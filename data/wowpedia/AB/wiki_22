But what T'chali did not say was why.\nThe Bloodmaul are in dire straits. The Bladespire clan be crushing them, and they needed a new weapon to help out with their fight.\nThat's when T'chali came up with a great idea. Why not make the perfect brew, one that strengthens you and weakens your enemy? Only thing is, T'chali does not know if it works.\nSo, you gonna take this brew up to Bladespire Hold and see if it works! \nReward.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nTell T'chali... did the brew work? \u00a0Did the Bladespire ogres like it? \nCompletion.\nThat's good news! \u00a0That brew is gonna come in handy with what T'chali is gonna ask you to do next. \nGains.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:\nNotes.\nThis quest is a pain because to get them to 'aggro' the brew, you have to be just barely outside their aggro range. If they come after you, they won't go after the mug. But as long as they see the mug first and talk about it, they can aggro on you afterward and you still get credit for it.\nIt is possible to 're-beer' the same ogre over and over again, if you find a good spot to drop it. He'll drink, wobble, then reset."}

Perhaps Crusader Olakin Sainrith would have some insight if you brought him the shards from several ghouls. \nProgress.\nWhat is that vile thing?\nCompletion.\n&lt;Olakin handles the shards of metal gingerly.&gt;\nYou saw these on all of the ghouls down there?

If we make it out of here, you are to proceed to &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Morgan's Vigil&lt;/a&gt; and speak with &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Maxwell\"&gt;Marshal Maxwell&lt;/a&gt;. He will give you further instruction.\nCompletion.\nAmazing, &lt;name&gt;. Simply amazing. Windsor stormed through here not five minutes ago. He makes some grand claims but purports that they are supported by his evidence. He is on his way to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; now to confront &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; and ... &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Prestor\"&gt;Lady Prestor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:\nNotes.\nJail Break! is an escort quest. Make sure that everyone who wants credit for the jail break has turned in &lt;a href=\"A%20Shred%20of%20Hope\"&gt;A Shred of Hope&lt;/a&gt; before starting this quest. Also, be sure to have an empty quest log slot before starting this, or it will fail immediately.\nPreparation: You will want to clean out the supply closet, clockwise from Windsor's cell, and also the open area between the prison wing and the Ring of Law wing. Optionally, you may want to clear out everything in the Ring of Law tunnel loop. Do NOT open the prison cells in the Ring of Law tunnel before Windsor gets to them, or face the inhabitants of all of them coming out to play.\nYou will proceed clockwise from Winsor's cell to the supply closet. There are several mobs inside the closet, as well as further mobs that ambush you outside the closet. When these mobs are dispatched, Winsor will armor up (at which point, he becomes effective in combat).\nMarshal Windsor will provide a +700 armor &lt;a href=\"Devotion%20Aura\"&gt;Devotion Aura&lt;/a&gt; to the party after retrieving his armor. This could well be a benefit when tackling the mobs around the Ring of Law.\nYou will then proceed across the open area to the other loop (which goes around the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Law\"&gt;Ring of Law&lt;/a&gt; arena). There are several doors along the loop that Marshal Windor will direct you to open (with the prison cell key), lock picking works. Inside each cell is a malefactor of one sort or another, most of whom you must defeat.\nAfter making the loop, Windsor will run back to the entrance area, and the quest will complete.\nAt all times, people on this quest should stay relatively close (visual range) to Marshal Windsor or fail the escort portion of the mission. And, obvious as it is, Marshal Windsor must not die during the escort. If you die during the escort, and can get resurrected, do not release. (Releasing puts you out of visual range, and reportedly unlinks you from the quest without causing the quest to actually fail.)\nIf you fail this quest, abandon the quest, exit and reset the instance, then return to try again.\nNPC script.\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;"}

She witnessed the first stages of the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; firsthand and, guided by a mysterious prophet later revealed as &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina rallied what survivors she could find and fled across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere, her &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition forces&lt;/a&gt; joined together with the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The human survivors then founded the port city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, joining the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, while maintaining peace with the Horde for several years.\nShortly after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde led by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; Theramore. Jaina managed to escape with her life, but the experience transformed her, making her more bellicose and even altering her appearance. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; during the attack, and fulfilling &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz%23Tides%20of%20War\"&gt;a prophecy&lt;/a&gt; made by the dragon-mage &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina took the fallen mage's place as leader of the Kirin Tor and head of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of personal tragedies, she attempted to maintain the Kirin Tor's neutrality during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; aided Garrosh to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina exiled the Sunreavers from her city during the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and aligned the Kirin Tor with the Alliance. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the Council decided unanimously to re-admit the Horde into Dalaran for the greater good. Furious, Jaina left the Kirin Tor.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina returned to her homeland of Kul Tiras in the name of the Alliance but was imprisoned for treason by her mother at the suggestion of Lady &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. After Ashvane's own betrayal was discovered, Jaina reconciled with her mother and brought the lost Kul Tiran fleet back home. Katherine stepped down as &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and named Jaina in her stead, re-pledging their nation to the Alliance cause and to the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the end of the war, Jaina was captured along other leaders of both factions by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, and was sent into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; where she was tormented within &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. She was eventually rescued by &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s and joined them in their campaign against &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and his forces, with her main focus being the rescue of Anduin.\nJaina serves as one of the main protagonists in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" franchise.\nBiography.\nEarly exploits.\nBorn three years prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina Proudmoore was the middle child of Lord Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, and his wife &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina was loved by her family and, from an early age, was filled with the joy of learning and the duties of a young lady, despite &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s military background. As a child, she had a governess and several tutors and propriety demanded that she be followed by an escort of her lady-in-waiting and a guard or two. She had a habit of hiding whenever she was frightened or upset, but her mother Katherine would always find her. Jaina had always been fond of reading; the library of &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20Keep\"&gt;Proudmoore Keep&lt;/a&gt; was her favorite spot growing up as her mother bemusedly noted, \"surrounding [herself] with musty old tomes.\" At a young age, she was enamored with tales of the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;. As a child, Jaina witnessed a &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; bless a Kul Tiran ship at least once, something she would not see again until many years later. Growing up, she also heard tales of the power of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen her magical talent was discovered after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Katherine had to fight Daelin to allow Jaina to be taught at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, though their daughter didn't know of this. On her way to Dalaran, Jaina\u2014who was then 11 years old\u2014briefly stayed as a guest in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, where she became close friends with &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Princess Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. One day during a prayer session in the &lt;a href=\"House%20Menethil\"&gt;Menethil&lt;/a&gt; family &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina for the first time met the 12-year-old &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the throne of Lordaeron, who thought Jaina looked like someone who was well accustomed to riding and hiking, spent a great deal of time outdoors, and would not mind having a snowball pelted in her face or going for a swim on a hot day. Arthas volunteered to escort Jaina to Dalaran along with her guards and servants. One night during the journey, the prince convinced her to sneak off with him and look at one of the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s where the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; kept &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s imprisoned\u2014the first real adventure they had together. Unlike Arthas, Jaina found herself feeling compassion for the captive orcs, even though the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had killed her older brother &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt; during the Second War.\nJaina spent the following years studying as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; in Dalaran. 6 years after her arrival to the city, she badgered the Kirin Tor's leader &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Archmage Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; into accepting her as an apprentice, eventually becoming one of the few female wizards in direct service to Dalaran. She came to be known as a star pupil who excelled at magical research and investigation, and Antonidas believed she had the potential to become the greatest sorceress in human history. The &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; was enamored with Jaina, but she did not return his feelings and remained focused on her studies as she wanted to advance on her own merits and not simply because an elven prince enjoyed her company.\nWhen Jaina was 18, she and her father Daelin attended Prince Arthas' induction into the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, Arthas visited Dalaran for a few months under the pretense of studying history so that he could get an opportunity to court Jaina. During a ride outside the city, the two kissed for the first time and began a romantic relationship, much to Kael'thas' chagrin. They initially kept their affair secret from the public in order to avoid feeding the rumor mill, but over the following year, Jaina began visiting Capital City during holidays. At &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;, after Jaina used a fire spell to ignite the &lt;a href=\"wickerman\"&gt;wickerman&lt;/a&gt; to the crowd's delight, she and Arthas retreated to the prince's rooms and had slept together for the first time. Afterward, Jaina promised Arthas that she would never deny him. Jaina was subsequently invited to spend the winter in Capital City and began being treated as a member of the royal family, as everyone assumed that she and Arthas would marry and have children soon. However, during a &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt; ball a few weeks after Hallow's End, Arthas began questioning whether the two of them were ready to be together and abruptly ended the relationship so that Jaina could focus on her magical studies in Dalaran and Arthas could focus on his commitments to Lordaeron. Jaina was very hurt by the decision but did not fight him on it, eventually realizing and agreeing that it was the right thing to do at the time. Both of them agreed to remain friends. Jaina returned to Dalaran, where at one point she helped Antonidas dispose of the renegade wizard &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; experiments.\nThe Third War.\nA few years later, Antonidas, eager to learn more about the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;mysterious plague&lt;/a&gt; sweeping northern Lordaeron, was met by the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Prophet&lt;/a&gt;, who pleaded with the wizard to take his people west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Antonidas dismissed the Prophet as nothing more than a madman, but Jaina, who had been watching from hiding, sensed great power in the Prophet and thought that perhaps they should heed his warnings. Antonidas continued to disagree and instead sent Jaina to meet with Arthas and investigate the plague at the northern village of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;. After some initial awkwardness, Arthas and Jaina began rekindling their relationship, with the prince hoping that the two of them could finally get married once they had solved the mystery of the plague. Neither of them knew that the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion would change their lives forever.\nAs they investigated Brill, Jaina saw some very strange things, including a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Abomination\"&gt;zombie made of various parts of several corpses&lt;/a&gt;. They faced off against several &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; enemies and came upon a granary which contained grain infested with the Plague. The crates bore the seal of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the primary distributor of grain throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Chasing the necromancer, who was actually &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, formerly a member of the Kirin Tor, to Andorhal, they found a mass of undead warriors waiting for them, but fought their way through to Kel'Thuzad, where Arthas killed him.\nJaina and Arthas made their way back to central Lordaeron, and they stopped for rest at the small town of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. When they arrived they discovered that the plague-infected grain from Andorhal had arrived and had been distributed amongst the townsfolk. They were transforming into the undead. Jaina reluctantly, but hastily left to find &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; for reinforcements. She teleported back to Dalaran where Antonidas sent for Uther. When she returned with the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at her back, Hearthglen was all but destroyed, and Arthas was fighting a losing battle. With Uther's help, though, they managed to push back the undead attackers. Arthas, demoralized and horrified by overwhelming forces of undead, vowed to go to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, where he hoped to fight &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorried about what the hatred for Mal'Ganis was doing to Arthas, Jaina used an &lt;a href=\"%3Ainvisibility\"&gt;:invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell and caught up with him on the road after he had an encounter with the same Prophet who had accosted Antonidas. The two continued toward Stratholme until dusk, at which point the two made camp and slept with each other, pushing away thoughts of death and plagues and finding comfort in each other.\nThe following day, Arthas, Jaina, and Uther reached Stratholme but didn't arrive in time to stop the townspeople from eating the tainted grain. All three knew that the people of Stratholme would soon become undead and attack them. Arthas was in favor of &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;slaughtering the people&lt;/a&gt; before their transformation to purge the town, but Uther could not condone murdering helpless people whose only crime was being infected, even if leaving them alive meant they would soon become a threat. When Uther refused to kill the civilians as Arthas ordered, Arthas renounced him, accusing him of treason. He demanded that any true to the king stay with him and see to the town's destruction. Unable to watch Arthas massacre the city, a tearful Jaina departed with Uther. Arthas was shocked and wounded by Jaina's decision, seeing it as a betrayal of the promise she had made the night they became lovers.\nAfter purging Stratholme, Arthas met with Jaina and pleaded with her to accompany him to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to hunt Mal'Ganis, but she refused and warned him that it sounded like a trap. The following day, Jaina and Uther returned to Stratholme's burning ruins. Both were appalled at what Arthas and his men had wrought. After revealing to Uther where Arthas had gone with Lordaeron's fleet, Jaina was visited by the mysterious prophet who had previously visited Terenas, Antonidas, and Arthas. The prophet sensed her leadership abilities and urged her to take the people she could with her to the west, fleeing Lordaeron and her home country of Kul Tiras. Many months later, &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began their invasion of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. It was at this moment, Jaina and Antonidas realized that the prophet had been right. Antonidas encouraged Jaina to take as many survivors of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; she could find and sail west for Kalimdor. At first, Jaina resisted, but after much debate, she relented. She understood, just as Antonidas did, that Dalaran could not stand against the Scourge. Master and apprentice parted ways, knowing that it would be the last time they would either see each other.\nOver the days to come, Jaina rallied as many refugees as she could. Not everyone she met agreed to go with her, but many did.\nAt some point before leaving (but after the fall of Quel'Thalas), she tried to console Kael, who was saddened by his father's death. Yet Kael angrily rejected her consolation and rebuked her for favoring such a \"monster\" (Arthas) over him. After this, she witnessed Arthas' army approaching Dalaran, at first wanting to confront him personally but faltering after recalling her previous failed attempts to sway him. Though she offered to help her mentor and the magi of Dalaran defend the city against the Scourge, Antonidas insisted that she tend to her other duties and lead &lt;a href=\"Human%20Expedition\"&gt;what remained of her people&lt;/a&gt; across the Great Sea.\nJaina's expedition consisted of individuals of various races and kingdoms. Despite their different backgrounds, they followed Jaina, as she represented something that had vanished almost entirely from the Eastern Kingdoms\u2014hope.\nArrival at Kalimdor.\nUpon arriving on Kalimdor, Jaina found that there were orcs there. Believing the Horde to having followed them from Lordaeron, Jaina clashed with the troops of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, Jaina set out to find the Prophet. Not only was &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt; a good defense, but also, she sensed a great power within. Jaina led a small expedition into the mountain, with the hopes of finding some power that could help her defeat the orcs. But she sensed that they were being followed.\nUpon breaching the core of the mountain, Jaina stumbled upon &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. They were about to battle when they were all suddenly confronted by the Oracle, who was actually the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; they had met in Lordaeron. The Prophet Medivh implored them all to ally with each other, saying that they would not survive alone against the might of the Burning Legion.\nReluctantly, Jaina agreed to ally her forces with Thrall's against Hellscream and an army of &lt;a href=\"chaos%20orc\"&gt;chaos orc&lt;/a&gt;s and demons. Jaina gave him a &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Gem%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;soul gem&lt;/a&gt;, which he used to capture Grom's essence as the invasion of Kalimdor began. Then, she helped him purge Grom of the demonic curse that had gripped him.\nJaina and Thrall continued as allies, although their forces were not very eager about it, even after Hellscream's death. They were terrorized by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, but also by the night elves' deadly hit-and-run attacks. Though their alliance with one another kept them alive, they were only holding on by a thread.\nFinally, Thrall received a vision. Jaina followed him to where he was instructed to go, where they found the leaders of the night elves, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. The Prophet appeared, and revealed himself to be none other than &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, returned to correct his mistakes of old. He implored the humans, orcs, and night elves to all join forces against the Legion, or they would all fall alone. They all agreed to defend Mount Hyjal together.\nJaina used her teleportation spells to scout out the surrounding area and found that &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and his doom guard were quickly making their way up the mountain. The defenders instituted three bases going up the mountain in an effort to halt his ascent.\nJaina's base was the first in Archimonde's path, and so it was the first to go, but before he could kill her, Jaina spirited herself out of Archimonde's clutches. The next base to go was Thrall's, and Jaina used her remaining energy to teleport Thrall from his base before Archimonde destroyed him, so that they could live to fight another day.\nFounding of Theramore.\nFollowing the Legion's defeat on Mount Hyjal, Jaina took her refugees to an island outpost off the eastern coast of Kalimdor, newly named &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; demanded an explanation of the humans encroaching on Durotar and the assassination attempt, Jaina stated she had no such knowledge. When Jaina agreed to help the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; investigate, they discovered the accusatory outpost was under attack from naga. After an encounter with a dying &lt;a href=\"marine\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina realized with horror that her father had decided to pay her a visit. Jaina pleaded with the Admiral to spare Rexxar, but Daelin would have none of it. Rexxar and his companions escaped, and Thrall rallied an army to push back Proudmoore's assault.\nJaina was in despair. While she felt loyalty to her father and her nation, her experience with the Scourge and the Legion convinced her that vendettas such as her father's were immaterial in the grand scheme. Jaina helped the Horde gain ships from the goblins and ordered her own troops to stand down when they &lt;a href=\"A%20Blaze%20of%20Glory%23Theramore%20City\"&gt;assaulted Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina's last words to her father were to ask why he didn't listen.\nWhen the people of Kul Tiras learned of their Lord Admiral's death, they cried out for vengeance, but the other nations of the Alliance were not interested. Ordeals caused by the plague in Lordaeron were more immediate concerns, and the other allied leaders also had little pity for Daelin's own aggressive actions. The people of Kul Tiras furiously isolated themselves from the rest of the Alliance but were not angry with all of the Alliance leaders. They instead nursed a bitter hatred only towards Jaina for betraying her family.\nJaina continued to rule over the tattered remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and hoped to reunite the distant human kingdoms once more.\nCycle of Hatred.\nTheramore and Durotar remained at relative peace for three years, though the two former archenemies were still wary of each other. Eventually, a series of minor shipping incidents led to extreme tension between the two powers, enough so that the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, who controlled the region's only neutral port, complained.\nDespite the tension, Thrall requested Jaina's aid in relocating a herd of thunder lizards displaced by a mysterious logging operation at Thunder Ridge. Jaina intended to relocate the lizards to a largely unpopulated region on the far side of Mulgore but was astonished to discover that the area was magically warded to protect its single inhabitant: &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe former Guardian brushed off Jaina's admiration, but filled in the gaps of what had been happening amidst the tensions between Theramore and Durotar: a minor demon, &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; had revived the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; and was playing the two powers against each other.\nJaina and Aegwynn hastily returned to Theramore, where they discovered that Jaina's own chamberlain had been corrupted by the Burning Blade. After dealing with the turncoat, they took on Zmodlor himself. Unfortunately, the demon was backed by a small cabal of warlocks. Jaina was nearly slain by the added strain, but Aegwynn was able to use her own life-force to support her, and Jaina was able to defeat the warlocks and banish Zmodlor back to the Twisting Nether. After the crisis had passed, Jaina and Thrall set about writing a permanent non-aggression pact to ensure that the mutual distrust of their peoples' never escalated into war again.\nAgainst all odds, Aegwynn survived and assumed the duties left by Jaina's chamberlain.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAs the Ruler of Theramore, Jaina led the town and was found in her tower. Having partnered with the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, she insisted on making a summit between Thrall and King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Varian was convinced by his son &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; but during a journey by the sea, Varian mysteriously vanished.\nWhen an investigation about the missing King Wrynn and the Defias Brotherhood was going on, she and &lt;a href=\"Tervosh\"&gt;Tervosh&lt;/a&gt; helped to capture &lt;a href=\"Hendel\"&gt;Hendel&lt;/a&gt; who was allied with the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Around the time of Zul'jin's fall, Jaina was able to discover that the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; who kidnapped Varian was allied with &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. She immediately sent this information to &lt;a href=\"Bolvar\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;. (As of 4.0.3, she informs Varian, who no doubt would want to make an example out of the rest of them, of the connection between Defias and Onyxia.)\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; told Jaina that two gladiators will be arriving soon in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina was happy to see &lt;a href=\"Broll\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt; much calmer now and immediately sensed a dark magic around &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina assisted the amnesic gladiator in remembering his true identity with the help of her chamberlain, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;. It was revealed that the gladiator is long-lost &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. She granted him a ship to the Eastern Kingdoms to reunite with his son and reveal traitors. She then informed King &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; about Lo'Gosh.\nDays later, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt;, a doppelganger of Varian and their group returned to Theramore to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; who kidnapped Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Before leaving, Jaina casted a magical ritual in which Lo'Gosh and Varian remembered what truly happened when Onyxia abducted Varian on his way to a meeting with Thrall. Under the guise of &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, Onyxia botched a spell that divided Varian into two different Varians when her ritual was interrupted by naga led by &lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt;, who attacked her. Moments later, the naga kidnapped both Varians, though the one that would be later known as Lo'Gosh jumped into the sea and escaped, the second being ransomed. After this revelation, Jaina gave them the blades &lt;a href=\"Shalla%27tor\"&gt;Shalla'tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ellemayne\"&gt;Ellemayne&lt;/a&gt;. She then aided the Varians and his comrades in the battle against Onyxia.\nAfter Onyxia was killed, Jaina was also the primary instigator in proposing an alliance between the humans of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; on the way back to Theramore. Varian was convinced and she traveled to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; where she met with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and told him the story of Varian. The orc leader also agreed to the meeting, despite having reservations since Orgrimmar sentiment was becoming increasingly restless with the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina then returned to Theramore, where she prepared for the peace summit, and ultimately welcomed Thrall and his advisers: &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt; and Garrosh. Although the conference had a promising start, it was ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists comprising of races from both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The attack sowed distrust between the human and orc delegates who had suspicions that the opposite faction may have lured them into a trap. Ultimately, the attempted assassinations on the human and orc leaders effectively ruined any chance of a human-orc alliance. One of the Twilight Hammer assassins was &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, who was left for dead or to be captured by her fellow assassins. Before King Varian could kill her, Lady Jaina claimed Garona as her prisoner with the intention of interrogating her. King Varian allowed it, so long as she shared the information with his adviser, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, who will be conducting the investigation on identifying the perpetrators. However, King Varian also claimed he will return to claim Garona for execution. Jaina and Aegwynn discovered that there was a spell placed on Garona's mind but could not remove it without causing her great pain and possible death. In a deal Garona made with Valeera Sanguinar, Garona agreed she would endure the pain and give them some of the information they required if Valeera used the information to go save her son &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; from the Twilight Hammer cult.\nWhen Arthas killed the dream form of Ner'zhul and woke from his six-year slumber as the new Lich King, Jaina sensed that something terrible was happening.\nAfter defending Theramore from a Scourge attack sent by the Lich King, she would later become a founding member of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. The previously defunct organization was re-established in order to aid Med'an in combating &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the Twilight's Hammer. After a series of attacks in Theramore, which were successfully repelled, Jaina alongside the other members empowered Med'an who faced off the ogre-mage. She was saddened by the death of Aegwynn and was last seen during the funeral in &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; crash-landed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina was one of the first to aid them, an event that was brought to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; by his &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventurers went to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; to experience the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to assist Jaina against countless waves including &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, she teleports away until &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has been assisted.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; prepared the forces of the Alliance for all-out war against the Horde. Desperate to avoid a fourth war, Jaina teleported to Orgrimmar to uncover the truth of the recent events in Northrend. There she learned from &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that an uprising broke out and that &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; had taken control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. The renegade Horde traitor, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, was in league with Varimathras. Thrall assured Jaina that the Horde had no official interest in a war against the Alliance unless provoked and that he would take care of the traitor. Jaina told them that she shall deliver their explanation to Varian, but warned them that he may still pursue war as the late Highlord was like a brother to the king.\nJaina's assessment proved correct as the forces of Thrall (&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;attempting to regain control of Undercity&lt;/a&gt;) and King Wrynn (hoping to reclaim it as Lordaeron for the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;bring Putress to justice&lt;/a&gt;) clashed at Undercity. Refusing to allow the Horde and the Alliance to descend into open war, Jaina stopped the Alliance army cold (literally) and teleported them back to Stormwind.\nSecrets of Ulduar.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; learned that &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; had escaped his ancient prison in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and Jaina called a conference of Alliance and Horde leaders at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. As Rhonin debriefed &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; on the situation, Jaina noticed that Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; had arrived early, and attempted to halt them before another confrontation was started. She was unable to stop Varian and Garrosh from coming to blows and King Wrynn left, refusing to work with the Horde at all after the events at the &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina wondered aloud who was left to challenge Yogg-Saron.\nCrusaders' Coliseum.\nLady Jaina Proudmoore, accompanied by King Varian, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%23Alliance%20and%20Horde%20leadership\"&gt;attended&lt;/a&gt; the tournaments at the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by various champions and representatives of the Alliance.\nThe Frozen Halls.\nAfter uncovering a hole in the defenses of Icecrown Citadel through the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina personally leads a team of Alliance champions to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to find the Lich King's weakness and possible redemption.\nAfter Jaina and her allies manage to free some of the Lich King's prisoners and kill &lt;a href=\"Scourgelord%20Tyrannus\"&gt;Scourgelord Tyrannus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; attacks, nearly killing the entire party.\nWithin the private chambers of the Lich King, Jaina and her troupe discovered an unguarded &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, the blade that stole Arthas' soul and led to the fall of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina communed with the souls stolen from Frostmourne and much to her surprise, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; appeared and told her a terrible truth. Not only did he inform her that Arthas was nothing but a small glimmer of light that stayed the Lich King's wrath, but in order to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King would have to be killed and a replacement would have to make the ultimate sacrifice.\nSuddenly, the Lich King entered the chambers and Uther was sucked back into Frostmourne. The Lich King coldly acknowledged Jaina while removing Frostmourne from its pedestal. The Lich King summoned &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;, two captains Jaina fought alongside during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. As The Lich King retreated to his private chambers and sicked the captains on her allies, Jaina remained determined to save Arthas and pursued him as the doors behind her closed. Following the defeat of the two captains, Jaina's allies rushed to her aid only to find her on the verge of defeat, with her former love viciously attacking her. Heartbroken and realizing that there was truly nothing left of Arthas, Jaina and her allies fled down the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Passage\"&gt;Hidden Passage&lt;/a&gt; with the Lich King in steady pursuit. As they came to a cliff, the \"&lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\" flew in and rescued them at the last moment.\nFall of the Lich King.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Deathbringer%20Saurfang\"&gt;Deathbringer&lt;/a&gt; was slain by a team of Alliance adventurers, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, fresh from the &lt;a href=\"Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;Gunship Battle&lt;/a&gt;, was unwilling to allow &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve his son's corpse. But when King Varian and Lady Jaina teleported to the scene, Varian ordered Muradin to step aside and let a grieving father pass, to which Jaina burst into tears out of respect for her King.\nHaving apparently returned to &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; afterward, she somehow was able to tell that Arthas had died.\nShould an adventurer bring &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20Locket\"&gt;Jaina's Locket&lt;/a&gt; to her following the Lich King's defeat, she weeps, stating that she knew there was still some part of Arthas trapped within the Lich King.\nLegends: Nightmares.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; invaded the mortal realm in the form of a magical mist and trapped Azeroth's sleeping denizens in their nightmares, Jaina became one of its victims. In Jaina's nightmare, she assisted Arthas in the purging of Stratholme and followed her lover Arthas and Muradin to Northrend to fight Mal'Ganis. They attacked the dreadlord and his undead army but during the battle, Muradin slipped and fell into a pit. Jaina chose to help Arthas attack the undead, while Muradin fell to his presumed death. When they defeated Mal'Ganis, they found a cave containing &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina read the warning about the blade's curse. When Arthas was about to touch the blade, Mal'Ganis attacked him. Jaina had no other option but to pick up the blade and kill the dreadlord. She saved Arthas but also became the Lich Queen.\nElemental Unrest.\nShe was present at the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;Elemental Unrest meeting&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina protected the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt; from the Elements.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nJaina attended a memorial ceremony in Stormwind that honored those that died in the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. During which a report arrived of a brutal attack on a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; caravan by supposed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; members. King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was considering violent action in response to the mounting tensions between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde. Jaina was able to persuade Varian to stay his hand and pursue diplomatic measures first by reminding him that even he could not control his own people as evidenced by the &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt;; though Varian subsequently reminded her that she has a penchant of putting her trust in the wrong people as evidenced by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. It seems that Jaina knows, or at least heard some rumors, about the fate of Bolvar Fordragon atop the Icecrown. After this, Jaina went to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;, whom Varian gave her permission to look after in his absence, and gave him a &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20hearthstone\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; which was connected to Theramore.\nAfter this, Jaina secretly met with Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to garner an explanation for this blatant violation of their peace treaty agreement. Thrall explained that he did not authorize this attack and he has been given demands by King Varian to condemn the attack publicly, turn in all violators over to the Alliance for justice, and to show good faith that the Horde was willing to continue peaceful relations with the Alliance. Thrall was only willing to declare his intention to continue honoring the peace treaty but refused to publicly condemn the attack as rebuking the pragmatism of staying alive, even with violent measures which he disliked, when the Alliance purposely cut off all trade with them and are causing them much suffering would be too cruel an attack on his people's identity. Nor was he willing to send violators over to the Alliance for judgment. Though Jaina understood the position Thrall was in, she none the less urged Thrall to find a way to meet the Alliance's demands as his noncooperation was only pushing the Alliance and Horde to all-out war.\nAnduin indeed used the hearthstone when he wanted to visit his \"auntie\" Jaina in time when she got back from meeting Thrall and later when &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; took over &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Also, before Moira's rise to power, Jaina attended the funeral of the late King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, she provided sanctuary to the exiled &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, who was seeking aid against the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated the death of his father, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and has seized control of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Sympathizing with Baine and impressed by his budding friendship with her ward, Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina agreed to fund Baine's rebellion with untraceable Theramore gold. Anduin learned from Jaina that Varian is taking agents to assassinate Moira and liberate Ironforge. After a long conversation, Anduin convinced her to create a portal to Ironforge so that he could dissuade Varian from that course of action.\nCataclysm.\nSince Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; wants to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and conquer the whole of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, offensives into the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; have been sent in response and secured territory once belonging to the Horde for &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt;. The humans of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; have sent their army and tried to establish a military line between night elf territory and Theramore. Theramore had a highway constructed that connects Theramore to Dustwallow Marsh; allowing the Alliance to move more quickly and send supplies and troops from Theramore to Alliance military bases in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde's surprise invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance forces streamed out of Theramore to attack the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt an unknown but relative small amount of time after Deathwing's reemergence into Azeroth Jaina was requested to come to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and at his request took &lt;a href=\"Kinndy%20Sparkshine\"&gt;Kinndy Sparkshine&lt;/a&gt; as an apprentice.\nDuring the assault into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to witness &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; become life-mates.\nWolfheart.\nThough Jaina would rather come to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;' meeting, she chose to stay in Theramore in order to continue organizing Alliance forces. In her stead came &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tervosh\"&gt;Archmage Tervosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlood of Our Fathers.\nAs the leader of Theramore Isle, Jaina was part of the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Delegation\"&gt;Honor Delegation&lt;/a&gt; coming to Stormwind for a meeting. She greeted Baron Lescovar who was drunk and called her an orc lover. Jaina continues trying to dissuade King Varian Wrynn from his unbending stance against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Despite differences in opinions, Jaina had always been King Wrynn's ally, if not his staunchest supporter. She continues to counsel the king on not only matters of state but also matters of the heart; most notably his turbulent relationship with his son, Anduin. When Varian was about to give a speech at the Remembrance Ceremony, he was missing and Jaina with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; went to look for him. She found him dying at Stormwind cemetery but Anduin healed him. Jaina then accompanied Anduin and all the guests to hear Varian's speech.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\n&lt;poem&gt;After the red comes the silver,\nShe who was golden and bright;\nThe Proud Lady humbled and bitter,\nShall now turn her thoughts to the fight.\nSaphire to diamond she gleams now,\nThe Kirin Tor leader who comes,\n\"Queen\" of a kingdom now fallen,\nMarching to war's martial drums.\nBe ye warned - the tides of war\nAt last shall break upon the shore.&lt;/poem&gt;\n\u2014 &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;' prophecy\nFollowing Deathwing's demise, Jaina became increasingly concerned with rising tensions between the Horde and the Alliance. Jaina later went to &lt;a href=\"Tidefury%20Cove\"&gt;Tidefury Cove&lt;/a&gt; where she met with Thrall in secret, where she tried to convince him to do something about Garrosh, whose warmongering was pushing the Alliance and Horde to all-out war. Thrall, now going by the name Go'el, was set on his new path and could not abandon the work he and the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; were doing to heal the damage the Cataclysm had wrought unto Azeroth. Even so, Jaina was convinced that if they hesitated any longer, war would ensue and many innocents would suffer the price.\nDisheartened by Thrall's decision Jaina later returned to Theramore, but some time afterwards would be visited by the former aspect of magic &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; who would request Jaina's aid in looking for the missing &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;; to which Jaina agreed to help him with this important endeavor. Jaina's advisers: &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tervosh\"&gt;Archmage Tervosh&lt;/a&gt;, night elf bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kinndy%20Sparkshine\"&gt;Kinndy&lt;/a&gt;, were all tasked to gain any information about the artifact. As the days passed, Jaina and Kalec grew closer as they began talking about their past, loves, and hurts. In time, Pained learned that the Horde is regrouping near &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt; and sent a word to Jaina. Now, Jaina had two problems: the search for the Focusing Iris and the Horde's bid for expansionism. Though she feared that Northwatch would fall to the Horde's expansionism, she believed that finding the Focusing Iris took precedence. Eventually, she and Kalec were successful in understanding why Kalec could not sense the Iris: the perpetrators were using transformation spells to masquerade it and hide its presence from Kalec's senses.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;, one of his &lt;a href=\"Longwalker\"&gt;Longwalker&lt;/a&gt;s to deliver the news of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;'s fall, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh's&lt;/a&gt; desire to conquer all of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and that the Horde was intent on marching upon &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. After handing over &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; (given to Perith to substantiate the claims of his warnings), Jaina promised it would be returned to Anduin and gave him a note to ensure he could leave Alliance territory unharmed for his. As departed from the city, Jaina and her advisers started preparing for war. During this time Kalecgos returned to Theramore and decided to stay and help Jaina defend her city. Jaina began contacting all the allies she can to help defend Theramore, including King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and other leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter witnessing Horde warships near the borders of Alliance waters, Jaina was convinced to ask help from &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. After being informed that Rhonin alone could not make such a decision, Jaina was left with the task of convincing the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; to help her. After much discussion, the Council of Six agreed to lend the Kirin Tor's aid to Theramore in the hopes that their presence will act as a deterrent; reasoning that doing nothing would be tacit support of Garrosh's war. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, one of the members of the Six, also sent word to &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; who sent a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;i forces.\nThe defense of Theramore is ill-fated: though the Horde's initial attack on Theramore was repelled, it was revealed that the entire ordeal had been a feint attack, in order to gather the best and brightest of the Alliance in one place, and then annihilate them with a Focusing Iris-empowered &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance discover this too late, and the nation of Theramore was utterly obliterated. Jaina and a few Alliance comrades barely survived, thanks to Rhonin who ordered them into a portal just before the mana bomb hit, sheltering them from the blast at the cost of his own life.\nWhen Jaina awoke, she found herself radiating with arcane energy and nearly all of her once fair hair turned white. Despite Kalec pleading with her to not go back right away, as he knew no one could have survived the blast, the shell-shocked Jaina did so anyway. Jaina was horrified by the loss of all she had worked for, and the deaths of her friends and people. She then came across the corpse of Kinndy; when she touched her shoulder to turn the body over, the young gnome's body, infused with arcane energy, crumbled into violet dust. It was at this moment, losing someone so bright and full of promise, that Jaina snapped.\nFilled with cold fury and rage, Jaina exacted revenge on the Horde that stayed behind to loot the ruins and dared to attack her. Not caring to think about the moral consequences, she climbed down into the crater where the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; lay and hid it so that she could use it against the Horde. She later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to gain their support for an immediate and brutal counterattack. King Varian was wary of simply attacking Orgrimmar head-on with their recent losses, and instead advised caution. King Varian and Prince Anduin were also against using dishonorable tactics to fight the war and informed her that the Horde, in the aftermath of Theramore's fall, had set up an effective naval blockade of Kalimdor. Not to be deterred from vengeance Jaina left Stormwind and for &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and demanded that the Kirin Tor strike against the Horde, even going so far as recommending that Dalaran be transported above Orgrimmar and rain destruction down on the city. Though committed to making sure Garrosh Hellscream would answer for Rhonin's death, the Kirin Tor were unwilling to give Jaina their support to destroy Orgrimmar, having just lost their leader as a result of getting involved in the war and their belief that Jaina's plans could lead to the deaths of many innocents who had nothing to do with the bombing of Theramore.\nSeeking vengeance and unaware that the Alliance was rebuilding their fleet to counterattack the Horde, Jaina traveled to the Dalaran library and located \"The Sixth Element: Additional Methods of Arcane Augmentation and Manipulation\", which she realized had been found and warded shut by her mentor &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing it as a sign that Antonidas would agree with her plans, Jaina carefully broke the seal, so that it would not set off the magical alarms, and discovered that the author theorized that the arcane was like an element, and that the Focusing Iris had been used once to enslave and control elementals. Using this knowledge, Jaina would head towards &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and then secure &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Island\"&gt;Fray Island&lt;/a&gt; and begin her plan to destroy &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, by using the Focusing Iris to summon a massive tidal wave's worth of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to drown the whole city.\nHaving been begged for help by the elements beforehand, Thrall barely arrived in time and tried to dissuade her from committing the horrific act, but Jaina ignored his pleas. She sent the elemental wave on its way and it was all he could do just to stalemate her water with the help of the wind; he quickly realized that it was a wonder that he is able to keep the water back at all. Enraged, Jaina attempted to kill Thrall with an arcane blast; the two trade spells, but doing all this, while holding back the wave and trying to talk Jaina down, took its toll. Thrall was forced to pour all his power into the wind, with nothing left to protect himself. It was only with the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; that Jaina was prevented from killing Thrall. Kalecgos, in reasoning with Jaina, told her that he knew what loss felt like (due to losing &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;), but that revenge will not bring them back, and one can heal as long as they don't do something so horrible that they can't take back. Thrall adds that using the Iris in a way that Garrosh, a thief, coward, and butcher would have would cast her in the same light as well.\nWhen Jaina said she did what she knew to be right, Kalec bluntly reminded her that Arthas had believed the same thing when he carried out the culling of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and pleaded with her not to stoop to the same level, saying that even Arthas had not reacted with such hatred. Jaina considered Kalec's words and was horrified to realize that not only was her behavior similar to Arthas but that her intended actions were nearly identical to what Garrosh and the Twilight Hammer had done with the Iris. Realizing what she almost became, Jaina dispelled the tsunami, remarking that while she would fight Garrosh's Horde, she would not murder civilians. She told Thrall that peace might be possible when Garrosh was removed, but not a moment before, and both friends realized that their friendship was yet another causality of Garrosh's brutality, with Jaina admitting it would be a long, long time, if ever, before she could call Thrall \"friend\" again.\nAsking Kalecgos to fly her and the Iris over the Horde capital, they saw the Horde's enthralled &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt;s nearly annihilating the Alliance fleet, which was sent to besiege &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; and eventually Orgrimmar. Jaina was horrified to realize that if Thrall and Kalec hadn't stopped her, she would have destroyed the entire Alliance fleet as well. She used the Iris to summon an army of water elementals to save the fleet. With the fleet rescued, Jaina and the Alliance fleet remnants sailed to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, routing any Horde presence in that area and reclaiming the ruined Alliance outpost, thus ending the Horde's blockade of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. With Northwatch secured, Varian sends an Alliance ship to Theramore to give those who died a proper burial.\nKalecgos took Jaina back to the ruins of Theramore for closure, and to her amazement, they came across Fearbreaker, perfectly intact despite of the bomb. Coming to grips with her grief, she sobbed as Kalec comforted her. As they talked, he helped her to realize that she wished to return to Dalaran and the Kirin Tor, remembering that Rhonin had told her that she was its future. Acknowledging their feelings for each other, Kalec kissed Jaina, formally beginning a relationship.\nMeeting with the remaining members of the Six, Jaina handed over the tome she stole, explaining what she did with the Focusing Iris. Kalec, as leader of the blue flight, unexpectedly donated the Iris to the Kirin Tor for safe-keeping. Jaina made her formal request to return to the Kirin Tor as a novice member, which they turn down . . . because they wish her to take Rhonin's place as leader instead. Khadgar explained that Vereesa found a box that contained secret scrolls of prophecy written by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, one of which perfectly described Jaina as she was now and the events that had just affected her. In the aftermath of all that had occurred, Jaina's restraint in the face of despair had shown them much of her character. Jaina points out that she needed help and part of the thanks was owed to Kalec, and so Khadgar extended an invitation to the former Aspect to join the Kirin Tor himself.\nAfter seeing to the new mass grave outside Theramore as the Kirin Tor's new leader, Jaina, with Kalec by her side, presided over her predecessor's memorial service at the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheramore's Fall.\nJaina is a key part of the Alliance side of the &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place in-game concurrent to &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;the events of \"Tides of War\"&lt;/a&gt; and following the destruction of Theramore by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the center crater of her ruined city, Jaina attunes to the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; before transport while &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;Alliance agents&lt;/a&gt;, aided by three &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s she summons, eliminate the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, including &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Rok%27nah\"&gt;Warlord Rok'nah&lt;/a&gt;, but does not seem to actually take part in the battle herself, as described in the novel.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nJaina, as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, was present during the Alliance meeting in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;, where the Alliance dignitaries and allies discussed the pros and cons of using &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; power. She remained silent in her opinion but did restrain the Sha when it physically manifested into an &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Echo of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance adventurer to negotiate with Jaina Proudmoore the withdrawal of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; claim fealty to the Horde and represent a major threat to the war effort. Jaina Proudmoore refused, citing a desire to maintain Dalaran's neutrality. Her reason being that despite her disdain for Garrosh, Dalaran could serve as a beacon of hope for peace. By showing the world that both Alliance and Horde can trust each other and work together in their city, the world would be able to believe that they could eventually be above the war. She and Anduin talked, and Jaina admitted that she was not proud of how she had planned to wipe out Orgrimmar. She stated that the Kirin Tor has a legacy of abuse and though members of the Kirin Tor have loyalties to both the Alliance and Horde, she hopes that they can trust each other to remain united in their mission to use power responsibly, despite if it conflicts with their faction's agenda. She later assists the night elves by increasing &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;' magical defenses in order to prevent Garrosh from obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their best efforts, the Horde successfully snuck into Darnassus and stole the Divine Bell. Jaina returned to Darnassus and while trying to discover how her traps failed, found evidence that implicated someone familiar with the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; portal network to aid in the theft. She quickly realized that members of the the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; had aided the Horde with the theft and declared it a betrayal and violation of the Kirin Tor's neutrality. Exactly why Jaina didn't consider her own actions as the leader of the Kirin Tor, actively helping keep the Divine Bell in Alliance possession, as a violation of the Kirin Tor's neutrality is not explained.\nFurious at this betrayal, Jaina mobilized the Kirin Tor, Alliance forces, and the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge&lt;/a&gt; the Sunreavers from Dalaran. After a brief confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina chose to incarcerate him and killed his mage guards. Some of those that surrendered were imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, while others along with those that resisted were put to the sword. After the purge, Jaina reported to King Varian that Dalaran was free of Horde interference and pledged the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to the Alliance. Varian was disappointed that Jaina had not conferred with him before she acted as he had been in secret talks with the blood elves to bring them back into the Alliance. Her attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; would consequently drive the sin'dorei back to the Horde. Jaina was unapologetic as she believed the Sunreavers brought the expulsion on themselves. Jaina also called Varian's diplomatic endeavors with the blood elves foolish as she now believed that \"once Horde, always Horde\". Varian stressed to her that the Alliance had to act as one. Jaina told Varian to not \"go soft\" before leaving to prepare the Kirin Tor for war.\nLater on, Varian discovered that Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance champion went out on their own to stop Garrosh from using the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Though Anduin succeeded in stopping Garrosh and destroying the Divine Bell, it came at a great cost: Garrosh had assaulted Anduin and left him badly injured. Varian regretted not having sent Anduin to Stormwind immediately and ordered for &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; to be sent to him at once. Varian then mournfully tended to his son while Jaina, furious at the assault on her nephew, swore to Varian that the Kirin Tor would make Garrosh pay and promptly teleported out.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nSome time later, Kalec returned to the Nexus though still kept up his relationship with Jaina. Unbeknownst to Jaina, Kalec had found a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;strange artifact&lt;/a&gt; that was torturing him with visions of a prehistoric &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He often subconsciously contacted her during his mental battles with the visions, causing Jaina to respond and Kalec to think she was the one contacting him in the first place. Jaina expressed concern over Kalec's health and also stated she had to do &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;some things&lt;/a&gt; that she wasn't proud of, but were necessary.\nJaina teleported to the Nexus and discovered an ancient artifact and realized that its magic has something to do with titans. Kalec sensed someone so she teleported to the entrance to have Kalec think that she just arrived. After assuring that everything is all right she teleported to Dalaran for more study. She went through several books, learning about the mage &lt;a href=\"Rulfo\"&gt;Rulfo&lt;/a&gt;. Suddenly, Jaina thought Kalec called her, so she teleported to his location, only to materialize near &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. At the proto-dragon's bones, she didn't find Kalec, but traces of the artifact's aura and the place where Kalec had dug the artifact. Soon, she also found &lt;a href=\"Buniq\"&gt;Buniq&lt;/a&gt; who told her about how Kalec was here and that someone else later came to this location. Buniq showed her a symbol that the mysterious person casted, which Jaina recalled knowing. With this knowledge, Jaina returned to Dalaran.\nLater, Modera was looking for her and Jaina hid herself. After she was gone, she continued to study more tomes in order to learn anything about the titan artifact and thus rescue Kalec. She returned to the Nexus and began focusing her knowledge on the relic Kalec had found. She was able to see the world of proto-dragons through Alexstrasza's eyes and after Galakrond was defeated, she was successful in bringing Kalecgos to the present. She accompanied him to the Aspects's meeting and the blue dragon reminded them of their duty. During the convocation, Jaina was hidden behind a pillar but Alexstrasza sensed her and as she was about to leave, she told Kalec to thank her. After this, Kalec took Jaina to Dalaran.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nJaina founded the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; not only to defeat the emerging threat of a resurrected &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; but also to prevent the Horde from scavenging any remains of his power should he be defeated. Jaina entered into an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; who had already established themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and had already begun undermining the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. Jaina sent her champions to &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; as a gesture of goodwill and to aid in their efforts.\nEventually, the Kirin Tor Offensive assaulted &lt;a href=\"Shaol%27mara\"&gt;Shaol'mara&lt;/a&gt; and established &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Rise\"&gt;Violet Rise&lt;/a&gt; as their base of operations.\nThey pressed their advantage on the Thunder King by assaulting the &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Emperor's Gate&lt;/a&gt;. With the gate destroyed, the Shado-Pan and the Kirin Tor Offensive worked together to secure the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Forges\"&gt;Thunder Forges&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormsea%20Landing\"&gt;Stormsea Landing&lt;/a&gt;. With the weapons liberated from the Thunder Forges and the Shado-Pan keeping vigil over Stormsea Landing, Kirin Tor resources were free to press the siege elsewhere.\nJaina led the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces against &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt; in the final assault on the Thunder King's stronghold. She learned that a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; force led by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, regent lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, was also about to launch an assault on the Thunder King, though opted to deal with one problem at a time. She was particularly eager to recapture &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, though put aside this goal to fight the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; in the courtyard. \nJaina and Lor'themar came face to face after Shan Bu was defeated. Jaina ordered Aethas to be handed over to her in return for Lor'themar's life, while Lor'themar demanded the release of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; in return for Jaina's. As tensions rose, &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, though gravely wounded, intervened to defuse the situation, urging Lor'themar and Jaina to break the cycle of retribution and walk away. The two eventually agreed, though Jaina made it clear that no true peace would ever be enjoyed while &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; rules the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. To her surprise, Lor'themar responded that that was precisely why they should conserve their strength that day. Softened by Lor'themar's answer, Jaina ordered &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; and her forces to back down. Theron and Jaina ended their parley with courteous bows, and, thanks to Zhu's mediation, left the courtyard bloodlessly.\nJaina later tasked those Alliance adventurers who had sufficiently earned her trust to assault the Thunder King's &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Antonidas\"&gt;Staff of Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; to absorb his power from his dais in the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Pinnacle of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. With the Thunder King's power fused with her staff, Jaina planned to use the Thunder King's terrible power on Garrosh when the time comes.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nJaina arrived alongside &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Vault of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt; was defeated. She told the Regent Lord that she was not surprised that Garrosh's arrogance had unleashed the Sha upon the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. They also noticed that Garrosh left &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; behind, and after advising Theron to stay out of the Alliance's way, Jaina sent the Alliance heroes through a portal to aid their forces besieging &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; both accompany King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s strike team to seize &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; from Hellscream's forces and takes part in the &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt; encounter. When the war moves to the Underhold, Jaina assists Alliance agents in the battle against Kor'kron orcs.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Jaina glared at the Horde and accused them of plotting against the Alliance. She urged &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to seize this opportunity to conquer Orgrimmar and dismantle the Horde, though it was an opportunity he did not take.\nWar Crimes.\nJaina attended the trial of Garrosh Hellscream in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and was extremely happy when she first heard that they had been summoned for Garrosh's trial. King Varian, Prince Anduin, Kalecgos and Vereesa Windrunner were residing at Violet Rise with Jaina for the duration of the trial and there was a feeling of lightheartedness, peace, and celebration at Violet Rise that night.\nOn the evening of the fourth day of the trial, Kalec came to Jaina in her tent in Violet Rise and asked if she'd go for a walk with him, although he looked very concerned. On their way down to the beach, Jaina recalled when she had gone out to meet Kalec as he landed on the beach outside Theramore and first said he'd help in the city's defense. She recalled criticizing the generals that were planning Theramore's defense for taking too much personal enjoyment in the planning their defeat of the Horde and noted bitterly that she was now one of those that she had mentally chided. She recalls the developing of the relationship between her and Kalec but how recent events had put distance between them, Kalec having only recently come to Pandaria.\nEventually, they began to talk and Kalec expressed how he felt that Jaina had grown very hard and bitter and that she doesn't seem to stop hurting over what's happened. At this, Jaina became frustrated and listed out all the things that had happened to her. Kalec agreed that she had a right to feel the way she did but said he was worried that her hatred would not end with the trial, referencing how she had advised Varian to dismantle the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Kalec said that now that more important matters were dealt with, such as stopping Garrosh, the differences between them mattered again, that they were both very different now and that they would have to wait and see what would happen between them until the end of the trial. They embraced and kissed, neither one wanting these differences to lead them to break up.\nOn the sixth day of the trial, Tyrande called forth her next witness - the longwalker &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;. Although he initially refused to speak due to the oath he had sworn to Baine, after Baine explicitly ordered him to speak, he reluctantly did. After asking him some questions with regard to &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;'s taking over of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; just before the shattering, Tyrande had a vision brought up of Baine speaking to &lt;a href=\"Jorn%20Skyseer\"&gt;Jorn Skyseer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; and Perith just after Magatha's coup. In the vision, they discussed what their next course of action should be and finally Baine stated that he would go to Jaina Proudmoore for help because Garrosh wouldn't send aid and Jaina was known to be more moderate than most. This led to complete chaos in the courtroom.\nJaina simply stared at Tyrande, stunned and feeling terribly betrayed, having expected Baine to use this but not Tyrande. Eventually, Kalec brought her back to reality and everyone in the courtroom was shouting. Varian, who was outraged, was demanding why Jaina hadn't told him about this. Taran Zhu then called a ten-minute respite. Varian told Jaina that she had to tell him what was going to happen next, comparing this with Jaina's removing the Sunreavers from Dalaran without telling him. When the court resumed Tyrande again questioned Perith, asking about what took place at the meeting between Jaina and Baine. Perith reluctantly told of how Jaina had given Baine monetary aid to help take back Thunder Bluff.\nTyrande then asked whether this was their only secret correspondence, to which Perith said it wasn't. Tyrande then brought up her second vision. The second vision was in Jaina's parlor in Theramore. Jaina became deeply enthralled with the sight and began reminiscing sadly of her destroyed home. In the vision, Perith was brought in to Jaina in her parlor. He said he was sent by Baine and warned Jaina that Garrosh was planning an imminent attack on Theramore Isle. He also brought with him &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; which had been given to Baine by Anduin when he first came to Jaina looking for help to retake Thunder Bluff. Perith said that Baine wanted to return Fearbreaker to its rightful owner. After the vision ended Jaina mockingly asked Varian whether he would arrest her for treason. To that Varian said he had only one question - whether she believed that Baine actually knew about the mana bomb. When Jaina immediately said no, Varian said that was good but demanded that after the session was over she was to tell him everything that had happened. When the session ended soon after and everyone got up to leave Varian told Jaina to stay, saying that they were going to have a talk.\nVarian became very angry at both Jaina and Anduin, outraged that Jaina would aid Baine but mainly frustrated that she hadn't told him before making the decision, to which Jaina stated that he wouldn't have listened, even if she had. When Varian said that he should put them both in prison Jaina responded that she wasn't his lieutenant or his child. She subsequently threatened to take the Kirin Tor out of the Alliance before leaving.\nOn the seventh day of the trial, Jaina herself was called as a witness by Tyrande. Tyrande questioned Jaina on the events after Baine's warning and Jaina told how she sent for and received aid, as well as how they won the battle when the Horde initially attacked and drove them back. Tyrande then questioned her on what happened after the attack, about the &lt;a href=\"The%20Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;The Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; and about the moments just before the Mana bomb dropped. Tyrande then, somewhat reluctantly, brought up the next vision, this one of Jaina and Rhonin in her tower just as the goblin zeppelin carrying the Focusing Iris started to reach Theramore. In the vision Rhonin told Jaina that he could divert the bomb so it would hit Jaina's magically fortified tower, thus minimizing the damage. He then started to do this but first opened a portal for Jaina and a few others to go through which was very difficult as the mana bomb was so close.\nJaina repeatedly refused to go through saying that she would stay and help defend her city. Eventually, Rhonin told her that she was the future of the Kirin Tor before pushing her through the portal seconds before the bomb landed. Everyone in the courtroom was horrified and many in the present cried out when the bomb landed. After a respite, court resumed and Tyrande continued her questioning of Jaina and asked her what happened after she went through the portal. Jaina, pale and red-eyed, replied that she regained consciousness on an island outside Thermaore and said how she told Kalec, who found her, that she wanted to go back to the city alone. Tyrande then proceeded to show another vision. In this one Jaina was walking through what was left of Theramore, with bodies distorted and floating in mid-air due to the magic energy still present. The past Jaina eventually found the body of her old apprentice, Kinndy, but when she reached out to touch it crumbled to violet sand and the past Jaina screamed in agony and began to weep. Tyrande then nodded to Chromie to stop the vision and ended her examination.\nAfter Tyrande finished, Baine stood up and began his questioning. He asked Jaina how she felt in the aftermath of Theramore and also asked her what she did after. She replied by telling him how she went to Stormwind looking for support from Varian, who disagreed with the idea and led Jaina to storm out of Stormwind Keep. She then said how she went to the Kirin Tor for aid, but who also refused, and how she then recovered the Focusing Iris and used it to create an army of water elementals with which she was going to use to destroy Orgrimmar. Go'el attempted to stop her but would have been killed if Kalec had not arrived and convinced her that if she went through with this she would be just like Arthas, to which she realized Kalec was right.\nTyrande then stated she had one more question before they ended court for the day. She asked Jaina if the reason she was glad she refrained was because, if she had released the tidal wave, she would have inadvertently wiped out the Alliance fleet. Jaina replied by saying that, while she was glad she didn't accidentally destroy the Alliance fleet, that wasn't the only reason. She then looked at Garrosh and said the main reason she was glad was because she would never want to be like Garrosh. Tyrande, however, did not stop and pressed the point, asking whether she didn't want to be like Garrosh or whether she didn't want to be like the Horde. Jaina paused and, after a while, replied by saying that the Horde wasn't Garrosh. This immediately caused Tyrande's eyes to widen as her questioning backfired. She said she had no more questions and the court session ended.\nOn the ninth and final day of the trial, the accuser and defender presented their final arguments to the jury. After the arguments Jaina declined to have a meal with Kalec, preferring to have some time alone to think. She was eating when &lt;a href=\"Jia%20Ji\"&gt;Jia Ji&lt;/a&gt; brought here a message with the red wax the mark of the Horde. She opened and read it. The message read:\nAfter reading it several times she sent a message back telling the warchief that she was thankful for his understanding. She then saw Kalec shaking hands with Varian and Anduin and realized he was leaving. She ran to him, through the crowds, shouting his name and he turned to see her. She jumped into his arms and they kissed.\nWhen Garrosh escaped with Kairoz through a time portal, alternate versions of many of the people present emerged from it, including one of Jaina. This version of Jaina was, in fact, a past version of her - not a possible one. It was her possessed with hatred for the Horde and began throwing fireballs at the members of the Horde in the courtroom as well as deflecting a fireball thrown at her by the true-timeline Jaina, leading the true-timeline Jaina to wonder how she can defeat herself.\nLater Jaina, having somehow overcome her doppelganger, hit &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; in the back with a fireball while she was fighting Varian. Varian looked up to see Jaina get shot through the chest, possibly by either a &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea pirate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; from the zeppelin, and collapse. Varian immediately abandoned Zaela, picked up Jaina and brought her inside the temple. When Varian and Jaina entered the temple the fighting was over and everyone else had managed to accept and defeat their alternate selves. When Go'el saw Varian enter with Jaina, who was limp and pale, he and Aggra ran over to her and attempted to heal her wound. Anduin, Tyrande, and Velen also arrived and did their best to try and heal Jaina. The wound, however, was too serious and they were too exhausted from fighting.\nKalec ran up and held Jaina and went very still. Everyone was despairing, save for Anduin, who refused to stop trying to heal Jaina. &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;, now hovering above them, promptly stated that \"The student remembers the lessons of my temple\" and proceeded to heal Jaina and the other injured, giving them all the second chance that was intended for Garrosh. Jaina opened her eyes and looked happy. She also took Go'el's hand and squeezed it, effectively forgiving him. After the celestials explained that they would have allowed Garrosh to live so he could continue to learn and how he was not the only one that was on trial, they told them that they must now go back out into the world and do what they must. All heads then eventually turned to Go'el and he humbly spoke for them all, stating that they would find Garrosh.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nJaina arrives at &lt;a href=\"Khadgar%27s%20Tower\"&gt;Khadgar's Tower&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zangarra\"&gt;Zangarra&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; is attacked by . While she approves of the Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; and thanks to them, the Horde commander is reminded that the Horde are not allowed to be part of the Council of Six's business. Khadgar says that it's not the first time that he disagreed with the council and it won't be the last. After Khadgar gets stitched up by &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana&lt;/a&gt;, he and Jaina go inside his tower to further empower the commander's &lt;a href=\"Legendary%23Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;ring&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they make it into an even more powerful ring, and Jaina comments that Khadgar is working with dangerous artifacts that he shouldn't dabble with. She leaves on a good note for the Alliance commander and tells them to be careful in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt;, but to the Horde commander, she simply says that she'll keep her eyes on them.\nLegion.\nJaina is present at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, fighting alongside King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and leading a squad of &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Battle-Mage\"&gt;Kirin Tor Battle-Mage&lt;/a&gt;s. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance forces are left vulnerable by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s unexpected retreat. The Alliance try to retreat on a &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; but is impeded by a summoned &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance forces watched helplessly as King Varian Wrynn sacrificed himself by distracting the Burning Legion forces so that the Alliance forces can fly to safety. In the aftermath of the battle, she attends Varian's funeral and is outraged at her belief that the Horde left the Alliance to die against the demons. Jaina pushes for a front against both the Legion and the Horde, arguing with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and Anduin over it, and says that her mages will never work with the Horde again, nor would they be allowed in Dalaran despite Velen and Anduin advocating for it. Even so, she has arranged for &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to move to &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid in the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; asks the Council of Six to let &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; mages back into the Kirin Tor, Jaina refuses, citing alleged atrocities and betrayals the Horde committed in the past. The council holds it to a vote though she warns them that she would leave the Kirin Tor should they choose to let the Horde back into Dalaran. Ultimately, she is defeated 4-2. Feeling betrayed, she lambastes the Six for blindly trusting the Horde and tells them to remember her warnings the next time the Horde betrays them again.\nJaina ended the relationship with Kalec and teleported out of the city, leaving the Kirin Tor in Khadgar's hands.\nJaina would go on to fight the demons on her own throughout the war.\nBefore the Storm.\nTo &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;' surprise, Jaina met with him one more time during his visit to the &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20Memorial\"&gt;Antonidas Memorial&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time they've seen each other since Jaina departed the Kirin Tor and left him without so much as an explanation. Kalec was glad to see her and Jaina congratulated Kalec on becoming a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. Kalec thanked her for her commendation but said he would gladly abdicate his office if she returned to Dalaran. However, Jaina refused. Though Jaina admitted she didn't know where else to go, she knew that she didn't belong in the Kirin Tor anymore. Jaina stated she didn't agree with the Kirin Tor's decision to readmit the Horde and that was the type of person the Horde has made her. As Kalec moved to comfort Jaina, Jaina confessed that she didn't like how hate has changed her but she doesn't know if she can be anything else anymore. Though her experiences have taught her what to hate and not want, she also has no idea what calms her anymore or have any positive aspirations. Jaina thinks that all she's done since &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt; was reacting and she feels frustrated that she can't seem to get herself out of that rut. Kalec apologized for being unable to help her in her struggles but Jaina admitted that only she can help herself. Jaina told Kalec she wasn't leaving because of the vote, but rather to figure out how to be true to her own nature. Kalec told her she'll work out her issues and that she'll find that when she rediscovers herself again, he's certain she won't find anything ugly or cruel. Kalec told Jaina that peace is a noble goal for the world but it is also a noble goal for one's self. Kalec promised her that should she ever need him, he'll be there. Kalec and Jaina kissed each other goodbye before Jaina portalled herself away.\nReunion.\nAfter the Legion's defeat, Jaina traveled to the ruins of Theramore where she thought back on the events that had led her here: leaving Dalaran, leaving Kalec, the bombing of Theramore, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, and of course her father's death at the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. She wondered what her life would have been like if she had fought with her father against the Horde then, or if her being at his side when &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt; died would have quelled his rage, or if she had returned home after the Third War if he'd have listened to her counsel.\nDeciding that she had run from those questions for too long, Jaina opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, capital of her homeland &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Under magical disguise, there she found her mother &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine&lt;/a&gt; giving a speech about Daelin, how he had always protected his people, and how Jaina had betrayed him. As the Kul Tirans insisted that they would stand alone, not asking Jaina or the Alliance for help, Jaina returned to Theramore and declared to herself that the Kul Tirans would not stand alone.\nThat was the first time Jaina had contacted Kul Tiras since the aftermath of the Third War.\nWarbringers.\nJaina sang \"&lt;a href=\"Daughter%20of%20the%20Sea\"&gt;Daughter of the Sea&lt;/a&gt;\" while paying her respects to a graveyard of swords in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. She took a silver Kul Tiran pendant hanged around one of the sword handles and handed it to a hooded ferryman at the Theramore docks as fare.\nWhile Jaina recalled the events that led to her &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt;'s demise, the ferryman sailed Jaina through a canal filled with floating corpses and wrecked ships. The wisps of dead sailors eventually guided their ferry through a stormy ocean until they reached a specific spot where Jaina saw the faces of the dead. With her magic, Jaina raised a &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20ship\"&gt;sunken Kul Tiran ship&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of the ocean, and then she spoke to her father, who was disguised as the ferryman, telling him she was listening to his wisdom now. The apparition of Daelin turned his face to her before fading away. Jaina boarded the Kul Tiran ship and finished singing the song with her own ominous verse. With fierce determination, Jaina sailed to war.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the defeat of the Burning Legion, Jaina returned to active involvement in the rekindled Alliance-Horde war. Jaina participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, arriving with her newly risen ship held in the air by her magic. She was able to clear away the Forsaken blight covering the area in front of the gates of the city and then used her ship's cannons to destroy the walls of Lordaeron and allow the Alliance in. She further participated in the battle, and when Sylvanas chose to destroy Undercity with the blight instead of allowing the Alliance to take it, Jaina teleported everyone out and onto her ship.\nFollowing the battle at Lordaeron, the Horde infiltrated Stormwind and freed two &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; prisoners: &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina confronted the Horde forces at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, but a fire started by Zul forced her to put it out and save the city instead of capturing them. When only one of the eight warships that pursued them returned, Jaina used her magic to view a survivor's memories and learn that the Horde had allied with the Zandalari. In response, Jaina suggested to Anduin that she should travel to her homeland of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and recruit its legendary fleet. While &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Greymane&lt;/a&gt; reminded Jaina that she was the reason Kul Tiras left the Alliance in the first place, Jaina insisted that dealing with that was the only hope they had of bringing them back. She promised to return with the fleet or not at all.\nEn route to her homeland, Jaina had a nightmare where herself as a child happily sang with her father, only for him to turn around and accuse the adult Jaina of being a murderer. Returning to Kul Tiras stirred feelings and memories that Jaina thought she had left behind. Upon arrival in the capital of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina found that the citizens feared and hated her for her role in &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;her father's&lt;/a&gt; death. In fact, the guards arrested her on sight to take her to the Lord Admiral, her mother &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, where Jaina would answer for her crimes. Jaina went along willingly, and Katherine, urged by &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, treated Jaina as a traitor and had her be taken away to face justice.\nJaina was exiled to &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt;, an island off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; from which none return. Once there, she was captured by &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, king of the ancient &lt;a href=\"drust\"&gt;drust&lt;/a&gt;, who pulled her into &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt;. Within Thros Jaina was haunted by memories of her past, including Arthas at Stratholme, Varian at the Battle for the Undercity, and Daelin at Theramore. But Katherine, realizing that Daelin had lost himself, convinced Jaina to forgive herself for her actions. After finding her way, Jaina slew Gorak Tul. The two returned to Boralus in time to defend it from an attack by Ashvane and the &lt;a href=\"Irontide%20Raiders\"&gt;Irontide Raiders&lt;/a&gt;. After clearing the city of enemies, Katherine, knowing the city's defenses would not be enough, gave Jaina her father's pendant, which she used to recall the legendary Kul Tiran fleet, which until then had been captured in a magical storm by the &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt;. The fleet, led by Jaina's brother &lt;a href=\"Tandred\"&gt;Tandred&lt;/a&gt;, proceeded to surround the Irontide ships. Outnumbered, Priscilla surrendered. Afterward, Katherine stepped down and named Jaina the new &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; of Kul Tiras.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAt the memorials to Daelin and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina, Tandred, and Katherine spoke about how Jaina had always expected Derek to be Lord Admiral, how Derek's corpse had been retrieved from the ocean floor by the Horde and used to taunt the Proudmoores, and what Derek and Daelin would think of all that their family and Kul Tiras had endured. Suddenly &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; arrived with a report that the Horde was attacking &lt;a href=\"Anglepoint%20Wharf\"&gt;Anglepoint Wharf&lt;/a&gt;, and Jaina left to confront the Horde personally while Katherine and Tandred rallied defenses. On the boat ride to Anglepoint, Jaina reassured Taelia that though she had not wanted to leave her team to report the attack, it was the right thing to do. Jaina assured her that even in times when they cannot save everyone, they should do the best they can and never give up hope. At Anglepoint Jaina teleported civilians out, then had Taelia and the Alliance champion work with the &lt;a href=\"Outriggers\"&gt;Outriggers&lt;/a&gt; but left behind one of her water elementals to help. Jaina later froze the seagate's water to prevent the Horde from entering Tiragarde Sound, and teleported the team atop the walls. Using Azerite bombs stolen from the Horde, Jaina destroyed the invading ships.\nJaina would later travel to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; artifact that the Horde had stolen from Boralus. With &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Umbric\"&gt;Magister Umbric&lt;/a&gt; shrouding Jaina's magic with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; to avoid detection, Jaina opened a portal for &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to access the Zandalari treasury.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance began a feint attack led by &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt; to bait the Horde out of Zuldazar while the Alliance prepared to attack &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. They would cover the area in a mist with the Abyssal Scepter, and until it was set up Jaina and Shaw provided support for Telaamon's forces. Afterward the two of them led the Alliance forces to get as much of Nazmir as they could, to make the Horde think it was where their main fleet was. Alongside the adventurer, Jaina marched into Zuldazar aboard controlled Zandalari &lt;a href=\"direhorn\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt;s from the northern border to take the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt;, clearing the way for Alliance forces. Before returning to Boralus, she bid farewell to Telaamon and promised his sacrifice would be remembered. Jaina and her &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt; spearheaded the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;assault on Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. Once they were within range, the Alliance planned to detonate the hidden explosives they planted on the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;'s ships. The Golden Fleet, however, began harrying the Alliance navy with their &lt;a href=\"ballistae\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt;s and one of them collapsed the deck by &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;'s position just as he was about to detonate the explosives. Jaina began using her magic to shield her ship from missiles; just long enough for Mekkatorque to re-position his remote detonator machine and blow up the entire Golden Fleet defending the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. With the Golden Fleet in ruins, the Alliance navy invaded &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; with little resistance.\nJaina serves as a boss during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; raid. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance fleet withdrew from Daza'alor. Lady Jaina Proudmoore stayed behind with a handful of Kul Tiran vessels to slow the Horde's pursuit. After the Alliance returned to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina spoke with Shaw, Genn, Wyrmbane, and Anduin. Although there was victory, Anduin mourned the loss of life and worried about &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, who barely survived after his encounter with &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin also worried that rather than drive a wedge between the Horde and Zandalari, killing Rastakhan had only ignited the Zandalari's fury. While Wyrmbane, Genn, and Shaw wanted to push the advantage and win the war in a matter of weeks, Jaina argued that attacking while the Zandalari mourned their king would make them no better than Sylvanas. Anduin resolved to keep fighting, but said that the Alliance must never lose sight of who they are and what they stand for.\nAfter Genn, Shaw, and Wyrmbane left, Jaina and Anduin spoke in private about the losses in Dazar'alor and Mekkatorque's state of health, which neither Jaina nor Stormwind's priests could help. Anduin was glad to have his honorary aunt back with them, and Jaina commented on how much had happened while she was away; specifically, she wanted to know about the rumors she had heard of her old friend &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;what happened&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The two left to go somewhere private to talk.\nSometime later, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; approached Jaina on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; to meet off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Though initially hostile to the idea, Jaina agreed to the meeting under the condition that she wouldn't be going alone. To her absolute shock, Baine delivered to her, her recently resurrected brother, &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. This shock quickly turned to an outrage due to believing that Derek was Sylvanas's puppet, but Derek was able to reassure his sister that his mind was his own and that Baine had saved him from such a fate. A shocked Jaina could only ask Baine why and the High Chieftain responded that there was a sickness in the Horde, that they waged war even as the Earth Mother was dying, that the Horde has forgotten what truly matters, and his heart could no longer bear it. In response to Jaina's warning that Sylvanas could kill him for this Baine merely replied that \"No life was worth living, if we cannot be true to our nature.\" As he returned home to seek solace in his family, he encouraged Jaina to do the same. As the two siblings reunited, Derek revealed that Baine had informed him of the exact circumstances of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;their father&lt;/a&gt;'s death. In response to Derek's uncertainty of where his path forward was, Jaina declared that they would find the answers together. Seeking to help her brother, Jaina brought him to &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Kul'Tiras and the Alliance sealed their pact, Jaina wanted to cement their bond with a grand gesture. To be precise, she wanted to build &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; a ship worthy of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran navy&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, she sought the services of &lt;a href=\"Dorian%20Atwater\"&gt;Dorian Atwater&lt;/a&gt;, a legendary shipwright, having built such works as the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;Proudmoore flagship&lt;/a&gt;. While Dorian built the ship, Jaina decided that her brother &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred&lt;/a&gt; would serve as its captain and trusted him to fill the ranks. After the vessel was completed and its crew assembled, Jaina let the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; name &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Anduin's vessel&lt;/a&gt; and had &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt; bless the ship in order to fortify it against storms and encourage fair weather and smooth seas. Vowing that Kul'Tiras will stand with the Alliance as long as she was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina subsequently delivered the vessel to Anduin, who warmly welcomed the gift as he accepted Kul'Tiras into the Alliance.\nRise of Azshara.\nAfter catching wind of the remains of the Horde fleet moving out to the sea, the Alliance assembled their fleets to finish the Horde's naval power, with Jaina among their forces. Unbeknownst to the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; was using the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt; to guide the Horde fleet and pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both fleets would be attacked by the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas were opened. Though surprised by their arrival in Nazjatar, Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; rallied the Alliance together.\nRealizing that their shelter was barely defensible, and much of the Alliance army was in an even more precarious position, Jaina elected to search deeper into Nazjatar for a more defensive position. However, en route, the Alliance encountered &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Okani\"&gt;Blademaster Okani&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade Ankoan&lt;/a&gt;. As they ventured together, they were confronted with an astral projection of Queen Azshara, who boasted that Nazjatar would be the last thing they would see and promised that she would hold the waters around Nazjatar at bay as long as she remained entertained.\nDeciding to work together, the Waveblade Ankoan allowed the Alliance to regroup and reinforce their base of &lt;a href=\"Mezzamere\"&gt;Mezzamere&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina recognized that the Alliance were only alive due to the aid of the &lt;a href=\"ankoan\"&gt;ankoan&lt;/a&gt; and Azshara's desire to toy with them. She further believed it would be best to learn more about the ankoan and helped establish a portal between Mezzamere and &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. As the Alliance established within Mezzamere, Jaina sent &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s to check out &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, however, the scouts never returned. Determined to discover their fate, Jaina and the Alliance adventurer performed a ritual and discovered that the scouts had been killed and that Azshara was in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing that the best way to survive against Azshara's forces was to support the Alliance's new allies, Jaina entrusted &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Alliance champions&lt;/a&gt; with joining with &lt;a href=\"Combat%20allies\"&gt;aiding their hunting parties&lt;/a&gt; and aid them in their tasks, as she plotted the Alliance's next move.\nJaina later turned to Blademaster Okani to discover what insight he could provide against the naga, and the blademaster and champion subsequently set out to rescue enslaved members of the Waveblade. Jaina would later regroup with her allies and recognize the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons used by the naga as being created by &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. Informed of Ashvane's rescue by Azshara caused Jaina to realize that she had underestimated Azshara's influence and was content in securing the Azerite weapons for her allies. Fearing that the biggest battle was still to come, Jaina encouraged further establishing relations between the Alliance and the Waveblade. She believed that by doing so the Alliance would show them that together they could take on Azshara's forces and succeed.\nAfter Alliance spies caught wind of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; planning to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; Jaina, recognizing that she owed Baine for returning Derek to her, agreed to Anduin's request to rescue Baine. Thus, she, along with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and the champion headed off to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. As Jaina and her allies ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, they unexpectedly encountered &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, who had also come to rescue Baine, and after a brief moment, agreed to work together to save Baine. When things started getting heated between Saurfang and Shaw, Jaina and Thrall were quick to get them focused on the task at hand. Upon nearly reaching Baine, the group was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Rowa%20Bloodstrike\"&gt;Rowa Bloodstrike&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed disappointment but not surprise by Saurfang's and Thrall's decision to rescue Baine. Unwilling to stand down, the group was forced to kill Rowa and moved forward to Baine, who was surprised by their presence. While Shaw moved to release Baine from his chains, Saurfang remarked that it felt too easy and the group was then attacked by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to kill them and Jaina in particular for vengeance for the &lt;a href=\"purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the group was successful in liberating Baine from his chains, and Jaina teleported the group safely out of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the group looked over &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall thanked Jaina for saving Baine. Revealing that he wished he could change it all (&lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;) and that sometimes he feels as if he did everything wrong. Following Jaina's comment about everyone having blood on their hands, Thrall revealed his belief that Sylvanas would now come for Thunder Bluff to burn it like she did &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Jaina reminiscent about how the Horde and Alliance united for the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. However, Thrall was unmoved due to remembering all the times that the Horde and Alliance had come together and how they let it fall apart and asked Jaina what was different this time. In response, Jaina told him that they were different and then departed to let Anduin know of the mission's success.\nUpon returning to Nazjatar, she informed Genn of what had occurred and argued that they had a common enemy in response to Greymane's outraged at saving a leader of the Horde. Remarking that Sylvanas and Azshara wanted the Alliance and the Horde at each other's throats, Jaina suggested that they direct their efforts Azshara instead of the Horde. She further encouraged that it would buy time for Saurfang's rebellion to take root. Though wary Genn agreed but warned she that if the Horde turned against them, they will answer for it.\nSeeking to gain control of the Tidestone away from Azshara, Jaina directed &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the champion to investigate the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; for anything potent enough to counter Azshara's sorcery. After Jaina learned that the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt; were obtained, she declared it an amazing find and that with them they could assault the guardian of the Tidestone and secure it. Declaring that now was the time to act, Jaina directed the Alliance to take the fight to the naga. En route, however, the Alliance encountered Horde forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and after a brief argument, both sides agreed to fight together against Azshara's forces, where during the fighting Jaina worked side by side with Thalyssra. After the Javelins of Suramar were used to shatter the Tidestone's protective barrier around &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Zharessa\"&gt;Lady Zharessa&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina joined the fight against Azshara's champion. After Jaina and Thalyssra combined their magics in order to use the Tidestone to open the way to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina warned that they couldn't underestimate Azshara as she was one of the most powerful sorceresses alive but declared, nevertheless, that she must be defeated. However, Lor'themar and Jaina argued about which side would deal the final blow to the Queen only to be interrupted by Azshara herself, who formally invited all of them to enter her palace.\nAccepting Azshara's invitation, Jaina was among the forces to strike at the heart of Azshara's power. After Azshara was defeated, Lor'themar and Jaina approached about to finish her off when the chains binding &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; shattered and the Old God subsequently rescued Azshara. Though triumphant over Azshara, Lor'themar declared it a hollow victory as not only did Azshara survive but N'Zoth was freed. In response, Jaina declared that the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; had kept them distracted and that divided they had no hope against N'Zoth. Agreeing with Jaina's assessment Lor'themar revealed to her his vow to tell his people of what transpired in Nazjatar, of how Azshara fell because the Horde and Alliance stood together, of the rising threat of N'Zoth, and his promise to take his place besides Saurfang and Thrall.\nJaina was among the Alliance forces to join with &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries against &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the plan to attack &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; were ordered with shielding the army from a magical assault. During the conflict, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in his death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. Jaina was stunned over Saurfang's death and called a recall of Alliance forces. Jaina was then among the Alliance heroes to attend Saurfang's funeral in front of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Saurfang's funeral, Jaina met with Calia and Derek at &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze%20Village\"&gt;Seabreeze Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting, Calia and Derek learned that the war was over and it was implied that Calia and Derek had grown close. As the three conversed the Proudmoore siblings remarked that &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; would benefit from Calia's guidance, much like Derek had. Unbeknownst to the three, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; was spying on their meeting at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, who after being informed of the details remarked that she must act quickly.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina answered Anduin's call for the Alliance leaders to gather in Stormwind. She thus witnessed Anduin's declaration that with the armistice signed, the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; was over and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s rejection of any idea of peace unless it was signed in Sylvanas's blood. She also learned that the Horde had abolished the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; position for a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;council style leadership&lt;/a&gt;. Following the meeting, she noticed that Anduin remained tense and was told that while she found peace in her heart, he couldn't say the same about himself and his belief that neither Tyrande nor Genn would consider the war to be over until Sylvanas was brought to justice. In response, Jaina expressed her belief that Sylvanas couldn't hide for long with &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; scouring the seas and the searching every dark corner of Azeroth. However, Anduin revealed that he wasn't concerned that Sylvanas would remain hiding but that she wouldn't, he then changed the subject by asking Jaina about a messenger from Kul Tiras. He subsequently learned that &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; sought to see Stormwind and learn more about &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;her father&lt;/a&gt;. The pair then got into a brief argument about telling Taelia that he had become the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, with Jaina believing that she should be informed about her father's fate. In the end, Jaina decided that the decision remained in Anduin's hands but warned him that if she learned the truth was kept from her, it would hurt her all the more.\nShadows Rising.\nKnowing that &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; was concerned by the lack of progress by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in finding &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina sought to counsel him towards patience but none of her arguments were able to ease his troubled heart. Thus, when Anduin requested that she personally check on the pair for an update, she agreed. Jaina was then disturbed to see that the pair had been interrogating a man by having Turalyon use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to shackle him in place, while Alleria's &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; powers invaded his mind. When Turalyon justified their actions by saying that the man had sheltered &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;an agent&lt;/a&gt; of Sylvanas, Jaina demanded to know how he had known to which the paladin revealed that the man had a dagger that was more fitting in a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; scabbard, and Alleria revealed her interrogation revealed that the &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt; was heading towards &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Jaina found that she could not argue with the results of their use of both school magics, she certainly argued with the method and asked if Anduin was aware of their tactics. In response, Alleria revealed that Anduin had told them to use whatever means necessary in the hunt for Sylvanas. This caused Jaina to declare that Anduin wouldn't be pleased with these tactics and revealed that she certainly wasn't. However, Turalyon was steadfast in his belief that their methods would make sense in time. Jaina then departed to personally inform Anduin of the information they received and exactly how they obtained it. She further revealed her belief that their tactics represented him poorly and by sanctioning them she questioned what it said about them.\nAfter a moment of thought, Anduin said that they would do whatever they must to bring murders to justice. That it said that they shall not forget those lost in war, never forgot &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. He then reminded Jaina how she was not above the swinging the harsh hammer of retribution and asked if she had forgotten. Jaina retorted that she had not forgotten but reminded him how &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; had once warned &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to uphold honor or be ended. She further remarked that one her brightest wishes was for Anduin's reign to endure and be remembered fondly, for more than anything that he was remembered in the same breath as his father.\nAnduin responded by remarking that difficult decisions have to be made and that he trusted Turalyon and Alleria. He then asked her if their statues would preside over &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; if they were without honor. This caused Jaina to remark that people change. The young king agreed but once more declared that he trusted Turalyon and Alleria, despite the misfortunes that have befallen them. He then pointed out that Stormwind would not exist without them, that they were woven into the very fabric of Stormwind's history. Recognizing that there would no swaying him, Jaina told Anduin that clarity and time are the final editors of all stories, as she would know.\nSometime later, she hosted Turalyon and Alleria in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, as they had come at Anduin's request should &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; discover nothing on the Zandalari coast. They were soon interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;, who reported that Shaw had been taken prisoner by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Whereas Alleria immediately jumped to the conclusion that Sylvanas was working with the Zandalari, Jaina called on her to not add fuel on an already kindly fire and risk the treaty. Jaina then stated she would use the treaty itself before turning to the blade.\nThus, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; received a missive from Jaina where she revealed that they were aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council. In the end, the council voted unanimously in favor of Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Jaina and Anduin in hopes that it would aid in the hunt and capture of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, they subsequently met on a boat at seas off the coast Zandalar. In a show of open trust, Thrall revealed that he had met with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, stunning both Jaina and Anduin. While Thrall was quick to smooth over Anduin's worries over the idea of the Horde betraying the Alliance by allowing Sylvanas to have a refuge on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, the information they received allowed the orc and pandaren to realize that the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; were aiding the Widow's Bite. When Anduin mentioned how Shaw was taken prisoner by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Ji reassured the young king that the Horde Council did not execute prisoners without trial. However, Anduin retorted that he wished to have Shaw returned soon, which made Thrall told them to give him two days. When the waves threatened to upend the boat, Jaina ported everyone to safety.\nJaina later secretly traveled to &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, where she caught Anduin in the town under the alias of Jerek. When Anduin noticed her, he admitted that sometimes he needed to be a boy again, and Jaina told him that she understood. She then reminded him that he had caught her red-handed.\nAfter the Horde destroyed the Widow's Bite and saved &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, they released Shaw and sent him back to Stormwind with &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;, who was captured at the end of the conflict. Jaina was visibly surprised at this revelation and soon learned that Thrall wished for Sira to be delivered to Tyrande. When Anduin tried some magic to make Sira tell him where Sylvanas was, the fear on Jaina's face shook Shaw to the core.\nShadowlands.\nWhen the Scourge began to &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;rampage&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; gone, Jaina was targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, who struck hard and captured Jaina before she could even cast a spell. She was subsequently taken to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe later worked with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to hide from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; and escape the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;; however, Thrall became injured. Jaina had almost given up when the pair were unexpectedly joined by &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions from&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. After catching their breath, the group made their way towards &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Respite\"&gt;Forlorn Respite&lt;/a&gt; in order to use the cave as a refuge. However en route they were confronted by &lt;a href=\"Tariesh\"&gt;Tariesh&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to stop them. Upon Tariesh's death, Jaina and her allies successfully made their way into the cave.\nJaina, Thrall, and the champion soon after ventured forth to rescue &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, which involved killing &lt;a href=\"Phael%20the%20Afflictor\"&gt;Phael the Afflictor&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Afflictor%27s%20Key\"&gt;his key&lt;/a&gt;, and rescue other souls from the Mawsworn. Following Anduin's liberation, the group returned to Forlorn Respite, where they discovered that a &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;Eroded Waystone&lt;/a&gt;, which could be the way out, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; could be found at &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%27s%20Cauldron\"&gt;Zovaal's Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;. When Thrall voiced his concern at leaving the missing &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; behind, with Jaina reassuring him that if there was a way out, then there was a way back in that could be entered to rescue her. As the group crossed a bridge over , they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, who taunted that their wretched souls will feed the coming darkness. However, Jaina was unmoved and countered that she was beaten by a force of \"wretched\" champions and Thrall threw &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;his axe&lt;/a&gt; at her. In outrage over all this, Heyla knocked them all off the bridge and into the river of souls.\nNot deterred, the group rallied continued onward and witnessed &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; toss &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; off as platform. After securing Baine, Jaina and Anduin stayed behind to tend to him, as Thrall and the champion headed off to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Wither%20Blade\"&gt;means&lt;/a&gt; to help mend his spirit and retrieve a new weapon for Thrall. With Baine restored, the group headed off towards the waystone, discovering the sheer size of the Jailer's army along the way. Jaina used her magic to keep the group shielded from the seemingly endless Mawsworn army. Upon arriving at the waystone, they were confronted by the Jailer's forces, and though the champion was able to escape, Jaina and the others were captured.\nAfter being captured, Jaina was sent to &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, where she was tormented with white-hot fires, before being liberated by the Maw Walker. After arriving to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina was overjoyed to be reunited with Baine and wished to head back into Torghast to rescue the still captured Thrall and Anduin. However &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; was able to convince that she needed to recover her strength. After Thrall was liberated from Torghast, Jaina was relieved as she had feared the worst. She later questioned Thrall if he knew where the Mawsworn had taken Anduin, to which Thrall revealed that they had spoken of Anduin as a valuable prisoner held in a chamber deep within the Jailer's tower. After discovering that Sylvanas and the Jailer intend to turn Anduin into a weapon, Jaina while concerned for Anduin, took comfort in the fact he was alive, and was confident that he wouldn't give in to Sylvanas.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of the Jailer, Bolvar felt a darkness calling to him within Torghast. Jaina learned from Bolvar that a new mourneblade was being forged within the tower and that the Jailer decided that the time had come for Anduin to become his agent, regardless of his choice. However, Bolvar repeated gazes into Torghast had allowed &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; to peer back at him and he attempted to gain control of Bolvar through the Helm of Domination. After Jaina and the Maw Walker were able to sever the connection, Baine called for them to immediately attack Torghast and rescue Anduin. However, Thrall and Jaina countered that they had to hold back and rally the covenants. Bolvar agreed with their assessment and thus implored the Maw Walker to continue their efforts and declared that when the time came, they would claim victory.\nChains of Domination.\nWhen the covenants rallied together to defend &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina and Bolvar joined them hoping to have the chance to save Anduin. During the battle, Jaina blasted an untold number of &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Realmbreaker\"&gt;Mawsworn Realmbreaker&lt;/a&gt;s out of the skies near the &lt;a href=\"Glitterfall%20Basin\"&gt;Glitterfall Basin&lt;/a&gt;. However, as the battle continued, Jaina grew concerned at Anduin's absence. This concern was warranted as it was revealed that while the Mawsworn did battle with the defenders, the &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;dominated&lt;/a&gt; Anduin was sent to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;, with Jaina and Bolvar arriving to late to stop them and unable to break Zovaal's hold as he carried out the task. Despite this set back, Jaina was undeterred and vowed to save Anduin, no matter what it took.\nSometime later, Jaina and her allies stormed into the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop the Jailer, once and for all. However, despite defeating the likes of &lt;a href=\"The%20Nine\"&gt;The Nine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas was able to stall them long enough for the Jailer to absorb the essence of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; into his being. Jaina was then briefly controlled by Zovaal through the use of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic before she was released after Sylvanas, who realized that the Jailer never intended to not break the system of Death and give everyone free will as she had believed, but to forge a new reality where all would be forced to serve him, attacked him. In response, Zovaal reunited Sylvanas with the missing fragment of her soul before leaving with the mind-controlled Anduin, and thus allowing Jaina and her allies to imprison Sylvanas.\nIn the aftermath, Jaina and Thrall came to &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; to inform the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; over what had transpired. The pair further revealed that prior to departing with the Jailer, Anduin had intentionally dropped a compass, which Anduin had given to &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;, which gave them both hope that Anduin was fighting against the Jailer. After Jaina sensed an enchantment upon the compass, the pair turned to Bolvar to examine it and discovered that a memory was contained within the compass. Upon reviewing the memory, the group learned that Anduin felt increasingly hollow and empty as a result of being dominated by the Jailer, and his belief that both he and Sylvanas would be lost by the time Zovaal succeeds, and his hope that his friends remember him as he was and not what Sylvanas had made him into. After the memory ended, a horrified Jaina swore that they wouldn't lose Anduin.\nIn the aftermath, the covenants gave their reforged sigils to the Primus, who promised to open the way to stop Zovaal. To Jaina's unexpected delight, the kyrian who delivered their sigil to the Primus was none other than her old friend &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Their subsequent reunion was rather bittersweet as each reflected on &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and how the last time they had seen one another in the flesh was at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;the culling&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina admitted that with what had been done to Anduin, that all those painful memories had flooded back again. Uther gave Jaina the courage to continue forward.\nEternity's End.\nJaina was amongst the crowd that welcomed the Maw Walker back to Oribos after the connection to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; was established and subsequently journeyed to the realm to aid the fight against Zovaal. She and Baine later arrived to aid the Maw Walker against &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, who after declaring that he had bought Zovaal's champion enough time, departed before they could personally join the fight. Jaina then used her magic to bring the group to the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;, with Baine hoping that if they got there in time they could liberate Anduin from the Jailer's control. However, the trio arrived only to witness the oracle &lt;a href=\"Dausegne\"&gt;Dausegne&lt;/a&gt; fall under Zovaal's sway and open the way to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; for him. After Zovaal teleported his forces towards the Sepulcher, Jaina sensed something &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; about &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Anduin's blade&lt;/a&gt;, and departed from the area with the others report what they witnessed to Bolvar.\nHaving returned to Oribos, Jaina participated in a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar, Thrall, and Baine about the comatose Sylvanas Windrunner. In this meeting, Uther revealed that Sylvanas's soul had been fractured from the moment of her death, that the Jailer had severed their bond, and with their reunion Sylvanas had been condemned to endlessly relive her atrocities as long as her soul remain divided. In response to this, Baine remarked that perhaps Sylvanas shouldn't be awoken. However, Bolvar countered that Sylvanas was the only one who likely knew the Jailer's plan and could be the key to saving Anduin. Though Jaina and Thrall echoed Baine's distrust of Sylvanas, the group ultimately let Uther mend the soul wound, which allowed for Sylvanas to rise and join the fight against Zovaal.\nUther later came to Haven to deliver the news that Sylvanas had awoken. The highlord argued that it was too risky to trust the banshee, but Uther claimed that he'd make sure Sylvanas didn't betray them again. Either way, Bolvar's more immediate priority was to enter the Sepulcher. The Enlightened &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ara\"&gt;Elder Ara&lt;/a&gt; agreed to help by taking the Maw Walker on a pilgrimage. Once she'd done so and the way into the structure was opened, Bolvar met up with Jaina, Uther, and Sylvanas at its entrance to discuss their course of action. Sylvanas stated that they needed to find a way to resist the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat him, and that Anduin might be the key. After Uther convinced Jaina to cooperate, the four headed into the Sepulcher together. After the group was able to have Anduin to liberate himself by shattering Kingsmourne Jaina was stunned into silence to witness the last dwindling piece of Arthas Menethil fade away.\nFollowing Anduin's liberation from Zovaal's control, Jaina attended the meeting with her fellow Azerothians and the Primus as they sought a way to protect themselves from Zovaal's Domination magic. While overjoyed to have Anduin back with them, Jaina was worried that he would be haunted by the memory of the things the Jailer made him do. Jaina also admitted to having conflicting feelings about Arthas, as even when he committed atrocities he thought he did so in the name of justice and remarked that she was one of the few to remember the prince, and not just the monster.\nThe Primus pointed out that Zereth Mortis' &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be resistant to Domination and that using the helm might allow the heroes to find the source of their resistance. Thus Bolvar, &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walker worked together to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Inscrutable%20Phrase\"&gt;Inscrutable Phrase&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, and imbue them within the intact half of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce this task was completed, the trio joined Jaina, Thrall, Baine, Anduin, Sylvanas, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina subsequently witnessed those who had overcome Domination in the past draw out the memories of their resistance and willpower and infuse it into the shards. After Bolvar declared that they had all the pieces they needed and that it was time for Primus to reforge the helm, Jaina directly opened a portal to &lt;a href=\"Torghast\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; and the group used it to reach the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina then witnessed the Primus reforge the helm into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, which was quickly used to ensure that the group was resistant to Domination, as the light from the crown touched him, Jaina declared \"For Azeroth.\"\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Jaina was amongst those who attended the judgment of Sylvanas Windrunner. After the Banshee Queen submitted to the judgment of Tyrande Whisperwind, the night elf matriarch ordered that her penance was to scour the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; for every soul lost in its depths, betrayed or condemned and to send them forth to the &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. After the sentencing, Jaina would remark to Alliance adventurers how hatred was a cycle, that it was all too easy to perpetuate, and how forgiveness does not come easily to those who have been wronged. After declaring her belief that the cycle of hatred can be broken with relentless effort and a great deal of time, Jaina personally witnessed Sylvanas entering the Maw to begin her penance.\nSometime later, Jaina was approached by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who had journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; after feeling the weight of the world upon him from the burdens he carried and the choices he made. As they talked, Jaina was able to cheer Khadgar up, and Jaina watched as Khadgar flew off to explore the Shadowlands.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years after returning to Azeroth, she was invited to attend the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, she wanted to attend but was unable to due to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; having issues with &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPowers and abilities.\nJaina is one of the most powerful mortals in the World of Warcraft universe, and four years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, was described as \"the most powerful human sorceress alive\". She was also the former leader of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, implying her powers are at least roughly equal to that of their greatest mages, and was further counseled and advised by Magna &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest and longest-serving &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, for several years.\nJaina is a skilled practitioner of transmutation magic and developed a powerful variation of the mass-teleport spell capable of moving a significant portion of an entire army with \"minimal effort\", making her extremely unpredictable on the battlefield. She can teleport herself short distances, as well as into Horde cities such as &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and was able to easily teleport away Horde players who attacked her in the past. She is depicted as knowing the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Brilliance%20Aura%20%28Passive%29\"&gt;Brilliance Aura&lt;/a&gt; spell, able to bolster her allies' mana regeneration, such as at the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Base\"&gt;Alliance Base&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. She uses an improved version to enhance mana and other energy regeneration, as well as increase running &lt;a href=\"speed\"&gt;speed&lt;/a&gt; in battle for the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and briefly encased all the Alliance and Horde units (including Thrall and Sylvanas) in ice before teleporting Varian and his army back to Stormwind.\nLikely owing to her &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; heritage as \"Daughter of the Sea\", Jaina seems to specialize as a Frost Mage, but is also capable of using arcane and fire spells as well in concert, and has been described as having \"always been most proficient at summoning powerful elementals of water and ice\". She was already able to summon three &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to assist her in combat by the time of the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, her Summoned Water Elemental was able to kill five &lt;a href=\"High%20Sunreaver%20Mage\"&gt;High Sunreaver Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in quick succession with a single attack each and was able to defeat &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; himself without apparent effort. She formed an ice bridge to clear a gap across a chasm during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, immobilized a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; in midair before shattering its armaments and ramparts with a &lt;a href=\"Flamestrike\"&gt;Flamestrike&lt;/a&gt;, conjured a &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; during the encounter with &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt;, and instantly turned part of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; into a frozen tundra during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe is also able to use formidable &lt;a href=\"abjuration\"&gt;abjuration&lt;/a&gt; magic, warding &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; against magi and rogues alike, using an &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Barrier\"&gt;Ice Barrier&lt;/a&gt; to survive an intense battle with &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; before imprisoning him within an \"Ice Prison\" preventing all action, and conjuring an arcane barrier to shield herself and the other Alliance leaders from the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; unleashed by Sylvanas Windrunner at Lordaeron while simultaneously teleporting them away to safety. She has some &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; skills, able to permanently imbue &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20Locket\"&gt;her locket&lt;/a&gt;, with a spell capable of opening a portal directly to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; every hour, enchant a mirror allowing her to instantaneously communicate with others, such as Varian and Anduin in Stormwind and Rhonin in Dalaran, and summon an orb of fire to upgrade a &lt;a href=\"legendary\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; ring. She has some experience with &lt;a href=\"illusion\"&gt;illusion&lt;/a&gt; magic as well, making herself &lt;a href=\"invisible\"&gt;invisible&lt;/a&gt; on several occasions during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and disguising herself as an older woman during her return to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. She is able to use mental magics as well, such as sharing a survivor's recent memories with herself and other people, helping determine &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s true identity and what caused him to be split into separate personas when he was Lo'Gosh, and partially unlocking &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;'s buried memories.\nAugmented by the lingering effects of the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina easily slew roughly thirty armored orcs within several minutes using a combination of arcane, fire, and frost spells. With the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina was able to single-handedly create a tidal wave made up of thousands of &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s bound together, capable of destroying &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and was able to nearly kill &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during their battle, using the water elementals within his &lt;a href=\"Water%20Shield\"&gt;Water Shield&lt;/a&gt; against him. Her most impressive feats during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; included raising the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;Proudmoore flagship&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of the ocean, and then flying it to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where she used &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;-charged cannons to destroy part of the stronghold's outer walls within seconds. During the battle, she also quickly dispelled or rendered inert the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; using a massive &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Ring of Frost&lt;/a&gt; combined with a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;, and raised several ice walls to block off reinforcements. Shortly afterwards, she was able to successfully but temporarily capture the Horde infiltration team sent to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; herself calling for them to flee at the sight of Jaina and declaring that they could not \"fight her\". After being rescued by her mother, Jaina slew &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, the last king of the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, in his own realm of &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros, the Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt; with the help of a single Alliance adventurer. Jaina used her flying flagship to circle overhead and rain devastation once again against the Horde, periodically firing arcane salvos against them as she fought them during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, even while using her Frost spells against them in tandem, managing to hold several dozen of the Horde's most skilled fighters at bay long enough for the Alliance fleet to retreat, although she was ultimately wounded and forced to flee. Her greatest achievement is perhaps locating and calling home the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; using the Proudmoore pendant when all others, even the &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt;, were apparently unable to do so, ending the Siege of Boralus and finally reuniting her nation.\nJaina is not without her weaknesses and limitations, however. She was nearly killed by a single bullet after the trial of Garrosh Hellscream in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating that without proper magical protection, she is physically just as vulnerable as most other &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. Jaina was also unable to revive &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; after he used his gnomish &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; to place himself into stasis, and was unfamiliar with the powers &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; used to slay &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina wields the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Antonidas\"&gt;Staff of Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, gifted to her by her former master as his most promising apprentice, and charged with with the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;'s power, turning it into the &lt;a href=\"Storm-Stave%20of%20Antonidas\"&gt;Storm-Stave of Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nJaina Proudmoore was one of the most inquisitive and talented sorceresses in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. With her power and intellect, many survivors of Lordaeron looked to her leadership to thrive in the foreign lands of their nation in &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; while other leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; appreciated her wisdom in their faction's affairs. Although she was originally wary of the orcs, she later fought and advocated for peace and moderation between the Alliance and Horde. Even so, old hatreds or manipulation from nefarious agents have constantly undermined her efforts to promote diplomacy between the rival factions. Jaina has gone to great lengths to appease the costs of peace, even going so far as to sabotage her father, Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, in his campaign to annihilate the Horde and let the Horde forces kill him. She even attempted to sway King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to establish more formal diplomatic ties with the Horde, though Varian felt that the Horde cannot be trusted. Though political tensions continued to escalate between her faction and the Horde, Jaina continued to coordinate with Thrall and even aid certain Horde leaders such as &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; through back channels.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;fall of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina became deeply affected by the trauma of the event. For a time she believed that her father had been right, snapping out of it only after &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; forced her to acknowledge that her anger was making her act exactly like &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; had been. Though still strong and independent, she is no longer as friendly or as trusting as she once was, especially to the Horde. Jaina has become committed to removing Garrosh from power. Though the initial rage she showed was a side-effect of the bomb, she is much less tolerant of orcs now (though she no longer possesses the desire to kill them all, and realizes that not all of them are like Garrosh) and for a time ceased her friendship with Thrall, citing him as the root cause of Theramore's destruction as he placed Garrosh in power in the first place. During the events of Garrosh's trial, however, the two made up. Even the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;' role in betraying the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; neutrality by circumventing her wards to aid the Horde in obtaining a magical weapon of destruction further reinforced her justified distrust of Horde aligned races. In spite of this, she admitted that peace may be possible if Garrosh is removed, and admitted that she wished she had parted with Thrall on better terms, implying that it may be possible to mend fences later on. She also felt guilt for planning to wipe out Orgrimmar but still firmly believes that Horde power, aggression, and influence should be checked. Jaina is more bellicose now and will not hesitate to act militantly to those who threaten the security of her people or undermine peace, although she still draws the line at killing non-combatants. She is filled with regret over her past actions (or lack of them), such as whether she could have saved Arthas, and the issue of Theramore. As a result of her experiences, she is emotionally damaged, but is essentially a \"complicated\" and \"conflicted\" character rather than an evil one. She isn't afraid to show who she is, nor is she afraid of her power.\nIn an interview regarding &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s wavering personality, &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt; replied:\n\"\"I think Garrosh has, at his core, a weak personality. He was very hostile about his father and ashamed of his father, and it took Thrall to say, \"Hey, look, you know your dad did some pretty amazing things despite everything.\" He had to get that validation externally. He also had to prove himself in battle externally. And now he is surrounding himself with some very bad and dangerous advisors, externally. Because I think that at the core, he doesn't really know. He wants to do well. He wants to preserve the orcs and their pride and their history. But I think he is actually a rather malleable person whose opinions can change. He doesn't have a strong core.\"\n\"I think the main difference -- Jaina has a very strong core. And when adversity and disaster and personal torment rip her down to nothing but that core, that core is still intact. It's hurt, but it's intact. And Garrosh doesn't really have a strong core. So what he believes kind of changes depending on what the situation is and who's talking. And I think that does not a good strong leader make.\"\"\nViews towards the Horde.\nJaina's current attitude towards the Horde seems to be considerably friendlier than before, but for a long while, her views towards them seem to be very complicated; Anduin watched her try repeatedly to ease her pain, only to have \"some fresh torment reinjure her wounded heart\". Following the destruction of Theramore, Jaina, while still loathing Garrosh for his crimes, was more balanced and restrained after she became the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, even initially refusing to openly support the Alliance's military efforts during the campaign in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; despite the requests of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, vowing to stay above the war in order to make Dalaran a \"beacon of light\", showing the way for the rest of the world. Shortly afterwards, Jaina subsequently purged the Horde from Dalaran after finding out that the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; had used its portals to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and steal the Divine Bell, being unaware that Varian had attempted to negotiate with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; regarding a possible re-admittance of the blood elves into the Alliance, which she skeptically criticized, arguing that they were not trustworthy and once being Horde, would always be so. While briefly softening after she and Lor'themar refused to fight each other, she nevertheless warned him to stay out of the Alliance's way during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and at its end urged Varian to \"dismantle the Horde\", believing that already they sought to plot against them. At the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, after Kalecgos noted that she seemed unable or unwilling to let go of her hatred, Jaina was able to overcome her negative feelings in part after &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; informed her that he neither hated nor blamed her, regardless of how she felt towards his faction. After &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; healed her as she lay mortally wounded in Thrall's arms, she squeezed her old friend's hand, and the shaman wondered whether she had been healed in more than body.\nJaina briefly appeared on &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, helping &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; empower the Horde adventurer's legendary ring, but expressed hostility towards the Horde, reminding Khadgar that she and the Council did not want them near their bases, but Khadgar dismissed her concerns. After helping the Alliance fight at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and witnessing &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s death, apparently because Sylvanas and the Horde retreated, she and Khadgar clashed again after he called a Council meeting in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; when she repositioned it over &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to defend the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. This time, Jaina left the Kirin Tor and their city after she was outvoted by most of her peers into allowing the Horde back into the order, calling the Horde monsters and cowards and warning the others that they would eventually betray them again, and subsequently left to fight the Legion by herself. During their last meeting, Jaina told Kalecgos that she still refused to agree with the Council's reasoning and no longer belonged in Dalaran, but that everything she did since Theramore's destruction was a reaction \"against\" something, and that she wanted to find out what she truly stood for, in order to find peace. After Kalecgos told Jaina that her true nature would not be anything ugly or cruel, and that he had faith that she would eventually find her way, Jaina replied wryly that he might be the only person in the world who did.\nAfter returning to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and raising the &lt;a href=\"Proudmoore%20flagship\"&gt;Proudmoore flagship&lt;/a&gt; from the depths of the ocean, she told &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s lingering shade that she was listening, and subsequently aided the Alliance against the Horde at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, further clashing with them in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; when they attempted to secure prisoners at the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt;. After they escaped, and Jaina witnessed their reaching &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, she returned to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, and despite an initially unfriendly welcome, eventually reconnected with her long-estranged mother and brother, and became the new Lord Admiral, apparently finding healing in her reunited family and homeland. With the Kul Tirans re-pledged to the Alliance, Jaina helped lead the naval and land attack in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, personally holding off the Horde pursuers to enable the Alliance fleet escape, but refused to press the attack while the Zandalari were in mourning over their king's death, believing such an action would make them no better than Sylvanas herself. After Baine returned &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to Jaina and was imprisoned for his actions, she was moved and later aided in the successful rescue mission for him in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, after which she fully reconciled with Thrall, telling him that they had changed, and that their peoples needed to work together just like at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterwards, she cooperated with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, even personally helping defeat &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, after which Lor'themar declared that he would tell the blood elves of what transpired, and finally take his place alongside Saurfang and Thrall against Sylvanas. After Anduin declared that Azeroth was both the Alliance and the Horde's home, signifying the beginning of the true \"battle for Azeroth\", Jaina cooperated once again with Thalyssra to protect their army from magical assault, witnessing Sylvanas killing Saurfang and fleeing Orgrimmar. With the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; at long last over, Jaina declared that the cycle of hatred ended when old enemies chose to walk away, and that both the Alliance and the Horde needed to learn such a lesson.\nJaina was also notably able to easily accept and embrace her older brother &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and her old friend &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; despite their being raised to &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;, with most humans apparently greatly fearing the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and regarding them as abominations, even allowing them to stay at &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze%20Village\"&gt;Seabreeze Village&lt;/a&gt;, and later honoring and understanding their decision to leave her and Kul Tiras, although stating that she would miss them both dearly.\nAppearance.\nJaina in her youth was known to be a very beautiful sorceress with pale skin, blue eyes, pink lips, and shoulder-length golden blonde hair. She wore a white female uniform with a long purple cloak with the Kirin Tor symbol. Other outfits were similar, but the tops were cropped and some of the cloaks were accompanied by hoods.\nAfter absorbing Aegwynn's powers, her appearance changed a little. Her previously blonde hair now had white highlights. It changed again after the destruction of Theramore, turning fully white except for a golden blonde skunk stripe. She let it grow longer and tied it in a French braid that fell over her left shoulder.\nRelationships.\nKalecgos.\nJaina first met with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; when he was searching for the stolen Focusing Iris. During that time, they quickly became friends while they talked about their pasts, finding out that they share the same pain of losing someone they loved. As soon as Kalecgos left, Jaina began to realize that she missed him. When Jaina was about to flood Origrimmar in retaliation for the destruction of Theramore, Kalecgos was the only one able to calm her down, reminding her that she wouldn't stoop as low as Arthas during his culling of Stratholme. After Jaina became leader of the Kirin Tor and Dalaran, she and Kalec began a romance. During the events of the trial of Garrosh Hellscream Jaina and Kalecgos, now having time to consider their relationship began to drift apart, with Kalecgos expressing concern that Jaina wasn't letting go of her hatred for Garrosh and the Horde and that it was beginning to consume her. Towards the end of the trial Jaina, having spent a lot of time in self-reflection throughout the trial and having just read a letter from Vol'jin as well as seeing Kalec about to leave, rushed to him and they embraced and kissed, making up. Eventually, the relationship ended as Jaina needed time to focus on herself.\nArthas.\nShe and &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; came to share a strong friendship that lead to very serious romance. But initially, their duties to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; forced them to put things on hold for a time. When they attempted to rekindle, the Scourge invasion got in the way. Their relationship is shown in the novel \"\". It is also shown that Jaina was still haunted by Arthas' descending to darkness, thinking it was her fault. In addition, nightmare caused by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina dreams what would happen if she followed Arthas to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and ends up becoming the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich Queen&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent Arthas from taking up the &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;accursed blade&lt;/a&gt;. In the quest &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, it was hinted that she had not give up her love for him. In \"&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Twilight of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;\", an alternate timeline was shown that Arthas, along with Jaina, were forced from Lordaeron to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. It was then said that they had a son named &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Menethil\"&gt;Uther Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to prove that if Arthas had never fallen into madness, Jaina would have remained by his side.\nThrall.\nAfter Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s armies were forced to work together after the meeting with &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the two leaders soon became good friends. Thrall once stated that Jaina reminded him strongly of &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;, but Jaina herself made no specific reason for her to trust Thrall. Their friendship was nonetheless strong, even having endured the battle of Durotar, which cost Jaina her father and Thrall many of his warriors. However, ever since Garrosh's assault on Theramore that ended in the city's obliteration, Jaina's friendship with Thrall has been severely tested as she blames him for putting Garrosh in power, which subsequently lead to the Fall of Theramore and the open war between the Alliance and Horde. During Garrosh's trial, though, the two restored their friendship when it seemed Jaina would die.\nInitially, a number of fans had speculated that Thrall and Jaina would be romantically involved at some point, but that proved to be false as Thrall developed a romantic relationship with a &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; in \"Cataclysm\". When Thrall and Aggra became life-mates, Jaina started crying with joy. Despite this, the decoded message from a &lt;a href=\"White%20Punch%20Card\"&gt;White Punch Card&lt;/a&gt; drop that reads \"Thrall and Jaina sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G\" became an in-game joke to fans.\nKael'thas.\nIt would appear that &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; fell in love with her during Jaina's training with &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, but their differences in their age (she was a teenager and he was several centuries old) filled him with guilt and self-doubt, and resulted in only an awkward friendship between the two. When he eventually did approach her, she had already fallen in love with &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and was at such a juncture that her studies came first. When contemplating Thrall's words of having a life companion, Jaina acknowledged Kael'thas' love for her, silently contemplating that while she had respected and admired Kael'thas, both he and Arthas had fallen to the weaker parts of their nature.\nIn the RPG.\nFollowing the merge of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; into a singular entity, Jaina and Thrall held conferences to discuss the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; army on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome people in Theramore speculate that Jaina's relation with Thrall has taken salacious turn. Some outspoken political opponents are on the verge of accusing Jaina of miscegenation.\nNot everybody in Theramore agreed with Jaina's decision to side with the orcs against Daelin and were gossiping or openly questioning her.\nJaina survived an assassination attempt in Theramore.\nLife on Theramore Isle is fairly insular, but Jaina welcomes visitors with warm lodging and hearty meals in exchange for stories about the outside world. Her people are simple, with most spending their days as kelp farmers or fishermen. In exchange for information or artifacts that might improve the lives of her people, Jaina has been known to provide arcane assistance to visitors, including occasionally teleporting travelers great distances, summoning elementals to guide them on their journeys or warding them with enchantments. In the event that her people are faced with a dire threat, Jaina will voluntarily accompany or aid adventurers who share her goal of protecting Theramore Isle.\nAgainst mortal foes, Jaina is merciful and tries to capture or force a surrender. Against demons and undead, Jaina is ruthless and uses her spells to their maximum potential for damage. She prefers to remain at great range.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTheramore.\nI welcome you to Theramore, &lt;name&gt;.\nI apologize for being abrupt and not having a lot of time to exchange pleasantries, but my city must come first.

Aboard a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; en route to the warfront, Jakhar practiced wielding Light's Wrath and dreamed of smiting the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Over Northrend, the zeppelin was knocked out of the sky by a fierce storm and crash landed deep within Scourge territory, forcing Jakhar to use Light's Wrath to decimate the Scourge and help the Horde soldiers fight their way to safety.\nDuring the war in Northrend, Jakhar used Light's Wrath to purify the land of undead wherever she went, earning her high praise from the Horde's commanders. However, Jakhar gradually became more and more obsessed and single-minded in her quest of destroying the Scourge and often put her fellow Horde soldiers at risk. As she became consumed by thoughts of retribution, her hold over Light's Wrath began to slip.\nOn one occasion, Jakhar led a small force of Horde forces deep behind Scourge lines, using Light's Wrath to wreak havoc on the undead until she finally lost control of her weapon. A lance of holy magic erupted from the staff, injuring the Horde soldiers and permanently blinding the priest. The party barely managed to retreat with their lives, and Jakhar abandoned Light's Wrath somewhere in the frozen wastes while they fled. According to &lt;a href=\"Israen\"&gt;Israen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, Jakhar appeared to be quite humbled by the ordeal and vowed to spend the remainder of the war using her powers to heal, rather than destroy.\nSpeculation.\nAlthough not directly stated, she is likely a &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nReferences.\n "}

This caused Jale to ask if there was no end to the drogbar's disrespect, with Torok saying that there better be \"or there will be\".\nLike Torok, Lasan and Dargrul, Jale was shocked at Ebonhorn's revelation that according to the spirits, the power of the hammer would be wielded against the Legion by an outsider rather than a native of Highmountain, but she nonetheless agreed to obey the spirits at High Chieftain Ulan's command. After Dargrul stole the hammer and used it to kill Ulan, Jale told Ulan's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla&lt;/a&gt;, that the Rivermane tribe could not spare anyone to hunt him down. As the drogbar would use the hammer against the tauren villages, the chieftains had to defend their own lands from the assault, and so Jale was forced to depart from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; along with Torok and Lasan.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrives in Thunder Totem to aid the inhabitants of Highmountain, Jale and the Rivermane at &lt;a href=\"Earthmother%27s%20Bounty\"&gt;Earthmother's Bounty&lt;/a&gt; are the first tribe that Mayla sends them to assist. After helping &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Maya\"&gt;Farmer Maya&lt;/a&gt; fend off the drogbar forces of &lt;a href=\"Ormgul%20the%20Pestilent\"&gt;Ormgul the Pestilent&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer and Jale journey further south to aid the fishermen of &lt;a href=\"Whitewater%20Wash\"&gt;Whitewater Wash&lt;/a&gt;. Once this area has been secured as well, the champion and the Rivermane chieftain travel to the sacred &lt;a href=\"Lifespring%20Cavern\"&gt;Lifespring Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, a place where the Rivermane practice much of their restorative water magic but which has come under attack from drogbar defilers under the command of a stonecaster named &lt;a href=\"Gelmogg\"&gt;Gelmogg&lt;/a&gt;. Together, Jale, the hero and a group of Rivermane tauren succeed in killing Gelmogg \u2014 even after he is transformed into a monstrosity by &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;, who also briefly mentions heading to Riverbend before disappearing again. In response, Jale hurries to Riverbend \u2014 which is her home village and the place where the Rivermane's winter supplies are stored \u2014 and is seemingly relieved when it appears that she and the hero made it there before Dargrul's arrival. However, the adventurer only barely manages to evacuate most of the villagers and send them to &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt; before the Underking appears and lays waste to the village with the Hammer of Khaz'goroth. After participating a failed attempt by &lt;a href=\"Warbrave%20Oro\"&gt;Warbrave Oro&lt;/a&gt; to kill Dargrul while he is in the &lt;a href=\"Bitestone%20Enclave\"&gt;Bitestone Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, the hero finally escorts Jale to the safety of the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Chieftains\"&gt;Hall of Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; in Thunder Totem.\nJale and her Rivermane shaman later participate in the battle against Dargrul's forces at &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nJale Rivermane was one of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; that traveled to &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Summit\"&gt;Highmountain Summit&lt;/a&gt; in order to thwart the &lt;a href=\"Necrodark\"&gt;Necrodark&lt;/a&gt;'s ritual to incarnate &lt;a href=\"Uul%27gyneth\"&gt;Uul'gyneth&lt;/a&gt;."}

Jimmy had a problem with responsibility as he was not able to do his chores. On his day off the farm, Jimmy went for his friends, &lt;a href=\"Liam\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bram%20Woodring\"&gt;Bram Woodring&lt;/a&gt;. Heading to Stormwind they decided to go fishing in Westfall instead of visiting Stormwind. Trying to find a better fishing spot, they went to &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Lighthouse\"&gt;Westfall Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt;, where he and his friends were abducted and found themselves unwilling crew members for the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;. The Bloodsail Buccaneers taught the three boys how to fight. Being the biggest of the three, Jimmy was trained in the use of a two-handed axe and became a good warrior. Under the command of Captain &lt;a href=\"Jerias%20Bloodvein\"&gt;Jerias Bloodvein&lt;/a&gt;, the captain of the \"&lt;a href=\"Garrote%20%28vessel%29\"&gt;Garrote&lt;/a&gt;\", Jimmy and his friends were forced to help plunder merchant ships, though the three managed to avoid killing people. Later they were taken to the &lt;a href=\"Plunder%20Isle\"&gt;Plunder Isle&lt;/a&gt; where the captain told them that he and &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; are enemies and now is the time to have revenge on him and the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Jimmy urged his two friends to help find a way to leave the pirates but Liam and Bram wanted to stay with them. Before the crew were going to invade the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down VanCleef, Jimmy was informed by Bloodvein that the Defias had kidnapped his family after getting word that a survivor from a raided &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; ship had recognized Jimmy, and were being held hostage on the Defias &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;. Bloodvein believed the Defias had done so to find out how Jimmy ended up on the \"Garrote\", and that the information would motivate Jimmy to fight harder.\nWanting to finally escape his forced life of piracy, when the crew's assault reached &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Cove\"&gt;Ironclad Cove&lt;/a&gt; Jimmy slipped away and rescued his parents, but they were caught. Captain Bloodvein was not willing to let anyone leave his crew and offered to allow Jimmy to fall back in line or be executed for mutiny. Jimmy challenged him to a duel for his freedom, and dodging the surprise bullet from Bloodvein's pistol that he'd been expecting, killed the undead captain after a brutal melee. Enraged by their captain\u2019s death, the crew of the \"Garrote\" were about to kill Blackridge and his parents but his friends used their magic and techniques to help them all to escape from the Bloodsails and reach the safety of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;. James is last seen telling his tale of piracy to &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Songshine\"&gt;Kira Songshine&lt;/a&gt;, whom he has had a crush on since the beginning of the story, in &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt;. James returned to being a farmer in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, discovering to his surprise that when he actually applies himself he rather likes running a farm, and considers writing a book on his adventures as a Bloodsail Buccaneer."}

While in deep meditation, Jammal'an received instructions on how to resurrect Hakkar by using the blood of his draconic foes, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Jammal'an and his undead bodyguard Ogom the Wretched stand ready to oppose any who would prevent Hakkar's return, though the prophet's actions may unleash upon &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; an even more terrible force: the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategy.\nAfter clearing his entire room from every troll dead or alive, you may attack their leader and his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; minion Ogom alone. He is a combination of a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, while his undead minion part &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, part &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the fight, he yells \"join us\" and casts a resistible but indelible &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; on the strongest player that is not on the top of the &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; list. This ability does nothing but once it disappears, the player may turn into a muscular Troll berserker with +100% damage bonus. If a &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; is afflicted, he will heal Jammal'an and his minion. If you have any form of &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, that would be the right time to use it.\nBesides that, it's a simple fight; he will summon a &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt; called Earthbind Totem. The totem will root anyone near the totem in place for 3 secs. He will melee attack while his minion casts &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;Shadow Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s or aids Jammal'an with melee. The only problem once he yells: \"Hakkar shall live again\" he will start to spam Heal on himself until he has no mana left. If a priest is available or you have an &lt;a href=\"affliction\"&gt;affliction&lt;/a&gt; warlock, &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Mana\"&gt;Drain Mana&lt;/a&gt; him. As a shaman, he does not have that much mana.\nSince Jammal'an's melee attack is nowhere near as damaging as his minion's &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;Shadow Bolt&lt;/a&gt;s, it is often a good plan to focus damage on the add first, interrupting Jammal'ans attempts to heal him. &lt;a href=\"Ogom%20the%20Wretched\"&gt;Ogom the Wretched&lt;/a&gt; does not have much health and can be dispatched quickly with a group of 50+s, allowing the rest of the fight to focus on Jammal'an and crowd-controlling the debuffed player.\nIn the RPG.\nA single leader holds sway over the priesthood \u2014 this is the prophet Jammal\u2019an. He rules the Atal\u2019ai and Hakkari and is instrumental in attempts to summon the Soulflayer. Jammal'an is a mysterious individual who is mostly responsible for the cult's recent success in summoning Hakkar. By all accounts, Jammal'an is a power-mad zealot, prone to devouring or (if he's feeling pleasantly full) exiling trolls who disagree with him. Jammal'an has recently received a series of visions in which Hakkar states that, when he enters Azeroth, he will grant immortality to all Atal\u2019ai. He made has apparently made no such promise to the Hakkari, who serve him hoping that he\u2019ll grant them some reward despite his lack of a promise. All members of the Atal'ai believe this prophecy (or at least pretend to), which makes them all the more ferocious. However, Hakkar has been summoned and the Atal\u2019ai are not immortal. The trolls think he\u2019s busy with other concerns \u2014 like draining other troll gods of their power \u2014 and hasn\u2019t got around to granting immortality yet. The &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai%20Exile\"&gt;Atal'ai Exile&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; thinks that the prophecy was nothing more than manipulation and with Jammal'an's reckless trust of false visions led his people to their eternal doom. They were a ruse to trick Jammal'an into bringing about his own doom \u2014 and that of the rest of the world."}

As with all gauntlet runs you need to keep moving for if you stop the trash will respawn behind you. The trick to this gauntlet is to kill :s before they can bang on one of the drums found around the area. Amani'shi Scouts are fast and have a large aggro range. Having a warrior charge in to stun it, a rogue cheap shot it, or even a druid root it is a good idea. If you don't kill the Amani'shi Scout fast enough he will run to the nearest drum and start pounding on it. Each time he pounds on the drum it summons 2 &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Reinforcement\"&gt;Amani'shi Reinforcement&lt;/a&gt;s. So Amani'shi Scouts need to die as soon as possible and your whole group needs to be sure they go down! Amani'shi Scouts keep respawning from huts, so be prepared for respawns during a pull. You must keep moving to avoid the respawns.\nThere are also normal groups of trash mobs spread around this area. These do not respawn as part of the gauntlet, it is only the : respawns you need to worry about.\nAmani'shi Flame Caster and Guardian groups.\nIf you have space, the easiest way to deal with these packs is to CC the Amani'shi Flame Casters and pull the Amani'shi Guardians about 40 yards away where 2 tanks handle them (chain sheep until the Amani'shi Guardians are out of dispell range). You can also line of sight the Guardians from the sheeped Amani'shi Flame Casters, which will prevent them from dispelling the sheep. The Guardians are single target DPSed down, then the flame casters. When killing the Flame Casters, open with a 4 second stun such as &lt;a href=\"Concussive%20Shot\"&gt;Concussive Shot&lt;/a&gt;, spell steal the buff and then interrupt the next AoE. If the pack has a Scout, the scout must die first of course.\nIf there is not enough room for the above, the following strategy is slower and more risky. If there is only one Amani'shi Flame Caster, take him down as first target, and deal with the Amani'shi Guardian afterwards. If there are 2 Amani'shi Flame Caster, sap is preferable to poly. Take first one down, then take the second (CC'ed) one down next. Without a sap, have a mage chain sheep one (he will be doing nothing but constantly sheeping), while DPS takes down the other. Amani'shi Guardians are tanked while DPS takes down the Amani'shi Flame Caster.\nA Priest Mind Controlling an Amani'shi Flame Caster does decent DPS, especially when no CC'd mobs are around (i.e. if they can spam the hasted Fireball Volley). To maximize DPS, use the self-buff, keep both damage spells on cooldown, and don't forget to melee. The MC'ing priest can die easily if the MC breaks early. Another Priests Shield, a timely Intervene (using a /cast [target=focus,exists][] Invervene macro) or Blind can be life savers. Intervene should also be used before the priest cancels the MC, don't risk losing time due to an unnecessary death. Keep in mind that MC'ing Priests cannot move out of the way of a patrolling Scout, so choose your position wisely (e.g. not too close to a drum or spawn point).\nAmani'shi Beast Tamer and Dragonhawk groups.\nThese groups are fairly straightforward, and can just be tanked and spanked. The Beast Tamer's mind control should be dispelled."}

They can be trapped, feared, frozen, and killed using AOE or single target attacks. \nStrategy.\nDPS and Enrage.\nJan'alai stands atop a platform with two smaller platforms on each side connected by a short bridge. The smaller platforms to the right and left contain &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Dragonhawk\"&gt;Amani Dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; eggs (20 eggs on each side). The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Dragonhawk\"&gt;Amani Dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; eggs will be hatched throughout the fight by &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Hatcher\"&gt;Amani'shi Hatcher&lt;/a&gt; and finally at 35% Jan'alai himself will hatch all remaining eggs. He has two enrage timers: one at 5 minutes that is rather unimportant, as it only increases his damage by 50% and speed by 50%, but at 10 minutes he goes berserk. You will need to get him down before this 10 minute timer.\nIt is important to spread out during this fight because periodically Jan'alai will cast a Flame Breath that does conical damage to a random player and others who are close.\nBombs.\nAt random intervals (approximately every 30\u201360 seconds) Jan'alai will teleport himself and the whole raid to the center of the main platform. He will then create a series of Time Bombs. They appear first as small sparks then become large balls of fire. The bombs detonate after approximately twelve seconds dealing significant damage to all players within 5 yards. Players should look for deliberately placed gaps in the bombs which will keep them at least 5 yards from any bomb. (Inverting the camera to look down onto the platform aids in finding a spot). Tips: New bombs usually spawn under random players' feet. If you have Deadly boss mod or similar addons installed, it is actually better to STAND STILL after you are teleported, look for a clear area, and move to it at the last 2 seconds. If you move immediately after the teleport, you are likely to make more bombs spawn under your feet, which means you will have less clear area to stand on. \nAlternatively, you may avoid the bombs by running to the \"safe spot\" that exists in the NW corner of the main platform. There are bone piles in this corner, which make it easier to locate. After being teleported, you may feel somewhat disoriented, making it difficult to run to the NW corner in time. A quick way to orient yourself is to look at your mini-map and spin until the arrow is pointed to the NW corner, then simply run forward. If your entire raid (minus the tank) takes this approach though, it is very important to spread out immediately following the bombs exploding, to avoid having several in the raid damaged by the directed flame attack.\nWhen the Time Bombs cover the ground all exits from the main platform, including those to the hatchery platforms, are blocked by [Fire Wall]. Any attempt to cross this wall of fire will result in a debuff that does 3063 to 3937 fire damage per second for 15 seconds(Divine Shield does not remove this debuff). Mages have the ability to blink through the Fire Wall without gaining the debuff, thereby avoiding all bomb explosions.\nDragonhawks.\nApproximately every ninety seconds Jan'alai will call two non-elite Amani'shi Hatchers. The Amani'shi Hatchers will appear at the stairs where your group entered. They will then run onto the smaller platforms and begin hatching &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Dragonhawk%20Hatchling\"&gt;Amani Dragonhawk Hatchling&lt;/a&gt; eggs. The rate at which Amani Dragonhawk eggs hatch increases every tick i.e. the first tick he hatches one, the next tick hatches two more, the next tick hatches three more, then four more, then five more. The Amani Dragonhawk Hatchlings can spawn very quickly so keeping track of the Amani'shi Hatchers becomes important. You can quickly become over run by Amani Dragonhawk Hatchlings if you allow too many eggs to be hatched at one time.\nEgg hatching places you between a rock and a hard place. When Jan'alai's health reaches 35% he will hatch all of the remaining Amani Dragonhawk eggs. If you have not allowed the &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Hatcher\"&gt;Amani'shi Hatcher&lt;/a&gt;s to spawn a few eggs during the fight this can produce a large amount of Amani Dragonhawk Hatchlings from both sides and will probably wipe the raid. Also, you must hatch eggs fast enough to avoid the boss's berserk timer.\nThe Amani'shi Hatchers are fairly weak and can be easily killed, killing only one outright and allowing the other to hatch a small number of Amani Dragonhawk eggs each time is a very good idea. For example: Have a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; or other dps kill the left hatcher when it spawns. Let the other open 3-5 waves and let the offtank take care of these while while 2 &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; classes dps them down. When this side is clear just repeat the same on the other side. This way when he reaches 35% all the hatchlings will come from 1 side and can be easily controlled by tanking them, hunter trap, mage frost nova, etc.\nDoing this also means fewer Amani Dragonhawks will spawn near the end of the fight when Jan'alai calls on the remaining eggs to hatch. Care must be taken with the number hatched since the Amani Dragonhawks should be killed before the next teleport/fire ball spell cast because trying to AoE down too many Amani Dragonhawks while avoiding the fire balls is more difficult.\nAlternate Strategies.\nPaladin Off tank: \nA paladin off tank can easily handle tanking all of the eggs from one side with 1 healer. This method requires 2 high AoE damagers though (warlock, mage). In this manner, the fight can be simplified to just 2 egg sets, and then focus on the boss. Largest hindrance to this method is making sure no one Flame Breathes the paladin with 30+ debuffs. The paladin can also Divine Shield (bubble) out of the debuffs.\nMoonkin Off tank: \nA Balance Druid is a substitute for tanking all of the eggs from one side with 1 healer. The Moonkin should have a large health pool and high armor. This method also requires 2 AoE damagers as well. In this manner, the fight can be simplified to 2-3 egg sets, and then focus on the boss. The Moonkin in this situation should use Hurricane + Barkskin for each set of eggs. Additionally a macro should be ready to switch to Dire Bear Form, AoE taunt, and switch back to Moonkin Form if control is lost. \nFront loading hatchlings: \nIf you have a mage for frost nova and slows along with 1-2 other good AoE DPSers, you might want to let the first hatcher clear out one entire side. While difficult, this can work, and doing this on the first spawn means that its easy to reset the fight and start over if an AoEer dies. Note that once the hatchers finish hatching one entire side they'll move to the other side, so be sure to kill it after the first 20 hatchlings are spawned. If you do 20 on the first hatcher spawn and 10 each on the next two spawns the rest of the fight turns into a simple tank and spank, and you don't have any distracting dragonhawks after the 5 minute enrage (which will tend to wipe your raid). If you try and fail, you fail early in the fight and can quickly reset, resurrect, and try again.\nTank from the egg platforms: \nJan'alai can be tanked from the egg platforms, which puts the majority of the raid outside his fire breath range. The tank and a single healer can pull the boss to one of the egg platforms while the rest of the raid allows the entire opposite egg platform to hatch. Without the fire breath to worry about, the rest of the raid can quickly dispatch the eggs on the other platform. If a teleport occurs before the firehawks are down, the tank can pull the boss back to the same egg platform, with typically only one fire breath hitting the raid. By the second teleport, the adds should all be dead. When the hatchers spawn again, the tank and healer (or possibly a different healer if the first is low on mana) pull the boss to the cleared egg platform and the rest of the raid hatches and kills the remaining firehawks on the other side. When all firehawks are down, the raid should take the standard spread-out configuration in the middle platform to DPS the boss.\nReset.\nJan'alai will reset if he runs off the platform. After resetting he will despawn for approximately 30 seconds, allowing you to finish resurrection of dead party members. It is advisable that your raid do not release to aid in wipe recovery. If you are unable to complete resurrections before he respawns, simply pull him down the stairs again.\nAny members that release and zone into the instance entrance will need to carefully navigate the Scout respawns on their way back to Jan'alai's platform. You cannot summon players inside the Zul'aman instance.\nFire Resistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Fire%20resistance\"&gt;Fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; gear is not strictly necessary for this fight, although having a few pieces of it (especially for the adds tank) can make the healers' job easier.\nIf you have paladins or shamans in the raid, fire resistance aura or totem should be arranged for each group.\nBugs.\nThe Hatchers will some times go to the same platform, both hatching eggs on that platform. If this happens, it is generally best to kill both Hatchers, minimizing the amount of eggs they hatch, unless the boss is nearing 35%. It is thought that this will happen if the eggs on either side is uneven, so it might not be a bug.\nQuotes.\nTimer progression:\nAggro:\nSummoning Hatchers:\nSummoning Bombs:\nAt 35%:\nKilling a player:\nEnrage:\nDeath:\nLoot.\nFor the timed event loot, see the &lt;a href=\"Zul%2527Aman_timed_event%23Loot\"&gt;Zul'Aman timed event&lt;/a&gt; article."}

Kill one, while letting the other hatch all dragonhawk eggs on one side of the the arena. The hatched dragonhawks should be tanked and killed before resuming DPS on Jan'alai; the +5% fire damage debuff the dragonhawks stack on the tank can be dispelled efficiently. A second set of hatchers will eventually be summoned, allowing you to hatch and kill the other half of the dragonhawks in a controllable manner.

In life, she developed a spell that \"displayed several images of her body that were nearly indistinguishable from her real form. These images duplicated her actions from different locations, making it nearly impossible for her enemies to find her. It was almost infallible.\" It is also said that Jandice stewards the blood of innocents from &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Theolen%20Krastinov\"&gt;Doctor Theolen Krastinov&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kirtonos%20the%20Herald%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kirtonos the Herald&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter years of being ignored in the basement of &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, Jandice has returned. She has been doing quite a bit of study in the field of Arcana.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; stated that according to &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; reports, some of the Barovs are still in Scholomance, including Jandice Barov. As she was a master of illusion in life, she appears just as strong in death. Mathias also reported that near her dwelling, one of the ritual hoods was found. He advised to leave it locked in the manor, but the &lt;a href=\"Barovian%20Ritual%20Hood\"&gt;hood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barovian%20Family%20Sword\"&gt;Barovian family sword&lt;/a&gt; ended up displayed in &lt;a href=\"Mardenholde%20Keep\"&gt;Mardenholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Course: Advanced Illusions\"\n\"Barov's spirit lurked in the recesses of Scholomance for years, but now she has taken a more active role in educating the next generation of &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;. Her vast knowledge of illusions has made her both a valued educator and a dangerous opponent to anyone foolish enough to draw her ire.\"\nStrategy.\nClear the room before starting the fight. The tank should charge in and turn Jandice around to keep her facing away from the rest of the party. When she starts casting Wondrous Rapidity, the tank can move behind her to save the healer some mana, as she will not move to keep the tank targeted after the cast or the channel has started.\nAt 66/33%, Jandice will split into \"fifteen\" shadow clones of herself with low health. All of them will randomly cast Whirl of Illusion on players. The \"real\" Jandice has black hair, headband, shoulders, gloves and belt \u2014 all of the clones differ in one or more of these slots. Players need to quickly find the right one and kill it (killing the wrong one triggers a small aoe explosion that hits your party for moderate damage). Once you kill the correct clone, the real Jandice will respawn, spinning for a few seconds, at the same spot where the clone was when it died, so the tank should land a taunt while she's still spinning before the rest of the group unloads. Make sure to turn her around again!\nIf you're fighting Jandice on Challenge Mode, or for the &lt;a href=\"Attention%20to%20Detail\"&gt;Attention to Detail&lt;/a&gt; achievement, it helps to have the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse.com/addons/wow/barovhelper\"&gt;BarovHelper&lt;/a&gt; addon from Curse. It places large obvious models on your screen for the boss and your targeted clone, helping you save precious seconds and avoid unnecessary damage from killing the wrong one.\nAlternatively, you can fight Jandice on the opposite side of a bookcase from where she spawns. If you stay there when she splits into her clones, the phase will end after several seconds without needing to destroy any of the clones.\nIn Hearthstone.\nJandice Barov appears as a in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".

These duplicates appear to be immune to &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage, but using a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; on the true Jandice will quickly kill all the images as well. She will keep duplicating, so always throw the MF on her as needed. Subsequently a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"kick\"&gt;kick&lt;/a&gt; Jandice to prevent her from duplicating. As of late all Jandice's duplicates along with Jandice will have a health bar, so if Jandice does duplicate herself press the V button (default show target's health) to find the real Jandice by looking for the bar that has some out of it already and focus all attacks on her. \nIt is unknown if any form of &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; damage done to Jandice also harms her images or not.\nOther spells she casts are Curse of Blood (10 min duration, increases physical damage dealt to target by 92) and Banish.\nIt is also useful to have each player in the group create a &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; to target Jandice (/target Jandice will suffice). Once she splits into the images, repeatedly pressing this macro will allow the group to re-target her most efficiently. It was once useful to have a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; mark Jandice, as the mark would remain on her when she re-appeared; however, this is no longer the case.\nIt is best to concentrate all &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; on Jandice until she drops. Dropping Jandice will result in the images despawning a few seconds later. Also, the trash mobs in this room tend to respawn much quicker than the other trash mobs in the instance, so it is imperative to finish her off as quickly as possible.\nIf you have a unit frames &lt;a href=\"addon\"&gt;addon&lt;/a&gt; that supports a separate unit frame for your focus, before beginning the fight, target Jandice Barov and type in /focus. The frame will show up during the fight, disappear when she creates her images, and then reappear as soon as she is attackable.\nQuotes.\nDeath:\n\"This is the &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20Jandice%20Barov\"&gt;Journal of Jandice Barov&lt;/a&gt;.

Led formerly by &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Throndyr\"&gt;Jarl Throndyr&lt;/a&gt;, with the current Jarl of Jandvik being the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Jarl had disappeared for some time, raising suspicion and competition within the village. &lt;a href=\"Brandolf\"&gt;Brandolf&lt;/a&gt; and several loyalist vrykul left the village to find their Jarl, and lend him help if need be. During the absence of the Jarl, two vrykul had attempted to take the title, though were thwarted when slain by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; per request of &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Sashj%27tar\"&gt;Tidemistress Sashj'tar&lt;/a&gt; disguised as &lt;a href=\"Toryl\"&gt;Toryl&lt;/a&gt;. When the deed was done, the vrykul-disguised &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; sent the Adventurer to find the Jarl, whom just outside the village had been attacked by the naga invaders, and muttered how poison ran through his veins.\nAfter finding the &lt;a href=\"Jarl%20Throndyr\"&gt;Jarl&lt;/a&gt;, he sent the Adventurer to gather materials for a funeral pyre to honour him the vrykul-way, by setting his body aflame. &lt;a href=\"Brandolf\"&gt;Brandolf&lt;/a&gt;, whom were safeguarding the fallen Jarl, later awaited the return of the Adventurer at the location of the funeral pyre.\nHaving built the pyre and honoured the fallen Jarl's wishes of being set aflame, Brandolf now wished to retaliate against the naga, the fall of their Jarl had been the breaking-point. Brandolf would now assist the player in the making of a tonic allowing them underwater breathing as well as underwater-walking. Allowing the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to assault the naga where they least expect it. With the ability to breathe underwater, the Adventurer ended the lives of the naga's commanders, where they then returned to &lt;a href=\"Jandvik\"&gt;Jandvik&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Sashj%27tar\"&gt;Tidemistress&lt;/a&gt; still disguised as &lt;a href=\"Toryl\"&gt;Toryl&lt;/a&gt; awaited the Adventurer back in Jandvik, where she sent them to meet up with her within an underwater cave. Although, upon entering the cave, the Adventurer was met with the sight of &lt;a href=\"Toryl\"&gt;Toryl&lt;/a&gt; locked in a cage, and the Tidemistress guarding her, along with what appears like the corpse of a male vrykul. Toryl called out the Tidemistress' ploy, and in return, the Adventurer killed the naga. Toryl returned to &lt;a href=\"Jandvik\"&gt;Jandvik&lt;/a&gt; after asking the player to release her vrykul bretheren from captivity. The Adventurer then approached &lt;a href=\"Kell\"&gt;Kell&lt;/a&gt;, the previously-assumed dead vrykul laying on the ground. His last wish before death was for the Adventurer to venture into the Azuregale Bay and locate &lt;a href=\"Brytag\"&gt;Brytag&lt;/a&gt;, who then sent the Adventurer to gather barrels of gunpowder used to bombard the naga from the back of a &lt;a href=\"sea%20turtle\"&gt;sea turtle&lt;/a&gt;. As well as to put and end to the &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Seawarden%20Largush\"&gt;Seawarden Largush&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the bequest of &lt;a href=\"Kell\"&gt;Kell&lt;/a&gt;, the Adventurer, before returning to &lt;a href=\"Jandvik\"&gt;Jandvik&lt;/a&gt;, killed several &lt;a href=\"naga%20brute\"&gt;naga brute&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s. When done, they returned to &lt;a href=\"Brandolf\"&gt;Brandolf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Toryl\"&gt;Toryl&lt;/a&gt; to relay the news of the naga and sea giant alliance.\nToryl decided it was time to put an end to the naga threat, and doing so would be through the death of the &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Sashj%27tar\"&gt;Tidemistress&lt;/a&gt; whom had previous impersonated her. By destroying naga ballista within &lt;a href=\"Azuregale%20Bay\"&gt;Azuregale Bay&lt;/a&gt;, salvaging the metal and constructing a makeshift ballista on the &lt;a href=\"Sashj%27tar%20Ruins\"&gt;Sashj'tar island&lt;/a&gt;, used to fire a powerful ballistae bolt at the Tidemistress and her guards, killing said guards and weakening Sashj'tar herself, allowing the Adventurer to end her life once and for all.\nAfter the death of the Tidemistress, the Adventurer returns to Jandvik, where he/she is crowned the Jarl of Jandvik as a thank for saving the village and the lives of all the remaining vrykul, none of whom opposed the decision of Toryl."}

A massive bomb resides in the lowest deck. A steel eagle head on the bow cuts through the sky as the vessel flies above the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Lich King's fortress&lt;/a&gt;, providing valuable cover for Alliance forces on the glacier below. Numerous Alliance leaders, from the noble &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; to rejoin the Alliance, use the \"Skybreaker\" as a staging point for their forays deep into enemy territory. Under the able command of &lt;a href=\"High%20Captain%20Justin%20Bartlett\"&gt;High Captain Justin Bartlett&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Skybreaker\" is the first line of attack for the Alliance war effort against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. \nAll is not quiet in the skies above Icecrown, however. The arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s new airship, \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\", has sparked open hostilities. The two gunships often square off, focusing on the renewed hostilities between the factions instead of the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Only time will tell if the brave crew of the \"Skybreaker\" can stand up to the Horde's newest behemoth in addition to the ravenous undead of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s Scourge.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, the final wing of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt; 5-mans, the \"Skybreaker\" comes to the rescue of Alliance players &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Arthas\"&gt;escaping the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; when they become trapped on a platform outside the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Passage\"&gt;Hidden Passage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"Skybreaker\", under the command of &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, later becomes involved in a &lt;a href=\"Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;Gunship Battle&lt;/a&gt; with \"Orgrim's Hammer\" in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Although it is the same gunship, it has been remodeled slightly for use in the raid; all below deck entrances have been covered up.\nCrew.\nThe gunship also has its own aerial &lt;a href=\"Skybreaker%20Troop%20Transport\"&gt;troop transports&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign.\nThe \"Skybreaker\" is divided into three decks, interconnected by wooden stairways and ramps.\nThe main deck is also the largest, housing many of the vessel's offensive and defensive weapons. Mounted on both sides of the forecastle are twin battery turrets, providing an unparalleled amount of forward firepower. Along the deck stand numerous marines and High Elven sorcerers, ready to defend the ship from any unfriendly attacks at a moment's notice. At the rear of the main deck stands the massive aft-castle, containing the ship's bridge inside the brilliantly lit glass exterior.\nThe lower decks are lined with broadside facing cannons staffed by a literal army of dwarves and gnomes. Though smaller than the \"Orgrim's Hammer's\" monstrous turrets, the sheer number of guns makes the \"Skybreaker\" more than a threat to the other ship. A well stocked armory and a small launch platform for aerial missions are contained in the aft sections of the lower decks. In the bowels of the ship rests the ultimate weapon of the Alliance: a massive bomb larger than a &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;, ready to be deployed upon the unsuspecting legions below. \nJust as the \"Skybreaker\" is a \"ship\" of the air, it carries a compliment of two flying lifeboats. These \"air dinghies\" appear to be designed with flapping wings, so perhaps there is a motor of some sort under the deck. It's also possible they're meant to be set up and fixed horizontally, as glider wings. On the back is a boat-style rudder, but clearly for an aircraft design. They're not very big and seem to have only enough room for two people, maybe three. In an age of flying mounts and aircraft, perhaps they are truly only for emergencies, for those who do not have flight conveyance and cannot get a ride with those that do."}

If you try the quest once and Kerlonian dies, the Horn of Awakening will remain in your inventory. If you go back to where you first met Kerlonian, he will be there, asleep. Use the horn on him and he will awake (apparently) restarting the mission. However, the horn you have in your inventory will now simply disappear after a few minutes (probably based on the timer for your \"first\" attempt). This means it will almost certainly disappear during the quest, making it impossible to awaken Kerlonian, and causing you to fail the quest again. So, if you fail the quest once, make sure you abort it the next time, so the Horn is correctly reset.\nTrivia.\nThe Sleeper Has Awakened is a quote from \"\" uttered by .

You must complete a large portion of the quest chain to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; reputation faction.\nTo complete even the first quest in this chain, you must either:\nSummary.\nYou start off with the relatively simple task of freeing some prisoners from the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Vrykul\"&gt;Vrykul&lt;/a&gt; women. Getting the last prisoner, &lt;a href=\"Zeev%20Fizzlespark\"&gt;Zeev Fizzlespark&lt;/a&gt;, brings you into contact with &lt;a href=\"Lok%27lira%20the%20Crone\"&gt;Lok'lira the Crone&lt;/a&gt;, who helps you infiltrate with the &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir\"&gt;Hyldnir&lt;/a&gt;, in disguise.\nAfter you successfully free Zeev, Lok'lira asks you to continue to gain the trust of the Hyldnir, with the purpose of rousing &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; from his stupor and ending the war between the Hyldnir and the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;. By competing in various stages of the &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet\"&gt;Hyldsmeet&lt;/a&gt; you gain the honor of riding a drake up to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, where you meet Thorim.\nYou manage to spur Thorim into action. He sends you out on a mission to regain the trust of the Sons of Hodir. In the process you find and restore his armor. You then help Thorim to get his drake mount, &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt;, back. Finally, Thorim reconciles himself with the Sons of Hodir and he regains his mighty hammer &lt;a href=\"Krolmir%2C%20Hammer%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Krolmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nTime to confront Loken. With Thorim's help you first thin out his minions and defeat three of his lieutenants. But when Thorim takes on Loken himself things end badly and Thorim and his drake are captured. It turns out that once again you have unwittingly been helping the side of evil. You get your own back when the king of the Sons of Hodir sends you to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; to kill Loken.\nDetails.\nAn Ambushed Expedition.\nArriving at &lt;a href=\"K3\"&gt;K3&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;The Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, you find yourself petitioned by a distressed goblin. &lt;a href=\"Gretchen%20Fizzlespark\"&gt;Gretchen Fizzlespark&lt;/a&gt; tells you she was part of an expedition into the mountains that was attacked by odd, &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;blue skinned Vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. The Vrykul captured all of the men, but released all of the expedition's women. You agree to get them back.\nYou fly to &lt;a href=\"Sifreldar%20Village\"&gt;Sifreldar Village&lt;/a&gt;, and observe the &lt;a href=\"hyldnir\"&gt;hyldnir&lt;/a&gt; there. You find that many of them carry &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Iron%20Key\"&gt;keys&lt;/a&gt; to the cages in and around Sifreldar. You kill a few hyldnir for their keys, and liberate the goblins held prisoner. While you're doing this, you remember that Gretchen also mentioned that the Hyldnir also took a fair amount of the &lt;a href=\"Equipment%20Recovery\"&gt;expedition equipment&lt;/a&gt;. Thoughtfully, you pick up what you can find of it to take back with you.\nReporting back to Gretchen, you discover that you missed one. Specifically, &lt;a href=\"Zeev%20Fizzlespark\"&gt;Zeev&lt;/a&gt;, Gertchen's brother. Gretchen asks you to look around &lt;a href=\"The%20Forlorn%20Mine\"&gt;The Forlorn Mine&lt;/a&gt;, since that seems to be where they send a lot of their captives to work.\nThe crone's bargain.\nWhile you don't immediately find Zeev, you do find something else unusual: a female captive. She accosts you, guessing correctly that you are looking for the new prisoner.\nShe introduces herself as &lt;a href=\"Lok%27lira%20the%20Crone\"&gt;Lok'lira&lt;/a&gt;, and offers you a deal: She'll help you get Zeev back, if you help her escape. She intends to put an illusion over you, so that you appear to be one of the &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir\"&gt;Hyldnir&lt;/a&gt;. To do that, she needs her set of &lt;a href=\"Runes%20of%20the%20Yrkvinn\"&gt;runes&lt;/a&gt;, currently held by one &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Syra\"&gt;Overseer Syra&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou hold no particular love for the Hyldnir, so it is no great moral quandary to slay Syra and retrieve the runes.\nLok'lira intends that you ingratiate yourself with the mine supervisor, &lt;a href=\"Mildred%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Mildred the Cruel&lt;/a&gt;. You are to 'lend a hand', and do what she asks of you until she trusts you with the keys to Lok'lira's shackles.\nMildred has been expecting a new Overseer (presumably to replace the one you slew earlier). She sets you to administering discipline to the male &lt;a href=\"Vrykul\"&gt;Vrykul&lt;/a&gt; toiling in the mines. Charming. Necessary, though, if you are to free Lok'lira.\nIf you had any qualms about the last job, you'll be having more bout the next one. Mildred has found the leader of the frykul resistance in the mines: one &lt;a href=\"Garhal\"&gt;Garhal&lt;/a&gt;. She wants you to slay him in front of the other males, to make a lesson of him.\nYour hope of rescuing Zeev rests on freeing Lok'lira, and balking at this point can only look suspicious. You find Garhal only a short distance away, in a stand off between two of his cronies and two guards. You send him to whatever eternal reward he was destined for, and return to Mildred.\nEven Mildred (whose own ekename is \"the Cruel\") acknowledges that you are without mercy. She has found yet another task for you: kill off Lok'lira. Naturally, this involves the shackle keys you've been after all this time.\nYou quickly take the keys to Lok'lira, and set her free. She's eager to get out of the mines, but you have to leave separately, to avoid suspicion. (You were told to kill her painlessly. She is gone from the mine. As long as you don't have to show anyone a body, no problem!)\nYou make your own way to the eastern end of the mine, leading to &lt;a href=\"Brunnhildar%20Village\"&gt;Brunnhildar Village&lt;/a&gt;. There you meet with Lok'lira, who is sporting a look much like your own illusion.\nAnd it seems you've arrived in the nick of time, too. It seems he's about to be spitted by one of the Hyldnir. You challenge her to mortal combat (not uncommon at the Hyldsmeet), and 'win' Zeev's freedom.\nThe Hyldsmeet: A worthy opponent.\nIt seems that &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, a servant of the titans, had been a guardian of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Terrace of the Makers&lt;/a&gt;. However, when &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; killed his wife (&lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;), he flew into a rage and lashed out at everyone close. This included the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir\"&gt;Hyldnir&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Brunnhildar%20Village\"&gt;Brunnhildar Village&lt;/a&gt; took their cue from that, resulting in a war between them and the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s lasting to this day. Once he recovered from his rage, Thorim sank into depression, and exiled himself to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet\"&gt;Hyldsmeet&lt;/a&gt; is a contest to determine who gets to be Thorium's new wife. Lok'lira had come to Brunnhildr Village in an attempt to participate in the Hyldsmeet, and gain access to the Temple, hoping to get Thorim to pay attention to the world again. The Hyldnir took exception to that, and there you are.\nYou, by killing the Hyldnir threatening Zeev, have automatically entered the Hyldsmeet. You COULD just skip out now, but with the guardian Thorim brooding instead of guarding, taking action sounds a whole lot more useful to you.\nLok'lira directs you to the next round of matches. For that, you need to defeat 6 (other) &lt;a href=\"Victorious%20Challenger\"&gt;Victorious Challenger&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Hyldsmeet: The Bear Pit.\nFor the next step, you'll need a Warbear. Lok'lira directs you to &lt;a href=\"Brijana\"&gt;Brijana&lt;/a&gt;, just past the east end of Brunnhildar village. Prove yourself to her, and you will be on track to getting a war bear of your own.\nYou go to Brijana. She does have a task to prove yourself: Ride &lt;a href=\"Icefang\"&gt;Icefang&lt;/a&gt; down the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Ancient%20Winters\"&gt;valley&lt;/a&gt; and back, burning &lt;a href=\"Frostworg\"&gt;Frostworg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Giant\"&gt;Frost Giant&lt;/a&gt;s alike.\nYou prepare yourself, and hop on Icefang's back. He apparently knows where he wants to go, and goes there without your direction. You take advantage of that to inflict pain and suffering among the foes of the Hyldnir. Brijana is satisfied with your performance, but not yet ready to help you get your bear.\nInstead, she has another mission for you. The Frost Giants are holding a number of the Hyldnir prisoner, frozen in blocks of ice. This is not a proper end for a warrior! Your task is to free a number of proto-drakes from the chains that hold them, load them up with Brunnhildar prisoners, and return them home.\nAnd isn't that the wild ride? You take your own flying mount out to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Niffelem\"&gt;Dun Niffelem&lt;/a&gt; time and again, releasing the shackles on a proto-drake, and directing the drakes to break the ice blocks to free the prisoners. All the while, giants are throwing their clubs at you, forcing you to dodge, weave, duck, and sometimes just take it on the wing. Still, eventually, you've returned a large number of Hyldnir to Brunnhildar.\nThat, Brijana declares, is a glorious feat! (And rightly so, in your own humble opinion.) She directs you to speak to &lt;a href=\"Astrid%20Bjornrittar\"&gt;Astrid Bjornrittar&lt;/a&gt;, back in the village, and tell her of your accomplishments.\nAstrid, of course, is more than happy to tell you that the reward for a job well done is another job. In this case, that you've got to make a harness before you can ride your bear. And she knows just where to find some hides that will do.\nFollowing her directions, you fly down the cliffs south of Brunnhildar Village and find scattered groups of Yeti. You don't have to kill many to get enough hides, but you do have to watch your step. Fortunately, you don't tumble over the cliffs to an ignominious death.\nYou give her the hides, and she puts together a harness for you from them.\nNow, what you need is the bear itself. Astrid directs you to the &lt;a href=\"Hibernal%20Cavern\"&gt;Hibernal Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, where the Brunnhildar have traditionally gotten their bears (before breeding them in captivity). At the caverns, you will need to find an &lt;a href=\"Icemaw%20Matriarch\"&gt;Icemaw Matriarch&lt;/a&gt;. She warns you, though, that the cave has recently been overrun by &lt;a href=\"jormungar\"&gt;jormungar&lt;/a&gt;, and most of the wild bears have been killed.\nYou venture into the caverns. It's nice that Astrid offered you a bounty on the jormungar, as you can barely move without tripping over them. You slaughter your way in to the back of the cave and find one last, &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Icemaw%20Matriarch\"&gt;Icemaw Matriarch&lt;/a&gt;, albeit injured. You harness her up, and head out of there.\nAstrid admires your bear, but tells you that you need the skill to ride it, to make it an effective combatant. She directs you to a point in town where &lt;a href=\"Kirgaraak\"&gt;Kirgaraak&lt;/a&gt; is chained up. Kirgaraak is the largest yeti the Hildnyr have yet captured, and should provide you adequate practice.\nYou return to Astrid after beating up on the chained yeti, and she declares you ready to face opponents in the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Pit of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;. At this point in the Hyldsmeet, you have to defeat 6 other warbear riders, to advance to the next stage.\nThe Pit is an anarchic place, with Hyldnir attacking each other based seemingly on who they were close to. You find that your bear is indeed superior to most of the other bears in the pit, but your bear takes a lot of mauling before you have defeated the 6 opponents required.\nThe Hyldsmeet: the Drakkensryd.\n&lt;a href=\"Astrid%20Bjornrittar\"&gt;Astrid Bjornrittar&lt;/a&gt; congratulates you on your success, and offers to take care of your bear until you return, as you won't need her on the great Drakkensryd. ... assuming you survive the Drakkensryd, as that is a mortal challenge. Astrid tells you to set your affairs in order and say goodbye to your friends, as you will either succeed, or perish.\nYou think it wise to return to Lok'lira for any parting advice at this point. She is amazed at the speed of your progress. However, the Drakksryd is something that will require a little luck, as well as courage and skill. She attaches a strand of her hair to yours, saying \"you cannot fail now\". You wonder, for a moment, whether it is knowledge, or wishful thinking.\nYour next task is to go to &lt;a href=\"Gretta%20the%20Arbiter\"&gt;Gretta the Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; and declare your readiness to take part in the Drakkensryd. To win, you must defeat 10 &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet%20Drakerider\"&gt;Hyldsmeet Drakerider&lt;/a&gt;s in flight around the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. The winner lands at the temple and talks to &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou are handed a &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir%20Harpoon\"&gt;harpoon with a chain attached&lt;/a&gt;, and set off on a &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Hyldsmeet Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt;, possibly even one you'd freed earlier. The temple is perhaps the highest point on Azeroth, and a long way up even from the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. You join the swirling, jostling crowd of drake riders circling the peak, and set about to prove your dominance. One after another, you spear a competitor and use the harpoon's chain to swing to their mount, slaying them in hand-to-hand combat and tossing the body off only to spear another.\nAt long last, you have risen through the pack, and hook the harpoon around a decorative ornament and swing to the floor of the Temple itself. Now, to face thorim...\nThorim Stirs.\nInitially, Thorim mistakes you for &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;. He throws it off after a moment, though, and declares that he intends to avenge her. You entice him to tell you what befell Sif. In turn, you describe how &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; now controls &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. He rages some, then recalls his dispair of the time, and what he did. You remind him that he can still fight, and he enlists your help.\nFirst, he asks you to help him make amends to the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; by slaying the &lt;a href=\"fire%20giant\"&gt;fire giant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fjorn\"&gt;Fjorn&lt;/a&gt; and some of his &lt;a href=\"Stormforged%20Iron%20Giant\"&gt;iron giants&lt;/a&gt;, at an anvil east of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Niffelem\"&gt;Dun Niffelem&lt;/a&gt;. He provides you with a charm that summons Earthen to aid you against the giants in the area.\nIn the process of dispatching the giants, you find a sizable piece of . It looks interesting, but you would need something hot to work the slag off in order to find out what it is.\nOne of the nearby fire revenants unwittingly catches your attention. Soon, you've captured a fair number of the revenants, put the metal lump on Fjorn's anvil, and apply the revenants to burning off the slag.\nWhat is left by the revenants is a gleaming lump of . When cool, you examine it and discover one of Thorium's runes shining from beneath the surface. You return to Thorim with the mysterious ore and the news that Fjorn and his giants are dead.\nThorim tells you that the ore is what remains of his armor, cast off in grief at the loss of Sif. He asks you to take the metal to &lt;a href=\"King%20Jokkum\"&gt;King Jokkum&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Niffelem\"&gt;Dun Niffelem&lt;/a&gt;, and plead for the assistance of the Sons of Hodir in reforging the armor.\nKind Jokkum listens to your story and thanks you for having defeated Fjorn. While there are still some ill feelings between him and Thorium (you can't expect one good deed to erase years of bitterness), he will allow his smith, &lt;a href=\"Njormeld\"&gt;Njormeld&lt;/a&gt;, to reforge the armor.\nHowever, Njormeld was sent to recover Fjorn's Anvil, now entirely Fjorn-free. You need to meet him there.\nNjormeld agrees that it can be done once the anvil is back in Dun Niffelem. However, the &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Revenant\"&gt;Seething Revenant&lt;/a&gt;s you used to burn off the slag are still around, and Njormeld asks your help chasing them away to let the anvil cool enough to move. One of the older Ice giants of Dun Niffelem accompanied him to the anvil, and Njormeld thinks it would be a kindness for you to help him do the work.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Snorri\"&gt;Snorri&lt;/a&gt;'s help (and your guidance), a few well-aimed snowballs send the revenants packing. You give Njormeld the ore and your thanks, and promise to meet him back in Dun Niffelem, when he's done with the armor.\nUpon returning to Dun Niffelem, you find Njormeld at the anvil, now installed where he can use it safely. And better, he has the armor ready for you to take back to Thorim. And it's better than it was when new! Njormeld hopes that the armor will remind him of those better days when they stood together.\nYou return to Thorim, armor in hand, who is amazed at its beauty. He is grateful ... but there's more work to be done.\nWhen he set to brooding, he released his old riding drake, &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt;, back into the wild. He is hoping to recover her despite the odds. He comes up with a plan that will involved Veranus' old nest. She may be a broodmother in name only these days, but he hopes that he can perhaps lure her back to her nest with some eggs 'borrowed' from other nests.\nAnd for that, he needs you to go bring some back. The nests are all over, with nothing more than ravenous baby proto-dragons and the occasional watchful parent to worry about.\nA fair few drake-bites later, you return with the eggs. Thorim tells you where to find Veranus' nest, and positions himself for the capture. A bit nervously, you plant your cuckoo's eggs in Veranus' nest, and shortly the old drake herself shows up. Fortunately, your close air support (Thorim) arrives before Veranus can really get lined up on you. Thorim manages to calm her down (a little, anyway), but ... it's going to take more time. Thorim asks you to meet him back at the Temple of Storms.\nOne last task remains - recovering &lt;a href=\"Krolmir\"&gt;Thorim's hammer&lt;/a&gt;. In his rage, he had thrown it to the earth and walked away. It might have been destroyed, but King Jokkum would be the one who would know, if anyone does. Thorim asks you to return to the king and ask what he knows of it.\nYou return to Dun Niffelem and talk to King Jokkum. He tells you that while there is much left to be done, mending relations between Thorim and the Sons of Hodir, he can share with you the secret of Krolmir's fate. King Jokkum gives you a ride atop his helm (\"Hold on!\") to the &lt;a href=\"Thunderfall\"&gt;Thunderfall&lt;/a&gt;. There you behold a tableau of dwarves and giants frozen as they fought. King Jokkum reveals that &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;his father's&lt;/a&gt; last act was to cast a rune at Krolmir, freezing it in a block of ice, to keep it out of the hands of his foes. The king summons the hammer, and returns it to Thorim.\nConfronting Loken.\nThorim asks you to meet him on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Terrace of the Makers&lt;/a&gt;. It's a short flight from the Thunderfall.\nAt Thorim's side, the two of you view a field where &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dwarf\"&gt;Iron Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and sentinels battle &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;. Thorim asks you to take the and rally the earthen defenders against &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;'s forces.\nBut it's not just the foot soldiers that Thorim wants you to defeat. Loken has dispatched three of his more powerful lieutenants to guide his forces. Thorim asks you to defeat , a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20giant\"&gt;Stone giant&lt;/a&gt;, , an &lt;a href=\"Air%20revenant\"&gt;Air revenant&lt;/a&gt;, and , an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20golem\"&gt;Iron golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nNumerous times you have to rally the Earthen to the cause, but you defeat () the lieutenants, and large portions of the army invading the Terrace.\nFinally, Thorim requests you witness - but not participate in - his fight against Loken directly. You fly off to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Temple of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt;, and let Thorim know that you are there with him.\nThorim finds Loken seated at the Temple of Wisdom and &lt;a href=\"The%20Reckoning%20%28Storm%20Peaks%29%23Notes\"&gt;confronts him&lt;/a&gt;. Loken knows what the result of a \"fair fight\" would be, and disables both Thorim and &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt; by some strange magic. He then summons a pair of Runeforged Servants to carry them off.\nLoken turns to you, then, and describes how you were the key to Thorim's defeat - drawing Thorim from the center of his power to where Loken's influence could defeat him. ... how Loken himself, in the guise of &lt;a href=\"Lok%27lira%20the%20Crone\"&gt;Lok'lira the Crone&lt;/a&gt;, guided you every step of the way. As a last twist before he teleports away, he thanks you for your invaluable service, sparing your life.\nYou carry word of Thorim's defeat to . You might be furious at being used by Loken, but the king goes a step further. King Jokkum vows to rip him literally limb from limb, but he doesn't particularly care who actually does it; taking the battle to Loken and stopping his plans is more important. In order to do so, the King sends you to his emissary spearheading the attack, &lt;a href=\"Stormherald%20Eljrrin\"&gt;Stormherald Eljrrin&lt;/a&gt;, so that he'll have the assistance he needs. In Jokkum's stead, Eljrrin gives you the honor to earn both Jokkum's gratitude and the blessing of the Sons of Hodir by taking .\nThe &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; where Loken dwells also harbors &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt;, a giant even more formidable than &lt;a href=\"Fjorn\"&gt;Fjorn&lt;/a&gt;, and sworn to the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Niffelem\"&gt;Dun Niffelem&lt;/a&gt;. Stormherald Eljrrin charges you with defeating him, as well as &lt;a href=\"General%20Bjarngrim\"&gt;General Bjarngrim&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou gather friends, and venture into the Halls of Lightning. Many harrowing encounters later, you return with news of the defeat of the General, Volkhan, and Loken.\nRewards.\nYou will gain a good amount of experience (or a gold equivalent instead).\nFrom &lt;a href=\"The%20Reckoning%20%28Storm%20Peaks%29\"&gt;The Reckoning&lt;/a&gt;, you get one of:\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Diametrically%20Opposed\"&gt;Diametrically Opposed&lt;/a&gt;, you gain one of:\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Whatever%20it%20Takes%21\"&gt;Whatever it Takes!&lt;/a&gt;, you gain your choice of:\nYou also gain several other, albeit , items during the course of the chain.\nAs well, you will be with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuest progression.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;# &lt;a href=\"They%20Took%20Our%20Men%21\"&gt;They Took Our Men!&lt;/a&gt;"}

Giant wolves are &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; of exceptional size and strength. While they do not match the sheer power or ferocity of the Horde's dire wolves, they are certainly impressive and deadly creatures. Most giant wolves resemble normal wolves, but are about 7 and feet long and weigh some 450 pounds. \nThis beast might be mistaken for any wolf at a distance, but once it's seen up close, it becomes clear that the thing is huge. The largest are perhaps as long as 20 feet from its thick snout to its curled tail, and weigh 5000 pounds, with dark gray and black fur. They do not share the shyness of humans of their smaller kin, which makes them naturally dangerous. Some giant wolves are used by orcs as mounts, though they are often difficult to train. Giant wolf packs will track prey at a distance during the day, resting frequently, and then close in just after twilight. They howl much like their brethren, but the deep, almost bass rumbling of giant wolves is clearly different. Much like &lt;a href=\"timber%20wolf\"&gt;timber wolves&lt;/a&gt;, giant wolves are skilled pack hunters. They do not have the same speed and maneuverability, however, and often hunt like great cats. Two members will startle prey, howling and pressing it into the rest of the pack. Giant wolves are crafty and will avoid armed humans. They are less apt to break and run than wolves, but serious injury will turn them. Giant wolves fight much like their smaller cousins, only on a larger scale."}

He is one of the two main protagonists of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands%20storyline\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands storyline&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCataclysm.\nGidwin aspires to become a member of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; along with his friend/rival &lt;a href=\"Tarenar%20Sunstrike\"&gt;Tarenar Sunstrike&lt;/a&gt;. Gidwin is usually in the back of the caravan as Tarenar usually takes the front seat and teases him for being short. Despite this the two, with the help from an adventurer, are able to pass a series of tests and become members of the Argent Crusade.\nSometimes afterwards he becomes restless which leads him to rush off to fight the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. At some point during his fight against the undead he was captured by scourge who, under &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Anastari\"&gt;Baroness Anastari&lt;/a&gt;, plan to turn him into a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. While chained down in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;Plaguewood&lt;/a&gt; Fiona and her companions (as the player is part of her companions) save him. He then thanks everyone, giving the player a &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; (which has only one use), saying he will return with Fiona's caravan, this time in the front seat.\nGidwin is also one of the dozens of past NPC's encountered by adventurers to assist in killing the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nGidwin accompanied Fiona and Tarenar to with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forward party. Tarenar and Gidwin left to go &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, but were attacked by the native &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;; luckily, the local &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; arrived to aid them, and Tarenar carried Gidwin back to the caravan to recuperate. Gidwin was poisoned during the attack, but adventurers succeed in brewing the herbs and other oddities necessary to save his life.\nLegion.\nTarenar and Gidwin joined the reborn &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe is later seen in &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war, Tarenar and Gidwin were traveling the world and conducted a drinking tour of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; capital cities, including &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nGidwin and Tarenar accompanied Fiona once more and are found at the &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Basecamp\"&gt;Expedition Basecamp&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nTarenar will probably skip over our grand adventure to talk about the Legion invasion if you ask him what we've been up to.\nYou know, we spent a lot of time at Light's Hope, but it was so jarring to see after fightin' demons all day long! I think that's part of why we took time off. We have a chance to get back to our roots and travel with Fiona and the others again.\nDon't think I won't find myself a fight to get into while we're here, though!

{"id": "518163", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=518163", "title": "Gilded Market", "text": "The Gilded Market is a public square in the Noble District of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. It can be found in the city's northeastern section, and is the first area encountered upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; and Noble Districts of the city. The market primarily consists of an open square surrounded by numerous houses and other structures.\nLying in the district of the city inhabited almost exclusively by Suramar's ruling elite, the Gilded Market is presumably mostly off limits for those who are not either of the aristocracy (or their servants), or members of the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; which maintains the status quo in the city. The market is accessed from the &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam%20Causeway\"&gt;Moonbeam Causeway&lt;/a&gt; to the west and further leads onto the &lt;a href=\"Moonlit%20Landing\"&gt;Moonlit Landing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Court\"&gt;Midnight Court&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nThe Gilded Market's strong association with the city's ruling powers would make it a target of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen insurgent faction&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;the civil war&lt;/a&gt; which raged across Suramar with the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, security within the market and the entire district was particularly heavy for the duration of the conflict.\nHistory.\nThe Gilded Market sits at the westernmost side of the &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; and Noble District, and has thus traditionally been inhabited by the upper classes, who hold political power within &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; society. Almost all of nightborne noble families make their home in the eastern districts of the city, and as such the area tends to be highly developed and affluently designed. &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Captain%20Gerdo\"&gt;Patrol Captain Gerdo&lt;/a&gt; appears to have primarily been in charge of &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; security in and around the Gilded Market area.\nWith the onset of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar's arcane shield was lowered and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was granted access to the city. Those who resisted this decision ultimately became the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; and would begin &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;a civil war&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to expel the demons and depose &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. The nightborne aristocracy almost as a whole opposed the rebels, and the city's eastern districts became a powerful bastion for loyalists to the regime.\nMany nightborne nobles saw the Legion's coming as a great opportunity, and fully embraced the ways of &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;fel magic&lt;/a&gt;. These &lt;a href=\"felborne\"&gt;felborne&lt;/a&gt;, now totally corrupted by their newfound power, largely frequented the Gilded Market and the surrounding districts. The presence of such support for Elisande and the Legion made the Gilded Market a target for the Nightfallen rebels, though it was often too secure to attack directly, heavily garrisoned as it was by &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, demons, and felborne.\nRelatively early in the rebellion, Nightfallen agents succeeded in releasing a captive &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Su%27esh\"&gt;Su'esh&lt;/a&gt; from its habitat in the &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20%28Suramar%29\"&gt;Menagerie&lt;/a&gt;, after which it caused havoc and heavy casualties as it proceeded to rampage through the Gilded Market and Noble District. This was known to have occurred on more than one occasion.\nOn the night of a large banquet held in the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Estate\"&gt;Jeweled Estate&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; in which Elisande herself would be in attendance, The Nightfallen managed to smuggle a group of disguised operatives into the Noble District in order to infiltrate the party and potentially eliminate the Grand Magistrix. The group eventually confronted &lt;a href=\"Patrol%20Captain%20Gerdo\"&gt;Patrol Captain Gerdo&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; guards as they attempted to pass through the Gilded Market. After an ensuing battle, the infiltrators succeeded in overpowering and slaying Gerdo, and continued on toward the Jeweled Estate and the main party, though they would ultimately not be successful in their main objective.\nAt the time of the rebellion, at least one major noble house in the form of &lt;a href=\"House%20Astravar\"&gt;House Astravar&lt;/a&gt; had its residence on the square. Headed by &lt;a href=\"Aurore\"&gt;Lady Aurore&lt;/a&gt;, the Astravars' mansion was the largest building in the Gilded Market. This additionally gave the locale a certain added political importance. As the insurrection developed, a position opened on the Grand Magistrix's inner council, and many prominent members of the nobility scrambled for the post. House Astravar was inclined to back &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lady Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt; (secretly aligned with the rebellion) and Aurore Astravar was approached by agents of the Nightfallen on Ly'leth's behalf to secure her support.\nAfter the rebel agents helped rescue Aurore's son, &lt;a href=\"Ailen\"&gt;Ailen&lt;/a&gt;, from the clutches of the rival &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%23Noble%20Houses%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;House Stelleris&lt;/a&gt; and returning him to the Astravar mansion in the Gilded Market, Aurore pledged the full support of her family to Ly'leth's bid, which she would eventually go on to win."}

They were first introduced into the game with the \"\" expansion and can mainly be found in the deep sea in areas like &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, though other groups have invaded the coasts of the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; as well.\n&lt;a href=\"King%20Gurboggle\"&gt;King Gurboggle&lt;/a&gt; is the self-proclaimed king of at least &lt;a href=\"Gurboggle%27s%20Ledge\"&gt;Gurboggle's Ledge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nGilgoblins have many similarities to goblins but also many differences. Their skin is blue or red with tiny dots. They possess gills on their necks, allowing them to breathe underwater. Gilgoblins have fins on the ends of their arms, with webbed hands and feet for swimming. Their ears resemble fins and their hair is a dark blue color. Their skin is also adorned with inky tattoos.\nThe adaptations that allow gilgoblins to survive the aquatic life has apparently drained some of their higher brain functions. and both note that the gilgoblins are quite primitive, and that they seem intensely curious about their advanced equipment, sometimes suicidally so. The gilgoblins of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; hold the &lt;a href=\"naga%20sea%20witch\"&gt;naga sea witch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20La-La\"&gt;Lady La-La&lt;/a&gt; in high regard. Most gilgoblins speak with broken grammar, but the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; speak fluently.\nGilgoblins live in big clams and caves, which they decorate with their new-found treasure, including cannons, cannonballs and other things.\nThe gilblins in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; will occasionally refer to a \"great kraken\" when attacked. The identity of this creature and its role in their culture (what little of it there is) is unknown, though it may be &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt;.\nA group of kelfin are the bulk of the faction named the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;. They are starkly contrasted to the rest of their brethren, showing great intelligence like their land-based counterparts and have a strong sense of community. Unlike the goblins of the land, they are extremely altruistic and selfless, living communally and looking out for one another; though this may have been a result of their former enslavement under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The Unshackled have befriended &lt;a href=\"Gral\"&gt;Gral&lt;/a&gt;, a shark &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;."}

Chaos reigned supreme as the ground shook with the approach of these gruesome machines. Walls and buildings proved no barrier to the devastation of the orcish catapult. Although they were sluggish and huge, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; forces would prove unstoppable when commanding these devices.\nSharpened horns, crimson with blood of those unfortunate enough to be caught in their path, heralded the advance of the orcish Catapult. Approaching on the battlefield, its grim visage was enough to make the weak &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; troops flee in stark terror. These cumbersome, wheeled machines launched deadly incendiary shot which exploded upon impact. The sheer destructive force of these great engines of war made them feared and respected throughout the land.\nThe orcish catapult has always been a standing asset to the Horde. Capable of hurling fiery projectiles over great distances, the catapults have been the doom of many Alliance regiments. Catapults served as the Horde's greatest siege weapon until the advent of the &lt;a href=\"demolisher\"&gt;demolisher&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany destroyed orc catapults from the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; can be seen all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, one of them even being exhibited in the &lt;a href=\"Library%20%28Ironforge%29%23Museum\"&gt;Ironforge museum&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Rageroar%20clan\"&gt;Rageroar clan&lt;/a&gt; still makes use of the war machines. Catapults were also used at the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Front\"&gt;Forsaken Front&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder lady &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; leadership, orcish technology advanced to an extreme in which their newly built catapults became weapons of mass destruction. As seen during the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a few dozen of them were able to fire from hundreds of miles away in the coast of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, and burn down &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; the size of an island, in mere hours.\nForsaken catapults.\nCatapults are used both as &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;-spreaders and &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nHuman catapults.\nThe catapult brought fiery death to all who stood in its way. Capable of destroying any target in its range, the projectile from a catapult could smash the toughest of defenses, or through the sides of buildings. This behemoth was large, slow, and difficult to maneuver, but the power that it held made it an essential part of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; forces during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the First War, humans favored the &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt; instead which was a joint collaboration of the Alliance forces.\nDwarven catapults.\nDespite the many technological advances of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, like the &lt;a href=\"siege%20tank\"&gt;siege tank&lt;/a&gt;s, some catapults are still used by the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nCatapults and &lt;a href=\"trebuchet\"&gt;trebuchet&lt;/a&gt;s use a lever arm to hurl a projectile in an arcing ballistic trajectory toward their target, yet that simple mechanism is employed in many different manners on the battlefield.\nSpring catapults.\nA spring catapult lacks the axle used by many similar weapons and instead uses a windlass and pulley system to draw back its flexible lever arm. Once a projectile is mounted in the sling at the end of the arm, the arm is released to hurl the projectile at the target. Spring catapults are easy to construct and are often built from scratch by tinkers and engineers on the battlefield.\nTorsion catapults.\nThe lever arm of a torsion catapult is mounted in an axle made of a twisted skein of leather or sinew. Once winched back into place, the basket on the end of the lever arm is loaded with a projectile that can be fired downrange.\nSiege catapults.\nA larger version of the torsion catapult, the siege catapult is made to hurl large payloads far behind the enemy's front lines.\nToy catapults.\nOriginally intended as a mass-produced siege weapon that could be carried in a soldier\u2019s backpack, these catapults can be reduced to the size of a child\u2019s toy upon command. Unfortunately, they proved too fragile and expensive to truly catch on. One orcish army drained its entire treasury to create a kind of \u201ccatapult cavalry\u201d unit equipped with these tiny weapons, only to lose the whole unit (and their weapons) in a single ambush. Unaware of their true powers, the victorious opponents took the \u201ctoys\u201d home to their children. No one is sure how many of these items are now scattered around the world, gathering dust on a child\u2019s bedroom shelf. This is a shrinking spike stone siege catapult that effectively has the shrinking property twice. The siege weapon can be made to shrink to approximately a foot in size, enabling it to be easily packed away with its commander\u2019s gear."}

Once a peaceful place of worship, corruption has turned protector into poisoner, with Mephistroth at the helm - and the powerful dreadlord has one aim: to annihilate those who seek to return the Aegis of Aggramar to its resting place.\"\n\"For Mephistroth, your attempt to infiltrate the Cathedral of Eternal Night is a deeply personal matter. The warlocks among you killed his favored general, &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt;, stringing up his corpse and heart in your Order Hall as both a warning and source of power. As for the rest of you, Mephistroth is seeking retribution for your recent brutal attacks on the Broken Shore. The memories are fresh. And revenge is sweet.\"\nBackground.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The upper chambers of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; were once a place of worship to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, fel minions have desecrated this holy place, twisting it into their own image. Now, this site will host a battle that could turn the tide of the invasion. While the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; engage the fel army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the cathedral in a desperate hope to return the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to its resting place.\"\nDeveloper insights.\n\"We're excited to add a new 5-player dungeon to complement the Broken Shore zone and - ultimately - the Tomb of Sargeras raid. Players' ultimate purpose on the Broken Shore is the culmination of all their efforts thus far in \"Legion\": Each of the five Pillars of Creation must be used in a particular place within the Tomb of Sargeras to halt the Legion's invasion and save Azeroth - and the dungeon tells the first part of that story.\"\n\"While the raid delves deep into the foundations of the Tomb, revealing mysteries and varied horrors, this dungeon ascends the spire, focusing on the dark majesty of a tarnished monument to the glory of the goddess Elune. Entering atop a balcony overlooking the grand central hall of the Cathedral (a room that will later serve as the setting for the first boss encounter in the raid), players begin a climb that will take them past moonlit hanging gardens, towards the pinnacle of the tower where the Aegis must be placed. While the dungeon is, of course, rife with Legion presence, we deliberately focused the areas of fel contamination around the portions of the structure closest to the source of fel storm. This amplifies the contrast and allows us to showcase large sections of untarnished elven architecture.\""}

The archbishop himself used to reside within the hallowed chambers.\n&lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s travel to the cathedral from far and wide seeking training and wisdom from their resident counterparts, training their skills and researching great truths behind the walls of the Cathedral. &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Laurena\"&gt;High Priestess Laurena&lt;/a&gt; is the highest-ranking priest trainer in Stormwind City, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; is one of the foremost human paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the chief paladin in Stormwind, and &lt;a href=\"Duthorian%20Rall\"&gt;Duthorian Rall&lt;/a&gt; is one of Stormwind City's most influential paladins.\nWhile not barred from the edifice, &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; are not welcomed warmly here.

After the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the building was first to be rebuilt and housed the refugees in the initial stages of city's reconstruction. The construction of the &lt;a href=\"church\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; was overseen by then-&lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;bishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; and his then-mentor, Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was here that the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; became a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the Silver Hand.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of the clergy in Lordaeron, the Church of Light reformed itself under the leadership of Archbishop Benedictus and his &lt;a href=\"Bishop\"&gt;bishops&lt;/a&gt;, while the Cathedral serves as the main spiritual hub for the Church of Light as well as for Stormwind, humanity, and the new Alliance.\nIn the years that followed, the promising priests were sent here to meet &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Laurena\"&gt;High Priestess Laurena&lt;/a&gt;, as they had caught the attention of senior members of the Church of Light with their dedication, and were worthy to continue their training. While the promising young &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; were sent here to continue their training by studying the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Divinity%20%28starter%29\"&gt;Tome of Divinity (starter)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Valor%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tome of Valor (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, but also to be sent on missions against the enemies of the kingdom that were the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the request of Archbishop Benedictus, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Karl%20Philips\"&gt;Commander Karl Philips&lt;/a&gt; ordered his soldiers to collect the hearts of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, in order to grant them swift and permanent deaths by bringing their hearths at the Cathedral of Light to be ceremoniously incinerated in the flames of the Light, and thus saving their souls.\nCataclysm era.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and her companion &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; visited the Cathedral, where the young &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; read books on the Light and the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt; that worship it. During the events of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the part of the steps was damaged. Shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the cathedral housed a ceremony for the fallen in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; led by Archbishop Benedictus.\nDuring the Cataclysm, cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; tried to blow up the cathedral so disillusioned peasants would flock toward their religion, but they were stopped by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; brought the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; to the Cathedral in order to meet &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, the last living member of the first Silver Hand paladins. Their reunion was initially tense, but upon sensing the Light within the undead, Turalyon accepted his former mentor.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the cathedral and its catacombs were filled to overflowing with the refugees from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Following the fall of Teldrassil, &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Refugee\"&gt;Wounded Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt; were found here.

In the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the Cathedral of Light was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and from which &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner%20%28Vision%20of%20Stormwind%29\"&gt;corrupted version of Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her followers of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; orchestrated the downfall of Stormwind. When the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; arrived, the corrupted Alleria killed &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; in front of the cathedral when he tried to reason with her, and later consumed her son &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; into a void portal before being ultimately defeated to end the vision.\nShadows Rising.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; transported bodies of Alliance soldiers into the catacombs of the Cathedral. Anduin, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; arrived there to inspect the bodies.

A grand structure with many wings and spires, the Cathedral houses Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Benedictus\"&gt;Benedictus&lt;/a&gt;, the bishop of Stormwind City, and various other priests. It also contains the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Chamber\"&gt;Grand Chamber&lt;/a&gt;, a vast meeting room where the council of bishops meets with the archbishop to discuss issues and plot the Church's actions. Every night at sunset, the Cathedral of Light rings a solitary bell whose sweet pitch reaches the entire city.\nFilm universe.\nThe Cathedral of Light is depicted close to its \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnation. It is where the funeral for &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; is held after his death."}

The created cauldron is placed in the alchemist's inventory much like a repair bot from &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, it can be used in the future at any time. When Cauldrons are used, a ground object is created that can be clicked on by members of a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; to receive a corresponding &lt;a href=\"potion\"&gt;potion&lt;/a&gt;. Cauldron recipes can only be obtained through alchemy &lt;a href=\"discoveries\"&gt;discoveries&lt;/a&gt; and currently only create Major Protection potions for the various magical &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;s (excluding Holy).\nFor Cataclysm Guild Cauldrons, see &lt;a href=\"Cauldron%20of%20Battle\"&gt;Cauldron of Battle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Cauldron%20of%20Battle\"&gt;Big Cauldron of Battle&lt;/a&gt;.\nList of Cauldrons.\nWhen you create a cauldron, the cauldron will appear in your bags. To use just right click on it; the cauldron will appear on the ground before you. The cauldron will last five minutes before disappearing. It has up to 25 potions in it, although each person in your raid or group can only get one (1) potion from the cauldron, even the person who made it. This means it is more cost-effective to make five single potions for a group of five people, rather than a cauldron. (See the recipes below.) Also you are not able to make the cauldron and collect all 25 potions by yourself to sell.\nPotions received from cauldrons are conjured items. They will disappear if the player is logged out for more than 15 minutes, similar to conjured &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt;. Potions created from a Cauldron have two additional limitations: &lt;a href=\"Unique\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;. This means you cannot trade or sell the potions.\nOutland Cauldron Recipes.\nAll cauldrons currently use similar reagents: 7x , 1x , and 2 of a corresponding Primal item (e.g., 2x for , or 2x for ). The ingredients for a Cauldron (with 25 uses) are comparable to making 10 ordinary Major Protection potions.\nCataclysm Cauldrons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cauldron%20of%20Battle\"&gt;Cauldron of Battle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Big%20Cauldron%20of%20Battle\"&gt;Big Cauldron of Battle&lt;/a&gt; recipes are purchased from a &lt;a href=\"Guild%20vendor\"&gt;Guild vendor&lt;/a&gt; once the guild has achieved &lt;a href=\"Mix%20Master\"&gt;Mix Master&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Better%20Leveling%20Through%20Chemistry\"&gt;Better Leveling Through Chemistry&lt;/a&gt; (respectively),\nModifiers.\nThe duration of the buff provided by a &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Battle\"&gt;Flask of Battle&lt;/a&gt; is affected by the &lt;a href=\"Guild%20Perk\"&gt;Guild Perk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chug-A-Lug\"&gt;Chug-A-Lug&lt;/a&gt;.
