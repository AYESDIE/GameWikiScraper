The format also has a human-readable textual representation whose file format ends in MDL. Several converters exist to convert between the two formats. \nConverters.\nThis is a list of known converters to convert to and from the MDX formats.\nRegarding the 3D model format:\nEditors.\nThis is a list of known editors for manipulating the MDX files.\nCode syntax.\nAll code samples below will be given in a C/C++ like pseudo-code.

The following notations are used to describe this.\nA few special fields exist which has specific meanings.\nOther notations.\nDatatypes.\nIn the code below various datatypes are used. This is a table describing these datatypes.\nGeneral structure.\nAll models have a tree hierarchy of components or chunks. Many components lie directly under the root while others are subcomponents. The contents vary from type to type though most of them have the same kind of header as shown below.\n struct Chunk\n UINT32 Tag;\n UINT32 ChunkSize;\n ...\nEach chunk begins with two 32-bit unsigned integers. The first is a tag describing the type. It is constructed as a sequence of four 8-bit characters giving them a descriptive ID if viewed in a hex editor (or Notepad). The second integer tells the size of the chunk. This size does not include the tag and size itself; it includes only the following contents. The ChunkSize is useful for determining the number of subcomponents. It is useful for skipping whole chunks in the writing of a non-complete MDX loader, in which case the tag and size are read and then that many bytes are skipped to start reading the next chunk.\nSome structures have IDs to refer to other objects. These are 0-based indexes, referring to the object in the order in which they appear in the file. The special value 0xFFFFFFFF (or -1 in signed format) represents \"No ID\", or in some cases \"Many IDs\". In the latter case, the reference has to be made in some other way, usually from the other object."}

{"id": "295409", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=295409", "title": "MMORAS", "text": "The system is designed to produce a Raid Average Score which is added to your roll. The Raid Average Score is not points but a percentage. You do not spend your Raid Average Score; it goes up and down based on attendance.\nOver the past four months a team has been working on a new system of raiding. About a month ago we got the opinions of many wow players who provided opinions regarding the system. MMORAS is now automated using raid tracker and calendar extras which provide the information. Below is information which is provided on the website; if you have any further questions feel free to visit our forums or contact me directly using contact us on the offical website.\nMod's used by MMORAS.\nMMORAS utilizes two mods created for World of Warcraft allowing the Guild Master to upload the information about raids. Raid Tracker is used for all information regarding the raid such as raid attendance, loot and raid ID's. CalendarExtras is used to gather event information for a guild. The Calendar file is optional, if no file is provided the system will still add the raid appropriately. See the MMORAS site for the best ways to configure and use these mods\nTutorials.\nUnderstanding of what tools exist and how to use them is important for your guilds success when using MMORAS. The below tutorials cover the standard user area and the administrative panel to help you and your guild better navigate and utilize the features MMORAS provides. Its suggested you read though these tutorials when starting your new account; this will allow you to have knowledge of all the features we can offer you. Navigating over to 'How it Works' can also aid you to better understand how the calculations are done in the background. This understanding will help your guild know when to use some of the more advanced features within the MMORAS system, such as alternative characters or vacation time. \nGuild Portal.\nThe following tutorial covers Your Guilds RAS, A Characters Overview, A Guilds Raids, A Raid's Overview and Guild Statistics.\nAdmin Panel.\nThe following tutorial covers Admin Home, Armory Update, Manage Members, Edit Member, Manage Alternative Characters, Add Raid, Manage Raids, Edit Raid, Guild Log,Guild Settings and MMORAS Settings. \nHow it Works.\nMany people may find this new system confusing at first so lets outline the system in a very vague way. By doing this I hope you can use this knowledge within your own scenarios. Below are some terminology used on our table headers within the main guild portal. :\n\"Percent Attended:\" This calculates the total raids attended since the members joined. This takes into account if a member has alternative characters also. Alternative characters can be assigned within the administrative panel. A character is considered attended if they signed up and are online when the raid begins or attend the raid.\n\"Late Percent:\" This calculates the total raids late since the members joined. This also takes into account if a member has alternative characters. The late percent is used in the calculation but in a special way. Members are deducted RAS for being late but the weight of that deduction depends on the guild masters decision. A character is considered late if they signed up and are late to the raid. This is up the guild leaders to decide how late is acceptable before they count it as a no show.\n\"Late Weight:\" This is set by the guild master, and allows the guild to customize how important it is to show up on time. You can set the value from 0 to 50. As an example if a player was late 100% of the time and the late multiplier was set to 50 then we would have 100*0.50=50. Therefore the player would suffer a 50 RAS reduction. By default the weight is set to 20. \n\"No Show Percentage:\" This calculates the total raids no shown since the members joined. This also takes into account if a member has alternative characters. A character is considered a no show if they signed up and do not sign on for the raid. \n\"Note: No show and late penalties may seem harsh but when someone signs up to a raid they give their commitment to the other guild members. If they do not show up they could cause confusion and anger among your fellow guild members who are waiting. Being on prompt is as important in the gaming world as it is in the real world.\"\n\"Adjustments:\" An adjustment can be positive or negative. A guild master can set an adjustment for each member if he/she feels they deserve that adjustment. By default a member is considered a recruit until they have run 5 raids. Within this time their RAS is halved and this is displayed in the adjustments field.\n\"Alternative Characters:\" A guild leader can assign alternative characters to members of the guild. Any raids that the alternative character attends will be count towards the main and vise versa. This works very similar to a group.\n\"Vacation Time:\" I thought I would mention this. A guild leader has the ability to apply vacation time to a member. Within this time there RAS score will not be affected by events that occur. This feature is key for those who have jobs who take them away often, or family occasions. \n\"Exempted Raids:\" An exempted raid is a raid which is not required. That being said if you attend a exempted raid you will gain point but if you do not attend an exempted raid you will not be deducted attendance. Exempted raids are considered non progression runs to gear people or to have fun, and those who are willing to help their fellow guildies should be rewarded.\nFAQ.\nRaid Average Score\nRAS is a system which is designed around potential fairness. It rewards being ontime and going to raids while punishing being late and not showing up when signing up. If a player has participated in exempted raids then they are counted but if they have not those raids are not held against the player. Keeping the roll factor is key, it gives everyone a chance and keep players coming back to raids even if they don't have the highest RAS (But a higher RAS will certainly help you). I am always open to new mathematical decisions on this formula so please message me if you find a flaw.\nNo, there is a system built into the control panel. The guild leader and officers can decide how many raids is acceptable before a members RAS is no longer halved.\nThe late multiplier is set by the guild leader or officers. This allows the guild to decide how important people being on time is. This could range from 0% to 50% depending how important this is to your guild. Each RAS system is very unique based of the guilds who use them. Use the system you want to!\nThat is the intent, you are of course free to choose not to include rolls but I feel it is better for raids as well as better for raid attendance in more casual guilds.\nMMORAS has the ablity to associate a main with an alt. If it sees your alt has been in a raid then your main is affected and gains the attendance\nThis could be due to multiple factors. You could not have completed your trial period and thus have your RAS halfed. The Guild could have also decided that you deserved an adjustment, this could be a positive or negative adjustment.\nThe intent is 100.\nNo, RAS can never drop below 0. This does not mean that once you hit 0 you can easily start making back up, it mearly means only your roll matters until you can get out of the negatives.\nA raid exemption is meant for older raids. These raids help the people who attended but do not punish those who did not show up. An example could be if you were to run an older instance to help a new guildy gear out. \nIf a character goes on vacation or has to be away due to injury the RAS system acounts for that. You will not be punished during this period, make sure you inform your officers so they can add your vacation period.\nWe run Apache 2 and mySQL. Supported by Justin Masse and Rob Landry. We are constantly working on improving the overall system and performance.\nI created the system because I was a bit tired of DKP. I wanted a more fair system which would still reward the more hardcore players.\nExternal Links.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mmoras.com\"&gt;MMORAS Offical Website&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "563892", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=563892", "title": "MOTHER", "text": "MOTHER (Matron of Tenacity, Herald of Endless Research) is a &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; with special responsibility for the research facility of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, whose main function is to carry out experiments on &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; samples. To fulfill this role, MOTHER was imbued by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge, especially any kind which might resolve the Old God threat.\nEventually, Uldir itself would become compromised and contaminated through the influence of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, throwing the facility into chaos. Despite the corruption, MOTHER's protocols remained intact, and she aided &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal champions&lt;/a&gt; in pushing through Uldir to ultimately vanquish G'huun.\nContinuing her work there for a short time after this victory, the watcher later moved to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, to apply her skills in healing damage done to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. She can cleanse corrupted items with &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20Purification\"&gt;Titanic Purification&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThousands of years ago, the facility of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; was created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; in what would become the region of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. The reasoning behind Uldir's construction lay with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;, powerful beings who threatened the very existence of life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To find effective ways of neutralizing the danger, extensive research and experimentation would be carried out at the site, with the Matron of Tenacity, Herald of Endless Research (M.O.T.H.E.R) serving as the &lt;a href=\"titan%20watcher\"&gt;titan watcher&lt;/a&gt; overseeing this work.\nIn spite of the titans' highest hopes, however, the work of Uldir would not only prove futile, but disastrous. The experiments conducted by MOTHER and the other operators of the facility accidentally spawned a new Old God altogether, known as &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;. G'huun's nearly limitless capacity to spread corruption meant that all of Uldir had to be permanently quarantined from the outside world along with MOTHER, while &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20seal\"&gt;powerful seals&lt;/a&gt; held the prison shut.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIt wasn't until the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; that Uldir would once again be opened, releasing the threat contained inside. As the seals located around Zandalar were broken, G'huun's corruption coursed through the facility and spread to the outside. Almost all of Uldir's defenses and fail-safes were ultimately overcome by this infection, with only MOTHER remaining active in fighting the spread inside. Indeed, only MOTHER's efforts to slow down G'huun's corruption prevented the total fall of Uldir.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal champions&lt;/a&gt; eventually entered the ruins with the intention of ending G'huun, MOTHER determined that the invaders were contaminated, and thus a threat. As such, she engaged the heroes in battle, only pausing when she was bested by their combined might. With this defeat, MOTHER began to aid the mortals in their progress through the titan facility and provided them the information required to permanently destroy the Old God. This was achieved when Uldir's reorigination drive was activated to purge G'huun within the &lt;a href=\"Festering%20Core\"&gt;Festering Core&lt;/a&gt;, thus ending the immediate threat to Uldir and the rest of the planet.\nAfter G'huun's defeat, MOTHER remained within Uldir and continued her efforts to remove the last of the Old God's influence from the facility. When &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; set out to find further ways of healing &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth's world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, wounded by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, they ventured to Uldir to make contact with MOTHER herself. Upon doing so, her protocols determined that she should move to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; to better asses the situation. After dealing with some lingering corruption present in Uldir's &lt;a href=\"Waygate%23Titan%20waygates\"&gt;titan waygate&lt;/a&gt;, the party activated its &lt;a href=\"Waygate%20Console\"&gt;consoles&lt;/a&gt; to transport them to the heart chamber. Despite this success, MOTHER would require some amount of time to analyze the condition of the world-soul and formulate a plan to heal it.\nWhen MOTHER finally finished her calculations, Magni called once again for heroes to journey to the Chamber of Heart in order to make the Heart of Azeroth stronger. After heroes completed MOTHER's mission and worked with &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt;, they obtained the &lt;a href=\"%3APetrified%20Ebony%20Scale\"&gt;:Petrified Ebony Scale&lt;/a&gt; which they used to empower the Heart of Azeroth. Magni welcomed Ebonhorn to the Chamber and employed heroes to discover more essences to further strengthen the Heart of Azeroth.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed, Ebonhorn nearly succumbed to its whispers and would have been killed by MOTHER without Magni's intervention. Seeking to save Ebonhorn, Magni called on heroes to return to the Chamber. Under the advice of &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, the hero sought out &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; in order to save Ebonhorn. Though unable to meet with Wrathion, the hero did acquire a potion of his creation that they used to save Ebonhorn. While recognizing that Wrathion didn't want to be found, Magni knew that knowledge he acquired could be critical in the fight against N'Zoth. Thus knowing that there weren't many places to hide from Azeroth's own speaker, Magni was confident that he would be able to track down the Black Prince.\nAfter MOTHER determined the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; could be used to restore the power of the Forge of Origination, Magni called upon his ally to join him in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Having heard that the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; were still abandoned, Magni thought the task would be rather easy only to discover that the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; were fighting at the vaults. The dying mogu warrior &lt;a href=\"Tsuo\"&gt;Tsuo&lt;/a&gt; implored the Speaker and Azeroth's champion in seeking out his &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt; who they discovered to be mogu who answered to &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt;. After restoring Ra-den's hopes that the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; could be beaten, Ra revealed that the Engine of Nalak'sha could be reached through the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the champions to reactivate the structure. Thus, Magni and his ally ventured into the vaults only to be caught off guard by the presence of the mantid. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Yox%27ith\"&gt;Yox'ith&lt;/a&gt;, a Manifestation of N'Zoth, Magni was able to have MOTHER use the Engine of Nalak'sha to successfully re-power the Forge of Origination. Magni, Ra, and the Champion then journeyed together to the Chamber of Heart where Magni revealed that they could end the threat of N'Zoth with the Forge of Origination.\nSoon after, Magni discovered that an anomaly existed within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt; and set off to investigate, discovering that &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was seeking to gain control of the forge. In order to help better combat N'Zoth, Wrathion and the champion sought an object of pure corruption, a task that ended with Azeroth's champion acquiring &lt;a href=\"%3AAshjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;:Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve&lt;/a&gt;. After a &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20N%27Zoth%23Horrific%20Visions\"&gt;Horrific Vision&lt;/a&gt; was defeated per Wrathion's request, Magni was stunned to hear N'Zoth's within the Chamber of Heart. Subsequently, the Old God attacked the chamber, opening a portal to &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; and releasing its forces into the facility. MOTHER fought against the Old God's minions alongside the other defenders of the chamber, but once it became clear that N'Zoth was about to overtake the facility, Ra turned to the adventurer and told them to save Azeroth, no matter the cost. The Highkeeper then charged at the portal to Ny'alotha and used a lightning attack to destroy it but was pulled into the realm in the process. According to Magni, the Chamber of Heart and all of Azeroth would've been N'Zoth's for the taking had it not been for Ra's sacrifice.\nDetermined to save Ra and end of the threat of N'Zoth, Magni called for Azeroth's Champions to venture into &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt;. Though Ra would be &lt;a href=\"Ra-den%20the%20Despoiled\"&gt;confronted and killed&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth's champions were successful in ending the threat of N'Zoth.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nGreetings.\nChamber of Heart facility has been rehabilitated. Now functioning within operational parameters."}

The frost dwarves nursed her back to health, and she learned their ways. After she'd spent a full year and a half with them, she told them she finally had the strength to return to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and face her family. She told them the chronicle of her brother's life, so they would know him too. Then, the Frostborn gave her a gift: a mace, forged from the broken pieces of the axe she'd had with her and that she had broken in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; fighting &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. She followed their tradition and named the mace after the person she carried it for: &lt;a href=\"Mithrios%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mithrios Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt;, her lost brother. Mithrios then stayed in the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; for years to come until it ended up with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, who used it in many conflicts, but he apparently lost it in Northrend.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the weapon was found by a &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt; patrol after a skirmish with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. The frost dwarves discovered runes on it that linked the weapon to the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and to the ancestors of Muradin. As the Frostborn were repairing the weapon, King &lt;a href=\"Velog%20Icebellow\"&gt;Velog Icebellow&lt;/a&gt; wrote to his old friend to come to visit them and tell the story of the weapon. Muradin, however, had no idea what weapon Velog was referring to, so he called his brothers, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;, to come with him.\nWhen Muradin and his brothers arrived to Frosthold, Velog showed Muradin the mace. He immediately recognized it and thought it gone forever. Velog showed Muradin how to find the oldest runes, and the Bronzebeard thane took it back with him, and added new runes onto it.\nDescription.\nBronzebeards left their own marks on Mithrios, etching runes into the weapon's metal head:"}

Indeed, had &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; blown the horns and called for all of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"ymirjar\"&gt;ymirjar&lt;/a&gt; and mjordin alike, the vrykul would've become a force more powerful than any other within the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. This action would've organized the vrykul nation.\nThe exact relation between the Mjordin and the &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim%20vrykul\"&gt;Jotunheim vrykul&lt;/a&gt; is unclear. They share the cliff city of &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Balargarde%20Fortress\"&gt;Balargarde Fortress&lt;/a&gt; but there was no evidence to link them directly.\nHistory.\nThe Mjordin were put into stasis in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Ancestors\"&gt;Halls of the Ancestors&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bethod%20Feigr\"&gt;Bethod Feigr&lt;/a&gt;, the champion of &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Ufrang%20the%20Mighty\"&gt;Thane Ufrang the Mighty&lt;/a&gt;, was sabotaged by &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Illskar\"&gt;Thane Illskar&lt;/a&gt; with dark magic during his fight for &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;ascendance&lt;/a&gt; and was turned into a &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt;. Besides this, the Mjordin vrykul were in conflict with other thanes.\nLater, during the fights between the &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, several &lt;a href=\"Mjordin%20Combatant\"&gt;Mjordin Combatant&lt;/a&gt;s were challenged and defeated in &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Ledge\"&gt;Savage Ledge&lt;/a&gt;. Following these fights, Thane Ufrang was asked to cease any type of support to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. As he refused, he was killed.\nNext, &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Hroegar\"&gt;Instructor Hroegar&lt;/a&gt; was killed and his key taken in order to free their prisoners. After these events, several assaults followed on &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt;, vrykul were killed and their corpses impaled by Ebon blade banners. Moreover, their own banners were burned and their prisoners released.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20the%20Ancestors\"&gt;Halls of the Ancestors&lt;/a&gt; were then desecrated and an ancient Mjordin hero, &lt;a href=\"Iskalder\"&gt;Iskalder&lt;/a&gt;, was awoken in order to stop the &lt;a href=\"valkyr\"&gt;valkyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vardmadra\"&gt;Vardmadra&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are extremely diverse, with subspecies ranging from stunted &lt;a href=\"gan%27arg\"&gt;gan'arg&lt;/a&gt; and imposing &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt; to colossal &lt;a href=\"Mo%27arg%20brute\"&gt;brutes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"fel%20lord\"&gt;fel lord&lt;/a&gt;s. A demonic species hailing from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, the mo'arg were some of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' opponents when he was still the defender of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. After Sargeras betrayed the Pantheon, the highly resourceful and industrious mo'arg were recruited into the Legion to serve as armorers, forging &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-infused weaponry and constructs to besiege the worlds of the cosmos.\nDescription.\nBrutish though they may seem, these iron-stitched horrors are exceedingly brilliant engineers and forge-smiths. Their black iron constructs have sown death across a thousand worlds. Many mo'arg are &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;ers, scientists, blacksmiths, and &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s that have \"improved\" their own bodies with bionic parts. Others instead serve the Legion armies as &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Fel%20lord\"&gt;Fel lord&lt;/a&gt;s are speculated by some scholars of the Legion to be an evolved version of the felguard.\nEven with muscular, tall and broad build, many mo'arg have improved their own bodies with bionic parts. A sickly green substance runs trough their veins, bleeding from their sharp-toothed mouths and from incisions in the torso and around neck; metal stitches barely maintain their patchwork skin. They are hairless and their feet display two front claws and a rear single claw. When not replaced with a bionic part, mo'arg eyes are white and seemingly without pupil.\nSo-called \"&lt;a href=\"mo%27arg%20brute\"&gt;mo'arg brute&lt;/a&gt;s\", such as &lt;a href=\"Smashspite%20the%20Hateful\"&gt;Smashspite the Hateful&lt;/a&gt;, forego the engineering that their race is known for in favor of wielding massive weapons and fighting on the front lines. They are much more imposing and powerful than other mo'arg.\nThe &lt;a href=\"gan%27arg\"&gt;gan'arg&lt;/a&gt; sub-race bears little resemblance to the mo'arg mother race, being stunted and weak to the point that they seem far more similar to &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s than they do the gargantuan demons of the Burning Legion. However, they are often just as intelligent and cunning as their mo'arg masters and should not be underestimated.\nNot all mo'arg are loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Maker\"&gt;The Maker&lt;/a&gt; serves the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; loyal to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sal%27salabim\"&gt;at least one independent mo'arg&lt;/a&gt; has even been allowed inside the walls of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;."}

Seeking to avoid their fate, they tried to flee from his sanctum. Arthas would savor every moment of their futile efforts. There was no escape from the inevitable.\"\nBosstiary.\n\"A godlike being formed from a fusion between the orc shaman Ner'zhul and the former prince, paladin, and death knight Arthas Menethil, the Lich King uses the Halls of Reflection as his private chambers and a refuge for his runeblade, Frostmourne.\"\nThe Chase.\nIn order to reach the Lich King after defeating &lt;a href=\"Falric%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;, players must battle a skeletal &lt;a href=\"Frostsworn%20General\"&gt;Frostsworn General&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spiritual%20Reflection\"&gt;Spiritual Reflection&lt;/a&gt;s of the party members. Upon entering the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Throne\"&gt;Shadow Throne&lt;/a&gt;, they find their faction guide (&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;) in combat with the Lich King, and near death. The guide makes her way out into the Hidden Passage while ordering the party to follow her out, and the Lich King - not willing to let his quarry escape - gives chase.\nThe Lich King raises a series of four ice walls throughout the Hidden Passage to block the escape of the party. At each wall, the Lich King raises groups of undead to attack. The groups consist of the following:\nIn order to break through each ice wall, the groups of undead must be destroyed. Typically, a half-dozen non-elite ghouls are spawned first, then a few risen witch doctors, and finally a lumbering abomination or three. More and more Scourge are spawned at each wall, so kill quickly and keep close to the guide.\nThe risen witch doctors must be killed first as they attack from range and may end up behind the Lich King, thus causing a wipe if the group is heavy on melee DPS.\nUpon reaching the end of the tunnel to the platform outside, the party finds they are trapped on the ledge - and the Lich King is close on their tails. Suddenly, their faction &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; (\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skybreaker\"&gt;The Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\") rises up and opens fire, collapsing the tunnel before the Lich King can reach them. The ship's captain ( or ) encourages the party to get on board before the mountainside collapses; a chest with the loot for the encounter is on the deck, as is a portal to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. If the instance was entered by the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, the portal will actually lead to wherever you entered from, just as if you used the Dungeon Finder to teleport out.\nIt is possible to damage the Lich King during this encounter, but his health will not drop below 1."}

It is time-consuming, however, so ensure that you do it before the rest of your party arrives, so as not to make them wait!\nBackground.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Deep within the Caverns of Time, the brooding dragon Nozdormu has awakened. Since the world was young, the bronze dragonflight has safeguarded the winding labyrinth, monitoring the shifting timeways to ensure that the delicate balance of time is upheld.\"\nDungeon Denizens.\nEncounters.\n\"Note:\" Only mobs unique to the instance are listed here.\nLoot.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep%20loot\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde Keep loot&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiversion.\nPlayers are asked to set incendiary devices in the various buildings of the Durnholde Internment Camp. The Durnholde Internment Camp has five buildings. Each building has 4 guards (usually two melee, one hunter, and one Warden (Priest)). When pulling this area, be sure to keep an eye out for patrols. It is also possible to skip fighting many of the mobs, as well as the first mini-boss, if you have a Rogue or Druid (see \"Stealth Tactics\" below). Once all the explosives are set, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Drake\"&gt;Lieutenant Drake&lt;/a&gt; spawns at the top of the stairs leading to the lower area and slowly walks to the back. Fighting him is not required, although it is not a terribly long or difficult fight. When the buildings catch fire, any mobs that you did not kill will run out into the courtyards and stand there\u2014you will probably have to fight through them to get back to the keep unless your whole party can stealth, or you selectively kill some of them first.\nEscort.\nTo continue, the party must then free Thrall from his cell in the basement of the keep and escort him out (Thrall agrees to come because you tell him you are friends of Taretha and have come in her stead). The escort is broken into three phases. First, you must fight your way out of the castle keep itself and back to the gates of Durnholde, where you will confront &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Skarloc\"&gt;Captain Skarloc&lt;/a&gt;. Second, you must search through Tarren Mill (fighting a number of town guards) to search for Taretha. Finally, you must face off against the &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20Hunter\"&gt;Epoch Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and his minions to free Taretha and restore the timeline.\nIf you wipe during the first portion of the escort (prior to or while fighting &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Skarloc\"&gt;Captain Skarloc&lt;/a&gt;), Thrall will reappear in the basement of the keep. If you wipe after defeating Skarloc and proceeding to Tarren Mill (but before reaching the &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20Hunter\"&gt;Epoch Hunter&lt;/a&gt; fight), Thrall will be standing behind the barn (where you speak with him to start the event in and around Tarren Mill). Once you have cleared Tarren Mill up to the point where you can speak with Taretha to start the fight with the &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20Hunter\"&gt;Epoch Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall will respawn in the Inn (standing next to Taretha).\nDuring the escort, when you are in the Inn, if you wait too long before talking to Thrall or Taretha, she disappears and you have to restart the quest from the beginning.\nEscort Phase One.\nThe first part is possibly the most difficult part of the whole instance\u2014Thrall runs quickly from one fight to another, with essentially no rest in between (although he does heal back to 100% after each fight). Each group in the first section contains four elites; the groups are semi-random, but always seem to contain a Mage, and about 50% of them contain a Warden, which are exceedingly dangerous (they heal, dispel, and AoE fear). This stretch can be difficult if you do not have substantial in-combat CC.\nIf you want to make your life a little easier, go ahead and clear any mobs in Durnholde Keep and in Tarren Mill before speaking to Thrall so that you will not have to deal with them later as adds or while Thrall is running around with no regard to mana or health. The ones immediately to the left and right as you enter the keep (including the patrols) should definitely be eliminated, as you can easily be feared into them (or have a fleeing mob run into them), which at that point will almost certainly cause a wipe.\nBe sure to have your healers top up on mana after each fight (you will drop out of combat after the last mob of each group dies). Thrall can survive on his own briefly\u2014he is a 67 elite and can take quite a bit of punishment (as long as you don't leave all four enemies on him!) Thrall can be healed as normal, but cannot be ed or have a &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; placed on him (since he is not in your group). He is quite resilient, and heals back to 100% between each fight. If you drag the last mob away from where the fight started, you will have a few extra seconds, since Thrall will run all the way back to where the previous fight began before moving on. You can also let him beat on the last mob while group members bandage and/or wait for cooldowns.\nAfter clearing the walls of Durnholde, Thrall and the party will encounter &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Skarloc\"&gt;Captain Skarloc&lt;/a&gt; and two bodyguards. You have 15\u201320 seconds from the end of the last fight until Skarloc rides up, and then there is a short conversation before he actually aggroes. Skarloc is a fairly straightforward fight; he is a Paladin with two adds (usually one melee and one Warden, which can heal and dispel; Skarloc will heal himself and the adds, and will use Hammer of Justice frequently on the tank). The adds should be burned down, then you can beat down Skarloc (see his page for more details). Once Skarloc is killed, Thrall will wait for you to speak with him to begin the second phase of the escort. When you talk to him, he will get on Skarloc's mount (a +60% one, thankfully) and begin riding to Tarren Mill. You may encounter another group or two of guards on the road, which will aggro on Thrall and must be fought. Once you arrive on the outskirts of town, Thrall will ditch the mount and wait for you to speak with him again.\nEscort Phase Two.\nWhen you speak to him, he will lead you to several buildings (first the barn, then the church) -- a group of elites will spawn outside each building and attack you. There is a slightly different mix of mobs than the first gauntlet\u2014in particular, watch out for the Protectors, which are healing/cleansing Paladins. Thrall will then run up into the Inn; there is another group of elites on the upper floor. Once you defeat them, Thrall will run next to Taretha (who is in the back room on the upper floor). Speaking to Taretha will then start the final event. (Warning: waiting too long results in Taretha despawning and the quest breaking. Do not wait much more than 5 minutes before starting the next part of the escort chain.)\nEscort Phase Three.\nOnce you talk to Taretha, &lt;a href=\"the%20Epoch%20Hunter\"&gt;the Epoch Hunter&lt;/a&gt;--a &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;Drake&lt;/a&gt; of the Infinite Dragonflight himself\u2014will announce his presence and tell Thrall that Taretha's life hangs in the balance. Naturally, Thrall asks if the party will accompany him in this last battle, though you really don't have a choice.\nThe Epoch Hunter will fly overhead doing nothing for the first phase of this event. He will spawn three waves of Infinite &lt;a href=\"Dragonkin\"&gt;Dragonkin&lt;/a&gt;, which are somewhat spell-resistant and have various abilities like Shadowbolt. Since they are Dragonkin, Druid's Hibernate spell is very helpful here. The waves are on a timer, so you must kill them fast (the next wave will also spawn about 10 seconds after finishing one; Thrall will reset back in the middle of the road where he began the fight). Stand behind him (being on the other side of the little corner fence between the Inn and Church is a good reference); the mobs frequently aggro whoever is closest to them when they spawn\u2014and Thrall can survive their assault longer than you can. The best tactic during this phase is to burn the Defiler in each wave down ASAP and let Thrall tank all the others, then pull the melee mobs off him one at a time. Thrall heals back to 100% after each wave, though he may require some healing from time to time. Alternatively, if your tank is a pally, you can simply let him multi-tank all the Dragonkins. This way you do not need to risk Thrall's life in the fight.\nOnce all three waves are down, the &lt;a href=\"Epoch%20Hunter\"&gt;Epoch Hunter&lt;/a&gt; himself will land. He, like most Dragonkin, has a frontal breath attack (in this case, arcane damage) that reduces movement speed and attack speed significantly, so keep him faced away from the raid. He also will occasionally knock everyone away from him (not sure if this drops aggro as well), and will sporadically dispel any magic-based buffs or HoTs. He can also place an undispellable DoT on one person that ticks for 750 (though not for very many ticks). It is a fairly straightforward fight; he doesn't deal huge amounts of damage, and other than the knockbacks and breath attack it's a straight tank-and-spank.\nOnce you've killed the Epoch Hunter, Erozion will remove the memory of your interference from Thrall and Taretha. Though Taretha's sad fate is unavoidable, Thrall goes off to meet his destiny\u2014and the flow of time is preserved. Be sure to speak with Erozion to finish the quest and get the next one in the chain; however you can simply turn it back in if you leave the instance without talking to him, although he may not be in his position at the start of the instance if you go back in straight away. Erozion will also teleport you back to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; if you speak with him again after turning in the quest and accepting the next one.\nCompleting this quest will allow the player to enter the second instance in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, which is set prior to the events of &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20I\"&gt;Warcraft I&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"The%20Opening%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;The Opening of the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, featuring the &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote about Druid Crowd Control: In addition to hibernate working, you can also root the dragonkin as you are considered outside. A single druid can basically CC both melee dragonkins and leave the caster to her quick death at the hands of your DPS crew.\nStealth Tactics.\nIf you have a Rogue in the party (and they know what they are doing), it is possible to bypass most of the encounters that occur before freeing Thrall. To do this, your rogue must stealth into the buildings and set the bombs! This will cause 2 things to occur: The patrols will despawn (a lifesaver in Heroic), and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Drake\"&gt;Lieutenant Drake&lt;/a&gt; will emerge. At this point your party has 2 options. You can clear the area at the bottom of the stairs and take Drake as normal, or, since you have already fulfilled the \"mission\" (which is just setting the bombs as a distraction) the party can now continue on to Thrall and never take on Drake at all!!\nHowever, the rest of the party might not get quest credit for this if they are too far away from the buildings.\nPatch 2.4.\nStarting in Patch 2.4, Durnholde Lookouts no longer spawn in the Heroic version of the instance. The placement of creatures around Durnholde Keep in Heroic mode is now identical to that of Normal mode.\nHeroic Mode Walkthrough.\nEntering Durnholde.\nYou enter the instance and clear the smaller groups up till over the bridge. Thus far, everything should be fairly easy. While you stand on this side, walk along the sides of the large prison pit to spot the patrolling \"Lookouts\" and give them marks, so you know where they are at any given time. These patrols are extremely difficult: they have a very large aggro range, and upon aggro will summon two additional mobs, both of which run very fast and hit extremely hard, not to mention being immune to most types of CC. There are five of them in all that you need to worry about: two patrolling the walls around the prison pit, two inside the prison pit, and one patrolling the right side of the pit, with a route that will take it near the stairs into the pit (making the top of the stairs unsafe).\nAt this point, you must determine whether your party will try to kill the groups in the buildings, or ninja them. In both cases, your major concern will be avoiding the patrols.\nThe ninja strategy essentially requires one party member or group of party members pulling the mobs while another drops down and sets the firebombs. The person setting the bombs may want to simply remove their armor: if the mobs come back too soon, they will most likely die almost instantly. For the puller, a hunter using eyes of the beast with a beast that can dash and then feign death is ideal. Expect some deaths with this strategy: the bomber is likely to get trapped, and the puller to get ganked: as long as you leave your resurrecting character outside the walls of the castle and away from combat, they can simply res members that have died in open spots.\nThe killing method is more straightforward, but often quite brutal unless you have enough CC: remove the mobs from each building and set the bombs, working your way through the groups while avoiding the pats. \nOnce you cleared all the buildings, you are free to run in and set fire to the houses. The best way to do this is leaving one building close to the wooden ramp to trigger as last, so you can set up for the boss fight. Once you set fire to all the buildings, the patrols will despawn.\nThe first boss : Lieutenant Drake.\nDrake hits extremely hard: he has a mortal strike that can do upwards of 7k on a tank, and a hamstring that can do up to 4k in addition to his regular attacks, whirlwind, and fear. Fear temporarily lowers tank threat and boss goes for casters and healers.\nIf you can afford dual tanking him (have two warriors, or have a feral druid, or protection paladin), keeping boss busy and away from group is a joke, and you can skip the rest of this strategy and proceed to looting. Else read on.\nIf you've killed all the mobs, then position the party on TOP of the ramp, while you stand below the ramp tanking. Avoid his whirlwind and be ready to counter overaggro. When he fears the tank he will reset his aggro and move to a random person on top of the ramp. When Drake reaches the top of the ramp, the one being targeted jumps down before getting hit and the tank can then take over with Taunt and if that fails, Mocking Blow, or even Challenging Shout.\nIf you haven't killed the mobs, simply pull Drake behind one of the burning buildings when he is away from them on his patrol back and forth.\nSaving Thrall.\nGetting to Thrall is not as hard. The burning houses despawned the patrols, so the patrol that normally walks in the armory no longer walks there.\nAfter talking to Thrall, immediately run to the entrance of the Armory. Sheep, fear, trap the first group as soon as they spawn and tank the mob(s) that are left. Thrall will regularly hit a random sheep. If this is a bad target ( example : The Warden, which dispels sheep ), quickly get a different target and keep resheeping the one Thrall is hitting. After a couple resheeps, Thrall will hit the one that's not sheeped.\nThrall can take quite a few hits, and will allegedly heal himself to 100% between fights.\nThis is a mana-battle. Let Thrall run up front from now on, let your healer drink while other players CC the mobs. The one Thrall is hitting first is your main target, to avoid Thrall breaking sheeps. \nWhen you survive this short gauntlet, the second boss will come forward.\nSecond Boss : Captain Skarloc.\nCaptain Skarloc comes with 2 adds which have the ability to heal themselves and others. His adds hit for around ~800 on leather (and can be very well be \"rogue tanked\" if the need arises).\nThe boss himself hits extremely hard (around 3000 on a well-equipped tank every 2 seconds), and also has a stun (which makes it hard for the tank to build up aggro and will also render the tank unable to dodge, parry or block). In addition, he has a 750 per second Consecrate which can and should be moved out of. Skarloc can also heal himself and the adds and will start doing so when a mob reaches 50% health. He can be interrupted. \nIt is recommended that Thrall tanks the boss while the group takes both adds out of sight and kills them one by one. By the time the adds are dead Thrall should have enough threat build up to last for quite a bit, although it is likely that a DPSer will pull aggro around 20% health.\nAlternatively, it is also possible to CC both adds, making absolutely sure that Skarloc himself never gets into sight.\nGrabbing the beast by its throat\nThrall next rides behind you on his 60% mount. Prepare for the next series of events.\nOnce everyone is ready, trigger the event and run into the barn. Have the tank position at the hallway into the barn, where the mobs spawn. Sheep the \"Protector\" as fast as possible. This mob heals and dispels sheeps.\nThe next spawns are repeating this and are easy once you figure it out. \nWhen you are ready, the entire party runs to the entrance of the \"Church\".\nA series of 2 groups with 3 mobs will spawn and the last group has 4 mobs ( a total of 3 groups after each other ). \nThese mobs can not be sheeped, but they can be Feared or Hibernated and are affected by Hurricane, Frost Nova and slowing/stunning abilities.\nFinal boss : The Epoch Hunter.\nThe last three waves of dragonkin hit much harder than before, but just as on normal, the real battle is making sure your party has enough mana and health to face the final boss after these waves. Tank the boss away from the group as normal.\nReputation Gains.\nKilling creatures in this instance gives reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThe background music played in the instance when not specifically at the Keep or &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; is an adaptation of one of the orc music tracks from &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;. It was also featured in the bonus campaign, \"The Founding of Durotar\", in .\nFor information on the fun stuff you can do and visit in the zone, see &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;."}

Once you release him from the cage, he starts walking slowly towards a bridge. He crosses the bridge to the other platform, and then heads down the ramp to the ground. That's it, that's the whole quest. You can expect to see 1-2 mobs at the start, a patroller on the bridge, 1-2 mobs on the second platform, and 2 at the bottom of the ramp. Those can be cleared before starting the quest. While halfway down the ramp, 2 more will spawn out of thin air and attack.\nOne strategy that works well is to check the General channel for others looking for the quest and form a party of at least three. Then have one person camp the each of the three spots where he might appear. When he does appear, everyone comes to that location and triggers the quest. This way is very easy since three people can easily handle the mobs and patrols, and every one gets credit for the quest rather than competing for the same mob.\nAt some point during the escort, a pair of s will spawn and attack the prisoner regardless if the route has been cleared or not. Each pair spawns at a static point depending on which prisoner you are escorting:\nWith this in mind, it's possible to prepare for the spawns, usually by setting traps.\nQuotes.\nReleased from cage:\nSkettis Wing Guard pair killed:\nMobs cleared at the bottom of the ramp and quest complete:"}

The building and the surrounding estate were the property of &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; before the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and Thalyssra's subsequent alienation, after which it was ordered dismantled by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe estate sits along a beach on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and is generally austere by the standards of the nightborne nobility. It possessed a small dock and a number of transport boats, as well as a small garden containing dusk lilies (a flower commonly associated with First Arcanist Thalyssra). It has the distinction of being virtually the only building located outside Suramar's city limits while remaining within the confines of its magical shield.\nHistory.\nNightfallen rebellion.\nBefore the lowering of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s powerful arcane shield over 10,000 years after the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the estate of the First Arcanist existed in the possession of &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, First Arcanist of Suramar.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar's leader, chose to make an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of sparing the lives of her people. A close advisor to Elisande, Thalyssra vehemently opposed this decision, even attempting a coup to overthrow the Grand Magistrix before it was too late. The coup would fail, however, and Thalyssra herself would very nearly die in the attempt before managing to escape the city.\nIn the aftermath of the failed plot, Thalyssra would form a rebel faction known as &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; with the goal of deposing the Grand Magistrix and expelling the Burning Legion from Suramar. As a result, Thalyssra's name was essentially blacklisted by Elisande's regime. As part of this, Thalyssra's estate was seized and ordered dismantled, with &lt;a href=\"Magisterial%20Sleuth\"&gt;magisterial agents&lt;/a&gt; being sent to ransack the property and oversee its demolition.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; raged on, Thalyssra and her allies continued research into the combat potential of &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; nightborne. To further these experiments, however, the First Arcanist required unique tools which remained in her estate in the city. She subsequently sent agents to recover an &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Amplifier\"&gt;arcane amplifier&lt;/a&gt; from the manor, though aware that the location was likely under guard following recent events. Upon arrival, the Nightfallen operatives succeeded in recovering the parts of the amplifier, which had been shattered into pieces, and escaped with the tool.\nSeveral of Thalyssra's personal items were also liberated from the estate during the raid, including some clothing, arcane tomes, and private correspondence. The items were returned to the First Arcanist at the Nightfallen base in &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nPost-insurrection.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; and the victory of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;insurrection&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; retook the estate along with the rest of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, now loyal to Thalyssra's regime, were stationed to guard the compound, and it became the primary abode of the First Arcanist once more.\nSome time between the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the commencement of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Thalyssra met with the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; in the estate to discuss the possible entry of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After a short discussion, Thalyssra, &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt; departed from the estate to travel to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;."}

Players started out with only a handful of weapon skills and had to visit weapon trainers to learn others. Once a weapon skill was learned, it needed to be improved through active use of the weapon. Now all classes start with the passive &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Skills\"&gt;Weapon Skills&lt;/a&gt; ability, which grants all relevant weapon skills upon creation, making this mechanic obsolete.\nOverview.\nWeapon skill represents your proficiency with a particular &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;. The basic formula for your maximum weapon skill at a particular level is (5 * level). Each attack which is not evaded has a chance to increase weapon skill, with low weapon skill, the skill gain rate is at or near 100%, however the skill gain change begins to sharply decrease once the weapon skill cap is approached. At 10% away from the cap, the skill gain chance is roughly 50%, and gaining the final skill point can take hundreds of swings. The chance per swing seems to be unrelated to &lt;a href=\"weapon%20speed\"&gt;weapon speed&lt;/a&gt;, making low speed weapons better. Instant attacks like Sinister Strike and Hamstring help to increase your weapon skill faster. Note that attacking Evading enemies will not increase your weapon skill.\nIt has been confirmed that &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt; increases the rate at which weapon skills are learned. Before &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0\"&gt;Patch 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, this was listed in the tooltip but was removed shortly after that. If you want to level a weapon skill, try asking for an &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt; buff or using a scroll which can help the process. Similarly, equip any gear you have that has an Intellect bonus on it\u2014if you're a paladin, put on your Holy gear and cast Blessing of Kings; if you're a shaman, put on your Elemental or Restoration gear.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3\"&gt;Patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, stats on melee weapons which granted an increase to weapon skill were replaced by an increase to &lt;a href=\"expertise\"&gt;expertise&lt;/a&gt; rating. Items which granted ranged weapon skill increases instead now grant increases to hit or critical strike rating.\nEffects of weapon skill.\nPlayer attacking a mob.\nIf your weapon skill is LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO the mob's Defense skill (the mob's level * 5)\nApplying these formulae gives the following base miss rate for a Level 80 character with a 400 Weapon Skill:\nAt level 80, 32.79 hit rating reduces your chance to miss by 1%.\nThus if you are a Level 80 character with a Weapon Skill of 400, you need a Hit Rating of 263 (8.00%) to never miss a shot against a Level 83 boss (or skull mob) with a special attack or single-wield auto-attack. What this means is that there is a big +hit benefit to keeping your Weapon Skill within 10 levels of the mobs you are trying to fight. For example, by improving your Weapon Skill from 390 to 395, you effectively reduce your chance to miss against Level 81 mobs by 3%! However, after getting to 395, increasing your Weapon Skill the next 5 levels, to 400, only reduces your chance to miss by an additional 0.5% (or 3.5% in total).\nPrior to 3.0, the base miss chance when your target's defense was 11+ points higher than your weapon skill was 1% higher. Back then, there was a huge jump in miss rate reduction by going from, say, 349 to 350 Weapon Skill. This was the point where you switched from one formula to the other, and so this particular single point of Weapon Skill was worth a dramatic +1.4% hit against a Level 73 mob/boss.\nIf your weapon skill EXCEEDS the mob's Defense skill, i.e. if the mob is lower level than you are\nI.e., for each point that your weapon skill exceeds your opponent's &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;, your chance to miss, be dodged, be parried, and be blocked decreases by 0.04%, and your chance to crit increases by 0.04%. Effectively, you can consider weapon skill to be the inverse of the &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; skill.\nGlancing Blows.\nAgainst &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s with defense roughly equal to or higher than your &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Rating\"&gt;Attack Rating&lt;/a&gt; (i.e. your weapon skill), you will have a chance to land a &lt;a href=\"glancing%20blow\"&gt;glancing blow&lt;/a&gt; instead of a normal hit. A glancing blow only occurs on white melee damage, cannot crit, and does less damage than a normal blow. If the attacker's weapon skill is \"less\" than his level * 5, the damage reduction will be proportional to the difference between the attacker's weapon skill and the target's defense.\nBack before patch 2.0, when Weapon Skill could be raised \"above\" your level * 5 from gear or racial bonuses, the damage reduction when a glancing blow occurred was reduced somewhat for each point of additional Weapon Skill. This is no longer the case.\nMob attacking a Player.\nIf a mob's weapon skill (its level * 5) is EQUAL TO your &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;, and you have no gear or talents that increase any of your defensive Ratings:\nFor each point that the mob's weapon skill (its level * 5) exceeds your &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;, it gains the following:\nFor each point that the mob's weapon skill (its level * 5) is less than your &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt;:\nCrushing Blows.\nIf a mob's weapon skill (its level * 5) is at least 20 points higher than the target's level-capped &lt;a href=\"defense\"&gt;defense&lt;/a&gt; (the target's Defense skill capped at its level * 5), there is a chance the target will receive a &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20Blow\"&gt;Crushing Blow&lt;/a&gt;.\nDazed.\nIf a mob hits a target from behind, and the target takes damage from the hit that isn't &lt;a href=\"Absorb\"&gt;Absorb&lt;/a&gt;ed, there is a chance the player will be &lt;a href=\"Dazed\"&gt;Dazed&lt;/a&gt;. The base chance for a level 30+ target to be dazed when hit from behind, if the mob's weapon skill is equal to the target's defense skill, is \"20%\". This chance can get as low as 0% if the target's defense is high enough, or as high as 40% if the target's defense is low enough. If the target is below level 30, it's base chance to be dazed is less; a level 10 target with fully trained defense skill only has a 7% chance to be dazed when attacked from behind by a level 10 mob.\nNote that your defense skill is NOT level-capped for purposes of determining your chance to be dazed. It is possible to become undazeable while wearing tank plate gear.\nPlayer attacking a Player.\nWeapon skills are maxed in PvP combat. This means leveling a weapon skill for pvp is unimportant; when attacking an enemy player, your Weapon Skill will always be considered to be your level * 5, and your target's Defense will always be treated as his level * 5 (before any Defense Rating from your target's gear is added in).\nWeapon skill does not affect your chance to hit other players in the battlegrounds or in the arena, but it still affects your hit chance against enemy players in world PvP or duels.\nIncreasing your weapon skill (at level 70+).\nA good place to increase ranged DPS for higher level characters is &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Sprayer\"&gt;Plague Sprayer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. They are level 80 Elites that fly above &lt;a href=\"Kolramas\"&gt;Kolramas&lt;/a&gt;. They have a high amount of health and the only attack they have is a plague beam that shoots straight down.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primordial%20Drake%20Egg\"&gt;Primordial Drake Egg&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; also work well for this; they are high 70's, and do not attack back.\nFor ranged DPS (bows/guns) - &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Boom\"&gt;Dr. Boom&lt;/a&gt; used to be an excellent choice - just bring enough ammo, and attack at will. Hunters had the best options with him due to auto-shoot. This no longer works as of 3.2. Likewise, the unkillable Servants in the Blasted Lands no longer skill you up when they are in their unkillable state.\nVendors in Dalaran sell white, low DPS weapons with extremely low attack speeds, making them great options for levelling weapon skill.\nIf you have a relatively good health pool, you can skill up from the waves of creates inside the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;:\nHistorical effects of weapon skill.\nThe effect of weapon skill has changed several times over the game's history. Prior to patch 2.0, some items granted extra Weapon Skill directly, making it possible to have a weapon skill in excess of your level * 5. Back then, the formula shown above for your weapon skill exceeding your opponent's defense also applied in the reverse situation, i.e. when your weapon skill was less than your opponent's defense.\nAfter the Burning Crusade went live, but prior to patch 2.1, CM &lt;a href=\"Crezax\"&gt;Crezax&lt;/a&gt; made a post &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D166546791%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1%26amp%3Bsid%3D1%232\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the EU forums outlining the effect of weapon skill on higher-level mobs. Note that this refers only to monsters 3 levels higher than the player in PVE (i.e. boss level mobs). Corresponding numbers for 1 and 2 levels higher than the player are not known, but are likely lower.\nThese numbers given by the CM were questionable, and were rightly taken with a grain of salt.\nAdditionally, the &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.1\"&gt;Patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt; notes said:\nPresumably this was only for Weapon Skill over your level's natural cap (Level * 5), a state of affairs which no longer exists as of patch 2.3. It was not known if you also got the additional 0.04% crit chance per additional +skill.\nSince items with Weapon Skill or Weapon Skill Rating used to reduce your chance to miss, to be dodged, to be parried, and to be blocked, they could increase your \"crit cap\" as described in the &lt;a href=\"Critical%20strike\"&gt;Critical strike&lt;/a&gt; article.\nHistorical: Increasing your weapon skill beyond (level * 5).\nItemization.\nPrior to patch 2.3, a few items in the game granted the wielder Weapon Skill Rating. Even then, though, itemization for +weapon skill was spotty.\n2.0.1 Skill Rating conversion\nPrior to patch 2.0, instead of Weapon Skill Rating, items granted their wielder Weapon Skill directly; e.g. a mace might say \"Increases your skill with maces by 5.\" Under the new &lt;a href=\"combat%20rating%20system\"&gt;combat rating system&lt;/a&gt; introduced in 2.0.1, those items now all had a Weapon Skill Rating bonus instead.\nIt took 2.5 points of Weapon Skill Rating at level 60, and 3.9 points of Weapon Skill Rating at level 70, to increase your actual Weapon Skill by 1.\nIn applying the miss rate formulae listed in the \"Chance to Miss\" section above, fractional Weapon Skill levels were dropped, not rounded. So, say you had are a Level 70 character, and you equipped a piece of gear that gave +15 Mace Skill Rating. In theory, this equated to 3.8 +Weapon Skill. And, in theory, Blizzard could have used the fractional .8 in its subsequent calculations of hit and miss, or, perhaps, rounded it to 4.0. But it didn\u2019t work that way. Instead, the fractional .8 Weapon Skill was simply dropped altogether. You got 353 Weapon Skill for purposes of all hit and miss calculations.\nAnother interesting point was that if you are able to stack your Weapon Skill \"above\" 365 at level 70, you'd find that each additional point of Weapon Skill above 365 continues to decrease your chance to miss by .1% per Weapon Skill level. So if your Weapon Skill was 366, your chance to miss was 4.9%, if 367, 4.8%, etc.\nPre-2.3 Talents.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s:\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s:"}

The show originated on &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Radio\"&gt;WoW Radio&lt;/a&gt; and has been consistently updated, shows cancelled only when computer systems, broadcasting equipment, the internet, and the U.S. Government conspire against him.\nThe show, while reviewing aspects of the World of Warcraft and changes being made to it, was known for its inability to settle for less than the best that Blizzard can offer. Every mistake, bug, and silly decision is brought up and torn to shreds, with constructive criticism and ideas for fixing the problems also presented when possible. This is the dividing line that makes Blue Plz! neither sycophantic Blizzard fanboy nor misinformed blind hatred.\nThe show relied partly on the participation of the community built around it. This community began building itself in 2005 when the show began on &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Radio\"&gt;WoW Radio&lt;/a&gt;. Dissenting opinions and constructive criticism were welcomed, while sheer stupidity and fanboy sycophancy were not.\nTotalBiscuit, known as WoW Radio's resident 'shock jock' and self-proclaimed Cynical Brit, moved over to his new website when WoW Radio closed its doors during a veritable drought of Warcraft content.\nThe Cynical Brit site gained additional coverage during the &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; for after TotalBiscuit started posting a series of YouTube videos (which were then featured on &lt;a href=\"MMO%20Champion\"&gt;MMO Champion&lt;/a&gt;) that catalogued many of the zone changes and gave insight into the new starting areas for the Goblin, Troll, Worgen and more recently Gnome races. \nBlue Plz! aired its last episode on June 4th, 2011, ending Season 5 on 11 episodes, making it the shortest season for Blue Plz!\nJohn Bain passed away on 24 May 2018 due to cancer.\nThe sour end of Blue Plz!\nDuring June 2011, it was revealed that Blizzard was rolling out a series of nerfs to the Tier 11 content through a Blue post. This was what TotalBiscuit considered the final straw, as he put both his radio show and his YouTube show (the latter being &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20Daily\"&gt;Azeroth Daily&lt;/a&gt;) on permanent hiatus, subsequently criticizing Blizzard for making the game too easy for players to get through high-end content. However, on further episodes of \"The Mailbox\" (what Azeroth Daily became following the announcement), he gave additional reasons, such as him souring on hotkey MMOs. "}

{"id": "22627", "revid": "40350614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22627", "title": "Blue dragon", "text": "Blue dragons are &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s that have blue-white scales and can breathe frost or &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. During the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; blessed &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his flight with power over the arcane and the duty of ensuring it would never be abused. Malygos and his mate &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; ruled the blue flight until the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when the crazed &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to wipe out the majority of the flight, leaving only Malygos and precious few eggs left. The event left Malygos both weakened and depressed.\nThe flight slowly but surely recovered over the millennia, until the ambitious young dragons &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; attempted to bring Malygos out of his stupor. They were successful, but rather than lead their flight as the noble and wise leader they had hoped for, Malygos was appalled at what he saw as the overuse of magic in the world. Rallying his flight and all the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s supporting his cause, Malygos began the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to subjugate or wipe out all magic usage on Azeroth. He was opposed by many mortal organizations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and the other dragonflights under the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;; the war ultimately ended in the Aspect's demise.\nAfter the death of Malygos, the blue dragonflight had to choose a leader who would become the new Aspect of Magic. It was ultimately narrowed between Malygos' son, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, and the dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;; though the former ultimately sided with Deathwing, leading to his demise. Chosen by his kind and empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos became the new Steward of Magic among the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. After the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of Deathwing, the blue dragons were left in a state of disarray. More and more left their home at the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; daily, until finally Kalecgos declared the flight disbanded and all blue dragons free to follow their own individual desires.\nSeveral years later, during the , Kalecgos realized his error and pledged himself to reunite his flight. He set out with the aid of his allies to bring the various blue dragons of the world back together; aided primarily by &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, and the simulacrum of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;. This led to a resurgence of blue dragons in the world, reunited as a family once more.\nLife cycle and appearance.\nBlue dragons, as with all other dragons, go through various life stages before they are fully grown. These stages are divided into &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Whelps are the children of their kind, while drakes are adolescents and young adults. The oldest of their kind become dragons, though they appear to still grow in some capacity as far older dragons are usually larger than their younger kindred. Traditional dragons look largely the same, akin to an immense lizard with four legs and wings sprouting along their spine. In their youthful stages, whelps seem to exclusively travel by way of flight, with older dragons flying or walking depending on their whims.\nSome blue dragons have their wings connected along their tail, giving a sort of webbed look, a trait unique to their kind. Some older blue dragons are also laid with arcane runes, a trait found on Malygos, Kalecgos, Senegos, and the various dragons that fought under Malygos during the Nexus war. Some blue dragons have deeper blue scales, a trait that was common on the dragons serving under Malygos during the Nexus War; extending even to their whelps and dragonkin serving with them.\nSeveral of these dragons also take unorthodox forms to those traditionally found; such as the &lt;a href=\"wylderdrake\"&gt;wylderdrake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"velocidrake\"&gt;velocidrake&lt;/a&gt;. As these are specified as drakes, it is unknown what their 'dragon' forms or whelp forms would look like; though they are presumably just smaller and larger variations of these appearances. With the advent of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s being discovered; &lt;a href=\"slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrake&lt;/a&gt;s have also been found baring blue scales.\nHistory.\nCharge of the dragonflights.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; departed Azeroth, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over it. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, yet five flights, one of which was the blue, held dominion over their brethren, and were chosen to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, the Titan lore keeper and master-magician, granted the blue dragon, Malygos, a portion of his vast power. From then on, Malygos would be known as the Spell-Weaver, the guardian of magic and hidden arcanum.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nAluneth.\nAt some point, while manipulating the fabric of reality, the wise and mirthful blue dragons tapped into another &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;realm of existence&lt;/a&gt; and made contact with the strange &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; entity called &lt;a href=\"Aluneth%20%28entity%29\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;. The blue dragons loved unraveling mysteries and delving into the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;. They were so intrigued by Aluneth's existence that they summoned the entity into the world for further study. Aluneth immediately went on a rampage through the blue dragons' lair, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. The arcane presence destroyed countless rare artifacts and tomes of power before finally being contained. The dragons were not angry about what had happened--they were delighted by Aluneth's capricious nature. After years of conducting harmless experiments on Aluneth, the blue dragons satisfied their curiosity and sent the entity back to its own realm. Later, the gifted &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meitre\"&gt;Meitre&lt;/a&gt; learned from a blue dragon about Aluneth.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently called the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the world, the blue dragons were among the first to realize the potential threat; and when the Aspect of the Earth, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the demons, the blues were some of the first to agree to the plan. Malygos himself was one of Neltharion's closest friends and staunchest supporters, and he gave much of his own essence toward the creation of this object, called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The blues joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion retreated, leaving the blue dragonflight broken in his wake.\nDuring the struggle, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; had been thrown from the battlefield and survived, but his prime consort &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; died from her injuries after being flung far into the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;icy north&lt;/a&gt;, including many others blue dragons. Wounded and shocked, the remaining blues and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion but at a great cost. Azeroth was sundered.\nKorialstrasz teleported himself to the icy caverns of the blue flight to search for any remaining life. He found none, save a few nearly frozen, but still intact, eggs. Knowing these eggs were the only hope of a future the blue flight had, Korialstrasz placed them in a &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20dimension\"&gt;pocket universe&lt;/a&gt;, where time ran ever so slowly, until he could pass them on to someone he could trust. One of those eggs contained &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing's betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, and the blues lost many of the few they had left. They would never again be seen in the same numbers as before. The age of dragons had passed.\nAfter the loss of most of his children and mates, Malygos hid out in his lair at &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, slowly going mad. Perhaps Malygos's last sane act was placing many of his surviving dragonkin in the caverns of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; to hold eternal vigil over the sacred site of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, location of the world tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. After that he isolated himself in his lair, refusing all visitors, while his presence in the world diminished over time.\nA few remaining blues continued their lord's study of magic throughout the millennia. The &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt;, a map of the world's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s gifted to Malygos ages ago by the titan Norgannon, was continuously updated and revised by the blue dragons over the long years of Malygos's seclusion. Mighty blue wyrms, such as &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, continued to search for and hoard artifacts of great magical power, keeping them from inexperienced hands. When the legion was planning its second invasion of Azeroth, another agent, &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to sway the &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; away from the path he was taking under the control of the Dark Titan, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 6,000 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, the isolated &lt;a href=\"Shandaral\"&gt;Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; witnessed members of the blue dragonflight using spells to crystalize living things and draw power from them. The dragons did that out of curiosity, and the elves saw a way to end their suffering. The Highborne attempted to interact with the dragons, but they ignored them or showed hostility towards them. As a result, Highborne &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s infiltrated the Nexus and succeeded in stealing the knowledge of dragons' techniques. Their greed, however, drove them to steal artifacts and triggered magical wards, sending blue dragons into a frenzy. Although the elven thieves managed to escape, soon the dragons' retribution came to Shandaral. The Highborne sorcerers gathered on a cliff overlooking &lt;a href=\"Moonsong\"&gt;Moonsong&lt;/a&gt; and hoped to use the stolen spells against the dragons. They prepared to crystallize a portion of the forest and use its power against the dragons. Despite their effort, the spell took an enormous size, casting a huge explosion. The torrent of energy instantly crystallized the entire forest of Moonsong and its inhabitants. The blue dragons, sensing the spellwork, successfully escaped.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nA thousand years before modern times, the almost-extinct blue dragons still managed to lend their aid to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, a child of Malygos, the blues fought the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters furiously and ultimately helped push them back to their city where they were sealed away from the world. The dragons suffered few casualties but the progeny of Malygos, Arygos, was believed lost, having charged deep into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; during the final push. After the war, a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to the blue wyrm &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; the bronze.\nUnbeknownst to his flight, Arygos, along with Caelestrasz and Merithra, was not dead, simply captured. The dark master of Ahn'Qiraj used the tortured dragons to power his new creations: &lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s.\n823 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Guardian of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, sensed something dark stirring in the icy lands of Northrend. She traveled to the distant continent and found a pack of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s hunting errant blue dragons, feeding on their potent arcane energies.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; entrusted the greatstaff &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; to the blue dragons and locked it in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Vault\"&gt;Nexus Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nIn the events leading up to the Second War, Deathwing led a powerful orc warlock named &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragon Soul \u2014 now renamed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros used the Demon Soul to force the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, into submission and forced the rest of the red dragonflight to serve him or risk the death of their queen. Korialstrasz, who escaped by faking his death sought the assistance of the other Aspects to free his queen. When Korialstrasz approached Malygos, the Blue Aspect seemed almost indifferent to the news at first. That is until the red consort hinted to the lord of the blues that as the aspect of life, there could be something Alexstrasza could do for him and his nearly-extinct flight. After heavy consideration and some coaxing from &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, he agreed.\nWith the Aspects convinced, Korialstrasz waited until Nekros brought Alexstrasza and her eggs out of the fortress, just as Deathwing had desired. When Deathwing made his appearance, Malygos and the others arrived and proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;the Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter having his powers restored to him, Malygos remained secluded for the most part but his flight did become more active in the world once again. Still recovering from the events that occurred ten thousand years ago, they nevertheless continued to safeguard the world from corrupting magic and those who would wield it.\nThird War.\nLike the other dragonflights, the blue dragonflight did not play any significant role in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, first &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, did however invade the icy lair of the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt;, where the wyrm had hoarded a great treasure and artifacts of significant power. The death knight, assisted by the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20lord\"&gt;Crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, quickly dispatched Sapphiron's brood and slew the ancient servant of Malygos, raising him in undeath as a mighty &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Siege%20of%20Dalaran%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;The Siege of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; mission, two blue drakes were ironically held prisoners in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, being transformed into flying sheep.\nThe Sunwell.\nAs of the aftermath of the Third War, the blue dragonflight was growing in numbers, but not fast enough. Following the Third War, which had ravaged the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and cost the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; their fabled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos and the blues felt a great flaring of power, coming from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Spell-Weaver, with no elders at his disposal, sent the young &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos's intended mate, followed soon after, arriving just in time to save Kalecgos from the Scourge. In their company was a strange young woman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. On a visit to &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, they were joined by the paladin &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt;. The four journeyed together, their exploits eventually leading them to Quel'Thalas where after being assaulted by &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; and an enslaved &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; they discovered Anveena was the new avatar of the Sunwell. Dar'Khan was defeated and Anveena was left in the care of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos, having sworn to look after her, remained in Quel'Thalas as Anveena's guardian.\nOutland and the nether dragons.\nAfter the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; by the demonic survivors of the Third War, Tyrygosa crossed through the portal in order to investigate the shattered world and the strange mysterious &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s found there. She discovered, to her dismay, the nether dragons were the wayward nether-twisted spawn of Deathwing himself, and that they were being subjugated by the death knight &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing his defeat, Tyrygosa attempted to save the fading nether dragons by bringing them to Azeroth, specifically to the Nexus which she hopes to use to feed and stabilize the ethereal dragons. The nether dragons however gorged themselves and grew mad with power claiming they were magic incarnate, and proceed to attack the blues. The mad slumbering Malygos heard this and awakened. Hearing the claims of the nether dragons Malygos misinterpreted their reference to themselves as magic and decided to absorb the nether dragons into himself. This empowered Malygos and allowed him to finally shake off his millennia-long madness.\nSince that time the blue dragons monitor the portal from their sanctum, and nothing crosses in or out without their knowledge.\nSecond battle of Grim Batol.\nA lone survivor, &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, overlooked by the blues was quickly captured by &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; and taken to Grim Batol to be used in her schemes to create the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos followed ultimately meeting up with the red dragon Korialstrasz. Korialstrasz sensed something happening deep within the mountain and returned to Grim Batol to find the black consort in the midst of creating the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, thanks to Korialstrasz's allies, the sacrifice of the nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, and the anger felt by &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt; towards his \"mother\", &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; and her creation were defeated. The mountain was once again abandoned, unaware to anyone that Deathwing lurked still deeper within.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke from his long dormancy, he journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Sindragosa's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, where he raised &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; into undeath as a mighty skeletal &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; and ordered her to lead the &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood\"&gt;Frostbrood&lt;/a&gt; into war. The Lich King then tore the spirits of Sindragosa's lost &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; into undeath in front of her skeletal form as a final affront to the great dragon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Sindragosa's Fall was crawling with &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; acolytes and members who were raising more frost wyrms from the ice. Later during the conflict, Sindragosa defended the Lich King in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who went on to slay him destroyed her as well, leaving only her skull behind. But rather than leave her to suffer again in some form, the adventurers took her crystalline essence to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where she could truly be laid to rest.\nNexus War.\nHaving awoken from madness, Malygos assessed the state of magical affairs on Azeroth and concluded that magic had run amok, blaming the mortal races and their reckless pursuit of power. Determined to forestall a catastrophe, the Blue Aspect decreed that the world's unbridled magic had to be reined in, and decided to fix this problem his way, by imprisoning and destroying all mortal mages and by realigning the flow of magic to point toward &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; gathered all this &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy.\nSo Malygos turned to the Arcanomicon to locate the ley lines, and tap into them using constructs called &lt;a href=\"Surge%20needle\"&gt;Surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s, maneuvered into position over ley lines by his flight. He diverted these lines of energy that coursed beneath the earth, where they were focused through the Nexus' ascending rings and blasted into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. However, this redirection carried disastrous consequences, splintering the world's crust and opening up unstable rifts.\nMalygos' siphoning of the world's magic did not go unnoticed. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, elite magi of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, swore to fight Malygos to the bitter end, going as far as using their waning powers to transport their entire city to float above Northrend, though several members opted to side with the blue dragonflight becoming &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Blue dragons, led by &lt;a href=\"Cyanigosa\"&gt;Cyanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, launched an offensive against the city. Their initial onslaught nearly succeeded in breaking through the shield but the magi of Dalaran were able to hold the spell, unaware that Cyanigosa had an agent on the inside. The mage hunter &lt;a href=\"Crevan\"&gt;Crevan&lt;/a&gt; had allowed himself to be captured, and when the opportune moment arose he manipulated his nephew, the apprentice &lt;a href=\"Aodhan\"&gt;Aodhan&lt;/a&gt;, into freeing him. Crevan released the prisoners of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; in hopes the distraction would work to Cyanigosa's advantage. The blue dragons pressed forward while Crevan attempted to bring the city down - literally - from inside, but Aodhan managed to outwit him long enough to stop him. The Kirin Tor, free from any distractions, were able to strengthen the shield and force the blue dragons to abandon the attack.\nThe blue's increasingly militaristic methods were condemned by the red dragonflight, who vowed to neutralize Malygos at all costs. To this end, they formed a council with the Kirin Tor, and the two groups began actively subverting Malygos's devastating campaign. When the blues dared attack &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the reds called upon the remaining dragonflights for assistance, creating the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;. Once again dragon fought against dragon. Alexstrsza and the other Aspects saw no way to end the senseless violence other than destroying Malygos. But the Blue Aspect proved elusive until &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;a key&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was found on the remains of the frost wyrm Sapphiron, a former servant of Malygos. The Spellweaver was finally confronted in his realm where he was slain by members of the Accord.\nThe blue dragonflight had been left without an Aspect.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nThe blue dragonflight faced a crisis that no other dragon in the world had faced before, the loss of an Aspect. Research indicated that one could be empowered during the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;, and the two major candidates for the position were &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, son of Malygos. Arygos betrayed his people to Deathwing for the promise of achieving the position, but in the end, the flight elected Kalecgos their new leader.\nKalecgos worked alongside the other Aspects in the final battle against Deathwing, using his new power to rewrite the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;'s magic and allow it to harm the Aspect of Death. At the end of the fighting, the Aspects became mortal.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nDeciding that the Focusing Iris needed to be placed somewhere safe, a squad of blue dragons began to escort it from the Eye of Eternity to the depths of Azeroth's ocean. However, agents of the Horde killed the entire squad and stole the artifact. Kalecgos went out searching for it because of his former position as Aspect, but was unable to discover its location until the Focusing Iris was used to empower the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of their diminished numbers, first from Deathwing, then the Nexus War, and then the Cataclysm, the blue dragonflight decided to go their separate ways. The few remaining blue dragons have scattered across the world, no longer affiliated with any organization.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nWith Nexus abandoned, only few individuals remained to check the Nexus, such as Kalec and &lt;a href=\"Jaracgos\"&gt;Jaracgos&lt;/a&gt;. After Kalec relived the true history of the proto-dragons, he was reconsidering his decision to let the other blue dragons choose their individual paths, and he concluded that he could restore the flight.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"Lanigosa\"&gt;Lanigosa&lt;/a&gt; aided a paladin adventurer to retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and fight the cursed titan keeper &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt;. Azuregos returned to the Nexus, however, he was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; as they sought to acquire control over the artifacts within the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Vault\"&gt;Nexus Vault&lt;/a&gt;. A mage and a priest adventurer freed him and, banding together, defeated &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Bilaal\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Bilaal&lt;/a&gt; and his followers. Azuregos stayed behind to secure the Nexus so it would not fall into the wrong hands again, and said to give his regards to Kalecgos.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;Azurewing&lt;/a&gt;, a remaining brood of blue dragons led by &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;, had made their home in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. They came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to drain the mana from the dragons to feed their addiction. They later assisted in defending Azsuna against the demons during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the fact that the blue dragonflight dragons went their separate ways, but seeing &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Mennar\"&gt;Lake Mennar&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; made him think otherwise. &lt;a href=\"Malynea%20Skyreaver\"&gt;Malynea Skyreaver&lt;/a&gt; explained to them that a &lt;a href=\"Sarcen%20Stone\"&gt;Sarcen Stone&lt;/a&gt; was drawing them to the area.\nAccording to a goblin from Winterspring, the blue dragons are still present in the &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; caves.\nDragonflight.\n20,000 years ago, Malygos had placed a contingent of blue dragons and &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; to watch over the slumbering &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;. These dragons had been on the island for all that time, and were unaware that Malygos was dead. After the events of the dracthyr starting zone, the drakonid joined the &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wings\"&gt;Healing Wings&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; reawakened, all dragonflights, including the blues, traveled to them. In the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos traveled alone to reignite the flight's &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. When he met a simulacrum of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; she asked him where the rest of the flight was, and Kalec explained how the flight was disbanded and they had all gone their separate ways. After spending some time with the local &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; and seeing how they celebrated the lives of the dead instead of mourning them, Kalec put out a magical call to any blue dragons who were listening to gather at the Azure Span. The Azurewing dragons arrived just in time to save &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, and as Kalec restored the Azure Oathstone he declared the blue dragonflight - his family - renewed. Afterward, many blue dragons could be seen in the skies of the Azure Span.\nIn the RPG.\nBlue dragons are associated with cold and earth. The term \"dragon\" is sometimes used instead of the term \"mature\" to describe the adult phase of a blue &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s lifecycle, between &lt;a href=\"Blue%20drake\"&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a &lt;a href=\"Blue%20wyrm\"&gt;wyrm&lt;/a&gt;. They are 100-500 years old.\nDescription.\nBlue dragons are regal creatures, their posture and facial expressions expressing wisdom and intellect. They are creatures of ice and water, often found in cold regions and preferring to keep to themselves. They are studious, enjoying both literature and scholarly texts, and study any bit of knowledge or trivia that they come across. These dragons are best known for altering their forms and integrating into other societies in order to learn new technologies, spells, and crafts. Blue dragons are peaceful creatures, but very territorial. Once a blue dragon has claimed a certain territory, woe to any \u2014 even dragons of their own flight - who enter into that area without permission. The mighty dragon bursts from the frigid waters, its muscular form covered in glistening scales. It has patterned cobalt markings across its neck and upper body, and its wings fold almost invisibly against its sinuous body.\nAge Cycle.\nBlue whelps are the youngest blue dragons who are capable of any sort of combat. At only a few years of age, a blue &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt; is already as intelligent as a fully grown human, but he lacks the maturity and grace of an adult. These young dragons delight in play, especially where magic is involved, and they would much rather have a new friend than an enemy. As such, whelps are usually friendly, but like most children they can be easily frightened or angered. Blue whelps are guardians of magic and constantly seek magical knowledge and artifacts to prevent evil forces from discovering them. The dragon is not overwhelmingly large, standing only about 6 feet in height, but his shimmering scales and brilliant eyes hint at the great power contained within his small frame.\nIf threatened, blue whelps usually flee. If no route of escape is available, they lash out viciously at their attackers, instinctively using their breath attacks as frequently as possible. They are smart enough to fly out of the range of melee attackers if they are in an open area, and they use their spells and breath to gradually wear their enemies down from above.\nBlue drakes are average members of &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; society, and are as highly varied as the young adults of any race. Drakes often take the forms of mortals to learn about them and assist mortals in their own struggles. Many drakes also begin training the youngest of the &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, taking a small group of these loyal creatures under their wing \u2014 both literally and figuratively. The massive drake emerges from the frigid waters, her ice-colored scales shimmering with hidden light. Patterns of cobalt runes line her neck and upper body, and her wings fold almost invisibly against her lithe form.\nBlue drakes prefer a swift kill in combat, and they prefer to remain airborne. They use their breath weapons whenever possible, and supplement their breath weapons with spells designed to slow down or kill their prey. They are excellent tacticians and focus on enemy spellcasters and other threats first. They do not land unless there is an immediate need or all opposition is destroyed.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nMalygos is said to have established magic itself and created all the spells that set the sky and earth into motion. While he is not revered as a god, for blue dragons see no godhood in scientific fact, he is considered the greatest scientific mind ever to have existed in the multiverse\u2014or, at least, his flight considers him so. Blue dragons have a natural affinity for spellcasting, and most powers of sorcery are instinct even to young drakes. Because of their natural propensity for magic, they have high magic resistances and can withstand many magical attacks. They are also the masters of frost, their breath weapon can drain enemies' magic energy, an effect the blue dragons term \"withdrawing Malygos's favor.\" Blues find all forms of ice and water welcome, most making their lairs in the frozen peaks of mountains or in caverns near, or under, freezing water.\nFor the thousands of years between the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, blue dragons were all but unheard of, but they have begun to emerge in the world once again. Their traditional home is &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where they remain close to the great Dragonblight, the final resting place of dragons. The blue dragons once communed with the dead there to ensure that each draconic spirit made its way into the Beyond. Northrend lies much in control of the Scourge, but blues still make pilgrimages to the dark northlands, seeking answers hidden among the bones of their dead. The most powerful blue dragon sorcerers claim that the spirits of the dead tell them a new upheaval is on its way, a cataclysm that will outweigh any trouble the world of Azeroth has yet endured. The blue dragons say this often, no matter what disaster the world suffers, so few have given their words much credence this time. More and more dragons however, migrate to the caverns of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. This migration occurs for two main reasons: First, because of the growing concern about another imminent attack on the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;; and second, to retreat from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, which some dragons see as a threat the dragonflight is not prepared to conquer.\nBlue dragons are a bit xenophobic, keeping to their territories and maintaining their own studies without interference. They are highly territorial, largely due to their paranoia that any intruder wandering into their lairs are probably agents of the black dragonflight, and won't hesitate to attack if his territory is invaded. Under such circumstances, a blue dragon is as violent and destructive as any black dragon. In previous years, blue dragons even attacked each other over territorial disputes, but such conflicts are unlikely now that so many dragons have adapted to living in groups for protection.\nIn modern days blue dragons are rare and difficult to find, thus their society does not have a rigid hierarchy. Although some great blue dragons remain in the world, they are few and far between, studying their magic almost to the exclusion of all else. All blue dragons serve Malygos with roughly equal standing, although there are some ancient dragons who are considered authority figures simply due to their great knowledge and mastery of magic. In essence, it is a society ruled by the powerful, but in a group of intellectuals such as these any real ranking system would do nothing but cause endless debate. Males and females have equal standing in the blue dragon society, although usually, it is the female who chooses her mate. With a few exceptions, blue dragons usually take only a single mate, and they are immensely protective of their mates and children. Female blue dragons sometimes stalk and observe a potential mate in a number of different forms to gauge the male's worth before revealing themselves.\nStudies.\nBlue dragons are the undisputed masters of magic, their culture revolving around the study and cataloging of magic and spells, primarily but not exclusively &lt;a href=\"arcane%20magic\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;. They focus on advancing in spellcasting ability, and the acquisition of knowledge and greater magical power to the exclusion of almost everything else, but this is not to say they are single-minded. Rather, the dragons are extremely loyal and know that the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s gave their master his domain so that they would use their magic to keep the world safe. As such, the \"proper\" use of magic is a matter of great importance to the dragons \u2014 while blue dragons are naturally curious about the use of warlock magic and the like, they consider such forms of magic to be perversions of nature. For this reason, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s are considered enemies of the dragonflight, although the dragons have higher priorities on their hit list \u2014 namely every living &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;. In their pursuit of magic, blue dragons infiltrate mortal societies in humanoid forms to learn more about how mortals practice spellcasting. While some dragons have engaged in this activity for centuries, it has been widespread only since Malygos's recent recovery from years of insanity.\nWhile the dragons are primarily interested in arcane magic, other forms interest them as well, especially those that do not require the worship of a divine being. For this reason, a number of blue dragons engage in a scholarly study of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. It isn't surprising to find blue dragons in the ranks of many mortal orders: the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, naturally, but also orders dedicated to the Light such as the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to their noted obsession with magic, blue dragons also enjoy researching other subjects. They could be called the academics among dragons; they have begun to serve more and more as the teachers of younger members of other species. While in humanoid form, many dragons also notice the scientific discoveries of other races and take an increasing interest in the development of engineering and similar studies. Blue dragons are scholars and often learn many languages, posing as mortal wizards and even paladins to better study the magical progress of the younger races. Many strive to impress their master, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. Members of the blue flight value other thinkers such as writers, artist, spellcasters, academic types, and engineers. They have associated with the &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; for the centuries, and more recently they study the unique skills of &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; engineers. They delight in knowledge and in samples of new crafts.\nBlue &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, more often than the dragonspawn of other flights, become proficient arcanists and rise to positions of power and authority within their broods, &lt;a href=\"General%20Colbatann\"&gt;General Colbatann&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; being a prime example. This is credited to the unusual intelligence and disposition towards magic associated with the blue dragonflight. Many other dragonspawn are warriors, rogues, hunters, scouts or gladiators. A few dragonspawn priests worship the blue dragonflight or Malygos, contrary to most blue dragon beliefs, but shamans and druids are almost unheard of among the blue dragonflight.\nFaith.\nThe blue dragonflight's belief system is scientific; they seek proof of everything and take little on faith or word of mouth alone. The dragons revere Malygos as a creator of magic, but not as a god; rather, they feel Malygos is simply the greatest scientific mind that has ever existed. Those dragons that know of the Titans respect them as powerful users of magic and as creators, but they consider the Titans good examples and mentors, not divinities to be worshiped. Likewise, the dragons respect the followers of Elune, Cenarius, and the other Ancients, but they do not worship these entities.\nMentality.\nThe blue dragonflight is focused on the pursuit of ever greater power and knowledge. This doesn't make them completely egocentric; the dragons share what they learn to help others of their kind as well as the world in general. Many blue dragons strive to impress their master, Malygos, with their knowledge of magic, or invent new spells or magic items. Members of the blue dragonflight value other thinkers, including spellcasters, engineers, writers, artists, and general academic types. If a mortal shows a blue dragon a spell he has never seen, they earn that dragon's respect. If they teach the dragon that spell, the mortal likely gains the dragon's gratitude for a lifetime \u2014 and blues live a very long time. Generally, members of the blue dragonflight consider adventurers in general to be kindred spirits, but they highly favor those who are clever, inventive and powerful.\nRelations.\nWhile blue dragons are slowly growing in numbers again, they lack the power to take on the children of Deathwing, such as Onyxia and Nefarion, directly. As such, the blues entrust favored mortals with the task of fighting against these powerful black dragons and reward their mortal allies with magical secrets and objects of power in return for risking their lives to aid the dragonflight. Generally, the blue dragonflight likes the mortal races, especially those that practice arcane magic, but there are a few exceptions. Most blue dragons dislike goblins since many goblins serve the black dragonflight, and it was a group of goblins that outfitted Deathwing with the adamantine armor attached to his scales. Also, blue dragons are wary of orcs, due to their role in enslaving the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in recent years. Relations between the blue dragonflight and the other dragonflights have dramatically improved since the fall of Deathwing at Grim Batol; many of the other dragons felt that the blues abandoned them after the construction of the World Tree; but now red, bronze, and blue dragons guard Nordrassil together once again.\nCorruption.\nBlue dragons are some of the foremost arcane spellcasters on Azeroth. As such, some are concerned that the demons' taint may touch and corrupt the dragonflight. These concerns are unfounded; blue dragons, blue wyrmkin, and the rest of the dragonflight are immune to arcane corruption \u2014 though no one yet understands why. Perhaps they have mastered magic to such an extent that they surpassed the danger. If this is true, perhaps arcanists of other races can achieve similar transcendence.\nHistory.\nFor thousands of years, Malygos' children prospered and experimented with the eldritch powers of the universe, unrivaled in their mastery of arcane power. The blue dragons were numerous and co-existed peacefully with the other dragonflights, working together to safeguard their world. But this age would not last forever.\nAt the hour of Deathwing's betrayal, Malygos narrowly managed to raise a protective spell fast enough to survive, and only a handful of others reached the safety of his barrier in time. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion retreated, leaving the blue dragonflight broken in his wake.\nAfter having nearly wiped out the flight, the black dragons were not ready to leave the last few blues in peace. The survivors of the blue flight had fled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, when Deathwing attacked, slaughtering them by the dozens. The survivors fought back but were no match for Deathwing's ferocity. In the process, their homes were destroyed and the land so damaged it could never recover. The area became the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Over what is now &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; another battle between the blacks and blues was waged. The dying blues released their magic and it sprinkled down to cover the landscape. Finally, an elder blue wyrm, beset by many blacks, released a spell to turn his attackers into stone, but the magic blanketing the area amplified the spell and crystallized the landscape.\nBlue Dragons were rarely seen, and most of the survivors had gone into hiding from the blacks. For thousands of years, none but a few of the most ancient dragons knew of Malygos's whereabouts, and much of his dragonflight hid in solitude, realizing their fight against Deathwing was doomed without their leader.\nFollowing Deathwing's retreat at the Battle of Grim Batol, the black dragonflight became less organized, allowing the blues the chance to strike back against the murderous dragons who hunted them for millennia. &lt;a href=\"General%20Cobaltann\"&gt;General Cobaltann&lt;/a&gt;, one of the eldest and most powerful of the blue dragonspawn, organized an army to protect all creatures against the threat of the black dragonflight hoping it would grow strong enough to obliterate the black dragonflight. Since the blue dragonflight was so long secluded from the affairs of mortals, most were pleasantly surprised at the progress humans and high elves had made. Their pride in the accomplishments of these races allowed them to justify taking humanoid form to trade secrets with the mortals.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, blue dragons were stationed at &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;, where they, along with the reds, greens, and bronzes, guarded the World Tree from another attack by the remnants of the Burning Legion in &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. They also kept an eye on the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from the caverns of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. The blues are concerned the demons there would eventually launch another attack against &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and the dragons stationed there.\nBlue Dragon Society.\nThe blue dragons' Aspect is the massive blue wyrm known as &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of Magic. He is said to have established magic itself and created all the spells that set the sky and earth into motion. While he is not revered as a god, for blue dragons see no godhood in scientific fact, he is considered the greatest scientific mind ever to have existed in the &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;multiverse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey have high magic resistances and can withstand many magical attacks.\nA blue dragon does not hesitate to attack if his territory is disturbed or invaded and is somewhat xenophobic. A blue dragon can be as violent and destructive as any black. The blue dragonflight was almost driven to extinction by Deathwing, and so blue dragons are rare and difficult to find.\nThey are native to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, remaining close to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, and once communed with the dead there to ensure that each draconic spirit made its way into the Beyond. Although the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; controls much of Northrend, the blue dragons still visit Northrend.\nCombat.\nBlue dragons are not cruel beasts, preferring a quick kill for enemies and prey alike. They often use their abilities and spells from afar, camouflaging their approach in fog and other foul weather to gain the advantage of surprise. They are excellent tacticians and attempt to damage or disable any opposing spellcasters before they commit to a physical attack. Blue dragons prefer to fight from the air, using spells and breath weapons to their fullest. Even when an enemy is routed, blues seldom land, instead swooping overhead to further panic their prey. Blues do not land unless there is an immediate need or unless all opposition is destroyed.\nBlue dragons are slim and regal, and the glow of intelligence shines brightly in their eyes. Blue dragons are no smaller than the average dragon, but they tend to be thin and sinuous in form. Most blues have scales the color of ice, but some have scales that resemble the sky or a type of gem. Some dragons are named or nicknamed after a gemstone type that their skin resembles. Many dragons also mark their scales with eldritch runes, which serve the same function as tattoos do for humanoids, as well as potentially having magical effects. Male and female blue dragons are nearly indistinguishable to most humanoids, but according to some ancient texts males tend to have straighter and thicker horns, while the female's horns tend to look more rounded.\nNotes.\n\"Azure\" and \"cobalt\" are usually associated with the blue dragons."}

During the ordering of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; blessed &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his flight with power over the arcane and the duty of ensuring it would never be abused. Malygos and his mate &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; ruled the blue flight until the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when the crazed &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to wipe out the majority of the flight, leaving only Malygos and precious few eggs left. The event left Malygos both weakened and depressed.\nThe flight slowly but surely recovered over the millennia, until the ambitious young dragons &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; attempted to bring Malygos out of his stupor. They were successful, but rather than lead their flight as the noble and wise leader they had hoped for, Malygos was appalled at what he saw as the overuse of magic in the world. Rallying his flight and all the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s supporting his cause, Malygos began the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to subjugate or wipe out all magic usage on Azeroth. He was opposed by many mortal organizations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and the other dragonflights under the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;; the war ultimately ended in the Aspect's demise.\nAfter the death of Malygos, the blue dragonflight had to choose a leader who would become the new Aspect of Magic. It was ultimately narrowed between Malygos' son, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, and the dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;; though the former ultimately sided with Deathwing, leading to his demise. Chosen by his kind and empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos became the new Steward of Magic among the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;. After the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of Deathwing, the blue dragons were left in a state of disarray. More and more left their home at the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; daily, until finally Kalecgos declared the flight disbanded and all blue dragons free to follow their own individual desires. \nSeveral years later, during the , Kalecgos realized his error and pledged himself to reunite his flight. He set out with the aid of his allies to bring the various blue dragons of the world back together; aided primarily by &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, and the simulacrum of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;. This reunited the dragonflight once more as a family, vowing to uphold their oath.\nCulture.\n\"The blue dragonflight, while ruled by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the lord of magic, was all but devastated by the evil &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Though there are few great blue dragons left in the world, their magical powers are awesome to behold. Native to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the few blues stay relatively close to the great &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, where they commune with the ancient dragon spirits who died in ages past. Their freezing breath and gargantuan claws have been the death of many hapless travelers in Northrend.\"\nMagic is what most concerns the members of the blue dragonflight. Acquiring it, researching it, cataloging it. Blue dragons are masters of the arcane and they wield it with a natural, almost intrinsic, ease. Even the flight's dragonspawn armies are flush with magical aptitude. The blues believe that with this power comes a certain responsibility and so members of the blue flight can often be found in positions policing and monitoring the use of magic by non-dragons. However, as they love their rules, they have a hard time understanding that sometimes you just need to let something \"&lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;grow&lt;/a&gt;\".\nTheir traditional home is &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where they remain close to the great Dragonblight. Historically, blue dragons have had a reputation for spending their days in solitary contemplation of the secrets of the world, but in recent times blue dragons have proved to be more social due to the growing threats to all living creatures. Their approach towards mortals, specifically arcane spellcasters, can vary anywhere from amiable curiosity to outright hostility.\nOf all the dragonflights, the blues are the ones most drawn to order and calmness. Ironically, this made them the ones least able to deal with the chaos caused by Malygos' insanity and eventual death.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; exposed &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; to the nether energies of the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, Malygos' insanity was calmed. Unfortunately, this led to the brutal &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, as Malygos rallied his flight to oppose all magic being used in the world, as he decided it was far too rampant. In the aftermath of the war, the blue dragonflight was left shattered and without a leader. To make matters worse, one of the lead candidates, Malygos' heir, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, sided with their ancient enemy, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, in order to try and take command as the new aspect of magic. While this ultimately led to Arygos' death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;, it traumatized his sister, &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos was chosen to lead their flight, though he eventually chose to disband the flight, an action he would later come to regret. &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; and several other dragons have criticized his decision heavily, with Azuregos becoming the steward of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that the various secrets that were abandoned within it would not be abused by mortals.\nDespite the disbanding of the blue dragonflight, some clutches still remained, such as the &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;Azurewing&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;. This group of dragons included many dragonspawn, led primarily by &lt;a href=\"Agapanthus\"&gt;Agapanthus&lt;/a&gt;, and shepherded what they believed may be the last clutch of whelps for their flight at the time.\nBlue dragonkin are sometimes referred to as Azure, Cobalt or Sapphire. When taking humanoid form, most blue dragons prefer to transform into &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, though &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; guises are also common.\nNomenclature.\nMembers of the blue dragonflight most often have names ending in \"gos\" for males, or \"gosa\" for females. Sometimes synonyms of the word \"blue\", or terms relating to spellcasting find their way into their names as well.\nMembership.\nThe blue dragonflight is primarily made up of, as the name implies, blue dragonkin. These include the blue dragons themselves, but also blue-scaled variants of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;. They later come to accept &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; among their ranks as well during recruitment at &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt;.\nA number of mortals have been shown to serve the blue dragonflight, primarily among Malygos' &lt;a href=\"Mage%20hunter\"&gt;Mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. They employ strange hounds, also known as &lt;a href=\"darkhound\"&gt;magehunter&lt;/a&gt;s, which aid them in hunting down renegade mages. After the Nexus War, the blue dragonflight has been shown working extensively with the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a group their aspect is also a leader of.\nHistory.\nCharge of the dragonflights.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; departed Azeroth, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over it. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, yet five flights, one of which was the blue, held dominion over their brethren, and were chosen to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, the Titan lore keeper and master-magician, granted the blue dragon, Malygos, a portion of his vast power. From then on, Malygos would be known as the Spell-Weaver, the guardian of magic and hidden arcanum.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nAluneth.\nAt some point, while manipulating the fabric of reality, the wise and mirthful blue dragons tapped into another &lt;a href=\"Plane\"&gt;realm of existence&lt;/a&gt; and made contact with the strange &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; entity called &lt;a href=\"Aluneth%20%28entity%29\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;. The blue dragons loved unraveling mysteries and delving into the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;. They were so intrigued by Aluneth's existence that they summoned the entity into the world for further study. Aluneth immediately went on a rampage through the blue dragons' lair, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. The arcane presence destroyed countless rare artifacts and tomes of power before finally being contained. The dragons were not angry about what had happened--they were delighted by Aluneth's capricious nature. After years of conducting harmless experiments on Aluneth, the blue dragons satisfied their curiosity and sent the entity back to its own realm. Later, the gifted &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meitre\"&gt;Meitre&lt;/a&gt; learned from a blue dragon about Aluneth.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently called the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to the world, the blue dragons were among the first to realize the potential threat; and when the Aspect of the Earth, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the demons, the blues were some of the first to agree to the plan. Malygos himself was one of Neltharion's closest friends and staunchest supporters, and he gave much of his own essence toward the creation of this object, called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The blues joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion retreated, leaving the blue dragonflight broken in his wake.\nDuring the struggle, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; had been thrown from the battlefield and survived, but his prime consort &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; died from her injuries after being flung far into the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;icy north&lt;/a&gt;, including many others blue dragons. Wounded and shocked, the remaining blues and the other noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion but at a great cost. Azeroth was sundered.\nKorialstrasz teleported himself to the icy caverns of the blue flight to search for any remaining life. He found none, save a few nearly frozen, but still intact, eggs. Knowing these eggs were the only hope of a future the blue flight had, Korialstrasz placed them in a &lt;a href=\"Pocket%20dimension\"&gt;pocket universe&lt;/a&gt;, where time ran ever so slowly, until he could pass them on to someone he could trust. One of those eggs contained &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing's betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, and the blues lost many of the few they had left. They would never again be seen in the same numbers as before. The age of dragons had passed.\nAfter the loss of most of his children and mates, Malygos hid out in his lair at &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, slowly going mad. Perhaps Malygos's last sane act was placing many of his surviving dragonkin in the caverns of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; to hold eternal vigil over the sacred site of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, location of the world tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. After that he isolated himself in his lair, refusing all visitors, while his presence in the world diminished over time.\nA few remaining blues continued their lord's study of magic throughout the millennia. The &lt;a href=\"Arcanomicon\"&gt;Arcanomicon&lt;/a&gt;, a map of the world's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s gifted to Malygos ages ago by the titan Norgannon, was continuously updated and revised by the blue dragons over the long years of Malygos's seclusion. Mighty blue wyrms, such as &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, continued to search for and hoard artifacts of great magical power, keeping them from inexperienced hands. When the legion was planning its second invasion of Azeroth, another agent, &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to sway the &lt;a href=\"Guardian\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; away from the path he was taking under the control of the Dark Titan, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 6,000 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, the isolated &lt;a href=\"Shandaral\"&gt;Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; witnessed members of the blue dragonflight using spells to crystalize living things and draw power from them. The dragons did that out of curiosity, and the elves saw a way to end their suffering. The Highborne attempted to interact with the dragons, but they ignored them or showed hostility towards them. As a result, Highborne &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s infiltrated the Nexus and succeeded in stealing the knowledge of dragons' techniques. Their greed, however, drove them to steal artifacts and triggered magical wards, sending blue dragons into a frenzy. Although the elven thieves managed to escape, soon the dragons' retribution came to Shandaral. The Highborne sorcerers gathered on a cliff overlooking &lt;a href=\"Moonsong\"&gt;Moonsong&lt;/a&gt; and hoped to use the stolen spells against the dragons. They prepared to crystallize a portion of the forest and use its power against the dragons. Despite their effort, the spell took an enormous size, casting a huge explosion. The torrent of energy instantly crystallized the entire forest of Moonsong and its inhabitants. The blue dragons, sensing the spellwork, successfully escaped.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nA thousand years before modern times, the almost-extinct blue dragons still managed to lend their aid to the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, a child of Malygos, the blues fought the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; masters furiously and ultimately helped push them back to their city where they were sealed away from the world. The dragons suffered few casualties but the progeny of Malygos, Arygos, was believed lost, having charged deep into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; during the final push. After the war, a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; was entrusted to the blue wyrm &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; the bronze.\nUnbeknownst to his flight, Arygos, along with Caelestrasz and Merithra, was not dead, simply captured. The dark master of Ahn'Qiraj used the tortured dragons to power his new creations: &lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s.\n823 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Guardian of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, sensed something dark stirring in the icy lands of Northrend. She traveled to the distant continent and found a pack of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s hunting errant blue dragons, feeding on their potent arcane energies.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; entrusted the greatstaff &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; to the blue dragons and locked it in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Vault\"&gt;Nexus Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nIn the events leading up to the Second War, Deathwing led a powerful orc warlock named &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; to the Dragon Soul \u2014 now renamed the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Nekros used the Demon Soul to force the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, into submission and forced the rest of the red dragonflight to serve him or risk the death of their queen. Korialstrasz, who escaped by faking his death sought the assistance of the other Aspects to free his queen. When Korialstrasz approached Malygos, the Blue Aspect seemed almost indifferent to the news at first. That is until the red consort hinted to the lord of the blues that as the aspect of life, there could be something Alexstrasza could do for him and his nearly-extinct flight. After heavy consideration and some coaxing from &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, he agreed.\nWith the Aspects convinced, Korialstrasz waited until Nekros brought Alexstrasza and her eggs out of the fortress, just as Deathwing had desired. When Deathwing made his appearance, Malygos and the others arrived and proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;the Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter having his powers restored to him, Malygos remained secluded for the most part but his flight did become more active in the world once again. Still recovering from the events that occurred ten thousand years ago, they nevertheless continued to safeguard the world from corrupting magic and those who would wield it.\nThird War.\nLike the other dragonflights, the blue dragonflight did not play any significant role in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, first &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, did however invade the icy lair of the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt;, where the wyrm had hoarded a great treasure and artifacts of significant power. The death knight, assisted by the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20lord\"&gt;Crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, quickly dispatched Sapphiron's brood and slew the ancient servant of Malygos, raising him in undeath as a mighty &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"The%20Siege%20of%20Dalaran%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;The Siege of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; mission, two blue drakes were ironically held prisoners in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, being transformed into flying sheep.\nThe Sunwell.\nAs of the aftermath of the Third War, the blue dragonflight was growing in numbers, but not fast enough. Following the Third War, which had ravaged the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and cost the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; their fabled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos and the blues felt a great flaring of power, coming from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Spell-Weaver, with no elders at his disposal, sent the young &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos's intended mate, followed soon after, arriving just in time to save Kalecgos from the Scourge. In their company was a strange young woman by the name of &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;. On a visit to &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, they were joined by the paladin &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt;. The four journeyed together, their exploits eventually leading them to Quel'Thalas where after being assaulted by &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; and an enslaved &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; they discovered Anveena was the new avatar of the Sunwell. Dar'Khan was defeated and Anveena was left in the care of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos, having sworn to look after her, remained in Quel'Thalas as Anveena's guardian.\nOutland and the nether dragons.\nAfter the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; by the demonic survivors of the Third War, Tyrygosa crossed through the portal in order to investigate the shattered world and the strange mysterious &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s found there. She discovered, to her dismay, the nether dragons were the wayward nether-twisted spawn of Deathwing himself, and that they were being subjugated by the death knight &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing his defeat, Tyrygosa attempted to save the fading nether dragons by bringing them to Azeroth, specifically to the Nexus which she hopes to use to feed and stabilize the ethereal dragons. The nether dragons however gorged themselves and grew mad with power claiming they were magic incarnate, and proceed to attack the blues. The mad slumbering Malygos heard this and awakened. Hearing the claims of the nether dragons Malygos misinterpreted their reference to themselves as magic and decided to absorb the nether dragons into himself. This empowered Malygos and allowed him to finally shake off his millennia-long madness.\nSince that time the blue dragons monitor the portal from their sanctum, and nothing crosses in or out without their knowledge.\nSecond battle of Grim Batol.\nA lone survivor, &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, overlooked by the blues was quickly captured by &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; and taken to Grim Batol to be used in her schemes to create the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos followed ultimately meeting up with the red dragon Korialstrasz. Korialstrasz sensed something happening deep within the mountain and returned to Grim Batol to find the black consort in the midst of creating the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, thanks to Korialstrasz's allies, the sacrifice of the nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, and the anger felt by &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt; towards his \"mother\", &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; and her creation were defeated. The mountain was once again abandoned, unaware to anyone that Deathwing lurked still deeper within.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke from his long dormancy, he journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Sindragosa's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, where he raised &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; into undeath as a mighty skeletal &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; and ordered her to lead the &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood\"&gt;Frostbrood&lt;/a&gt; into war. The Lich King then tore the spirits of Sindragosa's lost &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; into undeath in front of her skeletal form as a final affront to the great dragon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Sindragosa's Fall was crawling with &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; acolytes and members who were raising more frost wyrms from the ice. Later during the conflict, Sindragosa defended the Lich King in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; until the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who went on to slay him destroyed her as well, leaving only her skull behind. But rather than leave her to suffer again in some form, the adventurers took her crystalline essence to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where she could truly be laid to rest.\nNexus War.\nHaving awoken from madness, Malygos assessed the state of magical affairs on Azeroth and concluded that magic had run amok, blaming the mortal races and their reckless pursuit of power. Determined to forestall a catastrophe, the Blue Aspect decreed that the world's unbridled magic had to be reined in, and decided to fix this problem his way, by imprisoning and destroying all mortal mages and by realigning the flow of magic to point toward &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; gathered all this &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy.\nSo Malygos turned to the Arcanomicon to locate the ley lines, and tap into them using constructs called &lt;a href=\"Surge%20needle\"&gt;Surge needle&lt;/a&gt;s, maneuvered into position over ley lines by his flight. He diverted these lines of energy that coursed beneath the earth, where they were focused through the Nexus' ascending rings and blasted into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. However, this redirection carried disastrous consequences, splintering the world's crust and opening up unstable rifts.\nMalygos' siphoning of the world's magic did not go unnoticed. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, elite magi of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, swore to fight Malygos to the bitter end, going as far as using their waning powers to transport their entire city to float above Northrend, though several members opted to side with the blue dragonflight becoming &lt;a href=\"mage%20hunter\"&gt;mage hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Blue dragons, led by &lt;a href=\"Cyanigosa\"&gt;Cyanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, launched an offensive against the city. Their initial onslaught nearly succeeded in breaking through the shield but the magi of Dalaran were able to hold the spell, unaware that Cyanigosa had an agent on the inside. The mage hunter &lt;a href=\"Crevan\"&gt;Crevan&lt;/a&gt; had allowed himself to be captured, and when the opportune moment arose he manipulated his nephew, the apprentice &lt;a href=\"Aodhan\"&gt;Aodhan&lt;/a&gt;, into freeing him. Crevan released the prisoners of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; in hopes the distraction would work to Cyanigosa's advantage. The blue dragons pressed forward while Crevan attempted to bring the city down - literally - from inside, but Aodhan managed to outwit him long enough to stop him. The Kirin Tor, free from any distractions, were able to strengthen the shield and force the blue dragons to abandon the attack.\nThe blue's increasingly militaristic methods were condemned by the red dragonflight, who vowed to neutralize Malygos at all costs. To this end, they formed a council with the Kirin Tor, and the two groups began actively subverting Malygos's devastating campaign. When the blues dared attack &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the reds called upon the remaining dragonflights for assistance, creating the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;. Once again dragon fought against dragon. Alexstrsza and the other Aspects saw no way to end the senseless violence other than destroying Malygos. But the Blue Aspect proved elusive until &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;a key&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was found on the remains of the frost wyrm Sapphiron, a former servant of Malygos. The Spellweaver was finally confronted in his realm where he was slain by members of the Accord.\nThe blue dragonflight had been left without an Aspect.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nThe blue dragonflight faced a crisis that no other dragon in the world had faced before, the loss of an Aspect. Research indicated that one could be empowered during the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;, and the two major candidates for the position were &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, son of Malygos. Arygos betrayed his people to Deathwing for the promise of achieving the position, but in the end, the flight elected Kalecgos their new leader.\nKalecgos worked alongside the other Aspects in the final battle against Deathwing, using his new power to rewrite the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;'s magic and allow it to harm the Aspect of Death. At the end of the fighting, the Aspects became mortal.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nDeciding that the Focusing Iris needed to be placed somewhere safe, a squad of blue dragons began to escort it from the Eye of Eternity to the depths of Azeroth's ocean. However, agents of the Horde killed the entire squad and stole the artifact. Kalecgos went out searching for it because of his former position as Aspect, but was unable to discover its location until the Focusing Iris was used to empower the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; that destroyed &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBecause of their diminished numbers, first from Deathwing, then the Nexus War, and then the Cataclysm, the blue dragonflight decided to go their separate ways. The few remaining blue dragons have scattered across the world, no longer affiliated with any organization.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nWith Nexus abandoned, only few individuals remained to check the Nexus, such as Kalec and &lt;a href=\"Jaracgos\"&gt;Jaracgos&lt;/a&gt;. After Kalec relived the true history of the proto-dragons, he was reconsidering his decision to let the other blue dragons choose their individual paths, and he concluded that he could restore the flight.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"Lanigosa\"&gt;Lanigosa&lt;/a&gt; aided a paladin adventurer to retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and fight the cursed titan keeper &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt;. Azuregos returned to the Nexus, however, he was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum\"&gt;Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; as they sought to acquire control over the artifacts within the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20Vault\"&gt;Nexus Vault&lt;/a&gt;. A mage and a priest adventurer freed him and, banding together, defeated &lt;a href=\"Nexus-Prince%20Bilaal\"&gt;Nexus-Prince Bilaal&lt;/a&gt; and his followers. Azuregos stayed behind to secure the Nexus so it would not fall into the wrong hands again, and said to give his regards to Kalecgos.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;Azurewing&lt;/a&gt;, a remaining brood of blue dragons led by &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;, had made their home in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. They came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to drain the mana from the dragons to feed their addiction. They later assisted in defending Azsuna against the demons during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the fact that the blue dragonflight dragons went their separate ways, but seeing &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Mennar\"&gt;Lake Mennar&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; made him think otherwise. &lt;a href=\"Malynea%20Skyreaver\"&gt;Malynea Skyreaver&lt;/a&gt; explained to them that a &lt;a href=\"Sarcen%20Stone\"&gt;Sarcen Stone&lt;/a&gt; was drawing them to the area.\nAccording to a goblin from Winterspring, the blue dragons are still present in the &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; caves.\nDragonflight.\n20,000 years ago, Malygos had placed a contingent of blue dragons and &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; to watch over the slumbering &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;. These dragons had been on the island for all that time, and were unaware that Malygos was dead. After the events of the dracthyr starting zone, the drakonid joined the &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wings\"&gt;Healing Wings&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; reawakened, all dragonflights, including the blues, traveled to them. In the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, Kalecgos traveled alone to reignite the flight's &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;. When he met a simulacrum of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; she asked him where the rest of the flight was, and Kalec explained how the flight was disbanded and they had all gone their separate ways. After spending some time with the local &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; and seeing how they celebrated the lives of the dead instead of mourning them, Kalec put out a magical call to any blue dragons who were listening to gather at the Azure Span. The Azurewing dragons arrived just in time to save &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, and as Kalec restored the Azure Oathstone he declared the blue dragonflight - his family - renewed. Afterward, many blue dragons could be seen in the skies of the Azure Span.\nWhile many &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s had returned, and others had informed Kalec of their intentions to make their way to the isles, some members of the flight remained unaccounted for. After aiding &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, he created a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Locator\"&gt;Dragon Locator&lt;/a&gt; to help discover where the flight's missing members were. Adventures were subsequently sent to aid the missing dragons and while most of them decided to join the rest of their flight, &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt; declined because she was truly happy in &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Blossom\"&gt;Dawn's Blossom&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the blue dragonflight realized that the violent deaths of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; experienced had left them stranded in their final moments, they recovered their essences and brought them back to the Azure Archives. Working together as one, the blue dragonflight used the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy within the Azure Archives to break the loop of death that Malygos and Sindragosa had found themselves trapped in, and watched as Kalecgos and adventures clashed with them before they pair were properly soothed and released from their torment, and then watched as the spirits peacefully passed on to the afterlife.\nIn the aftermath, &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt; decided that the time had come for his long life to end at last and the blue dragonflight watched as he gave one last flight.

These are the leaders, the most powerful spellcasters, and the elders of the blue dragonspawn race. While all blue &lt;a href=\"scalebane\"&gt;scalebane&lt;/a&gt;s were &lt;a href=\"wyrmkin\"&gt;wyrmkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flametongue%20%28dragonspawn%29\"&gt;flametongues&lt;/a&gt; earlier in life, scalebanes are technically a different &lt;a href=\"Race\"&gt;species&lt;/a&gt;, having been transformed by a complicated ritual similar to those undergone by dragons as they mature. Scalebanes are chosen from the best of the lesser ranks, those who demonstrate exceptional leadership as well as combat or magical abilities.\nWhile most scalebanes are intellectual, they are still powerfully built for combat, standing 7 feet tall on average. They are trained in the use of all types of weapons and tactics. Many blue scalebanes carry banners representing their draconic patron or matron, such as &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nCombat.\nBlue scalebanes spend most of their time in combat commanding their units, but those with spellcaster levels pepper their enemies with spells from a distance. If pressed, they fight fearlessly, but prefer to avoid melee combat if possible because they know they are most effective in command positions.\nEach scalebane is always equipped with a magic weapon, usually a greatsword, which often has other abilities in addition to its enhanced magic bonus. In addition, a scalebane typically carries at least one other magic item, such as a shield, armor, a wand, or something that would benefit the blue scalebane's unit."}

{"id": "40858", "revid": "41364778", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=40858", "title": "Bluewall", "text": "Bluewalling, also known as blue shielding or blueflagging, is the act of attacking someone who has their &lt;a href=\"PvP%20flag\"&gt;PvP flag&lt;/a&gt; up when yours is not up. It is considered by some as dishonorable due to the lack of fair chance to attack you before you approach. While not against any specific rules, it is up to the player to decide if they want to be \"honorable\" or have the upper hand. Since &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; this is no longer possible, because players can no longer attack a flagged player without flagging themselves for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; first.\nOn the official &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard boards, some servers usually have some list or another of bluewallers, or if not, at least complaints against them expressing strong anger and frustration.\nThis phenomenon is, for the most part, restricted to PvE and RP servers as players can travel through many more zones without raising their PvP flag, and flagged players are generally an atypical occurrence. It is also difficult to define or even enforce since there is very little practical difference between suddenly flagging PvP and then attacking and attacking from behind a bluewall, despite the former technically not being bluewalling.\nThe name \"Bluewalling\" comes from the blue color of the text above a non-flagged player's name, rather than the color of a flagged Alliance player's icon, a common misconception.\nSometimes acceptable.\nOne notable exception where bluewalling is generally accepted is in &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"city\"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; where a member of the opposing faction's PvP flag will automatically get enabled, if they enter. Entering an opposing faction's capital city is informally thought of as trespassing and one can expect to get attacked just for being there, if you're from the opposing faction. \nAnother point of View.\nSome people, however, do not consider bluewalling an offence at all. On a PVE server, if you are for any reason flagged, that means you are subjecting yourself to PVP, period. That means unflagged people can attack, flagged people, it doesn't matter. That means you have to be really careful when deciding whether to flag or not. Sometimes Blueflagging is part of a strategy, when waiting for reinforcements to show up to start the battle, or whatever the case may be.\nAlso consider the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; class, which typically enters a difficult battle under stealth, in which case the initial PvP flag rarely makes a difference for the opponent. In face a Rogue can reasonably argue that bluewalling as a stealth strategy fits the overall character of the class.\nThere is another occurrence that hasn't been described here yet that has to do with the flagging process. When a high level character goes to a low level area flagged on a PVP server, some inexperienced players may unknowingly target and attack the flagged player, subjecting themselves to immediate ganking (most prevalent at Elwyn Forest/Westfall/Crossroads). While infuriating to most, that is just a part of the game, and should be just taken as a lesson for the future.\nUnintentional.\nNote it is possible to accidentally attack a pvp player and become flagged through careless tab-targeting, especially in crowded neutral areas with many daily quests and popular grinding areas, such as &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. If that happens the attacking player might consider using /sorry emote (even if killed) to let the other one know it was an accident.\nPlayers might also unintentionally flag themselves when buffing or healing a friendly player they do not realize is flagged.\nAlso note it is not possible to become flagged through use of AOE attacks around players or NPCs, the attack will simply have no effect and will not flag you. Bear this in mind if you are fleeing from NPC guards and you try and AOE fear/snare/etc to escape as it will do nothing. This behaviour also prevents griefing attacks where flagged players could stalk a player using AOE to farm mobs."}

One day, however, a group of &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the cavern and claimed it as their own, forcing the kobolds to take their candles and hide. However, the drogbar did not have candles, and so \"the darkness\" began to follow them, until it finally \"swallowed them whole\", allowing the kobolds \u2014 safe with their candles \u2014 to move back in. To this day, the Bluewax claim that if a kobold's candle goes out, or if they lack a candle altogether, \"the darkness\" will \"eat them\". A &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Candle%20%28object%29\"&gt;circle of six large candles&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the eastern part of Candle Rock. If an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; extinguishes the flames of all six candles, a large &lt;a href=\"voidwraith\"&gt;voidwraith&lt;/a&gt; called \"&lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Darkness\"&gt;Devouring Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\" will appear and attack them.\nLegion.\nThe Bluewax have recently begun taking advantage of the harpy attacks against the &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; by pillaging and desecrating the Skyhorn burial ground known as the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20Sky\"&gt;Sepulcher of the Sky&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"The%20Candleking\"&gt;The Candleking&lt;/a&gt; himself has stolen the skull of a long-dead tauren chieftain named &lt;a href=\"Oenia%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Oenia Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; to wear as a hat, causing Oenia's spirit to awaken from her eternal rest and ask bypassing &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to help retrieve her skull. By stealing and wearing a &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Bossing%20Around\"&gt;Skull of Bossing Around&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers are able to pass off as a high-ranking Bluewax and infiltrate Candle Rock without fear of being harmed. Before the &lt;a href=\"Bluewax%20Gatekeeper\"&gt;Bluewax Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; allows them entry into the Candleking's inner chamber, however, he forces the adventurers to prove their worthiness by sitting on the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Ordering%20Around\"&gt;Throne of Ordering Around&lt;/a&gt; and issuing commands to the kobolds in the cavern. Once these tasks are done, the gatekeeper lowers the gate and allows the adventurer to approach and kill the Candleking, who uncovers the adventurers for what they truly are by removing the Skull of Bossing Around from their heads. After returning Oenia's skull to her, she goes back to rest. If an adventurer chooses to return to Candle Rock later, they will find that the kobolds are now to them, rather than .\nThe Bluewax are currently in the process of building the \"biggest candle ever\" using the ear wax they have acquired from the harpies.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"Bluewax%20Drumtaker\"&gt;Bluewax Drumtaker&lt;/a&gt;s also managed to infiltrate the Highmountain tauren capital of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; and began to steal the ceremonial drums used by the tauren, which had been misplaced by the local children."}

These are combined into packages which are in turn hierarchically combined with other pledge packages for &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;s and rewards. \nAll of the Love is in the Air pledge gifts are non-functional as regards their name and picture. You cannot read a Bluffwatcher's Card.\nSource.\nBluffwatcher's Card is one of two pledge items (the other is ) that can be found inside a or a , given by Bluffwatchers as part of the Love is in the Air event. There is always one and only one of these two pledge items in each of these containers. (The Pledge of Friendship contains only the pledge item; the Pledge of Adoration contains functional gifts as well.) The odds of getting either pledge item appear to be about even, but in the short run you are likely to get a stack of one while trying for the other. \nYou will need one free inventory slot or a current stack of less than 20 Bluffwatcher's Cards in order to remove a Bluffwatcher's Card from its container. To remove the Bluffwatcher's Card from its container, right click the Pledge of Adoration or Pledge of Friendship to open it. \nIngredient.\nIf you have five or more Bluffwatcher's Cards in your inventory, right clicking on any of them will consume five and create a &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20of%20Cards\"&gt;Satchel of Cards&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nInventory space.\nThe Pledge of Adoration: Thunder Bluff and Pledge of Friendship: Thunder Bluff container items do not stack. Opening your Pledges of Friendship: Thunder Bluff should save inventory space, since both pledge items stack 20 high. It is generally useful to NOT &lt;a href=\"autoloot\"&gt;autoloot&lt;/a&gt; a Pledge of Adoration container - the Love is in the Air event items quickly consume any available inventory space. If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Pledge of Adoration to not autoloot it. You can then remove only the items that you need at the moment. \nBe careful when combining these into packages, the Bluffwatcher's Card pledge item stacks 20 high, but the Satchel of Cards package item does not stack at all.\nBluffwatchers.\nThere are both male and female s, so your character can use either a &lt;a href=\"Cologne%20Bottle\"&gt;Cologne Bottle&lt;/a&gt; for the female Bluffwatchers or a &lt;a href=\"Perfume%20Bottle\"&gt;Perfume Bottle&lt;/a&gt; for the male Bluffwatchers to get the \"give a \" dialog, if you want to gather these pledge items. \nAll of the Bluffwatchers are &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. For the Love is in the Air gift items given by non-guard NPCs, the race of the NPC, not the location, determines which city's gift item you get. Since all of a city's guard NPCs are the same race, the distinction does not come into play for the pledge items.\nTransferability.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item. It cannot be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed nor put in a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; tab, but it can be given, sold, or traded with other &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nDuration.\nThis item is &lt;a href=\"Thunder_Bluff_Gift_Collection%23Notes\"&gt;primarily&lt;/a&gt; useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year.\nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article."}

The 7th Legion stayed at the front of the ship to fight off storm drakes while the crew evacuated. An Alliance adventurer rescued the missing Legionnaires from &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s and brought them back to the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire%20Triage%20Camp\"&gt;Skyfire Triage Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing this, they became a recruit-able option for the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; after the freeing of Lord &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral units were seen aboard \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" when it sailed from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMembers of the 7th Legion guarded the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;s which contained &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; captured during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Siege of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Stockades were infiltrated by a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; group in order to free the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The guards, along with &lt;a href=\"Mage-Commander%20Lyra\"&gt;Mage-Commander Lyra&lt;/a&gt;, were all killed.\nOn King Anduin Wrynn's orders, the 7th Legion traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s mission of getting the Kul Tirans to rejoin the Alliance succeeded. They can be found aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Wind%27s%20Redemption\"&gt;Wind's Redemption&lt;/a&gt;\" docked at &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, where under Wyrmbane's command they work to secure the Alliance's position on Kul Tiras and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nElements of the Legion were also found on the \"&lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;Sword of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\"; they participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe 7th Legion was stationed near &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Plaguebringer%20Harris\"&gt;Chief Plaguebringer Harris&lt;/a&gt; developed a new bio-weapon. It was unleashed on them while &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions encountered &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tobias%20Zaren\"&gt;Captain Tobias Zaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Drustvar\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt;, some members of the 7th Legion were present among the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; contingent of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt; soldiers empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; who protect the people of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the bulk of the 7th Legion forces there moved on to where they were most needed, but a small detachment remained to keep an eye on Dragonblight. They gave them a warm welcome at the keep."}

However, Detheroc and Balnazzar remained a threat for her plans. With the information provided to her by Varimathras, Sylvanas took her forces to the Western Plaguelands, were Detheroc had set camp, protected not only the Undead under his control, but also by &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; and his resistance, all of which had fallen under Detheroc's mind control.\nSylvanas possessed two &lt;a href=\"footmen\"&gt;footmen&lt;/a&gt; and made them ask to open the gates of Detheroc's base, a necromancer opened them and seconds later Sylvanas, her forces and the footmen killed the necromancer and his soldiers. With her enemy sleeping Sylvanas is able to move her forces deeper into the city and one of their encampments. However with alone a limited amount of time before the enemy awakes, Sylvanas would either continue the strike to try an eliminate one of her enemies completely or establish a new encampment within the city itself. Either way once the time runs out and the remaining enemy forces awaken, they immediately run off to destroy Sylvanas's base outside of the city. \nAt this point the base can be abandoned as a new stronghold is established (or further reinforced) over the remains of the destroyed encampment within the city or a defensive measure is taken to save the encampment outside of the city walls. Regardless Sylvanas is able to secure her forces and launch continued attacks against Detheroc's forces. Over time the fight against Detheroc ends with Detheroc seemingly slain, Garithos freed from mind control, and Garithos and Sylvanas entering into an \"alliance\" to free &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nSneak Attack.\n\"Detheroc and Garithos' forces slumber, giving you the opportunity to strike their bases without fear of reinforcements.

These cunning, malefic beings once served as the demon &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s most trusted lieutenants. Yet, at Kil'jaeden's request, the vampiric Dreadlords were sent to watch over the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, and ensure that he carried out his orders to sow chaos in the mortal world. Though Dreadlords have been known to revel in the gore of single combat, they generally prefer to manipulate and beguile their enemies from the shadows.\nHero names.\n&lt;a href=\"Terrordar\"&gt;Terrordar&lt;/a&gt;, Nerothos, Bleakill, Necros, Fearoth, &lt;a href=\"Dethecus\"&gt;Dethecus&lt;/a&gt;, Maldibion, Nochthitus, Gholbine, Rashgarroth, Aramachus, Zilfallon, Lorthiras, &lt;a href=\"Zenedar\"&gt;Zenedar&lt;/a&gt;, Mullioch, Algammon, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Banehollow\"&gt;Banehallow&lt;/a&gt;, Ven'Gyr.\nInformation.\nThe Dreadlord is one of the most popular Undead heroes because of his massive versatility, especially in team matches. Though he is classified as a melee (Strength) Hero, the Dreadlord possesses one of the highest mana pools and intelligence growths. In single matches, a Dreadlord isn't as powerful due to his lack of support to an Undead army compared to a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nDreadlords should always be paired with &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ghouls&lt;/a&gt; during the early/mid-stage of the match, as they benefit the most from his skills. Alternatively, players may opt for &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; instead of ghouls, although this takes some time to start up and won't be as effective against ground armies.\nCarrion Swarm is the Dreadlord's killing capability, as it deals a good amount of damage against ranged units, including aerial that the Dreadlord cannot normally attack without the assistance of an orb. However, it should be the last skill invested into, unless an ally is also using the Dreadlord or ranged armies are being built due to its somewhat low damage which is further damaged if it hits more units.\nSleep is arguably his most useful skill, as it allows him to temporarily disable an enemy unit. Though it is almost negligible at first, level 3 Sleep is extremely powerful because of Sleep's naturally fast cooldown, low mana and prolonged duration regardless of whoever the Dreadlord targets.\nVampiric Aura is a powerful aura, especially when used in team matches and teammates are bringing in any melee unit, be it ground or aerial. At level 3, units under the aura's effect will restore almost half of the damage they deal onto enemies. This skill should take second priority over Sleep because of its usefulness with melee units; &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s become incredibly dangerous because most of the damage they'll take will be negated due to their strong melee attacks. If no melee units are being made, invest into Carrion Swarm instead.\nInferno, as the name suggests, summons an &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt;. It is a powerful creep that deals chaos damage, has spell immunity and permanent immolation. Upon making an impact with the ground, all nearby ground units are temporarily stunned, and all nearby ground units and buildings take impact damage. The impact also destroys trees, though this usually has no significant purpose. Inferno can interrupt summoned abilities, and also allows for killing potential with other Heroes.\nA Dreadlord will greatly benefit from mana boosting and regenerating items to complement his high mana pool and allow him to cast Carrion Swarm and Sleep frequently.\nSpells and abilities.\narrion Swarm.\nCarrion Swarm can cause great damage to enemy units, especially low hit point units such as ranged units and casters. Although having its fair share of advantages over Sleep, Carrion Swarm is less effective against clusters of units and costs more mana than Sleep. \nCarrion Swarm is also useful if another allied Dreadlord in the game is using Vampiric Aura. That frees up some points you can place in Carrion Swarm since they already have Vampiric Aura covered. \nAlthough Carrion Swarm cannot damage wards, it can damage both mechanical and aerial units.\nSlep.\nSleep is an incredibly powerful spell. Good use of Sleep can help determine the outcome of the game. Use Sleep on enemy Heroes to put them out of action. Use Sleep on Heroes that are attempting to run away. Surround them with your &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ghouls&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Abomination%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Abominations&lt;/a&gt; then attack them once they are trapped. Cast Sleep on the most powerful enemy units to take them out of the battle. If the player lacks poor micro skills, then Sleep will easily overwhelm them as they will generally not attempt to wake their units up.\nCast Sleep on the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Creep\"&gt;Creep&lt;/a&gt;s before attacking them, though it will not last as long, it adds precious seconds to save your units. You can cast Sleep again on the enemy after they have awoken. This is truly one of the most annoying spells to the enemy. This spell is even more powerful with multiple allied Dreadlords. They can put a whole army to sleep!\nUse Sleep on Heroes trying to cast spells that must be maintained such as &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, Death and Decay, Tranquility, Starfall, and Earthquake. This will stop these spells prematurely.\nTry to avoid casting Sleep until it is level 3 because it drains a considerable amount of mana from the Dreadlord's mana pool. You will find yourself quickly running out of mana and causing very little harm to the enemy with level 1 or 2 Sleep.\nNote that when Sleep is cast on a target, they become temporarily invulnerable for a 2 seconds.\nThe most common way to defeat Sleep is to wake up your unit by attacking it with your own unit. Be sure to stop the unit attacking the slept unit as soon as it wakes up. Sleep becomes less powerful if the enemy possess micro skills, but it can still cause control nightmares for them. Sometimes they continue to attack their own units after they are awake. This also shifts their control focus away from attacking you and more on waking up their own units which is in your favor.\nAn anti-magic shell will also protect the user from being targeted by Sleep.\nNight Elves can use the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Detonate\"&gt;Detonate&lt;/a&gt;.\nampiric Aura (Passive).\nThe Vampiric Aura works very well with &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ghouls&lt;/a&gt;. It is especially useful in large team games, where players' armies will greatly vary in each match. It is strongest with &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryphs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s, as they will easily shred any anti-air option against them outside of &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Batrider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Batrider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Engine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Siege Engine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBe reminded that Vampiric Aura doesn't work with ranged units so it's not useful with any unit possessing ranged attacks.\nIferno (Ultimate).\nInferno is an ability which allows you to summon an &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt;. Infernals have permanent Immolation, deal Chaos damage which allows them to do full damage to all armor types, and complete spell immunity.\nInferno is useful for casting on an enemy army. It's a great way to spawn in the Infernal because enemy units in the area of effect take damage and are stunned when Infernal lands.\nInferno can be used to interrupt spells that must be channeled.\nInferno can also be used to clear trees, but &lt;a href=\"Meat%20Wagon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Meat Wagon&lt;/a&gt;s would be more useful for that purpose.\nSimply target the Infernal and take it down quickly before it causes too much havoc. Despite being a summoned unit, they're protected by Spell Immunity which makes the task of removing them more difficult compared to other units."}

The Dreadlords Insurgents were commanded by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; returned from Kalimdor and while he secured his Kingdom, the dreadlords were able to discover that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was losing control of the undead. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had regained her own will, met with the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s in secret and they made a pact to kill Arthas. At the same time the Dreadlords strength, coupled with the Lich King and Arthas losing their powers, allowed them to gain control over the majority of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith their numbers and Sylvanas's assistance the Dreadlords prepared a trap for Arthas. Arthas was ambushed in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and was separated from his majordomo, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. The Insurgents undead then hunted Arthas throughout the city. The &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; battled their forces eventually escaping from there. He survived the onslaught and Sylvanas' assassination attempts, and sailed to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of Arthas being forced to flee a power vacuum was created in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, with there being three undead factions at large. One was the Scourge under Kel'Thuzad's control. Another was the precursor to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;; Sylvanas' forces and her banshees. Finally there were the Dreadlord Insurgents, retaining control over large unholy armies, including the mind controlled soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Lordaeron resistance&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;.\nKel'Thuzad chose not to interfere and was not seen for the most part of the Scourge Civil War. Sylvanas, on the other hand, was offered a place in the new order that was being forged by the Insurgents. She refused, and Varimathras launched an assault upon her base. Sylvanas improvised, and possessed local creatures using banshees to turn them against the Insurgents. In this manner she swayed &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackthorn\"&gt;Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly &lt;a href=\"Zul%27rogg\"&gt;Zul'rogg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Puddle%20Lord\"&gt;Murloc Puddle Lord&lt;/a&gt;. This gave her several factions of beasts to throw against &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, she was successful, and Varimathras joined her in exchange for his life.\nThe Dreadlord Insurgents still controlled much of Lordaeron, however. &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;'s pet &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; was protecting his master within a fortified city. With her banshees at hand, Sylvanas possessed the human gate guards and turned them on one another, allowing her army into the city by cover of night. While the soldiers of the Lordaeron Resistance slept, Sylvanas set about killing her enemies and taking the city. By the time Detheroc's men awoke, at least one encampment had been destroyed. This caused the undead to strike at Sylvanas's base outside of the keep. However, despite their best efforts, Sylvanas managed to secure her troops, strike out against her enemies, and ultimately gain control of the city. While Garithos and his men were freed, Detheroc's undead forces were destroyed with Detheroc himself torn to bloody shreds. \nUltimately, it was in Capital City that the Dreadlord Insurgency met its end. Sylvanas forged an alliance with the Lordaeron Resistance, promising &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; that he could have Capital City in exchange for help in killing Balnazzar. Garithos agreed, and despite tensions, Sylvanas and the Resistance stormed &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;'s fortifications.\nBalnazzar proved a tenacious foe, throwing both demons and undead at his enemies, but he was surrounded and the city was destined to be taken. Sylvanas ordered Varimathras to kill Balnazzar, and it appeared that he did so. Sylvanas then betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; and ordered Varimathras to kill Grand Marshal Garithos which he gladly did. From that moment onward, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; were declared, and they became the dominant undead force in Lordaeron. As time passed, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was to return to action and waged his war against the Forsaken, but by then the rebel undead were firmly entrenched."}

Korfax explained the lore:\nThe composition of Dreadnaught armor, according to the repeating quest &lt;a href=\"Binding%20the%20Dreadnaught\"&gt;Binding the Dreadnaught&lt;/a&gt;, is primarily &lt;a href=\"Dark%20iron\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt;, as Korfax requests endless quantities of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Scraps\"&gt;Dark Iron Scraps&lt;/a&gt; to construct the armor. How he manipulates Dark Iron without access to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Black%20Forge\"&gt;Black Forge&lt;/a&gt; remains a mystery.\nIn the the story is slightly different, as Mograine never was a member of the Scarlet Crusade and didn't wear the Dreadnaught's Battlegear in his life. However, his ghost was briefly seen wearing the plate armor set when he stroke down his treacherous son &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault&lt;/a&gt; in the \"&lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;\" issue."}
