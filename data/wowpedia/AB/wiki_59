During the time following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he ran extortion operations out of the &lt;a href=\"Jangolode%20Mine\"&gt;Jangolode Mine&lt;/a&gt;. It was in the mine that he was approached by &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, who had heard of his destructive power. She gave him a choice: Risk his life attempting to crush her, or join her and be rich and powerful. He chose the latter option and joined the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, acting as the foreman of their mining operations.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"In a fit of rage, Glubtok unleashed his potent magical abilities and reduced his &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mound\"&gt;ogre mound&lt;/a&gt; to ash. Upon hearing of his destructive talents, the Defias hired the massive ogre mage to supervise their laborers as head foreman of the Deadmines.\"\nAbilities.\nStage Two: Arcane Power!\nAt 50% health, Glubtok blinks to the center of the room and levitates in place. Glubtok then begins to cast Fire Blossom and Frost Blossom spells randomly throughout the room.\nStrategy.\nStage 1.\nGlubtok will alternate Fists of Frost and Fists of Fire. Fists of frost will slow the movement and attack speed of the tank and nearby players and Fists of Fire will cause his melee attacks to deal AoE Fire damage and have a small knockback. Glubtok will blink between fist cycles.\nStage 2.\nOnce Glubtok reaches half health, he will deep freeze the entire party and teleport to the center. He will then gain Arcane Power, causing him to float above the ground (still attackable by melee) and channel a spell causing him to shoot fire and frost at random locations, visibly marked. In this phase, the party needs to DPS him down while avoiding his attacks. He no longer melees and only uses the fire and frost abilities.\nHeroic Mode.\nIn phase 2, a wall of flame will appear and slowly rotate around the room, centered on Glubtok. It is easy to avoid, but everyone must pay attention to it as touching it will deal massive damage to any party member. Also, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Blossom\"&gt;Fire Blossom&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Blossom\"&gt;Frost Blossom&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn near where ever one of the spells of the same name landed. You should get rid of them as soon as possible as a lot of these adds will sum up to a lot of damage. It is a good idea for everyone to get together as phase 2 starts, because the tank cannot cross the fire wall to protect party members once it is up, and all adds that have been aggroed by the tank will be hit by any AoE spells the players cast.\nAny player who finishes the fight without taking damage from the fire wall will earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Ready%20for%20Raiding\"&gt;Ready for Raiding&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Gluth's appetite is so voracious that even the living were not enough to satisfy his hunger. It is rumored that &lt;a href=\"Feugen\"&gt;Feugen&lt;/a&gt; was said to feed him an army of &lt;a href=\"zombie\"&gt;zombie&lt;/a&gt;s daily, which Gluth uses to knit his own decaying flesh back together, recycling the remains of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; too weak to use in combat.\n25-man abilities.\nGluth.\nGluth has 8,436,725 hit points.

Vulnerable to all snares and roots.\nWhen Zombie Chows are hit by decimate they will immediately stop attacking and run towards Gluth. Should be rooted and AoE'd down. They will have approximately 50,000 hit points at this stage.\n10-man abilities.\nGluth.\nGluth has approximately 3,230,000 hit points. His melee is not terribly strong, approximately 3,500 on plate. Gluth is tauntable.\nZombie Chows.\nZombie Chows have approximately 500,000 hit points each. One will spawn every ~10 seconds from the grates near where you jump out of the pipe into Gluth's lair. These move at run speed. Vulnerable to all snares and roots.\nWhen Zombie Chows are hit by Decimate they will immediately stop attacking and run towards Gluth. Should be rooted and AoE'd down. They will have approximately 25,000 hit points at this stage.\n25-man strategy.\nGluth is one of the more difficult encounters in the instance from an execution standpoint. You will want two tanks and a kiting class. Paladins often work best with holy wrath for bad situations, plate armour and consecrate/taunt (any spec though protection is best). Most classes CAN kite the chow however. All that is required is maintaining aggro on the chow and running them around whatever slow effects are used.\nThe main tank should run up the pipe first, pick up Gluth and drag him all the way to the far door so as to avoid the Zombie Chow. Warriors are ideal as they can berserker rage to avoid Gluth's terrifying roar. The two tanks should taunt Gluth off each other every 15 seconds to mitigate the effects of mortal wound. \nZombie Chows will spawn constantly in the back of the room near the pipe from the grates. The ranged DPS and healers should stack up on each other ~30 yards from Gluth to aid the Paladin in kiting the zombies. The paladin should drop consecration on the stacked raid as often as possible while kiting the zombies around the back of the room in order to gain aggro on the Zombie Chow who should make straight for the healers. The Paladin cannot kite the zombies alone however, you will need assistance in slowing the adds:\nGiven that most of the above abilities have a coolown, it will probably be necessary to use a combination of methods. The paladin will need a dedicated healer. \nAs soon as Gluth casts Decimate, you will have a few seconds to heal the current tank before Gluth kills him. All of the zombies in the room will stop attacking and make straight for Gluth, the entire raid MUST slow, root, snare, stun and above all kill all of them before they reach Gluth. Use whatever AoE abilities you have. \nKeep this up for a few decimates and Gluth should be dead.\n10-man strategy.\nContrary to the tactics for 25-man, you do NOT need a paladin to help with the adds. Our guild discovered after our 2nd wipe (using a hunter for the 1st 2 tries) that our mage would be better. \nDrop into the room, in order, main tank, off tank, healers, DPS then kiter. Have your main tank pull the boss to the door at the far end of the room. Gluth will likely aggro before the Main Tank leaves the pipe, if you are the Main Tank wait to use any abilities on him until after you hit the floor as he may evade until he is able to attack you.\nTanking this encounter requires switching, and if vent is not available, make a macro with a &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Warning\"&gt;Raid Warning&lt;/a&gt; \"Tank Switch\" when the stacks get too high. Depending on your tanks, either have the main tank holding Gluth as much as possible, or your two tanks switching at regular intervals. In the first cast, once the MT has Mortal Wound stacked to 3 debuffs, the OT should taunt and hold Gluth for up to 15 seconds while the debuff stack expires on the main tank. In the second case, just have your two tanks taunt every time the debuff stack expires. As long as the debuffs are not stacked too high, Gluth's melee is easy to heal through.\nIf one of the tanks in your group is a tankadin, it may be best to allow them to kite the Zombie Chow. If you do this, a DPS-specced death knight, druid, paladin, or warrior, or as a last resort a healing-specced druid or paladin, can off-tank Gluth without too much problem. Have them wear as much tanking gear as possible \u2014 although paladins and warriors can probably just sword &amp; board while druids should stack as much health as they can and be in Dire Bear form and all three will be fine \u2014 and make sure that your main tank taunts as soon as their Mortal Wound debuff stack expires. Depending on your healers, you will want the Main Tank to allow Mortal Wound to stack 2 or 3 times, then have the DPS/healing-spec character taunt before the next Mortal Wound is applied to the stack. With a boss warning mod such as &lt;a href=\"BigWigs\"&gt;BigWigs&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"DBM\"&gt;DBM&lt;/a&gt; it should be fairly easy to make sure that the MT is holding aggro on Gluth whenever a Decimate is about to land.\nTank positioning doesn't matter particularly, but if your healers are not used to this fight it can be a good idea to position the OT behind or to the side of Gluth. After the off-tank taunts, Gluth will turn around, so the healers have a visual aid for the tank switch. The off-tank should then run through Gluth and stand next to the MT. Experienced groups can just stack the tanks next to each other at the door for the entire encounter. Healers must be very careful immediately after the Decimate. They must heal Gluth's target to over 10k health as quickly as possible after it occurs. If Gluth's current tank has any Mortal Wounds stacked on them at this point, it may be more efficient to heal the other tank to full and have them taunt, otherwise continue healing the current tank to full and proceed as normal. Healers should not bother healing the rest of the raid until both tanks are topped off, as all Zombie Chow drop aggro and move toward Gluth as soon as Decimate hits.\nThe trickiest part of this encounter is the Zombie Chow. As stated above, they spawn from the grates periodically. In the 10man you only need one kiter, and the most effective is a frost mage \u2014 if they are willing, have a fire or arcane mage re-spec for this encounter. Keep the chow as far away from the boss as possible, to avoid devouring, and use all slow/stun moves to aid the kiter. Do not allow Chow to reach Gluth, as he will be healed for 5% of his total health for each Zombie Chow he consumes.\nDon't try to kill the Zombie Chow until after a Decimate. Even on normal, they have 500k health and there is usually 5-10 up at a time, and if a raid can do that much aoe damage they shouldn't be focusing on the chow.\nAfter Decimate have your mage use whatever shield he/she has access to and use frost nova, the rest of the dps should then run in and Aoe the chow. In the case of starter raids (slightly undergeared) divert all DPS onto the Chow, leaving just the tank and Off tank on the boss. We found using 2Death knights and a hunter was sufficient to kill the chows before the frost nova broke.\nTips for kiting :\nOne of the hardest things for new groups is actually beating Gluth's enrage timer, once the mage has got the kiting perfected, you need to focus on maxing dps. Soft cooldowns (anything which resets in 3mins or less) should be used on entry, with heavy cools like bloodlust, being saved.\nThere seems to be a fault with the &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Boss%20Mods\"&gt;Deadly Boss Mods&lt;/a&gt; enrage timer, where enrage does not happen until 32 seconds after the mod declares it.\nWith your mage busy with the adds and your hunter/ ranged dps switching back and forth, you are heavily reliant on good melee dps to bring down gluth. Shaman totems to enhance melee damage, warrior shouts/ paladin blessings and death knights \"horn of winter\" should be kept up at all times, Gulth has approximately 3 million health (assuming that your kiter lets a few chow through) so your dps needs to max out damage as often as possible.\nAfter the 3rd decimate, roughly 4-5 mins in, you need to use all your cool downs, soft cool downs will have refreshed, and big cool downs like bloodlust should be used. Gluth should be at approximately 25-35% health. If he isn't, chances are you will not beat the enrage timer.\nThis is the point where you burn your mana, healers should be running low, so top off the tank and use whatever you've got to do some extra boss damage, before using your \"shadowfiend\"-type move. If Gluth does not die before the next decimate, you will inevitably wipe at the decimate, because the chow will be piling up and your mages will be oom. Have your dedicated healer leave the mage and apply some last min DPS on the boss. If he is below 5% at the next decimate, leave the adds alone, focus your fire and kill the boss, slowing not slaying the adds.\nAlternate strategy: Actually, you can tank the adds. We did it with a feral druid with about 32k health&amp;armor, 35% dodge (unbuffed). The tanking requires a lot less skill but more gear, and is demanding to the healers. 3 healers, with one concentrating on the add tank and one of the others switching to add tank when decimate is coming close. It is a bit demanding on the healers, but doable. A little bonus effect is that there will not be any stray adds, they are trivial to pick up when tanking, so DPS can concentrate better on Gluth. If kiting just keeps failing try tanking.\nAlternate strategy 2: When your raid is overgeared or your dps are just doing a good job (~2,7k each) you can simply tank him where he stands at the beginning and ignore all the adds. You will deal more damage than he can heal and he won't ever use decimate. So it will be just tank and spank with taunting. With this strategy you need only one healer so one can change specc to dps.\nSolo strategy.\nAgain, after the gear check that is Patchwerk, Gluth will not be threatening. Run through the tunnel, jump down, and nuke the plague dog where it stands. The healing from the zombies will not cause problems.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

This provides less space for the MTs to run out of place while feared, as well as keeps Gluth as far away from the zombies as possible. Two tanks are required in order to prevent the healing debuff from stacking too high, just like in the Fankriss fight.\nHe enrages 10\u201320 seconds after the third Decimate.\nThe Zombies.\nAdds will spawn at the three green grates near the tunnel from which you enter the room. They spawn approximately every 10 seconds. These need to be kited for 105 seconds until the decimate goes off. Once Gluth casts decimate, top off the MT (a druid NS rotation works well). This will reduce their health to 5%, allowing them to easily be zerged down. Be careful though, 5% is still 6104\u00a0hp, so you will need to group them up. They also however, lose all aggro and run straight towards Gluth. They must be killed before they reach and heal, so all DPS must shift focus from the boss to the zombies. Once they're all dead, kiting can begin again and the raid can return to DPSing the boss. \nThe Zombies have an \"Infected Wound\" ability, which increases physical damage by 100 for 1 minute. This can stack repeatedly.\n&lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt;s should be used wisely, if you choose to have an offtank which will start tanking once the MT has too many mortal wounds, you may want to choose the offtank to have a fear ward in order to get aggro (espacially if there is a big threat difference between the MT and the OT). By fear warding the main tank you ensure aggro, and allow the tank to activate abilities that increase the chance to block or migrate damage. Also by fear warding the Main Tank, Gluth will remain in the same spot, if the Main Tank is feared Gluth will follow the Main Tank, sometimes Gluth could move to such great lengths he gets in range with a zombie to eat.\nLoot.\nYou receive 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; at all reputation levels."}

Most glyphs are crafted by &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;scribes&lt;/a&gt;, are &lt;a href=\"Class%20colors\"&gt;color-coded by class&lt;/a&gt;, and can be applied as early as level 11. They can be removed at any time outside of combat using &lt;a href=\"Vanishing%20Powder\"&gt;Vanishing Powder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTo apply a glyph, right-click it in your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; to use it. This will automatically open the &lt;a href=\"spellbook\"&gt;spellbook&lt;/a&gt;, where the target spell will light up. Click the lit-up spell to apply the glyph. An ability that has a glyph applied to it will be marked in the spellbook with a pink mark on its corner.\nClass books.\nWith the removal of the old glyph system in &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.0.3\"&gt;Patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, a number of what were previously minor glyphs are now available as books and toys. They are all sold for each or found as drops.\nOld types.\nGlyphs mostly give convenient or cosmetic improvements, such as changing the visual effect of a spell, or give an additional effect. However, some have more substantial effects, improving or altering important abilities in a number of ways.\nExamples:\nMinor glyphs.\nMinor glyphs mostly give convenient or cosmetic improvements, such as changing the visual effect of a spell, or granting a new ability that is purely for entertainment purposes. However, some have more substantial effects, improving or altering important abilities in a number of ways.\nExamples:\nMajor glyphs.\nMajor glyphs feature spell changes that may increase the damage, or another feature of the spell. Some of these glyphs have trade-offs, for example increasing direct damage but removing a DoT effect of the spell.\nMajor glyphs were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrime glyphs.\nPrime glyphs were effective in combat, and generally increased the healing or damage of an ability. They were generally the most potent and important of the glyphs.\nExamples:\nPrime glyphs were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;.\nGlyphs by class.\nLists of the glyphs available to each class can be found on their own pages:\nHistory.\nInitially, there would be additional glyphs known as \"ancient glyphs\", added with the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Titans%20%28feature%29\"&gt;Path of the Titans&lt;/a&gt; system. When Path of the Titans was canceled, the glyph system was changed to three tiers - Major, Medium and Minor. In &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; this was changed to Prime, Major and Minor. &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; removed Prime glyphs, and added many new Major and Minor glyphs."}

{"id": "273866", "revid": "416633", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=273866", "title": "Hybrid Tax", "text": "The \"Hybrid Tax\" is a term used to describe the baked-in reduction of the &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es that can fulfill multiple roles. There is not necessarily a limiting factor that is visible in-game, nor is it a drastic reduction, and may be partially overcome with high skill. However, in general a class that can fulfill multiple roles will naturally have a lower DPS than \"pure\" DPS classes (&lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;). This hybrid tax is merely in place to maintain the popularity of pure DPS classes, since there would be a drop in their popularity if hybrid classes could produce the same DPS while having the advantage of taking on other roles as well. Again, it is not a steadfast rule or reduction but the tax is generally present and the reason why most averagely skilled hybrid DPS cannot outperform a pure DPS class in its element."}
{"id": "15000", "revid": "42038977", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15000", "title": "Hybrid class", "text": "Hybrid classes are &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es which can fill more than one of the core &lt;a href=\"class%20role\"&gt;class role&lt;/a&gt;s: &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt; (DPS). Realistically, no character can tank, heal, and dps at the same time, but hybrids are frequently flexible enough to serve in one role or another (no matter what &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; they have) if they have collected the gear required to serve that function. Hybrid classes are differentiated from &lt;a href=\"pure%20class\"&gt;pure class&lt;/a&gt;es.\nDefinition of a hybrid.\nThere are different views on how many possible functions are needed to consider a class a \"hybrid\". The most limited definition here would be any class that can fill any of the three roles, given the correct &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt; and/or gear. This definition would only consider &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"monks\"&gt;monks&lt;/a&gt; as hybrids. &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard consider hybrids to be any class that has two or more functions that they can spec for. If the definition is widened in this manner then &lt;a href=\"shamans\"&gt;shamans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"death%20knights\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"priests\"&gt;priests&lt;/a&gt; are added to the list of hybrids.\n3-way hybrids.\nThese classes are considered the truest \"hybrids\", as each of them can cover the three roles of tanking, damage, and healing.\nDruid.\nThe &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; is a hybrid of a tank, healer, and DPS. Druids are the only class with four distinct play styles because they can DPS both melee (in Cat form) and ranged spells (enhanced by Moonkin form).\nPaladin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; is often incorrectly thought of as a hybrid of a warrior and a priest, but actually a paladin's healing style differs greatly from a priest, and their tanking style from a warrior. Paladin tanks rely on magical &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools%23Holy\"&gt;Holy&lt;/a&gt; damage as the primary source of threat, and functions by the threat \"multiplier\" of &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Fury\"&gt;Righteous Fury&lt;/a&gt; rather than added threat effects like &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;. A paladin heals by spamming efficient direct heals, and not by using HoTs or group heals.\nMonk.\nThe &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; is a hybrid who focus on fists and feet to pummel their opponents into submission while using traditional herbal medicine with Pandaren martial arts to heal allies. \n2-way hybrids.\nFour classes, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, can perform two of the three roles in instance group with the right gear and spec.\nShaman.\nThe &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; is a hybrid of healer, melee and ranged damage dealer. They can also tank at early levels, but not very effectively.\nPriest.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; has the ability to spec and gear for flexible healing through the Holy and Discipline trees; priests can also spec into DPS through the shadow tree.\nWarrior.\nThe &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; can spec into tanking mostly through the Protection tree or into DPS through the Arms and Fury trees.\nDeath knight.\nThe &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; is a melee fighter that wields dark magic and runeforged weapons who can tank or DPS. \n= See Also ="}

{"id": "19285", "revid": "48774054", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19285", "title": "Hydra", "text": "Hydras are three-headed amphibious beasts native to both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Historians have long disagreed about whether the immense hydras of Azeroth and Outland share a common ancestor. What is clear, however, is that these ruthless creatures have existed on both realms since ancient times. Each head appears to display a level of independent behavior. The forms of hydras vary somewhat between the two worlds.\nTwo-legged Azeroth hydras.\nHydras in Azeroth are found along the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, and were also found in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; when it was &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;under attack by the Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;. Some seem to be intelligent and might be the favored pets or servants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aku%27mai\"&gt;Aku'mai&lt;/a&gt; carries within her a small measure of the Old Gods' power. This three-headed hydra is greatly feared for her mindless savagery and insatiable hunger for living flesh, but the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; worships her as a divine sign that the Old Gods will soon return. They are reportedly difficult to kill, both because their wounds heal quickly and, when another creature would die from similar wounds, they split into two smaller hydras. This phenomenon is not observed in World of Warcraft, however. Some savage creatures discover ways to use hydras as guardians, though these creatures are by no means domesticated.\nThe hydras of the Broken Isles, however, look similar to those found on Draenor (see below).\nOutland hydras.\nBefore its destruction, Draenor's hydras resembled Azeroth's but had four legs and longer bodies.\nOutland hydras have a more alien appearance. The outer two of their heads are small and have horns growing out the sides, several small eyes on each side, and no visible lower jaw. The middle head is larger and is notable for a single eye in the center of its face. They are commonly found in the lakes and pools of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, such as the famous &lt;a href=\"Ghaz%27an\"&gt;Ghaz'an&lt;/a&gt;, a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Underbog\"&gt;Underbog&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; know how to make armor from hydra hides. However the older the animal becomes, the hide becomes too soft to be effective armor.\nIn Netherstorm's Ethereal Eco-Domes, there is a single hydra called Markaru whose natural growth has been accelerated by the Ethereal technology. Aurine Moonblaze, an envoy of the Cenarion Expedition that was sent to investigate the technology, tasks you with retrieving its heart for study.\nHydras with submerged bodies.\nWitnessed only on Azeroth, these hydras are seemingly so massive that only their heads have ever been seen, while their bodies remain submerged beneath water or sand.\nFour-legged hydras.\nFour-legged hydras are found on both Azeroth and Draenor.\nOn Azeroth.\nFour-legged hydras can be found in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, notably populating the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Strand\"&gt;Ashen Strand&lt;/a&gt;. There, hydras of multiple different groups are fighting against each other for territory, with three identified groups (&lt;a href=\"Siltridge%20Hydra\"&gt;Siltridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Voidscale%20Hydra\"&gt;Voidscale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonemaw%20Devourer\"&gt;Stonemaw&lt;/a&gt;) each led by a different &lt;a href=\"Scale%20Matriarch%20Zodia\"&gt;Scale Matriarch&lt;/a&gt;.\nOthers can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, particularly in the regions of &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, as well as in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;many other islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn Draenor.\nThe hydras of Draenor are large, three-headed, four-legged reptiles with various elemental or natural breath abilities. Most hydras live on Draenor's shores, but some can be found in swampy areas inland. Despite often living among &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20encroachment\"&gt;the mushrooms&lt;/a&gt; growing near many of the shores, they are not always resistant to the infestation.\nThe different broods are often named after the brood's matriarch or patriarch. The main broods are named after four large hydras: &lt;a href=\"Lernaea\"&gt;Lernaea&lt;/a&gt; whose brood is green and use poison-based attacks, &lt;a href=\"Echidna\"&gt;Echidna&lt;/a&gt; whose brood is dark purple and use earth-based attacks, &lt;a href=\"Keravnos\"&gt;Keravnos&lt;/a&gt; whose brood is blue and use lightning-based attacks and &lt;a href=\"Typhon\"&gt;Typhon&lt;/a&gt; whose brood is red and use fire based attacks.\nAnother group of green hydras, similar to the Lernaean, called Varashian can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Mire\"&gt;Writhing Mire&lt;/a&gt; in north-western &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese hydras are captured by the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shattered Hand orcs&lt;/a&gt;, who use their venom as poison on their blades.\nThe ' hydra &lt;a href=\"Mragesh\"&gt;Mragesh&lt;/a&gt; was originally planned to appear in ', indicating a link between the two species even despite their different models.\nShadowlands hydras.\n&lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; is home to &lt;a href=\"mandragora\"&gt;mandragora&lt;/a&gt;-like hydras that are entirely plants, and not animals. They evolve from &lt;a href=\"lasher\"&gt;lasher&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOther creatures.\nWater elemental members of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Council\"&gt;Abyssal Council&lt;/a&gt; have been known to appear in hydra form, namely &lt;a href=\"The%20Duke%20of%20Fathoms\"&gt;The Duke of Fathoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Skwol\"&gt;Lord Skwol&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Frigid%20Lieutenant\"&gt;Frigid Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; is also an elemental.\n&lt;a href=\"Megaera\"&gt;Megaera&lt;/a&gt; is a hydra creature originating from a young &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt;. It was twisted into a multi-headed hydra and left to languish beneath &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s throne.\n&lt;a href=\"Mandragora\"&gt;Mandragora&lt;/a&gt;s, vicious plant creatures created by the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;, mimic hydras, but unlike other plant life have been known to improve on the design.\n &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; is also a multi-headed creature with a head of each &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther meanings.\nThe term \"hydra\" may also refer a &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; being controlled by another &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; who is controlling two or more characters at the same time. See &lt;a href=\"Dual%20box\"&gt;Dual box&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a hunter pet.\nHydras were made a family of tamable &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s with the release of the &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; expansion. When tamed, they possess the &lt;a href=\"Keen%20Senses\"&gt;Keen Senses&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nThe , a ghostly hydra and part of the three Spirits of Sholazar which are summoned as part of the daily &lt;a href=\"Oracles\"&gt;Oracles&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Cleansing%20Song\"&gt;A Cleansing Song&lt;/a&gt;, was briefly tamable between &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.0\"&gt;Patch 3.0.0&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.8\"&gt;Patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;. This was due to all three of the spirits being labeled as &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s despite Atha using the hydra model.\nAccording to a post on MMO-Champion, the &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt; PTR contained a tamed pet passive with a hydra icon and the ability &lt;a href=\"Bellowing%20Roar\"&gt;Bellowing Roar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this strong evidence that hydras were being considered as hunter pets, when patch 4.1.0 was released they did not become tamable.\nIn the RPG.\nHydras are three-headed beasts that dwell in marshes and in damp underground areas. They are notoriously difficult to kill, both because their wounds heal quickly and, when another creature would die from similar wounds, they split into two smaller hydras. Some savage creatures discover ways to use hydras as guardians, though these creatures are by no means domesticated. Hydras are fearless, because they know they are tough customers. They charge with little intelligence or tactics. Multiple hydras (such as those created when a large hydra becomes two smaller hydras) use flanking tactics and attempt to overwhelm a single opponent before moving on to the next.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt; a creature called &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Savant%20Hydra\"&gt;Savant Hydra&lt;/a&gt; is described however the validity of the source is disputed."}

They are sworn enemies of the armies of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Acting on rumors planted by &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, they worked to banish Ragnaros back into the Elemental Plane, offering aid and rewards to anyone who would challenge the Firelord.\nBackground.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAdventurers heard about the Hydraxian Waterlords from the gossiping &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Patron%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Grim Patrons&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, some of them being worried that the water elementals could shift the balance of power in their struggle against the fire elementals.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt; offered quests leading players to the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; including a questline to obtain &lt;a href=\"Aqual%20Quintessence\"&gt;Aqual Quintessence&lt;/a&gt; used to douse the runes found near most bosses in Molten Core. This was required to summon &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;, the penultimate boss, and, after his defeat, to summon &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; himself. Since there were seven runes, any raid needed at least seven players to bring a Quintessence if they wished to finish the instance. However, after the patch, Executus automatically spawns once the other bosses have been defeated.\n&lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt; could once be found at the &lt;a href=\"coordinates\"&gt;coordinates&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his removal from the game, and thus the absence of any known Waterlords in the game world, the Hydraxian Waterlords still exist as a reputation faction.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Waterlords were in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and sent for help to the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Aquelian%20Honor%20Guard\"&gt;Aquelian Honor Guard&lt;/a&gt;s accompanying &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Aquaclease\"&gt;Champion Aquaclease&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; are members of this faction.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Aquaclease\"&gt;Champion Aquaclease&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Honor%20Guard%20%28Nazjatar%29\"&gt;Honor Guard&lt;/a&gt; are present in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; himself can't cross the waters and only observes them from behind.\nReputation.\nAll of the bosses in MC reward reputation until Exalted. However, it takes only a few MC runs (or a dedicated afternoon of trash farming) to get to Honored. If you're working on your Hydraxian reputation by yourself, or are below level 70 and can't get a group together, you may prefer to start by grinding elementals in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;; getting from Neutral to 5,999 Friendly requires about 1,800 kills, and thus requires several hours, but it will reduce the number of weekly lockouts required. At level 85 it is also possible to do a \"&lt;a href=\"trash%20run\"&gt;trash run&lt;/a&gt;\" of Molten Core, killing as many of the trash mobs as possible without engaging the bosses; roughly 2,500 reputation can be gained from each trash run, and it takes about 20-30 minutes. If you didn't kill any of the bosses, you can then leave and reset the instance and do another trash run immediately. Thus you could possibly go from 0 Neutral to 11,999 Honored in about four hours.\nQuests.\nHydraxian Waterlords currently offer no quests. Before the Shattering, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt; provided a series of quests; the NPC and his quests have since been removed from the game. Players gained no reputation from turning in these quests, except A Hero's Reward. The purpose of these quests was to lead players to the raid instance itself, and to other activities that improved Hydraxian reputation."}

Her love of these things vanished during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, when she and many of her kin were sucked into Azeroth's deeps and transformed into hateful naga. In the millennia that followed, Thespia remained a close confidant of her childhood friend, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. Without hesitation, she journeyed with her comrade to &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; and vowed to oversee the naga's quest to drain the region's water supply.\"\nStrategy.\nHydromancer Thespia is accompanied by two water elemental adds: &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Water%20Elemental\"&gt;Coilfang Water Elemental&lt;/a&gt;, each with around 16,000 HP. The elementals can be banished. They have a volley spell that deals approximately 900 frost damage. The adds should be killed before DPS begins on Thespia. They can be brought outside of the room where Thespia resides to avoid her attacks. As of 2.1.0, the elementals will now despawn once Thespia herself dies.\nThespia will occasionally cast a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Cloud\"&gt;Lightning Cloud&lt;/a&gt; which deals a large amount of nature damage per second when underneath the cloud. Typically if you're under the cloud for more than 2 or 3 seconds, you will die. Run from the cloud to avoid taking damage. The cloud will not always be cast on the tank (regardless of aggro), so healers and ranged DPS must be ready to move if the cloud is cast above them. She tends to cast the cloud on groups of people, so keep everyone spread out as best as you can. If you have a lot of melee, expect the tank to have to kite her around the room a lot. Nature resistance gear and potions can help mitigate any mistakes, but by and large you should seek to avoid getting hit at all.\nThespia's other ability puts the debuff Enveloping Winds on a player. This prevents the player from being able to move, which can be especially deadly when caught beneath a Lightning Cloud. (As a bear tank, I've only had this happen to me once in the time it took me to get exalted with Cenarion Expedition. Needless to say, we wiped.)\nIf your tank or healer goes down and you want to save a total wipe, you can drop down on the small ledge to the right of the top of the ramp leading to her room and run around out of LOS. She will stand there a little bit and then reset, saving you a walk back or running all the way to the instance door with her chasing you.\nHeroic.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Heroic\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt; mode, the elemental's waterbolt volley does approximately 1900 damage. DPS must be quick to kill the adds. The elementals can be stunned, significantly reducing the amount of damage taken before they are killed. You can also counterspell, bash, etc. their volleys. Also, Thespia casts 2 clouds at once.\nA warlock, although not required, makes this boss fight trivial (especially in Heroic, when the adds melee cloth for 1.5-2k). Repeatedly banish one add and chain-fear the other while the rest of the party burns her down.\nAlternatively, a sufficiently group may choose to kill the two adds first, especially if a reliable crowd controller is not available for the fight. The tank of the group can either hold all three mobs (which will put a severe strain on healing) while the adds are burned down, or the tank can hold one add and the Hydromancer while the group either kites and kills the second add, or has a hybrid melee class tank and kill the second add.\nAnother strategy uses a hunter to kite Thespia. Have the hunter park his pet as far away as possible - for example in the water on the far wall of the cavern - misdirect Thespia to the pet, and after Thespia kills the pet, the hunter kites Thespia to the entrance. This gives the group more than enough time to burn down the water elementals, and then fight Thespia by herself. Note: Thespia does not always seem to go for the hunter after killing the pet; however, if the pet is stationed such that Thespia takes a detour to get to the ramp, just the pet can provide enough time to down at least one of the water elementals. The warrior will need to pick up Thespia on the way back while the rest of the party finishes off the second water elemental if necessary.\nThe Vial of Underworld Loam for the quest &lt;a href=\"Underworld%20Loam\"&gt;Underworld Loam&lt;/a&gt; will not drop in heroic mode."}

{"id": "83343", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=83343", "title": "Hydross the Unstable", "text": "Hydross the Unstable is the first &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;. He is a water elemental. There are 2 columns which channel beams of energy into him. It seems that the beams are keeping his body purified and \"stable\". If he crosses the threshold, the columns will stop channeling energy into him, causing him to revert into his \"unstable\", poisonous form, causing him great pain. Thus, he is more or less a prisoner of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; in the Serpentshrine Cavern, forced to guard the way and to prevent any intruders from getting past. He could have been captured by the naga and struck a deal with them, with him guarding the area and them finding a way to purify his body. It seems now that he has no choice in the matter. He could also be acting as a component to a giant water filter, as before the fight his tainted spawn emerge from a pipe and are cleansed as they walk by. \nAlthough being the first boss raids meet when entering the instance, &lt;a href=\"The%20Lurker%20Below\"&gt;The Lurker Below&lt;/a&gt; is an easier kill, and it is possible to sneak past Hydross. Therefore, new raids will usually try to defeat Hydross after vanquishing The Lurker Below.\nPreparation.\nRaid Composition.\nThe frost tank has to take slightly more damage than the nature tank.\nPositioning.\nThe melee group needs to move with Hydross, on each phase change a few yards forward and backward. All other raid members should set up distributed, to reduce the effect of Water Tomb. It's also no problem to run through Hydross and set up on his back.\nStarting the Fight.\nPrior to the pull a small group (one off-tank, a few damage dealers and a healer) need to pull and kill enough of the tainted water elementals on the \"assembly line\", so that none of them take part in the fight as adds. After the fight has started the tainted water elementals stop spawning.\nHydross starts in his water form. Whenever he leaves the area where he stands initially, he switches to the poison form. When he's moved back into the two beams, he switches back to the water form. Form switching takes place whenever he crosses a \"magic boundary\" which runs approximately between the two small flags in front of him. Every time he switches form, four adds of the same type as his new form are summoned. If pulled conventionally, Hydross would immediately switch to the poison form and summons adds.\nDruid tanks can simply use &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Charge\"&gt;Feral Charge&lt;/a&gt; and start the fight with a full rage bar. If druid is off-tank, main tank taunts aggro from him.\nThe safest method to avoid this is to use a &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Invisibility%20Potion\"&gt;Lesser Invisibility Potion&lt;/a&gt;. The frost tank has to wait until he drops out of combat (because he is in combat due to the assembly line adds being killed), use the potion, walk into melee range and start the fight from there. \nAnother possibility is to use a combination of &lt;a href=\"Swiftness%20Potion\"&gt;Swiftness Potion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Intercept%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Intercept (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, to reach him fast enough before he crosses the boundary. \nAs a third safe method, a mage can use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, walk behind Hydross and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; there. Hydross aggros on the ice blocked mage and the tank has 10 seconds to walk in and pick up Hydross. The drawback is that this uses the cooldowns on both Invisibility and Ice Block.\nSwitching Form.\nDue to the stacking debuff, the damage taken by the tank sooner or later reaches levels where he simply gets one-shotted. Usually 100% damage increase is the limit, in water form this means 22k crits are possible. Thus after 60 seconds (= four debuffs), it's time for the current tank to move backward and pull Hydross over the boundary.\nThis is a most critical moment, because immediately after a form switch Hydross resets his aggro list and summons four adds. There must be no DoTs on him and all DPS and healing must stop for a few seconds to give the tanks time to gain control of Hydross and the adds. If some raid member on the wrong side of the boundary draws aggro so that Hydross moves back over the boundary, he switches form again and summons four more adds (= wipe).\nIn water form he should be tanked at his initial position. There's a step running in front of his initial position, which forms an angle. Just down the step near that angle is a good tanking position for the poison form.\nElemental Adds.\nQuickly killing the four elemental adds is a key to success in this fight. Good tanking coupled with solid AoE damage is the fastest solution, particularly if the AoE also includes Hydross. The optimal approach to this would be two Paladin tanks, one in Nature and one in Frost resistance gear. Unfortunately raids will rarely ever boast this luxury, therefore most groups will have to find their own solutions to the problem. Druid tanks work well, some combination of AoE and emergency \"point\" tanking by warriors does the job too. Resist gear is also useful on the add tanks. The faster the adds are killed, the less damage they do (since their damage is increased by the raid-wide debuff too).\nSoloing Hydross the Unstable.\nHydross is still immune to frost damage. Frost mages should respec or prepare to melee the boss to death.\nHydross is a tank and spank fight if one ensures that the debuff does not stack up to more than 100% increased frost/nature damage taken.\nStart by tanking him at his initial position. After 1 min, the debuff (Mark of Hydross) would cause you to take 100% increased frost damage. At this point use a defensive cooldown and drag him across the threshold. Once he is out of his prison, he becomes poisoned and summons 4 Tainted Spawn of Hydross. Quickly kill the adds as their damage can be quite substantial. Continue to attack Hydross. After another minute, the debuff (Mark of Corruption) would cause you to now take 100% increased nature damage. Again, use another defensive cooldown and drag him back into his prison. Here, he will summon 4 Purified Spawn of Hydross. Kill the adds again and focus on Hydross.\nContinue alternating between his purified form and his poisoned form until Hydross is finally dead. \nHe drops 10 gold and 3 epic items."}

Dire hyenas chase both lions and their smaller cousins away from prey; hunting in packs, they are particularly dangerous. Dire hyenas are about 8 feet long and 5 feet high, and weigh more than 800 pounds. A dire hyena pack often sends in a few of its members to harass prey while the rest of the pack circles for position. During this delaying action, the foremost hyenas fight defensively; when the full pack is in position it charges as a unit."}

The raid has to move up the mountain to the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Encampment\"&gt;Horde Encampment&lt;/a&gt;.\nJust like Jaina did, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; assists in person and with several Horde NPCs. The Undead Scourge and Burning Legion keeps sending necromancers, banshees, gargoyles, infernals, and even frost wyrms against the defenders of Azeroth. The boss waves are started by talking to Thrall, first &lt;a href=\"Kaz%27rogal\"&gt;Kaz'rogal&lt;/a&gt; (which was not present in \"Warcraft III\"), and then the last lieutenant of the Burning Legion, the pit lord commander &lt;a href=\"Azgalor%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;. Once again, after this the base falls and the raid must now help the last defenders of the world in the summit.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Village\"&gt;Night Elf Village&lt;/a&gt; are located &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and her Sentinels: archers, huntresses, druids of the Claw, and druids of the Talon. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; is busy channeling the &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil%20%28Hyjal%20Summit%29\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; as the players enter the base. Besides providing an important piece of equipment (the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Goddess\"&gt;Tears of the Goddess&lt;/a&gt;), Tyrande and her NPCs help the players by holding off invading ghouls, crypt fiends, and abominations during the battle. The raid must bring Archimonde down to 10% health, at which point a large group of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wisp\"&gt;Ancient Wisp&lt;/a&gt;s attacks him and destroys once and for all the mighty demon lord."}

Most, if not all, female members of the are warriors and train to compete in the &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet\"&gt;Hyldsmeet&lt;/a&gt;, a competition in which warriors fight to determine who shall rule by &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;'s side. They are constantly warring with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; in the name of the Thorim. They have a strict matriarchal society with the males, both Hyldnir and other races, as they think men are good for naught but slave labor, mostly in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Mine\"&gt;Forlorn Mine&lt;/a&gt;. Even females not of their faction are regarded with more respect than any man.\nHistory.\nThey are the servants of &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, a keeper of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. In these times, the Hyldnir were the allies of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s. That ended when Thorim's wife, &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, was slain by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim's brother. A war between the Hyldnir and the Sons of Hodir started after Thorim brutally attacked the ice giants that were framed for the death of &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;. Thorim exiled himself to &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; in grief.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; sent three emissaries and all were dismembered. Because of their disdain for men, most weren't interested in allying with Arthas. However, in the village of &lt;a href=\"Valkyrion\"&gt;Valkyrion&lt;/a&gt;, their leader &lt;a href=\"Yulda%20the%20Stormspeaker\"&gt;Yulda the Stormspeaker&lt;/a&gt; delivered the village to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for him making her &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. After joining up with the Scourge, one of the ways the Hyldnir of Valkyrion served the Lich King was by capturing &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s and their eggs and taking them to the &lt;a href=\"Blighted%20Pool\"&gt;Blighted Pool&lt;/a&gt;, waters filled with corruption and disease intended to infect them with the plague, turning them into &lt;a href=\"plagued%20proto-drake\"&gt;plagued proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s. This act marked the beginning of the war between them and her former sisters.\nSome time after, a raid of Hyldnir from &lt;a href=\"Sifreldar%20Village\"&gt;Sifreldar Village&lt;/a&gt; raided the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"K3\"&gt;K3&lt;/a&gt; when that outpost was first set up and took off all the men as captives to work in the mines, leaving the females. Most of them were later rescued, except for &lt;a href=\"Zeev%20Fizzlespark\"&gt;Zeev Fizzlespark&lt;/a&gt;. Trying to rescue him, the adventurer found a female vrykul prisoner, &lt;a href=\"Lok%27lira\"&gt;Lok'lira&lt;/a&gt;, who helped them get Zeev back after they helped her to escape. She granted the adventurer a Hyldnir illusion that allow them to confront &lt;a href=\"Agnetta%20Tyrsdottar\"&gt;Agnetta Tyrsdottar&lt;/a&gt; and free Zeev.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Lok%27lira\"&gt;Lok'lira&lt;/a&gt; wanted &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; to break out of his stupor and rally his allies to retake &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, she ordered the adventurer to enter the &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet\"&gt;Hyldsmeet&lt;/a&gt;, which they won and allowed them to meet the Keeper. After a short discussion, Thorim left his throne to take his revenge on his brother and stop the war between the races of frost. However, all of this was a plan of &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, who disguised himself as Lok'lira to trick Thorim into leaving the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, in order to capture him and take him to &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; Yogg-Saron used an illusion of &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt; to control &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. After Thorim was brought to reason by the adventurers, she transformed into a tentacle.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the tribe is still active in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, and still use men as slave labor in their mines.\nCulture.\nThe Hyldnir raid in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to turn the males of the other races into slaves. Thereby, a lot of male &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; work in &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Mine\"&gt;Forlorn Mine&lt;/a&gt; under the watch of &lt;a href=\"Mildred%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Mildred the Cruel&lt;/a&gt;.. They work the slaves very hard, often killing them when there is opposition. The leaders of rebellions are killed without pity.\nTheir disdain for men has one exception: &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. They run a competition called the &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet\"&gt;Hyldsmeet&lt;/a&gt; to decide which of the Hyldnir should rule at his side. A vrykul lady can't even enter the competition if she hasn't won at least one duel to the death. At the center of &lt;a href=\"Brunnhildar%20Village\"&gt;Brunnhildar Village&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Pit of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;, where they battle each other while riding on polar bears.\nThey use &lt;a href=\"polar%20bear\"&gt;polar bear&lt;/a&gt;s on the ground, that they have traditionally gotten in the &lt;a href=\"Hibernal%20Cavern\"&gt;Hibernal Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. For flying mounts, they mount &lt;a href=\"blue%20proto-drake\"&gt;blue proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s. In Brunnhildar Village, they nest all around in the mountains above the village.\nInspiration.\nThe Hyldnir are much like amazons, as they are warrior-women who hate men and use them for slaves."}

After he is defeated by champions, he opens the gates to them and press on through to continue their trial. Hymdall is later fought as a bodyguard of &lt;a href=\"Odyn%20%28Trial%20of%20Valor%20tactics%29\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Hyrja\"&gt;Hyrja&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Trial of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. The gatekeeper questioned Odyn about \"being lenient with these pets of his.\" Odyn told him and Hyrja to fight to their hearts content to be prepared for the task ahead. He is present after &lt;a href=\"Helya%20%28Trial%20of%20Valor%20tactics%29\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; has been defeated."}

Her valor and courage drew the attention of &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"titan%20watcher\"&gt;titan watcher&lt;/a&gt;. Upon her death and ascension to the Halls of Valor Eyir has awarded Hyrja with her greatest honor, transformation into a Val'kyr.\"\nOverview.\nHyrja becomes empowered by &lt;a href=\"Olmyr%20the%20Enlightened\"&gt;Olmyr the Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solsten\"&gt;Solsten&lt;/a&gt; depending upon which mystic she is closest to. As she becomes empowered she is granted particular abilities that grow in power over time. Moving Hyrja out of range of a mystic slowly reduces that mystic's empowerment.\nStrategy.\nIt is important to swap Hyrja between Olmyr and Solsten every so often so her damage does not become increasingly high, if not in range of either Mystic she will gain stacks of each Mystical Empowerment. At higher gear levels it is possible to ignore the swapping mechanic and burn her down straightforward without dragging her to each Mystic.\nHyrja will use Shield of Light in addition to whatever Mystical Empowerment she has. She will target the tank and begin casting a straight beam attack that knocks players back if they're hit, do not stand in front of her when this is happening.\nEmpowered by Olmyr, she will cast Expel Light on one random target, the target of Expel Light should run away from other players so they do not hurt. She will also channel Sanctify, small orbs of light move out in a straight line from her location and should be dodged, as getting hurt by one also damages everyone in the group.\nEmpowered by Solsten, she will cast Arcing Bolt on random targets, this is a chain lightning spell, so everyone except melee should be spread so Arcing Bolt does not chain. She will also cast Eye of the Storm and begin channeling a room-wide thunderstorm, there will also be a large protective bubble at her feet, stay inside and continuing dpsing/healing will the storm continues. Range spread out immediately as she will usually use Arcing Bolt a few seconds afterwards."}

He and a group of surviving draenei took refuge in the halls of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe later discovered &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; leading a group of new creatures he had never seen before. Nemuraan demanded an explanation for the intrusion and used his powers to learn the new comers' language. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; explained that they were &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;an alliance of races&lt;/a&gt; from another world and have come to end the orcish threat. After some considering, Nemuraan believed them though he was still unwilling to show his people's hideout and offered to aid the Alliance forces in freeing their friend &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; by summoning &lt;a href=\"Boulestraan%20the%20Blinding%20Light\"&gt;Boulestraan&lt;/a&gt; and the ghosts of the draenei army that had fallen during the war. He was at first worried about upsetting his new allies but they readily agreed to his delight. Their combined forces stormed Auchindoun and rescued the dwarf, but he was badly wounded.\nUsing his Light-given powers, the priest healed Kurdran. Following their victory, Danath offered Nemuraan and his people to return to Azeroth but the draenei declined, stating that their place was in Draenor. He wished his new friends farewell and luck in defeating the orcs. He also stated that his people and the Alliance would perhaps one day fight alongside each other again against the forces of darkness; this foreshadows the draenei joining the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis status remains unknown."}

The town was razed by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; on orders from &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, who used the port to escape to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; left the razed town in pursuit of Illidan without searching for survivors.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nThere is no sign of Nendis in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". One can speculate that it was either washed away by the ocean or simply forgotten. It was on fire when it was last seen, so the naga may have just completed their task thoroughly.\nAnother possibility is that it is somewhere on the strip of coastline extending from &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; on the Kalimdor continental map, which is not a part of the zone in-game. Even with the reshaping of Kalimdor, and the possibility to use flying mounts in the old continents in \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", Nendis has not shown up.\nAs it was located rather north in Azshara, it's also possible that it was actually located in southeastern &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. Any ports (such as Nendis) would however be located at a much lower elevation than the rest of the zone, as Winterspring - and the mountains that surround it - stretch high above ocean level. However, the eastern base of Winterspring is green with forest and may have been a location of the town."}

However, he did not ally himself with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and as a result, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s, servants of the Old Gods, sought to capture him and the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Neptulon would later break free of his captor, &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt;, and return to the Abyssal Maw. Since the Cataclysm, Neptulon has rallied his water elementals to defend &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; on several occasions. The Farseer of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; convinced the Elemental Lord to pledge his forces to battle the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;. He also battled &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s forces during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAncient history.\nIn the beginning, the world that would become known as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. A nascent &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; maturing within the world's core had consumed much of the fifth element, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, and without this primordial force to create balance, the elements were thrown into chaos. The four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, who each ruled over innumerable lesser spirits, constantly clashed with one another on the surface of the primordial world during the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20wars\"&gt;elemental wars&lt;/a&gt;. Neptulon the Tidehunter was the wisest of the lords, careful not to fall to &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;'s schemes or waste his minions on fruitless attacks against &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;. As the other lords sent their armies to clash against one other across the world, the Tidehunter's forces would divide and conquer the enemy forces in brilliant routs before crushing them beneath colossal tidal waves.\nWhen the entities known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; arrived from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; and established their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Elemental Lords saw the invaders as a threat to their dominion. For the first time in Azeroth's history, the native spirits of the world worked together against a common enemy. Neptulon joined forces with Therazane; while the Stonemother raised enormous rock walls to corral the forces of the Old Gods and shatter their citadels, the Tidehunter and his minions would sweep in and crush the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; with tidal waves. Eventually, however, the elementals of the world could not stand against the endless swarms of &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, and were all enslaved.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Azeroth to battle the Black Empire, the Old Gods sent their enslaved Elemental Lord lieutenants to face them. Neptulon and his servants rushed to the aid of the other lords, but were waylaid by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, who managed to outmaneuver the Tidehunter's forces at every turn. Ultimately, Loken used his &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic to freeze and shatter the water elementals while Mimiron created enchanted bonds to imprison the Tidehunter. Neptulon and his water elementals were thereafter sucked into the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, a region of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nStone of the Tides and the Fall of Gurubashi.\nAccording to a book, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;The Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;\", the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s had access to a powerful artifact, which allowed them to gain control over the water-based magic. As later told in the book \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Gurubashi\"&gt;The Fall of Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;\", Neptulon sent his mighty &lt;a href=\"krakken\"&gt;krakken&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the troll nation. It is unknown whether there is a connection between the two stories.\nIt is also unknown how exactly Neptulon came to appear on Azeroth, thousands of years after the battle with the Titans. Perhaps a backstory of this event is similar to that of summoning &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; to aid with war (seeing as the event occurred when Gurubashi were preparing for some kind of invasion). This would mean that Neptulon is still present somewhere under the waters of the Great Sea.\nDecades later, Neptulon took a personal interest in seeing the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; extinguished so the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Tribunal of the Tides&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Tsunaman\"&gt;Tsunaman&lt;/a&gt; to do that.\nNeptulon had a base of operations on an island in western Stranglethorn. There, and in other places on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cult\"&gt;Twilight Cult&lt;/a&gt; set up ice stones to communicate with the Tidehunter's realm during the &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Midsummer Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nNeptulon makes his first appearance during the &lt;a href=\"Defending%20the%20Rift\"&gt;Defending the Rift&lt;/a&gt; quest for both factions where he and his minions battle the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; who are attempting to invade his domain through the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Breach\"&gt;Abyssal Breach&lt;/a&gt;. He clashes with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt; and appears to gain the upper hand over the sea witch until &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt; is called and attacks the Tide Hunter. Neptulon retreats into his realm, pursued by the vast naga forces where the fight continues on the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrone of the Tides.\nNeptulon appears in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Throne of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;, where he must be defended from waves of faceless enemies. Ozumat returns and, upon defeat, steals Neptulon away and quickly flees. Although heroes never continue this storyline, Neptulon eventually returns to the Abyssal Maw. In the remade &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic+&lt;/a&gt; version of the Throne of the Tides, which debuted in and tells roughly the same story, the final battle against Ozumat is changed. The battle concludes with Neptulon and the heroes soundly defeating Ozumat and the faceless, and Neptulon remaining safely in the Abyssal Maw. This version of events appears to be more in-line with Neptulon's later appearances. \nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s third invasion of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, deciding to summon the Elemental Lords in order to combat the Legion, starts with Neptulon. While Neptulon listens to the Earthen Ring's plea, he insists that the Elemental Lords do not work together. When the Earthen Ring says they will stand with him, Neptulon recalls one time long ago where he and the other Lords did work together (likely referring to their war against the Old Gods). Musing that perhaps there is still hope, the Tidehunter sends his servant, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Lord Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt;, to join the Earthen Ring at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeptulon sent &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Aquaclease\"&gt;Champion Aquaclease&lt;/a&gt; to help on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nNeptulon tasked &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Ori\"&gt;Farseer Ori&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"ankoan\"&gt;ankoan&lt;/a&gt; to serve him there against the naga. The Elemental Lord can be found in the waterfalls surrounding Nazjatar, and tasks &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Aquaclease\"&gt;Champion Aquaclease&lt;/a&gt; to fight the forces of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Neptulon himself is unable to enter Azshara's domain because the &lt;a href=\"%3ATidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;:Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, created by titanic magic, holds him back just as it does the seas.\nWorship.\nNeptulon is known to be worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Rockpool%20tribe\"&gt;Rockpool tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, who call him \"father\" and believe that he is the only one who truly rules the seas. He was also formerly worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodwash%20naga\"&gt;Bloodwash naga&lt;/a&gt; before they turned their back on him and chose to worship only &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. However, a few naga led by &lt;a href=\"Skar%27this%20the%20Heretic\"&gt;Skar'this the Heretic&lt;/a&gt; are known to still follow the Tidehunter, for which Skar'this was imprisoned, being considered as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;s with his followers by the other naga. It seems that he is also worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"Hagrim%20Hopebreaker\"&gt;Hagrim Hopebreaker&lt;/a&gt; says to the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeptulon is also worshiped by the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ankoan\"&gt;ankoan&lt;/a&gt; and sends his most powerful lieutenants to assist them against the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nNeptulon the Tidehunter reigns supreme in his domain, the deep ocean. Users of boats and other such water-crossing utilities risk his wrath; entering his domain without express permission is paramount to doom. He revels in taking those who feel invulnerable, especially &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt;'s rocky beaches and the flames of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; when given the chance. He rules over all water, whether it be the sea, the ocean, river or lake. All &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s worship him, as do all creatures that use water or the cold for their abilities. It is said that when an intelligent creature drowns, his or her soul will pass through his realm on the way to its end. It is supposed that he keeps those souls which amuse and interest him, but Neptulon only laughs at such suppositions.\nSkills and abilities.\nNeptulon prefers to toy with his prey, dragging it under the water only to let it briefly escape. Sometimes he will maroon a hapless victim on some lonely island and torture it with tidal waves and swirling whirlpools. He always attempts to identify those who cannot survive long underwater, dragging them away to deal with other opponents later. He loves to douse flame whenever he can and harbors a particular hatred of fire elementals.\nNeptulon is most dangerous in the water, and even more so when his foe also touches the water. If he or his opponent are land-bound, then he is weakened in his attacks. This spells destruction for most ships that cross his path. He can easily overturn even large craft of up to 600 feet in length, and stop massive vessels of up to 1,100 feet. Even those ocean-going behemoths that stretch to 2,400 feet can be slowed to half speed.\nDrench.\nNeptulon's touch can extinguish most flames of non-magical origin, save those of large wildfires. He has the ability to dispel even magical fires, but those are many times more difficult to drench.\nFrost storm.\nNeptulon has the ability to form into a massive swirling storm of freezing water, drawn from the very deepest part of the oceans and chilled by his elemental power. The storm is a 300-foot churning sphere of water that moves as he wills, at his swim speed, even extending out of the water into the air or onto the nearby ground (although at least half the sphere must always be in the water). Within the storm, he threatens all adjacent squares out to a distance of 25 feet from the affected zone and can make an infinite number of attacks of opportunity per round. This ability lasts for up to ten minutes, although he can end it at will. In addition to his normal attacks from that range, Neptulon may also perform any of the following abilities at will:\nVortex.\nWhen underwater, Neptulon can transform himself into a vortex once every 10 minutes; he can maintain this form for a very long time. He is 5 feet wide at the base, 50 feet wide at the top, and up to 80 feet tall. He controls his exact height, however, which at a minimum must be 10 feet tall.\nEven the largest of creatures may be caught in the vortex, and they can even take damage. Those who come into contact with the vortex will have difficulty in stopping themselves from being picked up bodily and held suspended in the powerful currents and even more difficulty in surviving. A creature that can swim is usually allowed to go free from the vortex, but they too, will have difficulty in living through this ordeal.\nNeptulon enjoys leaving any creatures within the vortex where he wants, depositing them wherever the vortex happens to be. Typically he does this in fairly harmful surroundings, such as natural vents, in deep water, or near other dangerous creatures.\nIf the vortex's base touches the ocean floor, it creates a swirling cloud of debris. This cloud is centered on Neptulon and has a diameter equal to half the vortex's height. The cloud obscures all vision beyond five feet. Creatures five feet away have some concealment, while those farther away are completely concealed from those within or on the other side of the cloud. Those spellcasters caught in the cloud will have to concentrate hard to cast a spell.\nQuotes.\nOut of the rolling ocean I rise.

He was tricked into making a &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;Blood Pact&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; the Deceiver, one that bound the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s into the service of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, he opened several portals on Draenor in an attempt to seek out new lands to escape to and conquer but was immediately captured by Kil'jaeden. His mortal form was destroyed and his spirit was transformed into the spectral &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, which was then encased in the mystical ice of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; glacier in distant &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nNer'zhul is the main antagonist of ' and the supporting antagonist in '.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nDuring his youth, Ner'zhul would often venture near &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; with his clan-mates. He was the only one that was brave enough to enter its entryway.\nNer'zhul grew up to become the chieftain and elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; and one of the most popular figures in orcish society. He was respected by all the clans and an advisor to all shaman regardless of their affiliation, appearing at the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; celebration in Nagrand. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; instructed his agent, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, to find a suitable leader for the Horde that would be, and Gul'dan decided on Ner'zhul due to the respect and admiration he demanded from all the orcs, seeing him to be the perfect person for such a role. Gul'dan arrived at &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, telling a false tale of how his village was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s (it was, in fact, Gul'dan himself who did that) to gain the sympathy and pity of the Shadowmoon clan. He succeeded, and Ner'zhul took him under his wing as his apprentice.\nAt this point in time, Gul'dan had used his &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; powers to challenge the elemental spirits at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, and he succeeded in throwing the elements in turmoil and their contact with the orc shaman was severed as a result. Ner'zhul was deeply troubled by the natural upheavals that plagued &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; outbreak that struck them, and furthermore, he had sought the comfort of the spirits when he grieved over his deceased wife, &lt;a href=\"Rulkan\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt;. Since the spirits would no longer commune with him, he had begun to venture deeper into his grief, both his sources of comfort having disappeared. Kil'jaeden preyed on this vulnerability and began visiting Ner'zhul in his dreams under the guise of his spouse. Under this guise, Kil'jaeden told Ner'zhul that the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were the reason the elements were in disarray, as well as the cause of the red pox epidemic and how they planned on destroying the entire &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish race, and that the only way to stop them would be to unite the orcs and kill the draenei. At first, Ner'zhul was skeptical, but the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewind clan&lt;/a&gt; by the draenei put an end to his doubts. He informed the clan leaders at the next Kosh'harg festival of what he had learned from Rulkan, and the orcs, revering ancestral spirits as they did, did not question that at all and obliged, forming the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nNer'zhul watched as the Horde increased its aggression against the draenei, but he did not see any benefit come from it, instead, he saw the Horde devolving into savagery and bloodthirst. Kil'jaeden, sensing Ner'zhul's skepticism took a different approach to contacting him. He began appearing as a radiant elemental entity, advising Ner'zhul that destroying the draenei was the only way to please the elements. Ner'zhul was initially in awe of this being, but he was still overcome with doubt, this entity's obsession with brutalizing the draenei deeply upset him. In addition, Rulkan no longer appeared to him, and he needed her guidance in such a crucial time for him and the Horde. He secretly traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; to commune with the spirits and was horrified to learn from the real spirit of Rulkan that he was being deceived. Being shunned by the ancestors and learning of the deception he fell for devastated Ner'zhul. Full of shame, he left Oshu'gun to return to Shadowmoon Valley, unsure of what he would do when he arrived there. Kil'jaeden knew of Ner'zhul's trip, and informed Gul'dan, instructing him to subdue Ner'zhul and take over the Shadowmoon clan leadership without killing him, as Ner'zhul was no longer reliable to lead the Horde. Gul'dan instructed a few Shadowmoon shaman on the secrets of the fel, and they formed the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadow Council intercepted Ner'zhul on his return from Oshu'gun and kidnapped him. Though many of them wanted him dead, Gul'dan knew that that was not Kil'jaeden's will, and instead relished in abusing and mistreating Ner'zhul along with the other members. Authority of the Shadowmoon Clan was transferred to the Shadow Council, and Ner'zhul was left as a decorative figurehead with no actual power. His public appearances began to dwindle and lessen, as did his power and authority over the Horde.\nNer'zhul, being as powerless as he was, posed no threat to the Shadow Council. They made him privy to many of their meetings and he knew a great deal of information about them as a result. After the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the Horde, the Shadow Council used it as their headquarters, and Kil'jaeden informed Gul'dan of the next step in transforming the Horde into the Legion's vanguard: they had to drink the blood of a demon to bind their will to their new masters. To that end, Gul'dan and the Council summoned the demon &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and kept his existence in the Black Temple a secret until the time to feed his blood to the Horde was right. Ner'zhul learned of the summoning and, with this knowledge, wrote an anonymous missive to Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; informing him of Gul'dan's intention of giving the Horde demon blood and snuck it into the Shadow Council's outgoing correspondence. The missive safely reached Durotan, and as a result of Ner'zhul's intervention, the Frostwolf clan would evade demonic servitude. Durotan's refusal to drink demon blood infuriated Gul'dan, but he knew that the Frostwolves were powerless to completely oppose the Horde, and did not mind it much.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s, Ner'zhul was left on Draenor by Gul'dan as he had no purpose in bringing him to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. During that time, Ner'zhul was plagued with thoughts of death and felt personally responsible for the scourging of Draenor and for dooming the orcs to demonic servitude, infighting, and possibly extinction. His chance for redemption came in the form of his former disciple &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt;, or as he was known by then, Teron Gorefiend.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat in the Second War, the Alliance pressed the Horde back to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, ultimately &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;destroying the portal&lt;/a&gt;. On the Draenor side, Ner'zhul was caught in the blast and gravely wounded. For two years while he recovered the clans of Draenor fought amongst themselves until &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; devised a plan of opening new portals and finding fresh worlds for the Horde to conquer. Teron went to Ner'zhul and asked the old shaman to lead the Horde once again. Ner'zhul having since recovered, had isolated his clan in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, where he began seeing visions of death, both &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;his own&lt;/a&gt; and that of the orcs as a people. Obsessed with what he saw as impending doom, he painted his face with a white skull. When Gorefiend, a being of undeath, came to him, Ner'zhul was not surprised, and after some persuasion, agreed to Gorefiend's plan to open &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;more portals&lt;/a&gt; and lead the orcs far away from their doomed world, regaining a small sliver of hope for the future. In order to fulfill the plan he sought out several artifacts from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Except for the Skull of Gul'dan, these artifacts corresponded to three &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt;s on Draenor, and using them in conjunction with a celestial event involving those constellations gave Ner'zhul the power to open the portals. Ner'zhul, Gorefiend, and several death knights combined their powers and used the Skull of Gul'dan to reopen the Dark Portal to begin Gorefiend's mission of acquiring the artifacts. The clans that had remained on Draenor formed a vanguard that would distract the Alliance armies with war to give Gorefiend time to complete his mission.\nUpon receiving the Skull of Gul'dan, it began to influence Ner'zhul. His wayward apprentice was speaking to Ner'zhul through his last remains. Ner'zhul became more and more concerned with his own power and well-being rather than that of the Horde. The &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt; became his enforcer, putting back in line through fear and brute force the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; of Draenor when they opposed Ner'zhul's absolute rule. As part of a pact between Gorefiend and Deathwing, the fallen aspect would lead Gorefiend to the locations of the artifacts, and Gorefiend would take several of Deathwing's \"precious cargo\" to Draenor. The cargo were batches of unhatched black dragon eggs, and Deathwing had intended to repopulate his flight on Draenor away from the other dragon aspects. Upon meeting Deathwing, Ner'zhul was intimidated and terrified of the power the dragon held. He surrendered the Skull of Gul'dan to Deathwing per the dragon's request, and Deathwing rewarded him with the use of several black dragons.\nGorefiend was successfully able to deliver all the artifacts, and after Ner'zhul gave &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; the Skull of Gul'dan, he began searching for a location to open his portals. There were two known ley line nexuses on Draenor: the first was the location of the Dark Portal, and the second was the location of the Black Temple. Ner'zhul decided the Black Temple would be the best location to perform the ritual and began his journey there. The &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; were quickly able to get on his track and follow him through &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing he would not be able to outmaneuver &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s, Ner'zhul elected to traverse the underground labyrinth of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; to reach the Black Temple. It was a success, and he arrived at the Black Temple with enough time to set up a defense and begin the ritual.\nFeeling the surge of power that came with having control of Draenor's magic, Ner'zhul stopped caring about the welfare of the Horde and thought only of harnessing his new powers. In his hubris, he ordered his followers through the portals, leaving behind the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Obris\"&gt;Obris&lt;/a&gt;, one of his servitors, protested at Ner'zhul's choice to abandon the rest of the Horde. In response, Ner'zhul blasted him aside; he no longer cared. Inundated with power, he previously could only have dreamed of, Ner'zhul's greed overcame him, and whatever vestiges of honor and altruism still remained in him vanished as he and his followers went through the first portal, abandoning the rest of the Orcish Horde to its fate. The vast energies that the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;Spell of Conjuration&lt;/a&gt; created then tore the planet apart once Ner'zhul had fled, and the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; was created.\nBirth of the Lich King.\nUpon entering one of the portals, Ner'zhul and his followers were immediately captured by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. At the demon lord's command, a group of dreadlords consisting of &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; tortured the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; Ner'zhul after he had escaped from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Ner'zhul, his sanity cracking, would agree to serve Kil'jaeden, who passed the orc's spirit through death and revived as a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;spectral entity&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlords bound his disembodied spirit to a specifically crafted set of armor and a mighty &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. These items were locked in a diamond-hard block of ice to imprison Ner'zhul. The Lich King and the dreadlords who had tortured him were then sent to Azeroth in order to weaken any resistance that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; would face during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. While the Lich King gathered his strength, Tichondrius and his fellow dreadlords would serve as jailors and executors meant to hasten the Lich King's task by any means necessary. To this end, they would construct the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Though seemingly broken by the dreadlords, Ner'zhul sought vengeance and was able to play on the dreadlord's fears of Kil'jaeden in order trick them into allowing him to hurl Frostmourne out of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. In time, Ner'zhul would guide &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to Frostmourne in order to make the young paladin his champion.\nAfter the Burning Legion's defeat at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul and the Scourge broke away from the Burning Legion, which caused an outraged Kil'jaeden to order Ner'zhul's death. The &lt;a href=\"Ascension%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge ultimately ended in the Scourge's victory. In the direct aftermath of the conflict, Ner'zhul merged with Arthas, who largely consumed his spirit to rule as the Lich King alone. However, the consumption was not complete. Ner'zhul was buried and struggled to wake up to regain control. Arthas drew on the orc's guilt over his role in the downfall of his race to trap him into a downward spiral of despair until nothing remained but a wail of sorrow. Vestiges or at least memories of Ner'zhul remained in the new Lich King, who once referred to himself as a former shaman. This Lich King would be killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s some time later, ultimately ending the fallen shaman's legacy.\nLegion.\nWhen one of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; enters the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt;, reformed from Frostmourne's shards, echoes of Ner'zhul and Arthas can be found with Ner'zhul tempting Arthas to take up Frostmourne. Arthas is defeated and once more states that he sees only darkness, while Ner'zhul exclaims that his plans have been ruined.\nShadowlands.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Lich King was meant to herald his coming and thus considered Ner'zhul, and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;successors&lt;/a&gt;, a failure due to his defiance of him. It was further revealed that Ner'zhul's soul came to reside within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, and that the last remnants of the fallen orc's twisted soul were encased in spiked shadowsteel, condemned to everlasting torment, and was ultimately confronted within the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. As the battle raged, the Helm of Suffering, Malicious Gauntlets, and Rattlecage of Agony that the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Remnant of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; wore were shattered revealing the being beneath and as the remnant is killed it announces \"\"Ahhh... &lt;a href=\"Rulkan\"&gt;Rulkan&lt;/a&gt;... I come... home...\"\".\nVisions of Ner'zhul.\nNer'zhul had the gift of true visioning and all he had seen would indeed come to pass. He had seen many events that take place in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", including:\nIn the RPG.\nNer'zhul was given &lt;a href=\"Plate%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Plate of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; and he gave &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;special chains&lt;/a&gt; and was considered a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Horde\u2019s history begins in hellfire. Over 130 years ago, the shaman Ner\u2019zhul was contacted by an extraplanar being called Kil\u2019jaeden. It is unknown if Ner\u2019zhul was tricked (much like the night elves had been) into thinking that Kil\u2019jaeden was a god or spirit of some kind, or if the powerful shaman knew at the time of their meeting what he was dealing with \u2014 a demonic lord of the Burning Legion. Though he had dedicated much of his life to balance and nature, Ner\u2019zhul was lulled by the archdemon\u2019s offers of power and was convinced to abandon his teachings in favor of a new path: that of the warlock. It's not known if he believed he could use this power to help his people, or if his reasons were entirely selfish. The consequences, however, were dire, regardless of Ner\u2019zhul\u2019s intent. Once he had learned the basics of manipulating this new, infernal magic, his fame grew, and others abandoned the old ways to follow his new, quicker path to the manipulation of the natural world. \nIt took nearly 50 years before Ner\u2019zhul realized his error. By this time, he had convinced many to follow his dark path, and the orcs waged war against the draenei. Ner\u2019zhul helped in the first efforts to unify the Horde into a cohesive unit; but when he saw what had become of his race \u2014 and what it was still becoming \u2014 he denied Kil\u2019jaeden. He refused to compel the orcs to drink demon blood.\nIt was far too late. Kil\u2019jaeden, furious, found a new pawn in the form of Gul\u2019dan, one of Ner\u2019zhul\u2019s strongest apprentices, who shared none of his master\u2019s honor or compassion. Where Ner\u2019zhul had been held back by a lingering feeling of guilt and regret, Gul\u2019dan\u2019s greed and ambition allowed him to grow even more powerful and cruel than his former master, and he did not have Ner\u2019zhul\u2019s compunctions, and convinced the orcs to drink the blood of the demonic pit lord Mannoroth.\nAfter the defeat of the Horde on Azeroth, Kilrogg Deadeye led his people to another portal to Draenor and found the orcs of Draenor under the control of Ner\u2019zhul, the ancient shaman who had once refused Kil\u2019jaeden. The Shadow Moon Clan led by the ancient shaman Ner\u2019zhul was the dominant clan on Draenor. Many ancient clans were still strong in Draenor, and the humans found themselves outnumbered; Ner\u2019zhul was quick to put Kilrogg\u2019s experience to good use, and they coordinated to devise the best possible tactics to defeat the humans. The fighting on Draenor had not raged for long before Ner\u2019zhul made an unusual decision that would change the course of history. The shaman no longer found Azeroth or Draenor suitable for his people; and so, he used his immense power to open another portal \u2014 and another, and another, each to a different world, potentially ripe for conquest. The world began to tear itself apart. Kil\u2019jaeden plucked Ner\u2019zhul and his followers from Draenor after they entered one of their portals and stuffed him into Northrend, where he became the Lich King.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The term nerf is based on Non-Expanding Recreational Foam, a substance used to make toy weapons. \"To nerf\" could be translated as \"turn a real weapon into a toy weapon\". See &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.hasbro.com/nerf/\"&gt;official Nerf toys website&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities, strategies and encounters, or even entire classes can be nerfed. Despite the frustrated cries of players personally affected by a nerf, such things are usually necessary to protect the integrity of the game balance as a whole.\nA \"stealth nerf\" refers to a change that was not announced by the developers, and was discovered (much to the dismay of the hapless victims) by the players themselves without any advance warning. Players tend to be especially frustrated with stealth nerfs, for obvious reasons.\nThe official WoW Class Forums are often filled with so-called \"nerf threads\"; topics in which the poster states that they consider a certain class to be &lt;a href=\"imba\"&gt;imba&lt;/a&gt;lanced. \nPerceived imbalances can lead to serious or jocular outcries calling for a nerf, i.e. \"NERF RET PALLYS!!!\" in-game or in said forum posts. This is at times frowned upon by the rest of the community and can result in responses like &lt;a href=\"EU_forums%23Learn2Play\"&gt;Learn2Play&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe opposite of a nerf is a &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt;. However, \"buff\" can also refer to a \"temporary\" boost in power."}

Nerglish is \"impossibly difficult\" to decipher, causing the murlocs' supposed intelligence to be seen as debatable by non-murlocs. Despite this, other races such as &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; can learn and speak the language fluently. The language is described as difficult to get one's tongue around the subtleties of pronunciation, but is a beautifully expressive language. Murlocs of the &lt;a href=\"Winterfin%20tribe\"&gt;Winterfin tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; have their own unique murloc dialect.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Traveler\"&gt;Traveler&lt;/a&gt;\" series, a great deal of it is heavily accented &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the TCG.\nAn excerpt from \"&lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle\"&gt;Nat Pagle&lt;/a&gt;'s Field Guide to Aquatic Life\" reads: \"I know the murlocs sound like they're just gurgling, but they're speaking a real language.

Nerglish is a low aquatic tongue akin to &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt; for cultures that dwell in the deeps. Makrura speak Nerglish (and were perhaps the first to use that tongue). Murlocs usually only speak their racial dialect of the language, also known simply as \"Murloc\", and nothing else, although some have been known to learn other languages. It is unknown how much of a difference there is between murloc and makrura dialects of the language.\nNames.\nMurloc names contain many wet, soft sounds; \"sh\"s, \"l\"s, and \"m\"s are common.

Following her escape, she would unite her fellow kelfin, &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s as the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt; and make &lt;a href=\"Newhome\"&gt;a home&lt;/a&gt; for them. After the Horde and Alliance fleets were destroyed by the naga, Neri would observe the Horde forces and seeing that they were enemies of the naga, and thus potential allies, she aided &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;. She directed the Horde forces to Newhome, however en route the group was confronted with an astral projection of Queen Azshara. The queen boasted that Nazjatar would be the last thing they would see and promised that she would hold the waters around Nazjatar at bay as long as she remained entertained. The encounter and Azshara's anger towards the two elves surprised Neri.\nWith the changes to Nazjatar, Neri discovered that the Unshackled had become exposed to the naga and subsequently moved the injured deeper into the cave. To further protect her people, she directed &lt;a href=\"Telur\"&gt;Telur&lt;/a&gt; to move the &lt;a href=\"Calling%20Conch\"&gt;calling conch&lt;/a&gt; deeper in the cave. Revealing that some of the &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s hadn't returned from their spying mission, Neri enlisted the Speaker to help her discover what became of them. To her sorrow, she discovered her friend &lt;a href=\"Nelu%20Darkclaw\"&gt;Nelu Darkclaw&lt;/a&gt; was dead and witnessed the death of &lt;a href=\"Sandel%20Fin\"&gt;Sandel Fin&lt;/a&gt;.

With her people better secured, Neri volunteered to join the Speaker on their adventurers.\nSeeking insight into Azshara's forces, Lor'themar turned to Neri, and Neri with the Speaker would set out against them in order to rescue enslaved members of the kelfin. She and the Speaker fought side by side against the naga and discovered that naga were using &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons, that Lor'themar revealed were crafted by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the trust between Neri and the Speaker grew, she revealed secret areas of Nazjatar to her new friend. After learning so much by the Speaker's side, Neri revealed she had spent so long fighting the naga that she had almost lost hope but now she saw a way out of the darkness.

Native to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, these spider-men once ruled over the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; that stretched like a great web beneath the desolate glaciers of \"the roof of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;\". However, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; crushed their dark empire and sent them skittering into the arctic wastelands. Though there were few pockets of nerubian warriors left, they still sought to gain vengeance upon Ner'zhul and reclaim their subterranean kingdom.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe trolls fought them for many thousands of years but never succeeded in winning a true victory over the &lt;a href=\"Aqir\"&gt;Aqir&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, due to the trolls' persistence, the aqiri kingdom split in half as its citizens fled to separate colonies in the far northern and southern regions of the continent. Not long after the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;s divided the insectoid kingdom of the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, the aqir that traveled north discovered and overthrew the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; society in the northern wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. These aqir would eventually become the race we know as the nerubian today, having adapted the tol'vir's architecture for their own purposes. Similarly, the aqir that traveled south ransacked and overthrew a titan research station near Uldum, renaming themselves the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and calling their new home in the southern desert &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. At some point after becoming nerubians, their society broke away and opposed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s that their people once served as aqir, specifically &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. The split happened early enough in nerubian history, that by the time of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension to the Lich King, &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; commented that he had believed them to be only legend.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Magnar Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; earned his surname from his battles against the nerubians in Northrend. While hunting nests of the insectoids, Magnar discovered that cracks in glacier walls could be turned into tunnels that allowed him to dig deep into enemy strongholds and launch surprise assaults on them from within. Years later, remnants of the nerubian armies once again began emerging from their caves, seeking to seize &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; machinery within it. Magnar, now a king wielding the &lt;a href=\"%3AScale%20of%20the%20Earth-Warder\"&gt;:Scale of the Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt;, led his people against the insectoids, pushing them back to the entrance of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; itself and defeating them so thoroughly that they ceased all aggression for millennia.\nWar of the Spider.\nThousands of years later, when the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; extended his influence over Northrend, the shadowy empire stood against his power. The ancient subterranean kingdom of Azjol-Nerub sent their elite warrior-guard to attack &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and end the Lich King's mad bid for dominance. Much to his frustration, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; found that the evil nerubians were immune not only to the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;undead plague&lt;/a&gt; but to his telepathic domination as well.\nThe nerubian &lt;a href=\"spiderlord\"&gt;spiderlord&lt;/a&gt;s commanded vast forces and had an underground network that stretched nearly half the breadth of Northrend. Their hit-and-run tactics on the Lich King's strongholds stymied his efforts to root them out time after time. Ultimately, Ner'zhul's war against the nerubians was won by attrition. With the aid of the sinister &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlords&lt;/a&gt; and innumerable &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; warriors, the Lich King invaded Azjol-Nerub and brought its subterranean temples crashing down upon the spider lords' heads.\nThough the nerubians were immune to his plague, Ner'zhul's growing necromantic powers allowed him to raise the spider-warriors' corpses and bend them to his will.When the time came the Lich King was delighted to raise &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, the last king of the nerubian, himself into a powerful undead minion. The former ruler was now a slave, and though he chafed at his leash, he could not free himself from it. As an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt;, Anub'arak crushed anything that posed a resistance to the Lich King's will and slaughtered many of his people. Anub'arak led the undead as they conquered the nerubian &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt;s and repurposed them for the Lich King's designs. For this, the living nerubians began to refer to him as the traitor king and lay the destruction of their kingdom at his feet.\nAs a testament to their tenacity and fearlessness, Ner'zhul adopted the nerubians' distinctive architectural style for his own fortresses and structures. Though there are few pockets of nerubian warriors left, they still seek to gain vengeance upon Ner'zhul and reclaim their subterranean kingdom.\nDuring the war, a nerubian by the name of &lt;a href=\"Vorus%27arak\"&gt;Vorus'arak&lt;/a&gt; led his brood under ground. A great tunneler, the Swarm Lord and his people dug, forced to eat their young for food. They eventually found an island, the &lt;a href=\"Skittering%20Hollow\"&gt;Skittering Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, where they survived and thrived. This group became the &lt;a href=\"Voru%27kar\"&gt;Voru'kar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Kilix%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Kilix the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Lan%27dalock\"&gt;Archmage Lan'dalock&lt;/a&gt;, the nerubians fought the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and dug deeper underground as they lost ground to the undead, until they inadvertently exposed a tendril of the \"&lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s will\", which led &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;N'raqi&lt;/a&gt; to manifest. Kilix the Unraveler then explained that they lost the war because they could not fight on two fronts against such powerful enemies, which cost them the war against the undead, and ultimately, their home.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the nerubian kingdom was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who confronted &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;. When he was finally killed in his ruined palace, they brought his broken husk to the living nerubians as proof of his death. However, Anub'arak didn't stay dead for long. He was later brought back by the Lich King to serve again, this time attacking the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, where the Traitor King was defeated once and for all.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; also acquired the &lt;a href=\"The%20Idle%20Crown%20of%20Anub%27arak\"&gt;crown of the nerubian king&lt;/a&gt; and put it aside for the nerubians whenever they decided to coronate a new one.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that the nerubians have an enormous secret stash of their own eggs hidden safely, so that after the wipeout of the Scourge from Azjol-Nerub, they can finally begin repopulating their people under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Ixit\"&gt;Seer Ixit&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skittering%20Hollow\"&gt;Skittering Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, home to the Voru'kar, was visited by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces seeking &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible for them to fight members of the brood, as well as &lt;a href=\"Vorus%27arak\"&gt;Vorus'arak&lt;/a&gt;. His carapace, revealed to have never been shed since the War of the Spider, is returned to Northrend to &lt;a href=\"Kilix%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Kilix the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the history of the nerubians is important to them before rewarding the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; with Azerite.\nNerubians were summoned to aid &lt;a href=\"Zek%27voz\"&gt;Zek'voz&lt;/a&gt; after he escaped his imprisonment. These nerubians were created by Zek'voz using corrupted titan discs, as such, they were the only instance of nerubians still loyal to the Old Gods. These nerubians were slain alongside the errant aqir.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that though most of the nerubian kingdom is full-on ruins, they heard that some of its buildings still stand, while the art within disintegrating because the Scourge don't care to maintain it.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-anak\"&gt;Azjol-anak&lt;/a&gt; living nerubians he met there were few in number, but they've all been of a good sort.\nGroups.\nAmong the uncorrupted nerubians count the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-anak\"&gt;Azjol-anak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20Guardians\"&gt;Nerubian Guardians&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Voru%27kar\"&gt;Voru'kar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAmong the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted nerubians count the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27kahar\"&gt;Ahn'kahar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anub%27ar\"&gt;Anub'ar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hath%27ar\"&gt;Hath'ar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nerub%27ar\"&gt;Nerub'ar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nerubis\"&gt;Nerubis&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\n&lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; claims that they were fiercely intelligent, and their will dedicated to wiping out any who were not like themselves. Much like the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegends tell of the nerubians' using the &lt;a href=\"jormungar\"&gt;jormungar&lt;/a&gt; as creatures of labor, forcing them to carve massive tunnels through Northrend's subterranean ice and lay the groundwork for the nerubians' ancient civilization.\nNerubians once controlled the &lt;a href=\"arachnathid\"&gt;arachnathid&lt;/a&gt; and used them as guardians of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; came.\nNerubians also enslaved the remaining &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend, turning them into the &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, who were later claimed by the Scourge during the War of the Spider. Although many of the few remaining tol'vir slaves died in the front lines during Third War, it's possible that more obsidian destroyers still exist deep within the remnants of Azjol-Nerub.\nThe &lt;a href=\"sacrificial%20pit\"&gt;sacrificial pit&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; were used long ago to sacrifice enemy forces in exchange for success in battle.\nArchitecture.\nAs attested by many traps and contraptions in &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; dungeons, they were once good engineers.\nThe nerubian architectural is described as distinctive, elegant, and angular. Their architectural style may have been inspired by &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;ly influence. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; later adopted the style for his Scourge after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt; and so &lt;a href=\"ziggurat\"&gt;ziggurat&lt;/a&gt;s, the big &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and refer to their building style. Of course, most of the architecture can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; itself. Another good example of their style is the statue in the &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Fiends\"&gt;Pit of Fiends&lt;/a&gt;.\nLanguage.\nTheir language, simply known as &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20%28language%29\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;, is described by &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Wintergale\"&gt;Chieftain Wintergale&lt;/a&gt; as an ancient and harsh language.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nAt the ancient continent &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s center was a mysterious lake of incandescent energies, the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. It was the true heart of the world's magic and natural power. From this magical ether the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; were born. As the fallen &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; recognized their appearance, he attempted to sunder the world that it once held in its unmerciful grasp. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; created avatars from the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; in its own image. These avatars were to be known as the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;.\n16,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;ish invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; ruled the lands far west of Kalimdor. These clever insectoids were greatly expansionistic and incredibly evil. The &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; were obsessed with eradicating all non- life from the fields of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. So the two big &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empires of &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; found their common enemy in the third &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"nation\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azj%27Aqir\"&gt;Azj'Aqir&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow, the nerubians are a depleted and embittered people. Most live in Northrend and shun all contact with outsiders \u2014 indeed, they attack intruders on sight, viewing all creatures not of their kind with suspicion. Understandably, they possess a vitriolic hatred of undead, especially crypt fiends and crypt lords. They realize that they are too weak to overthrow the Lich King, and must content themselves with their pathetic guerrilla war.\nNow, the nerubians exist only as scattered families in northern Kalimdor and in a few settlements throughout Ashenvale. In their quiet and passionless manner, nerubians despise the Scourge and will take any opportunity to do it harm.\nCulture.\nAzjol-Nerub contained huge libraries of literature, philosophy, and arcane lore. Occasionally, the kingdom would kidnap &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; for experimentation.\nNerubians are cruel and xenophobic. Like their &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; relatives are hostile to all races.\nNerubian culture may place great store in longevity; Nerubians encountered at the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Monolith\"&gt;Sundered Monolith&lt;/a&gt; told &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; their ages, and they seemed impressed by his.\nSociety.\nDifferent types of nerubian are referred to as castes with a life-long occupation and responsibility in society. Seers, for example, are relatively high-level nerubians who act as priests and mages. Spider lords are the rulers of the society in the same mold as the aristocracy of humanoid races.\nThe spider is the most common motif of the nerubians, and they have appeared to have evolved at least partially into an arachnid race (eight limbs) from an insectoid race (six limbs). Despite the nerubian cultural association with spiders (who reproduce through any male and any female), they reproduce as social insects do, through queens.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; nerubians are usually under control of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and are known as &lt;a href=\"crypt%20fiend\"&gt;crypt fiend&lt;/a&gt;s (in the case of most nerubians) and &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt;s (undead &lt;a href=\"spiderlord\"&gt;spiderlord&lt;/a&gt;s). Too few crypt fiends appear in Azeroth, so nobody knows yet what nerubian females look like or are called.\nNerubians tend toward evil; they have always been ruthless and aggressive, and since the fall of the Spider Kingdom these traits are more pronounced. Still, nerubians are intelligent, and not all fall into dark ways. They may join a group of adventurers in the hopes of striking against the Lich King, or of gaining the power to do so. Other nerubians, often young ones, leave their homes because they want no part of their people's hopeless conflict and desire to become more than embittered survivors \u2014 perhaps they want to attain, at an individual level at least, the heights their people once possessed. The remote possibility exists that a handful of nerubians are not evil and could get along with other races better than their brethren.\nLanguages.\nMany nerubians are fluent in Common as well as their own tongue (a clicking rasping language).\nThey speak &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaith.\nIn ancient Azjol-Nerub, there were five or six schools of religious thought, and theological debates were common. Eventually, however, nerubians have come to a conclusion that worshiping creatures from beyond the world is insane, and, in the words of the seer &lt;a href=\"Ul%27Tomon\"&gt;Ul'Tomon&lt;/a&gt;, \"makes as much sense as a fly caught in a web worshiping the spider who is about to devour him\". To modern nerubians, even the concept of \"worship\" itself is alien."}

The leader is usually the eldest female, mother of much of the group. Large communities will have the elders elect one of their own to lead as queen. Groups formed for a specific purpose, such as a warband or aggregate of decimated families, will choose a leader with proven ability. Queens are the mothers of the cities.

Queens have something akin to genetic memory, transferred through arcane memory from mother to daughter.\nThe most ancient of queens can reach 40 feet in height and fill an entire cavern with their bloated bodies.

Once skilled in architecture, accounting, law and other esoteric disciplines, the demands of life now require most seers to focus on magic to protect their communities.

They are hatched from the eggs of &lt;a href=\"nerubian%20queen\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt;s in breeding pods, as well as upon the death of some living adults. They can also hatch from unfortunate captured creatures.\nWarcraft III.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spiderling%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Nerubian Spiderling&lt;/a&gt; was the weakest nerubian &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".

Adult nerubians carry their young around their lairs. Up to around a dozen spiderlings cling to the adult's body. Nerubians leave the spiderlings in their lair when they move to confront enemies, but foes who clash with nerubians in their tunnels may find themselves confronting a spiderling swarm. Nerubians are spiderlings for about 3 years. At this point, they are adult nerubians. Like young creatures of other races, spiderlings have a limited command and understanding of their native language, &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20%28language%29\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;. Spiderling swarms are almost always attached to adults; the only other way an adventurer can reasonably expect to run into a spiderling swarm is in a nerubian incubation chamber. Spiderlings follow the commands of other nerubians, particularly the adult to which they are attached. Once the nerubians have destroyed or routed all opponents, the spiderlings feed."}

The only living spiderlord seen in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" has been &lt;a href=\"Vorus%27arak\"&gt;Vorus'arak&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Voru%27kar\"&gt;Voru'kar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nNerubian spiderlords are cold, ruthless, deadly, and intelligent beetle creatures. They are perhaps the most powerful &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s. Spiderlords once formed the majority of Azjol-Nerub\u2019s leadership in &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;; they were the keepers of law and dominated nerubian society, though the eldest members of other castes held considerable sway. In the largest communities, they still serve as advisors to a local &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20queen\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt;. Small communities are led by spiderlords. They exhibit more callous intelligence than their underlings; a nerubian spiderlord is willing to sacrifice almost anything to further one of his complicated schemes.\nThese nerubians look somewhat different than their brethren: they have a carapace and dual sets of wings, making their lower bodies appear almost beetle-like. This enormous, insectile creature resembles a gigantic, fantastically colored beetle. The scarab-like carapace unfolds like dual wings, and the creature\u2019s front limbs are scythelike and bony. Nerubian spiderlords come in many vivid, jeweled shades, everything from emerald green to sapphire blue to ruby red. Some scholars attempt to draw a correlation between a spiderlord\u2019s coloring and his approximate power level, but so far have reached no consensus. Nerubian spiderlords grow 18\u201320 feet tall and weigh 8,000 to 12,000 pounds. Their carapaces provide excellent natural armor, but their vestigial wings are not strong enough to allow flight.\nThey also typically grow to a larger size and train in some combination of &lt;a href=\"aristocrat\"&gt;aristocrat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; or other spellcaster classes. They must choose between training as aristocrats, warriors, or mages, the choice may not be changed later. When challenged, a nerubian spiderlord tries diplomacy first, after which he switches to his spell-like abilities. Melee combat is a spiderlord\u2019s last resort. A nerubian spiderlord possesses the same poisonous bite of other nerubians, but due to his scarab body he cannot spin webs. They can spin a single strand to ascend or descend in order to climb, but they cannot throw webs like common nerubians.\nOnly nerubian queens give birth to spiderlords; one out of every twenty eggs she lays on average grows into a spiderlord (the rest emerge as regular nerubians).\nNotes.\nIn the ', they were &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s but in the ' they are &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s."}

This is similar to an attack with a net, but it has a maximum range of 50 feet, and is effective against targets up to one size category larger than the spider. Webspinners often create sheets of sticky webbing from 5 to 60 feet square, depending on the size of the spider. They usually position these sheets to snare flying creatures but can also try to trap prey on the ground. Approaching creatures must be careful to notice a web; otherwise they stumble into it and become trapped.\n&lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20worker\"&gt;Workers&lt;/a&gt; who demonstrate exceptional weaving skills become webspinners."}

Workers deal with the larger needs of the community: food, weaponsmithing, mining, building, and supplying the needs of the other castes. Their lives are unending labors, though they do not chafe at them.

When pressed into service or when faced with destruction, however, they are disciplined, particularly if a skilled leader is present. Nerubians are proficient with all simple and martial weapons. Quick charges and use of simple weapons like spears and javelins are their normal tactics. They may wield simple, though wicked-looking spears. Some nerubians also use longswords, axes and other martial weapons. They can also deliver a poisonous bite, but prefer the distance that wielding weapons offers.\nWorkers who show unusual physical abilities become &lt;a href=\"nerubian%20warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s; workers who show mental talents become &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;s, and those who demonstrate exceptional weaving skills become &lt;a href=\"Nerubian%20webspinner\"&gt;webspinner&lt;/a&gt;s.

However, the man revealed himself to be the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder%20Zorak\"&gt;Oathbinder Zorak&lt;/a&gt; following the deal, unveiling the true terms of their agreement. If he spared him and his family, they would be bound for eternity to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, serving forever as their slaves. After Nerus' death, his soul was imprisoned inside a &lt;a href=\"Felstone%20Pendant\"&gt;Felstone Pendant&lt;/a&gt;. However, he wrote of the deal, and his hope that his family would understand why he made it, in his &lt;a href=\"Nerus%27%20Journal\"&gt;personal journal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; along with Delas Moonfang, Nerus' niece who had become a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; under their tutelage, uncovered the deal through the journal and an initially blank scroll, revealing the truth of Nerus and Zorak after it was soaked in the blood of demons. Having also recovered the pendant, the Highlord destroyed it on Delas' plea. Immediately following the pendant's destruction, Nerus' spirit was released. Angrily demanding an explanation, Nerus solemnly apologized for his actions, but told them that they could still save the Moonfang family spirits enslaved by the Legion. Traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the Highlord freed the night elf spirits and slew &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder%20Zorak\"&gt;Oathbinder Zorak&lt;/a&gt;, ending the curse placed upon the Moonfangs. Following this, Nerus pledged himself to the Knights of the Silver Hand to begin to atone for his actions, which Delas commented was a start for his redemption."}

He lived in &lt;a href=\"Featherbeard%27s%20Hovel\"&gt;Featherbeard's Hovel&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Rualeth\"&gt;Ambassador Rualeth&lt;/a&gt; was seeking audience with &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, he sent one of his &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;messenger&lt;/a&gt; to his hovel to ask him to come and speak with him in order to try and sway Falstad and be granted an audience faster. When the messenger arrived, he found the residence to be empty, trying to find clues to see what became of Featherbeard, he found his &lt;a href=\"Featherbeard%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; and read it. Reading the most recent pages he found out about the dwarf's concern about the increasing number of Witherbark troll raids on the Wildhammer gryphon aeries and a rash of egg thefts. He also wrote that he believed that a witch doctor named &lt;a href=\"Mai%27jin\"&gt;Mai'jin&lt;/a&gt; was behind the raids. On his final note, the messenger read that the dwarf travailed to &lt;a href=\"Shadra%27Alor\"&gt;Shadra'Alor&lt;/a&gt; to find the missing eggs.\nWanting to fill his master's request, the messenger traveled into troll territory to find what became of the dwarf. When climbing to the top of an altar, he found &lt;a href=\"Featherbeard%27s%20Remains\"&gt;dwarven remains&lt;/a&gt;. Searching on the corpse he assumed belonged to the dwarf, he found &lt;a href=\"Featherbeard%27s%20Map\"&gt;Featherbeard's Map&lt;/a&gt; with several Xs on it. Following them carefully, he found the missing eggs and returned to his master. Ambassador Rualeth was saddened by the news and wished the dwarf asked for help before going. The ambassador also stated that this will increase the hostility between the trolls and the time for his audience."}

After their marriage ended, Grizzek ended up keeping Feathers and cherished it as his favorite device. Several times a day, Feathers flew reconnaissance around Grizzek's home in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, using its mechanical eyes to scan for anything unusual and immediately reporting any trouble to Grizzek. Naturally, Feathers alerted Grizzek when &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; arrived to ask him to create &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; inventions.\nWhen Sapphronetta was kidnapped and brought to Grizzek by Gallywix's goons, Feathers cheerily greeted her. Saffy demanded that Grizzek give her \"her\" parrot back, but he reminded her that it didn't belong to her. Saffy eventually agreed to work with Grizzek to study Azerite, on the condition that she'd get Feathers when they were done.\nIn the midst of Grizzek and Saffy's Azerite experiments, Feathers reported the presence of \"Big ugly guests\": Gallywix's goons, who informed Grizzek that he and Saffy had been ordered to start making Azerite weapons. Following a visit by Gallywix himself, Grizzek and Saffy decided to escape to another part of Tanaris through a tunnel and enact a plan to prevent Gallywix from using their discoveries to harm others. They programmed Feathers to fly to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; with a warning about what had happened and a plea for rescue at a specific location, with the duo intending to offer their discoveries to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on the stipulation that they would only create things that could help, not harm. However, the parrot was quickly shot out of the sky by &lt;a href=\"Druz\"&gt;Druz&lt;/a&gt; and his enforcers, who knew of Grizzek and Sapphronetta's plans ahead of time.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhile investigating the whereabouts of Grizzek and Saffy, an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; found Feathers' charred remains in Tanaris. After the hero repaired the parrot with mechanical parts from nearby &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; goons and debugged its recall system, Feathers activated its \"Find Saffy\" protocol and flew the adventurer to the spot in Tanaris where Grizzek and Sapphronetta were hiding. Knowing that this meant others might be able to find them, the pair drove off on Grizzek's bike and &lt;a href=\"Feathers%20%28pet%29\"&gt;gave Feathers to the hero&lt;/a&gt; in return for not letting anyone know that they were still alive."}

{"id": "23117", "revid": "54476242", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23117", "title": "Fel", "text": "Fel magic (also called chaos magic, demonic magic, sacrificial magic, chaos energy or chaotic energy) is a destructive form of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; used by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and often by &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s among the mortal races. It is the manifestation of &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. It is demonic, entropic, chaotic, and extremely volatile. Its use by the wielder, or its effects on the victim, frequently results in an alteration of the individual, colloquially called corruption. All members of the Burning Legion carry the taint of fel magic within their very blood, allowing them to spread greater evil. As fel is the language of chaos and disorder, it is the opposite end of the spectrum from &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, which represents order.\nOrigins and characteristics.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; is most commonly perceived in reality as &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic, on the other hand, &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt; manifests as highly destructive fel magic, a destructive and extremely addictive energy originating as a result of the mutual destruction of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; as they collide on a cosmic scale in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Fel is fueled by drawing life from living beings and consuming their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s, utterly destroying them in the process. It requires but an insignificant sacrifice\u2014a living fish or two, a few strands of seaweed\u2014to fuel the magic.\nFel energy counters and is countered by &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy, it's polar opposite. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s are naturally vulnerable to fel magic. When Sargeras was infused and deformed by the explosion of fel energy caused by the shattering of &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; could not overcome &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s fel-fueled might. The fallen titan decimated the Pantheon members by summoning a massive fel storm that would consume their bodies.\nFel works like radiation, permeating an area and seeping into anything in the vicinity. Anything near a source of fel energy will eventually show signs of slight corruption. It smells like sulfur and brimstone. Fel can also pool into a green goop when it's in physical form. &lt;a href=\"Pit%20lord\"&gt;Pit lord&lt;/a&gt; blood is literal fel goo. When drunk, their blood causes mutations such as the growth of spikes, horns, scales, and wings. Felfire is a flame born of fel magic. It is deadly to the touch, burns much hotter than normal fire, and cannot be put out by regular means, though the water of enchanted &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s seems to be able to do the trick. A scalding core of fel fire is what powers the &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;s of the Legion.\nAll demon blood contains tremendous fel power, it is used to make powerful fel inks, demonic sigils, and is highly valued for &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; rituals. Pure fel energy can manifest as &lt;a href=\"entropic%20elemental\"&gt;entropic elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, which essence can poison living beings with a sickness that drains life.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; is devoured by fel energies, it produces more fel and is utterly destroyed in the process. Powerful demonic rituals often call for the intact skull of a pure soul and the blood of the truly innocent. &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;Jailers&lt;/a&gt; are demons that carry fel &lt;a href=\"cage\"&gt;cage&lt;/a&gt;s on their backs and use them to capture both the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; and body of their enemy, which they then send to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to subject their victims to horrific torture and interrogation.\nUses.\nFel magic is mainly used to cause massive destruction by its wielders, notably through &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bolt\"&gt;devastating blast of chaos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;rains of hellfire&lt;/a&gt;. Fel can be used as an &lt;a href=\"Immolation%20Aura\"&gt;aura&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28Vengeance%29\"&gt;temporarily turn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;into a demon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Weakness\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Life\"&gt;drain&lt;/a&gt; the life of foes. It can also be used to&lt;a href=\"Warlock%20minion\"&gt;summon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;banish&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Subjugate%20Demon\"&gt;subjugate&lt;/a&gt; demons. It can also be used to give momentum and propel a boat, to turn oneself invisible, to scry, and to create portals and &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Gateway\"&gt;gateways&lt;/a&gt; much more efficient, long-lasting and easier to create than with arcane magic. Fel can also be used to heal, though it leaves a mark on creatures who are not fel-based.\nLesser warlocks must use &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;soul shards&lt;/a&gt; to summon minor demons. Soul shards can be used to power spells, or to create a connection to the Twisting Nether, pulling a demon through against its will.\nLike all other types of magic, it can be animated, such as the &lt;a href=\"Flame%20of%20Azzinoth\"&gt;Flames of Azzinoth&lt;/a&gt;. It can also be used to power the monstrous machines of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, notably to breathe life into constructs such as &lt;a href=\"Infernal\"&gt;infernals&lt;/a&gt;, or in a necromantic way by resurrecting demons as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Devastator\"&gt;Devastator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fel%20cannon\"&gt;Fel cannon&lt;/a&gt;s are siege weapons infused with fel energy, while &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;s are powered with \"felfire\".\nSome &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s have manipulated fel energy to enhance their attunement with the wild.\nEffects on beings.\nInfusion with fel magic, also called fel corruption, can manifest through physical transformation normally ensues, such as a change to an individual's eyes or skin color, or heavy genetic mutations such as the growth of demonic traits like spikes, scales, and horns. Negative corruption tends to lead to physical or mental deterioration, as happened with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; that turned into &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s, or as happened with boars turned into enraged &lt;a href=\"hellboar\"&gt;hellboar&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEither way, corruption gives the individual increased strength, more magical potential, and can lead to transformation into a demon. Fel seems to tend to cloud one's judgment, or at least heavily amplify their negative traits such as violence and impatience while snuffing out positive ones such as empathy, allowing one to make decisions they never would've made before. When the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Malus&lt;/a&gt; took &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt;'s fel sword, it empowered and transformed him, his eyes blazed green with corruption, and he stated that the fel flames whisper to him of victory and destruction.\nFel energy can also be used as a deadly poison, slowly consuming the victim to death. The Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; notably died of fel poisoning after being injured by a mortal blow from a &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;'s spear.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; tasked the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; to spread the influence of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; in the realms of the other &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;cosmic forces&lt;/a&gt;, they had to consume fel energy, an unpleasant but necessary process to become demons, in order to infiltrate the plane of &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, and later the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the existence of non-sentient demons suggests, a creature's wishes are irrelevant to the process. Willing or not, a creature can be changed into a demon. The chaos magics of the &lt;a href=\"eredar%20warlock\"&gt;eredar warlock&lt;/a&gt;s have burnt out whole worlds and annihilated countless species over the eons, turning indigenous races into demons. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, many species were corrupted with fel magic, including &lt;a href=\"Feldrake\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feltalon\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bilgefin\"&gt;murlocs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkhound\"&gt;hounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Direwolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helboar\"&gt;boars&lt;/a&gt;, and so on. The &lt;a href=\"void%20revenant\"&gt;void revenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xhul%27horac\"&gt;Xhul'horac&lt;/a&gt; was twisted and fed overwhelming fel energy by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, as he wanted to use his powers to tear open the portals through which he planned to rally the forces of the Burning Legion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Felsworn\"&gt;Felsworn&lt;/a&gt; were mortals who swore fealty to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and in return, were gifted with fel power.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; now bleeds green blood.\nPractitioners.\nDemons.\nAll &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s carry the taint of fel magic within their very blood, allowing them to spread greater evil. They are &lt;a href=\"Immortal\"&gt;immortal beings&lt;/a&gt; who feed upon &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;, and delight in inflicting suffering, spreading corruption, and destroying all that is good. Their &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s are tethered to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and as such, even if a demon dies in the physical universe, their spirit will return to the Nether where they will reform once again. To truly destroy a demon, the creature must be killed in the Nether itself, in places where it bleeds into mortal worlds, or in areas saturated with fel energies. Demons normally delight in inflicting suffering, spreading corruption, and destroying all that is good. Mortal beings can be turned into demons themselves by being infused with fel energy.\nWarlocks.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s are magical practitioners that seek to understand darker, fel-based magic, and its destructive spells. While many warlocks willingly follow the Burning Legion, there are those who work against it, using their magic to fight against evil. They delight in using fel forces to cause intense pain and suffering in others, and revel in corrupting minds and agonizing souls, leaving enemies in a state of torment that would see them undone in due time. Even the most battle-hardened warriors can be deceived, landing blow after blow against the warlock, only to succumb to their suffering as their very vitality is siphoned away by the dark spellcaster. Warlocks have proven themselves to be powerful allies-as well as powerful foes. Warlocks convert life into fel, draining the victim as a source of power.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Magocracy of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; attempts to stifle the studies of fel magic. Despite the superior power of fel magic which threatened to overshadow established practices, students were taught about practicality over what is achievable. Fel's efficiency is commonly balked for being unstable and \"evil\". The official teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; are that &lt;a href=\"Demonology%20%28lore%29\"&gt;demonology&lt;/a&gt; is to be eschewed, avoided, and abjured. Any attempt to summon demons are to be found out and stopped at once, and those involved are to be expelled, or worse. However, when &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s gave up the arcane to begin a personal quest to understand demons and their fel energies, like &lt;a href=\"Daio%20the%20Decrepit\"&gt;Daio the Decrepit&lt;/a&gt;, they effectively became warlocks. Some warlocks are also named fel magus such as &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Magus%20Verondis\"&gt;Fel Magus Verondis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Magus%20Kel%27rothek\"&gt;Fel Magus Kel'rothek&lt;/a&gt;.\nEven if they are still considered as pariahs, operating in the shadows of polite society, they start to be respected by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; on the battlefronts. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the warlocks of Azeroth have joined forces and efforts in recent years to form the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; and have taken over the Legion world of &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon hunters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, disciples of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, uphold a dark legacy, one that frightens their allies and enemies alike. The &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; embrace fel and chaotic magics\u2014energies that have long threatened the world of Azeroth\u2014believing them necessary to challenge the Burning Legion. Wielding the powers of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s they've slain, they develop demonic features that incite revulsion and dread in fellow &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. The fel energy that flows within demon hunters, empowers their physical and magical strikes to devastating effect, while they can command chaotic energies to inflict havoc on enemies. Demon hunters mark their bodies with &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s to keep their fel forces in check.\nElves.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; rebuilt &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crystal\"&gt;demonic energies&lt;/a&gt;; living in proximity and absorbing its energies gave many blood elves fel-green eyes, and they subsequently become addicted to the fel energies. For remaining in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s most loyal followers were rewarded by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; with the gift of being allowed to gorge themselves on demonic blood for days, even as many of his blood elves retreated through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and became &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;Felblood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;Satyr&lt;/a&gt;s have been transformed into their current shapes by inheriting the demonic curse that originated with &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;.\nEredar.\n13,000 years ago, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; shattered the tranquility of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; by offering the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; immeasurable knowledge and power. When &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Duumvirate\"&gt;Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; accepted his offer, the Dark Titan infused the eredar with fel energy, turning them into demons called &lt;a href=\"Man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;Man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt;, while some became &lt;a href=\"wrathguard\"&gt;wrathguard&lt;/a&gt;s. The eredar settled in as commanders within the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and under their leadership, the ranks of the Burning Legion swelled with new demonic races, gathered from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; brought the &lt;a href=\"Red%20mist\"&gt;Red mist&lt;/a&gt; upon the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, causing them to mutate and devolve into the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; and then further into &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt;. Their warped bodies bear only a rough resemblance to the proud draenei they once were, and quite a few have lost their grip on sanity.\nOrcs.\nUnder the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was the first &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; warlock and is considered one of the most powerful mortal warlocks to have ever existed. He taught other young orcs the dark arts and strove to eradicate the orcs' shamanistic traditions. His master, seeking to tighten his hold over the orcs, helped Gul'dan found the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, a secretive sect that manipulated the clans and spread the use of fel magic throughout &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. As more and more orcs began to wield warlock magics, the gentle fields and streams of Draenor began to blacken and fade.\nFrom every account, the demonic energies, used so freely and with no heed given as to their cost, leeched all that was wholesome and life-giving from the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The originally brown orcs changed from under the influence of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood, their skin became various shades of green and they began experiencing lusts for blood. Those who kept drinking pit lord blood became &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRPG.\nThe ultimate manifestation of the demonic &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is fel energy. Fel energy, which most commonly manifests itself as ghastly, green-yellow flame, is arcane magic at its most corrupt, for it employs the blood of demons. Unlike arcane magic the use of fel magic corrupts the user's body and soul. By contrast, the chief danger of arcane magic is that using it inevitably leads to the desire to wield greater power: power that only fel magic can provide. When the demons brought death and damnation to Azeroth, they also carried their own brand of magic to the world. Fel magic is pure, evil, and arcane; it resides in the blood of demons. This blood has magical properties; it is addictive to arcane magic users and can be used to create evil weapons. When a weapon is forged in demon blood, it becomes a fel weapon. It glows with a foul, yellow-green fire and deals extra damage to good-aligned opponents. Some arcanists can cast fel spells, perhaps after drinking demon blood. Since the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; returned to Azeroth, the world's heroes have encountered fel weapons and fel magic at an increasing frequency. As demon cults continue to fester and grow in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and other remote corners, gruesome sacrifices are held to entice demons into giving their blood in trade. The cultists use their blood to enchant the weapons that they hope will bring about their masters' ultimate victory.\nChaos energy is highly dangerous; some believe it actually is equivalent to &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic, although it can be harnessed by &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s. Thought at first to be magical, as it can sometimes mimic the effects of arcane magic, chaos energy is purely &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; in nature. Chaos energy is generated through the use of devices called chaos generators. A small box contains magnets, several differing kinds of metal, steam energy, and a tiny golden core that vibrates at a high frequency when powered. Political maneuverings by wizards in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; have caused the ruling body to declare chaos generators unlawful, but the goblins and some gnomes still manage to research and develop new uses for chaos energy. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; hasn't outlawed the usage yet, as it is not arcane magic, but they are suspicious of it because of the similarities.\nDemons sometimes tempt spellcasters by offering small amounts of their blood in exchange for services. If the recipient drinks the demon's blood within 24 hours of the offering, the next arcane spell he casts will be empowered by the fel. Fel blood is highly addictive as well as corruptive. Anyone who drinks it risks becoming dependent on fel blood, and unless the person continues to drink it daily, he will suffer withdrawal symptoms. He has a chance of breaking the addiction seven days after first drinking the fel blood.\nEntropic fire is fel energy given substance: it is entropic fire that burns on infernals, and it is entropic fire that ran down the body of the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20the%20Destructor\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;. Entropic fire burns, as does normal fire, but it is more sinister still: it feeds on life, including the life of its wielder. A gray ore known as fel stone litters the physical spaces of the Nether. It functions as a conduit for the Nether's entropic energies.\nSpeculation.\nIs Fel Energy Essentially Death Energy?\nFel energy was once defined by Chris Metzen at Blizzcon 2005 as demonic, essentially entropic, essentially death energy."}

{"id": "15197", "revid": "47097556", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15197", "title": "API PickupContainerItem", "text": "Wildcard function usually called when a player left clicks on a slot in their bags. Functionality includes picking up the item from a specific bag slot, putting the item into a specific bag slot, and applying enchants (including poisons and sharpening stones) to the item in a specific bag slot, except if one of the Modifier Keys is pressed.\n PickupContainerItem(bagID, slot)\nDetails.\nThe function behaves differently depending on what is currently on the cursor:\nTrying to pickup the same item twice in the same \"time tick\" does not work (client seems to flag the item as \"locked\" and waits for the server to sync). This is only a problem if you might move a single item multiple times (i.e., if you are changing your character's equipped armor, you are not likely to move a single piece of armor more than once). If you might move an object multiple times in rapid succession, you can check the item's 'locked' flag by calling &lt;a href=\"API%20GetContainerItemInfo\"&gt;GetContainerItemInfo&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to do this, you should leverage OnUpdate to help you. Avoid constantly checking the lock status inside a tight loop. If you do, you risk getting into a race condition. Once the repeat loop starts running, the client will not get any communication from the server until it finishes. However, it will not finish until the server tells it that the item is unlocked. Here is some sample code that illustrates the problem.\n function DangerousSwapItems(bag1, slot1, bag2, slot2)\n ClearCursor()\n repeat\n local _, _, locked1 = GetContainerItemInfo(bag1, slot1)\n local _, _, locked2 = GetContainerItemInfo(bag2, slot2)\n --&lt;a href=\"%20DANGER%21%20At%20this%20point%2C%20locked1%20and%20locked2%20will%20not%20change.%20%20They%20will%20not%20change%20%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20until%20the%20server%20tells%20us%20that%20the%20items%20in%20question%20have%20become%20unlocked%2C%20and%20that%20%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20will%20not%20happen%20until%20we%20finish%20this%20call%20stack%20%28i.e.%20return%20from%20this%20function%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20then%20his%20caller%2C%20then%20his%20caller%2C%20all%20the%20way%20up%20our%20lua%20code%29.%20\"&gt; DANGER! At this point, locked1 and locked2 will not change. They will not change \n until the server tells us that the items in question have become unlocked, and that \n will not happen until we finish this call stack (i.e. return from this function,\n then his caller, then his caller, all the way up our lua code). &lt;/a&gt;\n until not (locked1 or locked2)\n PickupContainerItem(bag1, slot1)\n PickupContainerItem(bag2, slot2)\n end\n DangerousSwapItems(1, 1, 1, 2)\n DangerousSwapItems(1, 2, 1, 3) --DANGER!

After Anzu faded into darkness, she created the arakkoa to represent her grace and his cunning. Her loyal &lt;a href=\"high%20arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; followers, the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, wage war on the cursed arakkoa in her name. The &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; are Rukhmar's children as well, and &lt;a href=\"Rukhran\"&gt;Rukhran&lt;/a&gt; is rumored to be her progeny.\nAs the mother of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, Rukhmar was their main and traditional deity; her veneration was eventually abandoned in favor of numerous other deities, such as &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ka%27alu\"&gt;Ka'alu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, and later an &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Old%20God\"&gt;unnamed Old God&lt;/a&gt;.\nRukhmar's children associated her with their Talon King &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, the goddess' chosen: it was thought they were both one and the same. When the arakkoan hero vanished, the believed reason was that the Arakkoa Outcasts had turned from Rukhmar; however, the truth is he went into a world of shadows in order to rejuvenate his weakened body. Thus, it seems unlikely that Terokk and Rukhmar were the same individuals after all.\nBiography.\nThe Gods of Arak.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt; that saturated the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; birthed many kinds of animals, but almost all of them were consumed by the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s. But with the end of the Evergrowth by the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s, life had a chance to thrive on Draenor once more, and the remains of &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt; became forests that teemed with Spirit and accelerated the development of new species. The first to arise were enormous creatures with extraordinary power over the land: some tapped into the power of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, some the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, and others the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Yet survival was a challenge because of the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, and winged species proved to be most suited to thrive on Draenor for they could fly out of reach of both forces. Most of Draenor's avians developed in a region called &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;, dominated by a massive spire that towered over dense woods. Three godlike creatures who took form in Arak were &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, Rukhmar, and &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;.\nRukhmar's spirit was touched by the primordial force of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Her connection to this energy allowed her to summon enchanted flames that could either destroy life or nourish it. White-hot fire constantly rippled over her reddish-orange wings without ever singeing her. For ages, the three largely kept to themselves, fighting off attacks from Primals and Breakers. Only Anzu dreamed of a better world for him and his feathered kin. He called on Rukhmar and Sethe to work together to transform Arak into a sanctuary for winged creatures of all kinds. As one, Anzu and his allies drove the children of stone and root from Arak. With the Primals and Breakers gone, Arak became a haven for winged species. Anzu, Rukhmar, and Sethe settled in as caretakers of the land and its varied species. Rukhmar developed close ties with the most beautiful birds: &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt;. She treated them as her own beloved children. She and the kaliri spent much of their time perched at the apex of Arak's spire, basking in the warmth of the sun. But while Rukhmar was noble, she was also arrogant. She saw herself as the epitome of grace and beauty among the world's creatures. She never set her talons on the ground, and she regarded the creatures that dwelled in and around the forests with disdain.\nOver the years, Sethe became envious of Rukhmar. He coveted the favor of the wind and the warmth of the sun that Anzu and Rukhmar had. Sethe tried to convince Anzu to help him slay Rukhmar, but Anzu was cunning and cared little for the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, unbeknownst to even Rukhmar, Anzu had feelings for her that he lacked have the courage to confess. In the dark of the night, Anzu sent one of his &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s to warn Rukhmar of Sethe's plot. Anzu watched from the top of a mountain spire as Rukhmar and Sethe clashed. Thanks to Anzu's warning, Rukhmar had the advantage. She flew high, put the sun at her back, and dove at Sethe. With a flap of her wings, she split the sky upon Sethe like the crack of a whip. Sethe crashed into the spire where they fought with such force that it crumbled and fell around him, creating the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Spire\"&gt;Broken Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnzu stepped into the battle then, pinning Sethe under his foot. Looking up at the raven god, Sethe uttered a dying curse: that his blood shall blacken the sea until it runs thick as tar, and his flesh shall fester and soil until the very sky rots with it. Anzu responded that they shall then leave no blood nor flesh, and devoured Sethe whole, picking the bones clean. But a small trickle of blood escaped and blighted the valley below, creating the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnzu felt Sethe's hatred coursing through him. His body contorted, his wings shriveled, and he became cursed without flight. His mind was wracked with painful visions. Anzu had contained &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Sethe's curse&lt;/a&gt; by taking it upon himself, and he would grapple with the curse for some time. He could not bear to present himself to Rukhmar, for if she had not seen him worthy before, then surely she would now be disgusted by the aberration he had become. He disappeared into the forest deeps, and ignored Rukhmar whenever she called for Anzu to show himself. Though Sethe's curse weakened Anzu, it also gave him new power: the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; that Sethe had once commanded. As Anzu grew more familiar with his abilities, he shrouded himself in a realm of shadow to hide from Rukhmar forever.\nThe Arakkoa.\nAfter much fruitless searching, Rukhmar gave up. She was humbled by Anzu's sacrifice, but she was also horrified by the curse that now darkened her home. Rukhmar took to the skies and left Arak, eventually settling atop &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;'s highest peak. Rukhmar decided that if she could not find Anzu to thank him, then she would reward his sacrifice by creating a new race in his honor. Using her own life energies, Rukhmar transformed some of her kaliri followers into the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;: \"heirs of Arak\". They embodied Rukhmar's physical grace and majesty, as well as Anzu's intellect and cleverness. Rukhmar intended that the arakkoa would one day return to Arak, but not yet. Sethe's curse still lingered, and she did not want her children to suffer from it. After they had matured and become wise, Rukhmar intended to lead her children back to their ancestral home. Her only fear was that she would not live long enough to do so, for she had expended much of her life essence in creating the arakkoa. She would never be as powerful as she had once been, and she knew she would eventually grow old and die.\nFor many generations, Rukhmar watched the arakkoa develop from afar. Occasionally she communed with them, telling them stories of Arak, Sethe's evil, and Anzu's nobility. She taught them rudimentary ways of commanding the Light, and they were quick learners. They mastered the Light and became adept healers and seers. Much of their primitive customs revolved around the worship of Rukhmar, who they revered as the goddess of the sun, which they saw as the source of their Light magic. But they were not content with the Light alone. Due to Rukhmar's teachings, they revered Anzu just as much as they did she, and they studied the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; that he had excelled in, becoming great sorcerers as well.\nThree thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, as the arakkoa flourished, Rukhmar felt her own life fading. She communed with her children one last time and urged them to claim Arak for themselves. Rukhmar took to the winds and soared south, and the arakkoa followed. But just as they reached Arak, Rukhmar breathed her last breath. Flames consumed her form and she burned like a second sun in the sky. The arakkoa saw Rukhmar's passing as a sign of their ascendancy. They vowed to create a grand civilization that would outshine any other culture on Draenor in order to honor her. The light of their knowledge and their power would blaze in the heavens just as Rukhmar had.\nLegacy.\nThe arakkoa society would come to be called the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;, with a group called the Anhar using the Light and the Skalax using arcane and the Void, both holding equal prestige and influence. During the height of Apexis culture, a small group of Anhari priests sought out the remains of Rukhmar. They found her charred bones near the spire, and used their magics to resurrect her. But it was only a partial success. This new Rukhmar had only a sliver of the original's power and intelligence. Nonetheless, the Apexis worshiped her as their goddess reborn. The Anhari infused her with their Light powers, granting her a long life so she could soar the skies for millennia.\nThe Talon King &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; would eventually come to be seen as an incarnation Rukhmar herself. After Terokk was betrayed, the arakkoa eventually were split into two races: the High Arakkoa, who became the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, and the Arakkoa Outcasts, flightless arakkoa led by Terokk himself. Rukhmar continued to favor the High Arakkoa, but shunned the Outcasts. The High Arakkoa began a war of genocide in her name against the Outcasts while she soared above, but this only prompted the Outcasts to sink into corruption and darkness.\nThis form of Rukhmar's death likely came at either the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, or Draenor's destruction and transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nWhile Rukhmar, Anzu, and Sethe were born from a large amount of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; as opposed to the coalesced power of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, they have similarities with &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s such as massive size, age, speech, and even Rukhmar creating the arakkoa like some Wild Gods made races of their own."}

{"id": "354823", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=354823", "title": "Rumblefitz", "text": "Rumblefitz was a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin%20alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt; who was hired by &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria%20%28item%29\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. He was partnered to the ogre &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn a personal level, Rumblefitz worked with Zhahara because she promised him access to the rare alchemical texts hidden within the libraries on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;. By his own admission, he had a habit of talking too much and people couldn't tell when he was kidding; he'd been told he was \"unreadable.\"\nBiography.\nRumblefitz and Blokk spied on &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; as they made their way from &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The goblin sent his companion to seek out Zhahara and tell her that he had found two &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and was planning on following them.\nRumblefitz pursued his targets to the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;. However, once on the tram car, Strongbo noticed the goblin and realized that he had been following them all day. In response, Rumblefitz tossed an explosive potion which sent several passengers flying and knocked Bo onto the car behind them. After a brief duel, Li Li managed to kick the alchemist off the car and onto the tracks below.\nThe goblin later heard from the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; of how the two pandaren had visited the festival. As Li Li and Bo made their way to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; aboard a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;, Rumblefitz, Blokk, and the &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt; pursued them on a ship. When Rumblefitz pointed out that the pandaren were pulling away, Rahjak simply stated that Zhahara would find them should the trio lose track of them, and either way the pandaren were sure to draw attention wherever they went. Rahjak explained that he intended to face Bo in combat in hopes of finding the moment called the \"breath of eternity\", but that Rumblefitz' stupidity could cost him his chance. The blademaster warned that if an incident like the Deeprun Tram happened again, he would skin Rumblefitz alive. When Rumblefitz started to reply in a mocking manner, Rahjak punched Blokk in the chest, causing the ogre to vomit, and then amended his statement: he would skin Rumblefitz alive, then feed what was left of him to the ogre. He finally stated, however, that he would let Rumblefitz live for now since Zhahara apparently saw something in him.\nRahjak eventually managed to capture Li Li in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; after she got separated from Strongbo. Zhahara's cohorts brought the pandaren to an island and chained her up, with Rumblefitz brewing a potion to drain her of her magic. Li Li tried to convince the goblin to help her stop Zhahara, but Rumblefitz explained that the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; had promised him first crack at the pandaren's alchemical texts. In response, Li Li asked if he had ever thought about simply asking to see the texts. The conversation was interrupted by Rahjak, who told Rumblefitz to give the pandaren a spyglass so she could watch Bo die once he arrived to save her.\nBo arrived at sunrise and began fighting Rahjak, but Li Li managed to escape her bonds after tricking Blokk. As she rushed toward Bo, Rumblefitz tried to stop her by throwing a potion which Li Li tossed back at him. The bottle shattered, instantly freezing Rumblefitz into a gold statue."}

{"id": "132818", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=132818", "title": "Rumholt Thunderaxe", "text": "Rumholt Thunderaxe, an &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarf&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt;, studied the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; for many months after learning of their reemergence. The Dark Irons had diverged from their Ironforge heritage in the few hundred years since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, gaining new abilities and losing old ones. Even their physical structure was different. Investigations into Rumholt's own family tree revealed that two of his ancestors \u2014 his grandfather's cousins \u2014 joined the Dark Irons during the war. Curiosity spurred Rumholt to great feats of research, but he finally realized that study in his comfortable Ironforge home was not enough.\nOne year ago, Rumholt purchased a magic item able to change his appearance (a hat of disguise) from a passing &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; merchant. Rumholt left a letter for his son Dedrik, who was abroad fighting &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;. This letter stated that Rumholt was leaving to \"conduct field research\" but left the specifics vague; it also stated that Rumholt did not know when he would return. With that, Rumholt left &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and set out for the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen he was safely away from the dwarven capital, Rumholt donned his hat of disguise and altered his appearance to resemble a Dark Iron dwarf. A few days later he encountered a Dark Iron band searching for ruins. Rumholt gave his name as M'nath Pikesplitter (his traitorous ancestors bore the Pikesplitter surname in the War of the Three Hammers). Rumholt claimed to be the sole survivor of a sudden &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; attack. The Dark Irons warily accepted Rumholt's company and headed back toward their headquarters to show this new acquisition to their chieftain, a dwarf called &lt;a href=\"Bakthet\"&gt;Bakthet&lt;/a&gt;. On the way, an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; group ambushed the band. Rumholt drew his axe and fought alongside the Dark Irons, and his dedication and prowess impressed his new companions. Rumholt entered the Dark Iron cave a hero \u2014 something he had never been in Ironforge.\nRumholt lived with the Dark Irons for months, partaking in their rituals and forays against troggs, gnolls and other Badlands creatures. He was a more competent fighter than many of them, having honed his skills in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s. Soon the Dark Irons not only accepted him, they honored him. They taught him their histories and the stories from the times before the War of Three Hammers \u2014 from their perspective, of course. Rumholt sympathized with them. He understood why his Pikesplitter ancestors had defected, and he was proud to wear their name.\nRumholt became more and more Dark Iron as time went on. He was not evil, but neither did he think the Dark Irons were evil, just misunderstood and justifiably vengeful. Rumholt did not participate in an attack against an Ironforge caravan, but neither did he condemn it.\nSix months after Rumholt joined the clan, a trogg band broke into the cave system. The troggs rampaged through the caverns, killing many before the Dark Irons defeated them. Among the dead was the chieftain Bakthet. A few Dark Irons threw Rumholt's name (actually, M'nath's name) into the running to become the new chieftain. Rumholt defeated his rivals in combat and became the clan's new leader, claiming the fallen chief's magic pendant as his prize.\nRumholt was ecstatic about his new position. Now he could be with the people he had come to respect and who respected him. And in his leadership position he could ensure that the Dark Irons fought only against evil creatures.\nYet Rumholt missed his son. Dedrik was Rumholt's only family, and he had not seen him in many long months. Rumholt knew that, patriotic as Dedrik was, once he truly saw the Dark Irons he would understand and stay with his father. Rumholt simply had to figure out a way to get him to his side.\nOne year after leaving Ironforge, Rumholt's scouts told him of a solitary Ironforge dwarf making his way across the Badlands. Rumholt recognized his son from the description. He was overjoyed. Though he briefly toyed with the idea of having his warriors abduct Dedrik, he dismissed that plan because it would only serve to demonstrate the Dark Irons' violent nature.\nInstead, Rumholt planted a message where Dedrik would be sure to find it. The message stated that Rumholt had been captured by Dark Iron dwarves and was being held prisoner. \"I do not believe they mean to harm me, but please come quickly!\" the message pleads. Rumholt knew that this would draw his son to his side. What he did not count on was Dedrik hiring a group of heroes to help him."}

To sustain himself, he hunted down &lt;a href=\"blue%20whelp\"&gt;blue whelp&lt;/a&gt;s near the &lt;a href=\"Azurewing%20Repose\"&gt;Azurewing Repose&lt;/a&gt;. After being confronted by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Stellagosa\"&gt;Stellagosa&lt;/a&gt;, Runas asked for forgiveness and offered to help the &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;Azurewing&lt;/a&gt;, who were under attack by &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; and suffering from an unusual loss of strength. The Azurewing's leader, &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;, was unconvinced of Runas's intentions.\nRunas led the adventurer and a projection of Senegos to the &lt;a href=\"Ley-Ruins%20of%20Zarkhenar\"&gt;Ley-Ruins of Zarkhenar&lt;/a&gt;, where a group of &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; were pulling energy from the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s that converged there. He asked the adventurer to retrieve some &lt;a href=\"Charged%20Mana%20Jewel\"&gt;mana jewels&lt;/a&gt; from the nightborne to fight off his hunger. In exchange, he told them how to disable the nightborne's mana siphons to re-energize Senegos's mana pool.\nAfter taking out the nightborne group's lieutenants, the adventurer attempted to defeat their prince, &lt;a href=\"Ael%27Yith\"&gt;Ael'Yith&lt;/a&gt;. However, Ael'Yith escaped and initiated an assault on the Azurewing, having decided they were an even more potent mana source than the ley lines. Runas returned to the &lt;a href=\"Azurewing%20Repose\"&gt;Azurewing Repose&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to warn them of the attack, but he came too late. At this point, Runas's mana withdrawal had advanced to an extreme degree. He bid farewell to the adventurer and thanked them for letting his last few hours mean something, then withered away.\nSenegos dedicated an entry in his &lt;a href=\"Senegos%27%20Magical%20Tome\"&gt;magical tome&lt;/a&gt; to thanking Runas."}

Metal cages in which to place the subjects of the Warlocks' experiments must be constructed, as well as the ornate metal runes that need to be built into the stone floors for the Warlocks' spells of summoning.\nIn Warcraft II.\nThe casting of ancient and powerful Runes enables the &lt;a href=\"Ogre-Mage%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Ogre-Mage&lt;/a&gt; to lay an abstruse trap for those hapless enough to enter into it.

Those who are diligent and watchful will catch a glimpse of the Rune as they approach it. The chaotic forces that make up this enchantment can not discern between ally or enemy and will kill a friend as surely as a foe. Heed these warnings well, as even staying near these Runes can be hazardous - for when the dwoemer dissolves, they explode as if their &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; had been triggered.\nRunes in Warcraft III.\nAfter the Third War some runes emerged to power up heroes of Azeroth.\nRunes in World of Warcraft.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; received a &lt;a href=\"Consecrated%20Rune\"&gt;Consecrated Rune&lt;/a&gt; from the paladin trainer &lt;a href=\"Bromos%20Grummner\"&gt;Bromos Grummner&lt;/a&gt; during their formation. \nRunes are featured in the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"rune%20system\"&gt;rune system&lt;/a&gt;, in the profession &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; that are etched with runes of power on their metallic skin. There are rumors that the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; practice rune magic of some kind. The &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; covered their &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s in mysterious runes. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Depths%20Necrolyte\"&gt;necrolytes&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Neltharion\"&gt;Maw of Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; would use &lt;a href=\"Necromantic%20Rune\"&gt;necromantic rune&lt;/a&gt;s to deposit the power they've drained from dead dragons.\nThe ancient worshippers of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; would use a runestone to summon a vortex of fire to destroy their enemies. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; uses runes to subjugate &lt;a href=\"elementals\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; uses runes to control plague disseminators.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; dropped &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Runestone\"&gt;Titan Runestone&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"Echoes%20of%20the%20Titans\"&gt;Echoes of the Titans&lt;/a&gt;. Warlocks use runic symbols in their summoning circles. The key to binding a wrathguard is to reduce the number of runic symbols used in the summoning circle.\nThe uses runes for protecting the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Shadowmoon Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. Shadowmoon runecarvers were notable, responsible for the runes used by the clan. Runes were inscribed on the flesh of the Shadowmoon clan in order to more clearly speak to their ancestors and the elements. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; seem to use runes, as an incarceration rune was used on &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; used spell runes, and the scholars of &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Nar'thalas Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; were renowned for their knowledge on them. The &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt; use runes to subjugate living spirits and to control the dead. The Legion used runes to corrupt the land with fel energy. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; use &lt;a href=\"Lightbound%20Runestone\"&gt;Lightbound Runestone&lt;/a&gt; to transport their troops to distant worlds.\nSeveral runes are elaborated on from books in Dalaran during the quest &lt;a href=\"Dabbling%20in%20the%20Demonic\"&gt;Dabbling in the Demonic&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; and their offshoot the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; use runes for empowerment, protection, and as tools. The &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt; use runes for controlling machines, and for protecting their ships into dangerous territory like &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, a rune on the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Melody\"&gt;Abyssal Melody&lt;/a&gt; where Void-aligned Tidesages are corrupting the ship can be seen where &lt;a href=\"Samuel%20Williams\"&gt;Samuel Williams&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a &lt;a href=\"k%27thir\"&gt;k'thir&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Halsey\"&gt;Brother Halsey&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe runic language employed throughout the Shadowlands can be traced back to the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;. He devised a unique language of intricate symbols, each individually representing a specific word tied to the very foundations of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and the might of the five houses, from simple commands, to necromantic energy manipulation. One example are the runes found on the &lt;a href=\"runeforge\"&gt;runeforged&lt;/a&gt; weaponry of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Their massive two-handed runeblades are emblazoned with words of power set in runes, each with translations such as \"Razorice\" and \"Fallen Crusader\".\nIn order to imprison his brother, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, the Primus invented an even more potent runic language: &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;. Its sole purpose was to be the utter suppression of another.\nIn Shadowlands, Domination magic has been seen used for many things, such as creating a vessel, subjugating a spirit, creating an item of great power, warding. &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; also uses runes for various purposes such as sealing entrances to important locations or to perform necromantic rituals within the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; continue using runes to control spirits and protecting themselves.\nIn the RPG.\nA rune is an arcane symbol inscribed on a creature, surface, or object. Runes exist in groups called families, which are composed of ten runes. No runes ever require a verbal component. Inscribing a rune requires physical contact with the target.\nThe Runic Art.\nThose who seek to understand and master runic power understand that the convergences of the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s are not the only important part of this power \u2014 the patterns formed by the lines themselves are important as well. These patterns, which resemble letters in a strange alphabet, are called runes. Each rune is a reflection of a pattern of energy lines somewhere in the world. Each such pattern creates a certain magical effect when energy flows in that specific formation, though in its natural occurrence, this effect is much too broad and scattered to have a meaningful impact.\nThose who master runes, then, seek to duplicate those patterns in smaller forms; their runes manifest &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al power that is &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; in nature, but purely benign and non-corrupting. They are manifestations of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s own unique flows of power, nothing more.\nThese secrets represent recent understandings of rune magic \u2014 until recently, it was believed that runes were simply symbols of power from ancient days. With the discovery of the ties between the form of runes and the patterns of natural power in the world, it is only a matter of time before more rune families are uncovered, extrapolated from other natural power sites.\nRunes are organized into rune patterns, which are not actually separate runes. Instead, each rune pattern is a grand, complex rune that encompasses the individual designs of each rune within that pattern. Thus, the rune for a more complex spell actually includes the pattern of the less complex spell that precedes it in the rune pattern, which itself includes the pattern of the cantrip that begins that pattern. Essentially, each rune pattern is a larger and larger pattern, the center of which is the rune for the simplest rune, which is added to in greater degrees of complexity the higher up the tree one goes.\nEmpowering a Rune.\nEmpowering a rune means flooding it with arcane power, and the process is nearly identical to casting a spell. Runes are inert before their creator empowers them. Thus, rune magic is a two-part process: first the caster creates the rune, and then, immediately or some time later, he empowers it. All characters with this ability are called rune-casters (just as all characters able to cast spells are spellcasters). Note that the character empowering a rune does not have to be the same character who created the rune, but he does have to be aware of the rune\u2019s existence and know the rune pattern.\nWhile empowering a rune is akin to casting a spell, the two actions are very different. Where the normal arcane caster channels arcane power and shapes it through the use of gesture, word and material components, the runecaster simply shunts the energy into the pattern formed by the rune, serving as the channel between the energy and the rune.\nThis process defines the difference between runecasting and arcane spellcasting, and is the reason that the use of runes does not cause arcane corruption. The patterns of traditional arcane spellcasting are not natural \u2014 the energy of the world, which emanates from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, does not flow into those patterns without the dominating will of the arcane caster to bend and spindle it into those shapes. This is an act of supreme hubris; the forcing of the world\u2019s essential power to submit to the desires of the caster is the reason that other kinds of arcane casting cause corruption.\nRune-casting uses patterns that already exist in the world. Since these are naturally occurring patterns created by manifestations of the Well of Eternity\u2019s power in the world, the rune-caster need not force the energy to obey him. It flows willingly into the patterns \u2014 these are the patterns that the energy itself created, duplicated\non a smaller scale.\nRune Patterns.\nAncient lore groups runes into rune patterns. In reality, each pattern is the two-dimensional depiction of an intricate network of &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s located somewhere in the world. These patterns are incredibly complex, made up as they are of many lines and curves. Runes are the written representation of the paths that the ley lines follow around and through geographical features in magically powerful sites.\nA character learns new runes the same way other characters learn new spells, by paying another runecaster. However, rune-casters who seek out runic sites may meditate on the flows of power to gain new understanding.\nRunic Sites.\nThe patterns that make up rune patterns are not simply arcane scribblings, each is the two-dimensional representation of a place in the world that some runecaster has had the opportunity to study. By discovering the precise layout of the ley lines in a place of power, the nature of that place can be recreated: The ley lines of a scorching desert rendered into a rune might create effects of burning destruction, while those of a deep swampland might perhaps create runes of rot or decay.\nWhen a rune-caster is present at the site upon which a rune pattern is based, he is considered to be more skilled for the purpose of determining the effects of runes from the native pattern.\nTypes of Runes.\nThere are three kinds of runes: marks, glyphs and sigils. A mark is inscribed upon a creature, and each mark targets a single creature. A glyph is cast upon an object, and each glyph targets a single object. A sigil is placed upon an object or creature in order to create an effect in an area, with that object or creature at the center. Each sigil has an area that it affects.\nMarks.\nMarks are runes inscribed on a creature. The subject must be still, so marks cannot be inscribed on unwilling creatures, however a mark can be inscribed on any helpless creature. Marks generate their effects immediately upon completion. Some inscribes have the ability to delay mark activation or even to make a mark permanent.\nGlyphs.\nGlyphs are runes inscribed on an object. As with marks, a glyph can not be inscribed on an object in the possession of an unwilling creature. Glyphs activate immediately upon completion. Again, some inscribes are able to extend the life of a glyph or even to make one permanent.\nSigils.\nSigils are runes inscribed on a surface that subsequently acts as the rune's trigger. The affected surface is always five-foot by five-foot area, and the first creature to enter the space with a sigil activates it, even if the creature is unaware of the sigil. Sigils last until triggered, dispelled or erased. The inscriber can choose to activate a sigil upon its completion as part of the final inscription process. An activated sigil always generates a thirty-foot-radius burst centered on the rune, affecting all creatures in its area.\nCrafting Runes.\nBecause the power of rune magic is dependent upon the pattern of the rune itself, the one thing that all rune effects have in common is the necessity for the rune to physically exist in order for the magic to take effect. Every rune can be used in one of three ways: as a spontaneous rune, as a scribed rune, and as a permanent rune.\nSpontaneous Runes.\nSpontaneous runes are created when the rune-caster doesn\u2019t have the time to properly scribe a rune on a surface (in combat, for instance). All rune-casters keep small pieces of wood or stone upon which they scribe the runes they know. These small plaques cost almost nothing to create, and most rune-casters create them in their spare time, storing them with their material components. When casting a rune, the rune-caster touches one of these runestones or runesticks to the target and channels the power through the rune. The rune fades from the runestone and appears on the target, appearing to be burned onto non-living objects or etched in glowing lines onto the flesh of creatures. While the quickest form of rune-making possible, spontaneous runes are also the most fragile. Casting a spontaneous rune, unlike other runes, is only a one-step process: Placing the rune on the target and empowering it occur at the same time.\nScribed Runes.\nScribed runes represent the preferred method of creating runes. Using a set of special paints, the runecaster can create a lasting rune. Because the rune exists upon the subject, none of the spell\u2019s energy need be wasted in creating the rune, as is done with spontaneous runes. The benefit of a scribed rune is that it is more difficult to destroy and dispel than a spontaneous rune, and the range is usually longer. Placing a scribed rune upon the body of a creature requires that the creature be willing or helpless, while placing such a rune upon an object requires that the rune-caster handles the object. Scribed runes last for number of days depending on the skill of the caster, or until empowered. After the rune\u2019s empowerment ends, the rune fades away.\nPermanent Runes.\nPermanent runes are runes that, once created, are nearly impossible to destroy, for their magic is such that even with the passage of time, the rune remains. Living flesh must be tattooed with the marks (though some orc runemasters are said to practice a form of ritual branding). Most nonliving material is etched with a ritual stylus or set of special chisels. The rune-caster must also place a small part of his own spirit into the rune. The benefit of a permanent rune is that it is more difficult to destroy than a spontaneous rune. Thus, when the magic empowering the rune fades (i.e., its duration expires), the rune still exists on the target, and the runecaster can empower it again. Placing a permanent rune upon the body of a creature requires that the creature be willing or helpless, while placing such a rune upon an object requires that the rune-caster handles the object.\nDetecting Runes.\nPerhaps the primary downfall of rune-casting lies in the fact that it is unsubtle. Objects, places and people marked with runes are obvious, for the runes are sprawling, complex patterns that appear to be inked, etched, tattooed or seared into the surface of the thing they affect. A rune may be concealed beneath something (such as clothing for runes upon creatures, or behind a tapestry for a rune etched into a wall), but if the rune is currently generating a magical effect, it gives itself away, for it glows with arcane energy.\nWhen runes generate magical effects, they glow. The color depends upon the caster and the rune, but is often gold or silver. These runes are obviously magic and active. If the rune is concealed, a better look allows a creature to notice the glow or see the effects of the rune in the air around the target. An empowered rune sometimes creates a strange rippling effect, like heat off of stone in the middle of a desert. A detect magic spell reveals the presence of an empowered rune, though it does not reveal what specific effect is in place. It does grant a glimpse at the pattern of energy it forms, however, so that those who use detect magic may gain an idea of a rune\u2019s pattern is.\nDestroying Runes.\nBecause the scribed pattern of the rune provides the pattern for the power to flow, destroying a rune can destroy the magic it creates. However, it is the nature of such patterns to be self-preserving. so they are hard to destroy because the patterns are natural, and energy is easily pulled into them. As a result, the runes themselves are difficult to destroy.\nA rune has a hardness, and a toughness equal to the runes power. A rune catches attacks in arcane streams of power, so attacking a rune deals no damage to the object or person upon which it is placed, unless the attack deals enough damage to destroy the rune (in which case the rune\u2019s bearer takes the excess damage).\nSpontaneous runes are easily destroyed in the fashion of other magic, through the use of dispel magic and similar spells. Additionally, destroying the rune itself dispels the effect.\nScribed and permanent runes are more difficult to destroy. The inks used to create them provide no great resistance until they are empowered, but once the rune is empowered, the inks regenerate for as long as the empowerment lasts. Additionally, in order to use a dispel magic or a similar ability on a scribed or permanent rune, the rune must be greatly damaged. A dispelling effect that is more powerful than the rune can dispel it without this restriction. If the rune\u2019s magic is dispelled in such a fashion, the rune is destroyed.\nDark Runecasters.\nIn an interview about \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Factions\"&gt;Dark Factions&lt;/a&gt;\" with Luke Johnson, he said that &lt;a href=\"dark%20inscriber\"&gt;dark inscriber&lt;/a&gt;s use &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s to channel necromantic and/or demonic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe effect of a rune depending on the symbol drawn.\nThe effect of a rune might be determined by the symbol drawn. For example, the rune/symbol drawn on hearthstones (which teleports their users home) means home. &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Belvar\"&gt;Prospector Belvar&lt;/a&gt; omitted the runes for \"north\" and \"west\" because he wasn't sure how they'd impact the stone giant he sought to control.\nRune sets.\nWithin the game, three sets of runes are used repeatedly:"}
