As such, he appears in several zones and his storyline is often entwined with other recurring characters such as &lt;a href=\"Adarrah\"&gt;Adarrah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBurning Crusade.\nBudd Nedreck was the well-spoken, often snooty explorer that &lt;a href=\"Griftah\"&gt;Griftah&lt;/a&gt; sent players to, just outside of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Griftah%27s%20Note\"&gt;Griftah's Note&lt;/a&gt; was short and to the point. \"Listen up, Budd! This be the last fool I send 'til ya pay me all ya be own'. No more stallin!\"\nBudd was looking for treasure, and all sources pointed to Zul'Aman - but Budd wasn't about to go in there and get it himself. Instead, he sent adventurers in to do the dirty work for him, taking anyone who could even work a shovel. His first task was retrieving a map that was lost by previous recruits who had failed to return from their own. Then he had players fill in the missing parts of the map, after which he sent them to dispatch &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Hex Lord Malacrass&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout it all, Budd was obviously the brains of the operation - insistent that one day the player would also get to partake in wealth beyond their wildest dreams. But he changed his tune once the Hex Lord was defeated, intent on stealing all the glory for himself.\nPlayers who returned to Zul'Aman, killed &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and retrieved the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Zul%27jin\"&gt;Blood of the Warlord&lt;/a&gt; were entreated to return it to Budd by the quest text: \"As you examine the pulsating vial, your thoughts turn to the petulant little man outside Zul'Aman. You can't wait to see Budd's expression when he sees this!\" Budd proceeded to take the vial of blood and toss it on a burning building, bragging about his triumphs to the sky and taking all credit for Zul'jin's demise. While ordinarily this would be irritating for players who worked so hard to progress through the raid, in this case, it was far better that he claimed credit. After throwing the blood in the fire, Budd was swept up into the air by malevolent spirits and thrown into the fire, after which he proceeded to run around ablaze.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBudd and his band of treasure seekers and troll slayers have moved camp to &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; in search of new profits. But his fate at Zul'Aman had an unfortunate side effect: Budd had pretty much lost his mind and thought he was a troll complete with a troll mask. His band of cohorts, not wanting to leave Budd behind, used him as troll bait by using his fragile state of mind to sic him on the local trolls of the area. Budd thought he was playing \"Troll tag,\" but mostly what he was doing was knocking trolls silly with a frying pan, all the while happily shouting \"tag!\" to any he happened to hit.\nCataclysm.\nBudd makes an appearance at the opening sequence to the &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt; zone, where after his mercenary vessel, which carries &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, is sunk by &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt;. He ends up at &lt;a href=\"Budd%27s%20Dig\"&gt;Budd's Dig&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kelp%27thar%20Forest\"&gt;Kelp'thar Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also appears in &lt;a href=\"Thistleshrub%20Valley\"&gt;Thistleshrub Valley&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; near the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Adarrah\"&gt;Adarrah&lt;/a&gt;. Budd and the others were planning to drive a caravan into Uldum to search for artifacts. Unluckily, the caravan was ambushed by &lt;a href=\"pygmy\"&gt;pygmy&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries that were hired by the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; to kill any intruders. Budd concocted a crazy plan to get the team and a &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; prince out of the Tol'vir city, which, strangely enough, worked.\nPlayers fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt; may receive Budd as one of their random strike force partners in the daily quest, &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;The Protectors of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nBudd visits Garrison's tavern in order to find some shiny things.\nQuotes.\nI love boats!\nHave you checked out my &lt;a href=\"Deepdive%20Helmet\"&gt;breathin' hat&lt;/a&gt;?\nNo more &lt;a href=\"Breath%23Objects\"&gt;suckin' on clams&lt;/a&gt; for Budd! No sirree...\nNo time to be talkin', mon. I be needin' to rest now...\nIt ain't all bad...\nI still got my breathin' hat!\nAhoy!\nListen, &lt;class&gt;. It's clear that you and your friends know your way around Azeroth. Surely you've come across certain folks who hunger for fame and fortune.\nSend me anyone who might be willing to enter Zul'Aman and I'll make it worth your while."}

{"id": "13045", "revid": "214161", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13045", "title": "Buff", "text": "Most often, a buff refers to a temporary beneficial spell or effect placed on a player. Buffs can range in effect from simple personal shields to buffs which augment almost every category of &lt;a href=\"stats\"&gt;stats&lt;/a&gt; a given player may have for their race or class.\nBuffs can be of two types: those that expire over time (simple buffs like &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Brilliance\"&gt;Arcane Brilliance&lt;/a&gt;) or those that are dependent on the environment around you (like the AoE effect given by &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;s). You can dismiss an active buff that expires over time by right-clicking on its icon.\nMost buffs do not stack with other similar buffs. One prominent exception is &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; spells; heal over time spells from multiple characters and different heal over time spells from the same character (such as a druid's &lt;a href=\"Regrowth\"&gt;Regrowth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;) will stack with each other.\nBuff can also be used as a verb, i.e. \"to buff\" means to apply buffs.\nBuff is also used to represent a change to a class or ability that makes it more effective or useful. It is the opposite of a &lt;a href=\"nerf\"&gt;nerf&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaid Buffs.\nSome buffs were introduced in Dragonflight. These include:\nMonks and Demon Hunters bring Raid Debuffs against all targets they hit, in the form of &lt;a href=\"Mystic%20Touch\"&gt;Mystic Touch&lt;/a&gt; (increased physical damage taken) and &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Brand\"&gt;Chaos Brand&lt;/a&gt; (increased magical damage taken).\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThere were 9 standard raid buffs, which are provided by a number of different abilities. Duplicate abilities with the same effect would not stack, but you could combine buffs with different effects. For example, &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Mark of the Wild&lt;/a&gt;'s increased stats did not stack with &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Emperor\"&gt;Legacy of the Emperor&lt;/a&gt; as both increased stats; but &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Mark of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; did stack with , as stats are a different buff effect to stamina.\nSome abilities apply more than one buff. When you are in the &lt;a href=\"Proving%20Grounds\"&gt;Proving Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, you automatically receive all 9 buffs until you leave the instance. A raid that consists of a party capable of providing all 9 buffs is considered an optimal raid, and when forming a raid party you should try to ensure that each of the buffs will be available. While not technically raid buffs, &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Wounds\"&gt;Mortal Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Resurrect%23Combat%20resurrection\"&gt;combat resurrection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%23Burst%20Haste\"&gt;Burst Haste&lt;/a&gt; are often just as desirable.\nThe buffs are:\nWeaker versions of some buffs can be provided by consumable items. While these versions are weaker, it is worthwhile to have an inventory of these items when raiding, in case a class capable of providing the full version of a particular buff is not available. Like the abilities above, these do not stack with similar effects:\nBurst Haste.\nAnother factor to consider when devising a group composition is a Burst of Haste. A cooldown that provides 30% Haste while it is up, it is different to the other buffs because it is temporary with a duration of 40s, and then cools down for 10 minutes from the start of the buff. These spells are generally used at a critical moment during a raid encounter predetermined by the raid leader, based on the party's strategy.\nThis buff can provided by the following classes:\nIf one of these classes is not available, a weaker version of the Burst Haste buff can usually be provided by a Leatherworking consumable. At the time of Dragonflight, this is specifically &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Hide%20Drums\"&gt;Feral Hide Drums&lt;/a&gt; which provides 15% Haste at the same duration.\nSince Shadowlands, all Priests now also bring the &lt;a href=\"Power%20Infusion\"&gt;Power Infusion&lt;/a&gt; cooldown which can be cast on a single ally to grant them 25% Haste for 20 seconds, although due to its smaller nature this is generally not considered as important as the full Burst of Haste type effect. Power Infusion stacks with the Burst of Haste effect.\nList of notable buffs from environment.\nLordaeron's Blessing.\nIncreases &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt; by 5%.\nLasts: 30 min\nHow to get: Take control of the northpass tower in Eastern Plaguelands, click the altar that appears outside the door.\nNotes: Persists in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and persisted in the original &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFire Resist.\nIncreases &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; by 83.\nLasts: 1 hour\nHow to get: &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; (either by the &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; spell or the &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; device) a &lt;a href=\"Scarshield%20Spellbinder\"&gt;Scarshield Spellbinder&lt;/a&gt;, found in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes: Sometimes the tooltip will say differing amounts of Fire Resistance, but the buff always provides 83 resistance.

They are solitary predators who are feared for their grisly hunting tactics: they swoop down on unsuspecting prey and savagely eviscerate them. Their boney beaks can snap through armor and their powerful claws have been known to perforate even the strongest equipment. Their spines are thin, hollow, and needle-like. Their hides are light, allowing them to fly, but also quite tough, which allowed them to survive Korthia's arrival to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.

Moreso than other regions of its level range (35-45), the Badlands is fairly difficult for Horde to reach. The only entrances to the region come either through Alliance territory far from Horde flight paths (&lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;) or high level areas far from Horde flight paths (&lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;).\nThere are a few alternatives. All of these assume that you are traveling from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, but it should be fairly obvious how to alter them to account for alternate starting points.\nThe quickest way, albeit rather gimmicky, is to queue for the &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; instance using the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; (This can only be done at about levels 34-42, but these are the levels at which the Badlands are appropriate to quest in). Once in, die and resurrect at the spirit healer (incurring &lt;a href=\"resurrection%20sickness\"&gt;resurrection sickness&lt;/a&gt;). You are now in the Badlands, and can run southwest to Kargath. Note that it is bad etiquette to quit a dungeon group immediately; you should probably stick around for the instance. \nThe second quickest route (assuming you don't already have flight points in Arathi or Hillsbrad) makes use of a teleporter in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, accessible via a short quest chain that starts in Orgrimmar. This path goes through two low-level Alliance regions, so is more risky on PvP servers, but fairly easy on PvE servers. If you are a level high enough to survive in the Badlands, you should not have much problem. Do the following:\nA more traditional route overland route runs from the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; through five other regions. With care, this can be done by level 20+ characters, but the distance is quite long so a travel form or mount is recommended. Of course, if you have one of the flight points listed below already, fly there from the Undercity and then continue from there. \nAn overland approach also exists from the south, but it is even longer and much more dangerous, heading through a couple level 50+ regions:"}

This is much simpler for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players who can simply run through &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, but has proven difficult for Horde characters who do not have the flight point. If you are Horde, and have the FP, simply fly to Stonard. If not, read on.\nConventional route.\nThis path assumes that you are beginning in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, though you may be able to skip ahead if you are already familiar with &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.

(Watch for swimming crocs!)\nNote: As you swim you will likely see your zone change directly from Wetlands to Swamp of Sorrows. After you enter the Swamp of Sorrows zone, you have to swim a while longer before you get to Misty Reed Strand. There is no way to access Badlands, Burning Steppes or Redridge Mountains from the sea. There are a couple places you can climb the mountain bases into the Redridge zone \"border\", but you cannot climb into the main area of the zone. \nAlso Note: This route means swimming trapped between mountains and the sea for at least 1/2 an hour."}

The venom drops less than half the time, so you'll be killing a lot of scorpions to complete this.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Aged%20Kodo%20Hide\"&gt;Aged Kodo Hide&lt;/a&gt;s are dropped with pretty much every aged kodo slain.\nThe aged kodo travel in herds, mostly along the trails (who do you think made the trails) along the south and west, usually ending up near the &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Graveyard\"&gt;Kodo Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "15037", "revid": "541395", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15037", "title": "Realm", "text": "A realm is an instance of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" (WoW) game world. Realms are hosted on physical devices called &lt;a href=\"server%20blade\"&gt;server blade&lt;/a&gt;s (for this reason, the terms \"realm\" and \"server\" are often used interchangeably). This prevents any one realm from becoming too crowded and overwhelming its associated server, provides for better connection times by allowing players to connect to local servers, allows for &lt;a href=\"localization\"&gt;localized&lt;/a&gt; communities based on language, and allows different play-styles for different groups of users. Each realm also has its own name, generally taken from an important character, location or group within the Warcraft universe. \nTo play \"WoW\", you must first choose a realm to play on. You then connect to this realm over the Internet. Blizzard has servers in the US, Europe, China, and Korea. For a list of all realms, see &lt;a href=\"realms%20list\"&gt;realms list&lt;/a&gt;.\nChoosing a server is an important decision involving many factors. For a fuller exploration and some helpful tips for choosing, see &lt;a href=\"Newbie_guide/Picking_a_Server\"&gt;Picking a Server&lt;/a&gt;.\nFunctionality.\nEach realm is a complete version of the game world but has its own player characters who are tied to that particular realm. Players can interact with all the characters on their current realm but cannot generally interact with players on other realms. This includes communicating, forming parties and guilds, sending mail, trading and directly interacting. Each realm is a discrete instance of the game world, and as such events that take place on one realm will not affect other realms, including world progression such as the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, and realm first achievements.\nA character must be created on a specific realm, and can only be played by selecting that realm. Players may create characters on any number of realms up to a maximum of sixty characters per WoW account.\nCharacters cannot move between realms via in-game means. However, players may take advantage of free character migrations (FCMs) or paid &lt;a href=\"Character%20Transfer\"&gt;Character Transfer&lt;/a&gt;s to move characters between realms. It is not possible to move characters between different &lt;a href=\"%23Regions\"&gt;regions&lt;/a&gt;.\nExceptions to the above rules include &lt;a href=\"Connected%20Realms\"&gt;Connected Realms&lt;/a&gt;, where multiple realms function as a single cohesive realm; &lt;a href=\"cross-realm%20zone\"&gt;cross-realm zone&lt;/a&gt;s, where certain &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s may feature characters from several different servers; and &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; instances, which may feature characters from separate servers. One notable exception is the &lt;a href=\"RealID\"&gt;RealID&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BattleTag\"&gt;BattleTag&lt;/a&gt; systems, which allow players to invite other players from other realms to join their party. All characters in the party will be moved to the realm of the current leader and will function fully in that realm, including queuing for arena and instances.\nTypes.\nThere are currently four main types of realm available to players: Player vs. Environment (PvE), Player vs. Player (PvP), Roleplaying (RP), and Roleplaying Player vs. Player (RP-PvP). Each type of realm features a slightly different ruleset. While PvE realms are the basic option, PvP and RP-PvP realms allow for increased &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;, while RP and RP-PvP realms are designed to facilitate &lt;a href=\"roleplaying\"&gt;roleplaying&lt;/a&gt;, and accordingly have certain requirements and expectations of their players. Test realms are a special type of realm available for players to test features from coming patches.\nAccording to the North American realm status page, there are 241 total NA realms. Of these 113 are Normal (PvE) servers, 105 are PvP, 17 are RP, and 6 are RP-PvP. For Europe, there are 109 English speaking realms, 87 German, 37 French, 11 Spanish, and 19 Russian, for a total of 263 realms. This breaks down into 99 Normal (PvE), 129 PvP, 20 RP, and 15 RP-PvP servers.\nGame version.\nRealms are sectioned off by the type of game version they're on:\nPlayer versus environment.\nAbbreviated PvE, the &lt;a href=\"PvE%20realm\"&gt;player versus environment realm&lt;/a&gt; allows for a more relaxed style while in the world. PvE realms focus on &lt;a href=\"player%20versus%20environment\"&gt;player versus environment&lt;/a&gt; (PvE) play and depending on the location within the world, it is more difficult to initiate &lt;a href=\"player%20versus%20player\"&gt;player versus player&lt;/a&gt; (PvP) combat on these realms. This type of realm is also referred to as a \"normal\" realm. PvE realms are generally recommended for new players, since there is no risk of unwanted PvP combat or ganking from other players.\nPlayer versus player.\nAbbreviated PvP, the &lt;a href=\"PvP%20realm\"&gt;player versus player realm&lt;/a&gt; differs from the normal realm. PvP realms have an increased amount of &lt;a href=\"player%20versus%20player\"&gt;player versus player&lt;/a&gt; combat, in the form of &lt;a href=\"World%20PvP\"&gt;World PvP&lt;/a&gt;; entering any &lt;a href=\"contested%20territory\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt; or enemy territory automatically &lt;a href=\"PvP%20flag\"&gt;flags&lt;/a&gt; the character being used for PvP combat, and the character cannot be unflagged while in these zones. The player will remain flagged for five minutes after having left a contested or enemy territory. PvP realms are generally recommended for those who enjoy knowing that they could be attacked at any time.\nRoleplaying.\nAbbreviated RP, the &lt;a href=\"roleplaying\"&gt;roleplaying&lt;/a&gt; realm features the PvE playstyle with roleplaying rules, which apply to behavior and naming.\nRoleplaying player versus player.\nAbbreviated RP-PvP, the &lt;a href=\"RP-PvP\"&gt;roleplaying-player versus player realm&lt;/a&gt; features the PvP playstyle with roleplaying rules, which apply to behavior and naming.\nTest.\nNot a normal option for character creation, &lt;a href=\"Test%20Realm\"&gt;Test Realm&lt;/a&gt;s are special realms that are periodically made available, in which players can try experimental features in development before they get released as general &lt;a href=\"patches\"&gt;patches&lt;/a&gt;. Test realms often exist in both PvE and PvP varieties.\nRegions.\nAs with all \"World of Warcraft\" play, servers are divided into regions. The current regions are Americas &amp; Oceania, Europe, China, Taiwan and Korea. \"World of Warcraft\" accounts are region-specific and only allow for use of features related to that region, including access to servers.\nCharacters cannot be transferred to realms in other regions, and a player cannot communicate with or invite players from other regions. Cross-realm features such as &lt;a href=\"cross-realm%20zone\"&gt;cross-realm zone&lt;/a&gt;s and battleground instances do not function cross-region. Currently, all leaderboards and ladders (eg &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt;) are region- or realm-specific.\nMany server names are found in multiple regions. Non-US realms are distinguished on multi-region server lists by use of a prefix, such as and .\nLanguages.\nEuropean realms are divided up by which language is primarily spoken on them, each realm having a specified language. Fully localized realms also feature game text and names in the specified language.\nWhile you will not be banned if you do not fluently speak that realm's specified language, you may feel more comfortable in a realm where the majority of players speak a language that you understand.\nPopulation.\nEach realm has a population listed on the realm selection screen. Each realm is characterized as having Recommended, Low, Medium, High, or Full population. Recommended realms are realms that &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; feels will give a new player the best experience, while the rest are categorized based on how many players are currently logged into the realm. Players cannot create a character on a Full realm unless they already have characters on that realm. Full realms are deemed 'full' by Blizzard and as such, their 'full' status does not fluctuate like a 'high' population realm's might. There is no reason to wait until off-peak times to see if you will be allowed to create a character on a 'full' realm.\nA realm's population impacts its play experience in many ways. Higher population server boasts far more players with whom to communicate, trade and group, but may feature waiting times simply to log into the game, and users may experience lag and server stress problems at peak times. On lower population servers there are fewer other players to group with, making non-cross-realm features such as an arena, trading and serious end-game play much harder to achieve. However, players do not have to queue to play the game, and lag and server problems are minimal.\nThe population can also affect play within the larger game world. High population servers may feature far more competition for resources and quest mobs, and an increased chance of &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;, especially on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20server\"&gt;PvP server&lt;/a&gt;s. In extreme cases, high numbers of players in busy areas can cause long queues to complete quests, or even cause the server to crash. Lower population servers typically feature little such competition, but also make it harder to find other players with whom to interact. However, in extremely low population areas, the &lt;a href=\"cross-realm%20zones\"&gt;cross-realm zones&lt;/a&gt; feature may act to mitigate these differences by introducing players from other realms. This feature does not affect capital cities or most end-game zones but may improve the experience while leveling on lower population servers. While server population affects many areas of the game world, it has little impact on cross-realm aspects of the game, such as non-rated &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s or dungeons queued for through the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaction balance.\nAside from the overall population, each server features a different balance between the factions. Unlike the overall population, this information is not displayed in the server list, although it can be viewed through sites such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftrealms.com/\"&gt;WarcraftRealms.com&lt;/a&gt;. The population of a character's faction is often far more important than the combined population of the server, and since many aspects of play including the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; are faction-specific, individual characters' play experience is largely determined by this rather than by the total population. For example, a Horde character may play on a server highly populated with Alliance characters, yet find few other Horde characters with whom to play, trade, etc. &lt;a href=\"World%20PvP\"&gt;World PvP&lt;/a&gt; is one area where the population of the opposite faction can be directly significant, especially on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20server\"&gt;PvP server&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIndividuality.\nWhile different realms are almost identical in their game world, NPCs and rules, in practice each offers a slightly different playing experience, as well as a unique collection of players to encounter and interact with. While server type, population, and language are some of the more obvious differences between servers, there are many other factors that can lead to realms offering their own unique environment. \nAs separate instances of the game world, realms may develop their own reputation or sub-culture, specific to that server, or even to one faction of that server's population. The presence of well-known guilds or players may also affect the reputation of a realm, with some realms becoming well-known or notorious as a result of the actions of certain inhabitants.\nPlayer interaction ensures that each realm offers a unique experience, with communication and group play largely only available within a server. Aside from population and server type, some realms feature more guilds with a certain focus, such as rated battlegrounds or high-end raiding, with players sometimes choosing to transfer characters between servers in order to join a particularly prestigious or desirable guild. \nStatistics.\nRealm statistics provide some interesting insight into overall player trends and certain differences between regions and server types. The following data was taken from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftrealms.com/\"&gt;WarcraftRealms.com&lt;/a&gt;, current for October 2015, and represents only the number of characters recorded on US and EU servers.\nFaction balance:\nServer type:\nExternal links.\nUS\nEU\nKorea\nFansites"}

The system generates a score for an achievement based on the percentage of players on the realm that have completed it. The more players that have completed the achievement, the fewer points it's worth. \nrealmRanker was not designed to be a raid progression tracking system, rather it was designed to give a measure of skill and/or dedication of a given guild. The theory behind this is that the fewer people have a given achievement, the harder the achievement must be to get. This works for most cases, however it does not work for all. \nOne case where ranking achievements in this way falls apart is in the \"100,000 Honor Kills\" sort of achievements. While there's something to be said for a player having 100,000+ honor kills, it's not so much a measure of player skill, rather it is a measure of the time the player has been playing \"World of Warcraft\" and how much they PVP. These sorts of achievements are included in the score generated by RealmRanker, giving older characters a boost over younger ones. "}

The Avatar can be summoned in the Sanctum of the Fallen God using either an &lt;a href=\"Egg%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Egg of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Yeh%27kinya%27s%20Scroll\"&gt;Yeh'kinya's Scroll&lt;/a&gt; or by simply clicking the Shrine of the Soulflayer.\nThe Avatar of Hakkar is the immortal presence of the god &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Its spirit still haunts the Temple of Atal'Hakkar, waiting for the right time to regain its power.\nLegend state that there is an egg that is the only item that can contain the essence of Hakkar and prevent him from rising again. The stories say that the location of the egg is somewhere near the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Hakkar was notorious for demanding sacrifices from his followers. Many millennia ago, he instructed the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; to bring for this avatar, using blood ritually drained from living victims to feed him. The Atal'ai priests now seek to raise Hakkar's avatar with a modified version of this ritual, one that involves sacrificing &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. If the Atal'ai succeed, the re-emergence of Hakkar's avatar could spell doom for &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategy.\nTaking down the Avatar of Hakkar is deceptively easy, although the event looks complicated. Someone with the egg must start the event or simply right-click the Shrine of the Soulflayer.\nThe Avatar of Hakkar will spawn and will aggro if someone is near the ritual circle. He will occasionally cast Cause Insanity, a spell that will make a player charge after their teammates.\nIf the cave is being solo'ed you need to kill him fast, since Cause Insanity will mark you as a non-enemy for him and will restart.\nIn Classic.\nIn order to spawn Avatar of Hakkar someone needs to have the scroll and right-click it.\nThere will be an elite &lt;a href=\"Hakkari%20Bloodkeeper\"&gt;Hakkari Bloodkeeper&lt;/a&gt; that spawns between each Eternal Flame you put out; killing that Bloodkeeper will drop &lt;a href=\"Hakkari%20Blood\"&gt;Hakkari Blood&lt;/a&gt; for someone to loot. Meanwhile non-elite &lt;a href=\"serpent\"&gt;serpent&lt;/a&gt;s will also spawn and meander around the central circle where the Avatar of Hakkar is waiting to be freed. They will not attack unless &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;ed, or the Bloodkeeper is near them when &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt;ed. It's critical to stay in the corners, so you only have to fight the elite &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, and the occasional serpent that aggros with it. As you put out each flame, run along the walls to the next flame. Periodically an elite &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; will path in, and begin casting something on Hakkar. Pull them over to the group just like the Bloodkeepers, though nothing will assist them.\nYour group can take their time like this, putting out each flame and resting/drinking as needed. Once there is only one flame left to put out and you have the last Hakkari Blood, then kill any remaining elites and spawn the Avatar of Hakkar. The serpents beneath him will aggro, but a quick burst of any form of &lt;a href=\"Area%20Effect\"&gt;Area Effect&lt;/a&gt; damage should quickly kill them. Then all that's left to do is kill the Avatar, who actually looks much deadlier than he is. He will &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; someone in the group periodically, but the duration is short, and he really doesn't have much health. Once he dies, those with the quest can collect his essence!\nQuests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Egg%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Egg of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; will not be removed from the player's inventory once the quest has been completed and can be used to summon Avatar of Hakkar during further runs of the Sunken Temple. There is no way to re-acquire the Egg of Hakkar and summon Hakkar after completion of this quest if it has been destroyed by the player."}

Though only a tiny fragment of Sargeras' true form and devastating cosmic power, the Avatar radiated great strength and fury, and was so large as to rival the bones of the gargantuan &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; in stature. After Aegwynn defeated the Avatar, she buried it deep within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nCreation of the Scepter.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and Sargeras' first, failed attempt to enter the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Titan immediately began planning his next method of infiltrating the planet. He knew that he couldn't rely on a static portal since such a gateway would require an astronomical amount of power to serve a titan, and the most promising source \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 had been destroyed in his last attempt. Additionally, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;'s laborious preparations had given away his intentions, allowing the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; resistance to thwart him. Sargeras concluded that he instead needed to enter the world with minimal warning. He commanded the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; to create a tool that could temporarily wrench open rifts between worlds, just long enough to let a portion of his soul through. Although that meant he couldn't enter Azeroth in his most devastating form, such an instrument would clear a path for his avatar to lead the Legion's invasion or carry out subtler schemes. The weapon would also weaken and threaten to collapse the physical universe, but Sargeras considered those to be only side benefits.\nThe result of the eredar sorcerers' monstrous undertaking was the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow Sargeras to create portals to any realm he desired, but the rifts it created would only allow a portion of his soul to enter. Sargeras would simply have to be more creative with his plans, and so, he waited. Millennia later, he found his opportunity in the form of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the then-&lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. She had become the most powerful &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth, beyond even the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;'s ability to control, and her pride made her a fine candidate for corruption.\nThe clash with Aegwynn.\nAround the year 823 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, Aegwynn had traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s in banishing a pack of demons that were draining the potent &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energies of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Just as the last demon was banished from the world, the sky turned black and a massive, dreadful sound, \"like that of a mace splitting a giant's skull\", echoed across the wastes as the Avatar of Sargeras entered the battle. He informed the young Guardian that the time of Tirisfal was about to come to an end and that the world would soon bow before the onslaught of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn raised her staff, &lt;a href=\"%3AAluneth\"&gt;:Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;, to unleash a storm of arcane magic, but nothing happened. Realizing that &lt;a href=\"Aluneth%20%28entity%29\"&gt;the entity&lt;/a&gt; within the staff was resisting her commands, Aegwynn instead summoned the greatstaff &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt; to aid her in battle. The following battle was the most difficult Aegwynn had ever fought. As the Avatar and the Guardian clashed, a storm of magic engulfed the region, holding even the mighty dragons at bay, but Aegwynn finally defeated her opponent with a final flurry of arcane might.\nHowever, at the time of the Avatar's death, Sargeras had transferred a portion of his spirit into Aegwynn's soul. The Guardian herself was unaware of this and dismissed the hollowness she felt inside her as being caused by the strain of the battle. Even in death, the Avatar's corpse was malevolent, still gripping its massive scepter, and Aegwynn resolved that she could not allow it to rest next to Galakrond's bones. She considered many locations to serve as the demon lord's final resting place, but finally chose a sunken, ruined portion of the ancient &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, which had been secured with &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; seals that would nullify any evil that still lingered in the Avatar's body and the scepter it wielded. The building where the Avatar was interred, once called the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, would eventually become known as the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn also imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Guardians\"&gt;several of Sargeras' demon followers&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Avatar. Most of them were dead or barely alive, and the Guardian believed that the tomb's enchanted seals would keep them contained. While it was true that the demons would never have been able to escape the structure on their own, over the millennia some of them fed on the Avatar's lingering power and regained enough strength to prowl the tomb.\nMeanwhile, Sargeras' spirit lingered within the Guardian, darkening her thoughts and driving her to distance herself even further from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, until many years later it passed from Aegwynn to her son, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegionfall.\nWith the Legion tearing down the tomb's barriers, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; is in a position to reanimate the Avatar of Sargeras and unleash its power on Azeroth. The fallen husk of the Avatar remains in the lowest, deepest recesses of the Tomb. A remnant of Sargeras' dark power lingers within the construct, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s will need to defeat it in order to accomplish their goal in the depths of the Tomb. The &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt; thus serves as the penultimate boss in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThe avatar of Sargeras is an incarnation of the lord of the Burning Legion believed to be created from part of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' spirit. The second time that Sargeras entered &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was in the form of an avatar. &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; at the time, detected Sargeras's presence, hunted his avatar down and defeated it in combat. She \"destroyed\" the avatar with a single spell, or so she thought \u2014 in reality, Sargeras just implanted himself inside her womb, ensuring that the next Guardian would contain his demonic essence.\nMany believe that Sargeras's spirit yet endures, somewhere \u2014 hungering for revenge against the only world ever to withstand the Burning Legion's might... Some people think the Avatar was the real Sargeras, but &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; is pretty confident he never actually set foot on Azeroth."}

Some claim that when a person with a great need for vengeance dies, their spirit becomes an avatar of vengeance. This story cannot be true, though, as avatars of vengeance are not undead creatures. Rather, they are beings composed of the raw energy of vengeance and vendetta; they are revenge given physical form.\nAvatars of vengeance are rarely encountered naturally, nor are they summoned. They are born of a terrible wrong or bitter emotional state. When an individual seeks vengeance with all of their will, they may inadvertently bring to life an avatar of vengeance. The spirit has a will of its own \u2014 even if the individual who created it remits their hate. The spirit does not stop until it claims vengeance upon the perpetrator of the act that caused its creation.\nSpeculation.\nAvatars of Vengeance might be formed in a similar way to the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, the last breath of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, who also represent intense negative emotions."}

This dire state has caused many brave individuals to converge on the sacred mountain to protect it from harm. These heroes, hailing from all walks of life, have joined with the druidic &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; allies under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.

This group, the Avengers of Hyjal, has instead focused on ending the threat of the Firelord once and for all by invading his own realm - the deadly, smoldering &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. While this effort might seem suicidal, the Avengers insist that if they don't act against Ragnaros while they have the opportunity, they may not have a world left to defend.\nThe majority of these fearless combatants have already stormed the Firelands and begun carving out a permanent encampment. There, the Avengers continue seizing objectives and battling elementals as well as the tainted &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, traitors who have rejected their commitment to the natural world in order to serve Ragnaros. The Avengers of Hyjal have accumulated a number of invaluable accessories - cloaks, belts, rings, and trinkets - during their time in the Firelands. These potent items are certain to be of use to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes who have recently chosen to help the organization wage war against Ragnaros and his servants.

She is the wild god of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s and other winged creatures, while the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; are her mortal followers. She uses the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Idol of Aviana&lt;/a&gt; to grant &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; the power of &lt;a href=\"Flight%20form\"&gt;Flight form&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile caring towards her children and worshippers, she is a fierce and savage combatant who slew many demons during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; before being killed. After 10,000 years in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, she was resurrected during &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' siege on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;War against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Aviana later helped the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. She granted the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; her &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%27s%20Lunarwing%20Form\"&gt;blessing&lt;/a&gt; after saving her harpy children from becoming corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nAviana found her way to &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother Tree, a fount of life that was the first thing &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; created within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Aviana grew enchanted with it, as it was more than a tree; it was a source of life, healing, and peace. Aviana spent years melding her power into the tree, and soon all winged creatures of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; dreamed of spending the afterlife flying through its branches. Aviana's spirit became tied with G'Hanir, and in time this would have lasting consequences.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in his mortal disguise Krasus, was unable to fly, Aviana gifted him &lt;a href=\"Aviana%27s%20Feather\"&gt;a feather&lt;/a&gt; which granted him temporary wings.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Aviana was one of many &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s who came to the aid of the night elves in defense of their world. Though the shock of their attack initially gave them an edge, the endless numbers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; eventually overwhelmed many of them. Aviana was knocked from the sky and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; witnessed her lifeless body fall when a large group of demons attacked her. The doomguard surrounded her and pierced her body with their spears. When Aviana was killed, her realm tree G'Hanir died.\nThe shock of Aviana's death reverberated through the Emerald Dream, and all the leaves of G'Hanir fell from their branches. Many mourned it, and some succumbed to the temptation of serving dark forces in Aviana's absence. But although she had died, her spirit lingered. As the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; struggled to rebuild their society in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; discovered a gift: A &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;single branch&lt;/a&gt; from the Mother Tree, with a single acorn hanging from its leaves, had been left in their care. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; used the acorn to grow &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; sensed that it had been Aviana's spirit that had given the branch to them, and he believed it was best to keep it hidden. Many of &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;Aviana's children&lt;/a&gt; had been lost to chaos, and they might be driven to claim the remnant of Aviana's legacy for their new masters. Quietly, Malfurion moved the branch to a safe location within the Emerald Dream. Few knew of its location, but its influence was felt far and wide. For many millennia, the branch served as a stabilizing force for the Emerald Dream, and the land near it was said to be a place of great healing and peace. \nThe first druids found her body among the carnage and bore it up to the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;highest mountain&lt;/a&gt;. She was laid to rest just outside the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Shrine of Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, within a circle of sacred stones.\nEmerald Dream.\nFor ten thousand years Aviana drifted formless in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; while the mortal races continued to worship her; the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; in particular focused their worship around her and learned to take the forms of raven and crows. Her children, the &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, descended into violence and barbaric behavior, and eventually forsook their parent for other, darker masters, or struck out on their own. Some worshippers believed Aviana to have survived her death at the hands of demons, and others claimed to have actually had contact with her. However, this is unlikely, unless it was through the Emerald Dream.\nCataclysm.\nTen thousand years after Aviana's death, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; the Destroyer returned to Azeroth from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. Under his command the fire elementals of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; marched upon Mount Hyjal, to make way for the Firelord himself to set fire to the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. During their siege &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were called from across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to assist in the mountain's defense. One of the tasks assigned to them was to assist in the resurrection of the demigods, one of whom was Aviana. Besides resurrecting her, adventurers were also assigned to destroy her fallen children, the harpies, who were attacking their &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;mother's shrine&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Demigoddess of the Sky was reborn and Aviana returned to the world to help repel the invading fire elementals and to send Ragnaros back to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Ragnaros was slain, Aviana turned her attention to G'Hanir once again. Times had changed, but her dream of providing a spiritual haven for her kind had not. She set out to restore the Mother Tree to its full glory.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAviana has taken an interest in the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;, as they too are creatures of the sky and so fall under her domain, and wishes to extend an invitation of peace and give them a place on the Great Bough of &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;. She sends &lt;a href=\"Skylord%20Omnuron\"&gt;Skylord Omnuron&lt;/a&gt; to , and for helping to retrieve a feather from &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, Omnuron gives adventurers &lt;a href=\"Aviana%27s%20Feather\"&gt;Aviana's Feather&lt;/a&gt; to help them gain wings, much like the one she gave to &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; during the War of the Ancients.\nLegion.\nAviana appears in a ray of light at Hyjal to help battle &lt;a href=\"Destromath\"&gt;Destromath&lt;/a&gt;, the pit lord who is preventing the cleansing of &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;G'Hanir, the Mother Tree&lt;/a&gt;, the branch from &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt; that she gave to mortal druids ages ago.\nAviana and several Druids of the Talon appear at the &lt;a href=\"Sylvan%20Falls\"&gt;Sylvan Falls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;. Aviana has created a test of dexterity for new Druids of the Talon, and adventurers can take it as well. Completing the test will reward &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Winds\"&gt;Emerald Winds&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Avatar of Aviana&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; to direct the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid of the Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Essence of Balance&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Wrath of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, in order to power the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Idol of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; and commune with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. When Malorne becomes trapped in an &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; recreation of his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, a figment of Aviana is seen battling demons during the War of the Ancients.\nWhen a demon attack at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Shrine of Aviana&lt;/a&gt; turns out to only be a distraction, &lt;a href=\"Thisalee%20Crow\"&gt;Thisalee Crow&lt;/a&gt; asks Aviana for more information. Aviana reveals that her eyes and ears across the world have told her that &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; is under attack by the Legion at the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. Thisalee and the Archdruid of the Dreamgrove go to save him on Aviana's command.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Aviana\"&gt;Idol of Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, which grants the Druids of the Talon their &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;Flight Form&lt;/a&gt;, is stolen from the Shrine of Aviana on Hyjal by the Legion and used to corrupt harpies with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;. After it is retrieved and cleansed, Aviana blesses the Archdruid of the Dreamgrove with the &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%27s%20Lunarwing%20Form\"&gt;Archdruid's Lunarwing Form&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer visage can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20G%27Hanir\"&gt;Sanctum of G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20elemental\"&gt;Azerite elemental&lt;/a&gt;s appeared under &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Aviana fought against an &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Leviathan\"&gt;Azerite Leviathan&lt;/a&gt; that had emerged in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. She was assisted by the adventurer.\nDragonflight.\nAviana appears beneath &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt; and above the &lt;a href=\"Char\"&gt;Char&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream%20%28zone%29\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nAviana takes the appearance of a large harpy with white feathers covering her body, with gold-colored arms and legs. She wears a gold outfit covering only her groin and breasts, as well as a gold headdress and necklace. The necklace bears a sapphire at its center.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; visited &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Aviana initially took the form of a gigantic white peregrine falcon, before shifting into a slim, wide-eyed humanoid woman. Her wings became feathered hands and the tail became the trailing end of a white gossamer gown, but her feet remained sharply-taloned. Krasus described her as having a beautiful face the color of ivory, with a sharp but elegant nose and a mane of feathers in place of hair.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDragonflight.\nWhat do you require, mortal?\nIn the TCG.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;\", Aviana has the title of \"the Reborn\". Swift and ruthless, she personifies the capricious nature of the winds, and her children are no different.\nIn the RPG.\nLong ago, Aviana was a normal &lt;a href=\"raven\"&gt;raven&lt;/a&gt; until she was chosen by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to deliver messages from the moon goddess to her son, the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Soon she was carrying messages among many of the powers of the ancient world; each power granted the raven new abilities required to carry out her duties until she eventually became an equal among them.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, Aviana took the form of a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and joined their studies of magic. When &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; built her temple and gathered together her chosen servants to revel in their arcane power, Aviana realized the corrupting influence of magic and returned to Elune's side.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Aviana would occasionally take mortal form and guide groups away from the &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of the time she flew high above the land gathering information for Cenarius on the movements of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAviana prefers to keep her distance from combat, acting primarily as an observer or messenger. When drawn into battle, she will strike from a distance for as long as possible using her magic and her longbow before changing into raven form to charge and claw opponents while trying to make her way to freedom.\nAviana is described as a tactical spy of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and messenger of the gods. She is classified as a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Hearthstone.\nAviana appears as for the druid class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Her flavor text reads: \"\"Call her \"Tweety\". She'll find it real funny. I PROMISE.\"\nSpeculation.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients%20Trilogy\"&gt;War of the Ancients Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\", it is implied that some night elves were altered and became forest guardians. Some fans speculate that night elves who venerated Aviana may be the &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;. The death of Aviana during the War would have left them without their matriarch, and could explain their now brutal nature (although Aviana herself also hinted to having these streaks).\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

When you do not flap, you begin to fall (at a steady but manageable rate). Thus you are always either rising, falling, or resting on (or moving across) a surface.\nWhile on Aviana's Guardian, you can turn at will. Unlike mounted flight (on a normal flying mount, that is), the only way to gain altitude is by flapping, and the only way to lose altitude is by *not* flapping. Also, you cannot change your speed; you slow down naturally over time, unless you maintain your speed by flapping the mount's wings. Thus, stopping your mount is often a matter of skidding and hoping you don't fall off the far side of whatever it is you are landing on."}

The name of the character will show up as \"&lt;Away&gt;Name\", and an auto-response will be sent to anyone who sends the flagged user a &lt;a href=\"tell\"&gt;tell&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"ready%20check\"&gt;ready check&lt;/a&gt;. A message can also be typed after codice_1 (or codice_2) which will be included in the auto-reply.\n\"AFK\" is a common acronym and phenomenon all over the internet, not just in World of Warcraft.\nBattleground.\nA player who enters Away Mode while in a battleground will automatically leave that battleground. The player will also gain the &lt;a href=\"Deserter%20%28debuff%29\"&gt;Deserter&lt;/a&gt; debuff, which prevents the player from joining a battleground for 15 minutes.\n\"Detailed\" AFK messages.\nYou can make your AFK status more detailed by typing a message \"behind\" the \"/afk\". This can be used to tell people why you are AFK and how long you will be gone. Some &lt;a href=\"addon\"&gt;addon&lt;/a&gt;s will also make your AFK (and &lt;a href=\"DND\"&gt;DND&lt;/a&gt;) more detailed, giving automatic replies telling where your character is located and the like.\nVarious AFK mechanics.\nIn your Interface Options, under \"Controls\", you can select \"Auto Clear Away Mode\", which will automatically unset the AFK flag when chatting or moving. It should be noted that any input that would reset the AFK flag if \"Auto Clear Away Mode\" is enabled will also reset the AFK timer, regardless the user having the option disabled.\nUseful AFK macro.\nAs AFK may be used to let people you don't want to talk with believe you are not available at the moment, it may be useful to make a macro which marks you AFK and keeps you so no matter what you do. To do this, one must access the &lt;a href=\"CVar\"&gt;CVar&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"CVar%20autoClearAFK\"&gt;autoClearAFK&lt;/a&gt;\" while adding a simple AFK command.\n /run if IsShiftKeyDown()then SetCVar(\"AutoClearAFK\", 1);else SetCVar(\"AutoClearAFK\", 0);end\n /afk\n /run if IsShiftKeyDown()then print(\"Auto-Clear AFK is now enabled.\");else print(\"Auto-Clear AFK is now disabled.\");end\nClicking this macro will mark you AFK if you are not already marked so. (If you are already AFK, clicking it will drop your AFK status. Clicking it again will turn it back on.) It will also turn \"Auto Clear AFK\" off, preventing actions you make from removing your AFK status. Shift-clicking the macro will turn \"Auto Clear AFK\" back on. Both actions will be notified to you via private messages.\nHumor.\nBefore the &lt;AFK&gt; tag was changed to &lt;Away&gt;, players on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20realm\"&gt;PvP realm&lt;/a&gt;s often said \"AFK\" stood for \"A Free Kill\", because a player of one &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; could often attack an AFK character of the opposite faction without that character fighting back.

After killing these orcs and saving the wyrmling, they will be able to listen to the dragon's story.\nThe young whelp is named Awbee, and is one of many wyrmlings stolen from their mother's clutch in far away &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. The blues are not the only &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s that have been captured, however. Dragons from each flight are being captured to be used as guinea pigs in experimentation. These experiments have been ordered by &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, whose goal is the creation of a &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The chromatic dragons he has managed to produce so far hold the abilities of all five dragonflights, and have been raised to be under the control of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. A large number of such creatures would be unstoppable.\nAccording to Awbee, those subjects unsuitable for experimentation are given to the sadistic minions of Nefarian and &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; to be destroyed. The unfortunate whelplings endure horrible torture at their hands before finally dying, either from being thrown into the lava or given to the denizens of &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; to be torn apart. At the time the party finds Awbee, the orcs are getting ready to do just that.\nAwbee is grateful to those in the party and will want to make sure that the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; knows what Nefarian is up to. To this end, Awbee gave the rescuers a scale. If it is used in the proper place, they will be teleported to the blue dragonflight's matron mother, &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt;, who will be able to scry what Awbee has seen and felt when the adventurers hand over the scale.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAwbee eventually recovered enough to leave the mountain. Years later, Awbee grew up into an adult dragon and in gratitude, returned to the mountain in order to aid the rescuer during the fight against &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Tharbek\"&gt;Commander Tharbek&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAwbee is amongst the blue dragons who responded to the activation of the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt; and joined the rest of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in making the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; their new home.\nQuotes.\n\"The Matron Protectorate completed:\""}

It was made specifically for the orc &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;, and he described it as being like an extension of his own arm. Created using &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;druidic&lt;/a&gt; magic, the axe was enchanted with a piece of Kalimdor's magic, making it light as a feather and stronger than any mortal-forged axe. It proved to be able to slice through any foe with ease.\nNear the end of the war, Broxigar dived into the portal over the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and used the axe to wound &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Although not a very deep wound, it would later be the focus of Krasus and his allies' spellwork, that for a second, tore Sargeras' attention away from his struggle to keep the portal open... allowing Malfurion and Illidan to close it upon him. Miraculously, the axe somehow made it back to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, survived both the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and Broxigar's sacrifice, and washed up on the shore of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; where it was found by &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;.\nRhonin and &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; insisted that the axe be brought back to their time period, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; allowed this. After returning to the present, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, in the shape of an old orc, brought the axe to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and told him of its history. Thrall promised to honor it and Brox's sacrifice.\nIn time, Broxigar's niece &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt; grew up to warrior age and after proving her skills, Thrall gifted her with the axe, of which Thrall's most trusted &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; had seen in a dream that it should go to her. She felt honored to wield such a fabled weapon.\nA trapped Malfurion contacted Thura in her dreams and manipulated her to enter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion had been transformed into a tree by the Nightmare Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and intended on using the Axe of Cenarius to break free of the transformation, as it was the only thing that could do so.\nThura continues to wield the axe, having shown up at Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival with it upon her back. The spirit of Broxigar, who also appeared at the festival once offerings were made to the ancestors, also appears to wield a spiritual version of the axe."}

Unless he could return with the axe of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;, retrieving it from a sealed cave in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, he would be forced to leave &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Town&lt;/a&gt; forever. \nThrall tricked a &lt;a href=\"snow%20beast\"&gt;snow beast&lt;/a&gt; into breaking down the cave door, and found the large axe suspended in a block of solid ice upon a pedestal. Melting the ice in a hot spring that was also present in the cave, Thrall claimed his fathers' axe. Appearing on the pedestal were two hand-prints - Thrall found that his hands fitted perfectly, and a carving of Thrall's face appeared in the stone."}

Led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Krogg\"&gt;Warlord Krogg&lt;/a&gt;, they were assigned with storming the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to stem the power of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Alongside this goal, they were sent to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;; allowing them to have a major presence in the region.\nThey are veterans of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Northrend campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Axebite fielded in the Northrend campaign, fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them racked up years of back-pay during this campaign, which they proceeded to almost immediately blow recklessly in &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; on all sorts of debauchery. Unfortunately, this came shortly before their next deployment to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;; forcing their leader, Warlord Krogg, to discipline them. The preparations met numerous other delays beyond just &lt;a href=\"AWOL%20Grunt\"&gt;AWOL Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s, as the \"&lt;a href=\"Hull%20of%20the%20Foebreaker\"&gt;Foebreaker&lt;/a&gt;\", one of their vessels, was behind schedule, and their air detachment's flagship, the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Spear%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Spear of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;\", was missing its engine. After a conscripted &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sorted these issues out, the warfleet made way for the Twilight Highlands.\nThe Axebite made up the majority of the warriors in the warfleet heading towards Twilight Highlands. Accompanied by members of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, the Axebite rode atop &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s such as the \"Spear of Durotar\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Heart of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;\" (though the latter ultimately ended up crashing). While en route alongside the warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, ordered their escort of &lt;a href=\"wyvern%20rider\"&gt;wyvern rider&lt;/a&gt;s to attack an unguarded alliance naval fleet near the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. Without this escort, the warfleet was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately was destroyed on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Port\"&gt;Dragonmaw Port&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, they were separated from Garrosh's ship and his detachment.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Remains%20of%20the%20Fleet\"&gt;Remains of the Fleet&lt;/a&gt; rallied under &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Stonefist\"&gt;Admiral Stonefist&lt;/a&gt; and Warlord Krogg; seeking to continue Garrosh's mission of recruiting the Dragonmaw clan. At the same time, elements of the remaining airforce departed with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Krazz\"&gt;Captain Krazz&lt;/a&gt; to establish an air base that would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Krazzworks\"&gt;Krazzworks&lt;/a&gt;. Warlord Krogg would later depart to the Krazzworks following the successful recruitment of the Dragonmaw clan, after sending the Axebite warriors to help Dragonmaw insurrectionists rise up against their &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; overlord, the foul warchief &lt;a href=\"Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt;. Once this was accomplished, the Axebite began to operate out of Dragonmaw Port, and the area was upgraded to be more fortified to act as the Horde's main outpost in the region. &lt;a href=\"Wounded%20Axebite%20Warrior\"&gt;Wounded Axebite Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s were later tended to in the claimed port. &lt;a href=\"Axebite%20Infantry\"&gt;Axebite Infantry&lt;/a&gt; later laid siege to the Alliance base of &lt;a href=\"Highbank\"&gt;Highbank&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdmiral Stonefist later led a battle onto the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Shore%20%28Twilight%20Highlands%29\"&gt;Twilight Shore&lt;/a&gt;, but was slain after his ship crashed along the shoreline. After his death, &lt;a href=\"Rok%27tar\"&gt;Rok'tar&lt;/a&gt; took command. &lt;a href=\"Axebite%20Marine\"&gt;Axebite Marine&lt;/a&gt;s engaged in battle with &lt;a href=\"Highbank%20Marine\"&gt;Highbank Marine&lt;/a&gt;s along the shoreline, seeking to control the beach-head to ensure the defense of their respective bases of Dragonmaw Port and &lt;a href=\"Highbank\"&gt;Highbank&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nWarlord Krogg alongside members of the &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; headed to &lt;a href=\"Wyrms%27%20Bend\"&gt;Wyrms' Bend&lt;/a&gt;; seeking to stem access to the mountain fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. There, Axebite warriors fought with the Twilight's Hammer along the passageway. With the Gob Squad, the adventurer pried open the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Gates\"&gt;Dragonmaw Gates&lt;/a&gt;. The group slaughtered a number of Twilight's Hammer, securing their way into the entrance of Grim Batol with allies in the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Lirastrasza\"&gt;Lirastrasza&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe warriors of the Axebite later established the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Crushblow\"&gt;Crushblow&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the Dragonmaw and Kor'kron under &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and Forsaken sent by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Cozwynn\"&gt;Lady Cozwynn&lt;/a&gt;. This combined force assailed the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Gate\"&gt;Twilight Gate&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to accomplish their mission of stemming the tide of the Twilight's Hammer.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rok%27tar\"&gt;Rok'tar&lt;/a&gt; appeared as a follower in the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Dresh\"&gt;Commander Dresh&lt;/a&gt; was overseeing construction in &lt;a href=\"Crushblow\"&gt;Crushblow&lt;/a&gt; when the peons of the region disappeared. Seeking to prove the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;'s usefulness in the Horde, an adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; set out for the outpost to find out what happened to the peons. Heading out to the area, they found the peons hid away in the old &lt;a href=\"Dunwald%20Holdout\"&gt;Dunwald Holdout&lt;/a&gt;; now renamed &lt;a href=\"Peon%20Hideout\"&gt;Peon Hideout&lt;/a&gt;. Within, they found that the peons had revolted under &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Magrok\"&gt;Foreman Magrok&lt;/a&gt;. Finding that the peons of Crushblow felt undervalued, Kiro and the adventurer set about breaking apart the revolt. They went about this by gathering supplies for a party, giving promotions, and repairing their tools; culminating in a feast in Crushblow.\nWith this all done, the adventurer then challenged Foreman Magrok and defeated him in a duel; thus ensuring the peons returned to work and the foreman resumed his duties. With this done, Kiro and the adventurer returned to Orgrimmar; where Commander Dresh was pleased to hear that construction had resumed on the outpost, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; was impressed by the vulpera."}

The battle looked bad when the humans found themselves surrounded by the growing Horde numbers coming from the open Great Gate. However, Llane and his men managed to hold the line long enough for the Great Gate to close, and then, when it reopened, redirected to Stormwind, he continued to hold the line so the human prisoners could escape.\nHowever, with the death of Medivh, the gate closed, leaving the remaining humans trapped and surrounded by the Horde. Seeing Blackhand approaching to claim the honor of killing the human king, Llane ordered Garona to kill him first, as that would restore her honor among the orcs and would be the only chance for there to be peace between the two races. After some hesitation, Garona stabbed him in the neck with the dagger that was loaned to her, killing him. As the King hoped, this action allowed Garona to be welcomed back to the Horde with open arms.\nAnduin Lothar then arrived, and, after defeating Blackhand in a , was allowed to leave with Llane's body.

He was the child of King &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and Lady &lt;a href=\"Varia\"&gt;Varia&lt;/a&gt;, and the father of King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. His grandson King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was given his middle name Llane to honor him.\nBiography.\nThe Gurubashi War.\nLlane was born in the year 564 by the formerly used in that kingdom (40 years before the First War). Llane spent his childhood with &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. One day, while out on the road in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh and his two friends were ambushed by three &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s. None were hurt badly, however, Medivh fainted after casting several spells. In 577 (according to \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Last%20Guardian\"&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;\", Medivh's coma lasted 20 years, hinting at larger timeframe), Llane reached to the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Age of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; and was given the full title of Prince of Stormwind. During the evening feast arranged to honor the young Prince, the great wizard Medivh, who had been absent from events of the world for many years, interrupted, announcing his return to the world and giving an obsidian hourglass to Llane, symbolizing Stormwind's unending prosperity. The sands in the glass ran, but the top half never emptied into the lower half.\nYears after the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind's farmers and settlers would continue to push southward, claiming territory close to the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Skirmishes would erupt between the Gurubashi and Stormwind forces, but the elderly &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen&lt;/a&gt; would refuse to order an invasion of Stranglethorn in favor of a defensive war, to Prince Llane's outrage. While King Barathen's strategy against the Gurubashi was effective, it would be unable to stop every attack, one which saw slow, barbaric, and gruesome deaths delivered to the villagers of three towns in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. This would ultimately prove to be the final straw for Prince Llane, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, who, in defiance of King Barathen's wishes, journeyed south to bring war to the Gurubashi. Though initially shielded by Medivh's magic, the three friends would end up in the fight for their lives when they battled &lt;a href=\"Jok%27non\"&gt;Jok'non&lt;/a&gt;, a Gurubashi Warlord empowered by &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the three friends would prove victorious and return to Stormwind, though remain shaken by Medivh's powers.\nWhile none of the Gurubashi who witnessed Jok'non's death survived, it was clear to the trolls who was responsible. Rallying under Jok'non's son, &lt;a href=\"Zan%27non\"&gt;Zan'non&lt;/a&gt;, the Gurubashi launched &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;an invasion&lt;/a&gt; intent on destroying Stormwind. In the face of the troll onslaught, Barathen recalled all his forces to the stronghold's gate, believing that the survival of Stormwind would depend on one colossal battle. As the death toll mounted on both sides, Barathen mounted a desperate counterattack against the Gurubashi which would cost him his life. Llane, driven by guilt, would plead with Medivh to unleash his power on the Gurubashi as he had against Jok'non. Though frightened of his power, Medivh would accept Llane's request and destroy Zan'non and the Gurubashi forces, avenging Barathen. With his father's death and the victory over the Gurubashi, Llane would be welcomed as Stormwind's new ruler.\nLlane Wrynn's son, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, was born to him in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; ten years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. He taught him how to ride a horse and oversaw his combat training.\nThe First War.\nWhen reports of mysterious creatures lurking around the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; reached Stormwind, rumors spread through the streets that they were either vengeful spirits, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s armed with some new breed of power, or a strange race from across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. King Llane dispatched &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; to discover what these new creatures were. Lothar led a small force of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to scout the Black Morass, resulting in humans clashing with &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time in what would become a series of bloody skirmishes and battles. Though Lothar and his men scored a number of small victories, they found themselves outnumbered more and more with each battle and were eventually forced to pull back, never discovering &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;the portal&lt;/a&gt; through which the orcs were arriving. Lothar informed King Llane the invaders were bringing in reinforcements from somewhere, and the kingdom readied itself for a full-scale war that became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Llane named Lothar the \"King's Champion\", the highest military rank in the kingdom, and entrusted him to end the orcish threat.\nThough messengers were dispatched by King Llane to the other human kingdoms, warning of mysterious, fearsome green-skinned invaders, few believed the reports indicated a real threat. &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was considered the most likely nation to help, but the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, disguised as a visiting Stormwind noble, openly mocked King Llane, claiming the threat was actually a rebellion of disgruntled citizens, and as a result Lordaeron declined to send aid. This general lack of aid was likely influenced by Stormwind's pride in standing alone and recently developed policies of isolationism, which other kingdoms saw as signs of arrogance.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; fell to the orcs, the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; marched onto Stormwind City. Thousands of Horde soldiers marched through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and encircled Stormwind, cutting off all access except for the sea. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; had ordered &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to lead their &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans in the assault on Stormwind. To weaken the city's defenses, &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s bombarded the city walls through the night, and at dawn Kilrogg and Cho'gall launched their attack. While orcs charged the battlements, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s engulfed Stormwind's soldiers in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; fire, resulting in staggering losses. Just as it seemed Stormwind would fall that day, cries of an attack came from the Horde's rear lines- Lothar and the majority of Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s had moved around the Horde by sea. The King's Commander was now leading a charge through Elwynn Forest, catching the orcs in the rearguard by surprise. While the Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer were distracted by the knights, Stormwind soldiers emerged from the front gates to flank the orcs in a counterattack. Flanked on both sides and suffering many casualties, the orcs were forced into a retreat. This was the greatest disaster to ever happen to the Horde, which withdrew to Redridge to devise a new plan. Lothar and King Llane had received information about the Horde's battle plans from Medivh's apprentice &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who had learned of them from &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, which helped prepare for the attack on Stormwind.\nThough the war effort continued, fronted by King Llane and Anduin Lothar, the pair of friends were never able to gather accurate data of the orcs' numbers and could only guess at how great a force they would have to contend with.\nDuring this time, King Llane also sent many surveyors into the hills and mountains throughout the kingdom in search of new deposits of gold.\nAt some point, Llane was visited by a mysterious stranger who revealed herself to be &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the mother of Medivh. She revealed that Medivh was behind the arrival of the orcs into the kingdom, warning that Stormwind would eventually have to deal with him.\nAs the war continued to rage, both armies found themselves strained by internal conflict. King Llane, who believed the bestial orcs to be incapable of conquering the city, contemptuously held position at Stormwind and refused to press the front into orc territory. After a few years, the majority of the orcish Horde had crossed into the Kingdom of Stormwind, and &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; deemed that the time for the primary strike against humanity had come. The Horde launched its full might against the human kingdom.\nThe war began to turn badly for Stormwind. After losing ground to the Horde's newfound organization and brazen assaults, Llane prepared his armies for a counterattack, sensing that the final confrontation was at hand. It was around this time that Garona Halforcen and Khadgar revealed that his old friend Medivh was responsible for the orcs' arrival. Despite this information, Llane refused to believe that his friend would willingly betray them, and that all his actions could be justified as part of a brilliant scheme. Llane felt confident in Medivh's allegiance, and that his army and Medivh's powers would be enough to beat back the Horde. Garona would later return after Medivh's defeat and become a close friend and adviser to Llane.\nMeanwhile, Warchief Blackhand's second in command, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, set out to free the Horde from demonic corruption, culminating in his killing of the corrupt Blackhand and assuming the role of warchief. Under his decisive leadership, the Horde laid siege to Stormwind Keep once again. Though the city walls were breached and fighting took to Stormwind's streets, Llane and his commanders organized the city's defense from within the fortified Stormwind Keep and held them at bay.\nThough considered a trusted friend of the King, Garona remained an agent of the Horde. During the orcish siege of Stormwind, Garona, controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, assassinated Llane, cutting his heart out with &lt;a href=\"the%20Kingslayers\"&gt;the Kingslayers&lt;/a&gt;. Garona knew from a vision she had seen in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; that she was fated to kill one of the few men who accepted her for what she was, and thus it was she who mourned her victim most of all. Llane's assassination was witnessed by his son, Varian.\nLegion.\nDuring the Burning Legion's infiltration of Karazhan, a vision is seen of Lothar and Llane visiting a comatose Medivh.\nDragonflight.\nYoung Prince Llane Wrynn was time-displaced and transported onto the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, along with time-lost &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw\"&gt;Riverpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Matriarch%20Bluepelt\"&gt;Matriarch Bluepelt&lt;/a&gt; who captured him in a cave in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;. He was rescued by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, sent by &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard%20%28Everywhen%20Inn%29\"&gt;his guard&lt;/a&gt;, and returned to &lt;a href=\"Everywhen%20Inn\"&gt;Everywhen Inn&lt;/a&gt; from where he took a portal to his time.\nStatue.\nUntil its removal in \"\", a statue of King Llane could be found in Stormwind Keep; the plaque reads:\nAlternate timeline.\n&lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;."}

A small &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt; lay there on the ground, injured and near death. With a mother's gentleness, Jiang took the creature into her arms and into her care. She named him Lo, and they became fast friends.\nHowever, the townsfolk shunned Jiang, and begged for her to get rid of Lo before he became old enough to hurt her. During that time, the cloud serpents were feared by the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, as the beasts were seen as violent and aggressive creatures, and even to approach one was to flirt with danger.\nDuring one of the battles in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Jiang nearly perished at the hands of a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; spear, but just as the weapon was inches from her heart, Lo came to the rescue. The serpent, only half grown, swooped in and ripped the troll limb from limb. He then gathered up the wounded Jiang and flew her far from the battle to safety. Jiang attempted to convince the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses that the cloud serpents could turn the tide of war, but her words fell on deaf ears.\nSeveral days later, the Zandalari had pushed in from the coast, and the pandaren champions stood their ground on the &lt;a href=\"Gong%20of%20Hope\"&gt;great bridge&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dawn%27s%20Blossom\"&gt;Dawn's Blossom&lt;/a&gt;. The Zandalari numbers were vast, and their &lt;a href=\"bat%20rider\"&gt;bat rider&lt;/a&gt;s fought in such a way the pandaren had no counter to. Just as the battle was thought to be lost, however, Jiang swooped in on Lo, plucking the Zandalari from the bridge and striking down their bat riders.\nThe war would still take many months to win, but the tide of war had turned. Soon, Jiang started training other pandaren how to ride as she did, upon the backs of other serpents.\nAfter the war had been won, there was great celebration throughout the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, but also mourning, especially for Jiang, who had sacrificed herself to kill the &lt;a href=\"Mengazi\"&gt;Zandalari leader&lt;/a&gt; during a battle at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt;. For decades after the conflict, Lo was seen circling the skies above the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly searching for his friend and rider."}

They were born from one of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;'s tears when the world was young and is the younger sibling of &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt;.\nMythology.\nIn the early days of the world, when the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; slept, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old Ones&lt;/a&gt; stretched their &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;shadows&lt;/a&gt; across the land and corrupted many of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; with their whispers, teaching them to make war and turn the elements loose on each other. The Earth Mother's distraught eyes, &lt;a href=\"An%27she\"&gt;An'she&lt;/a&gt; (Sun) and &lt;a href=\"Mu%27sha\"&gt;Mu'sha&lt;/a&gt; (Moon), woke up their mother so she could see what had happened. Saddened by the chaos and bloodshed, the Earth Mother wept a single tear. Realizing that she was susceptible to corruption and no longer a safe haven for her children, she wiped away the lone tear before tearing An'she and Mu'sha free from her skull. Unable to console their mother, Sun and Moon set out to hunt down the source of the corruption.\nUnbeknownst to the Earth Mother, her tear fell to the earth and from it sprung a new life: a baby glowing blue with life and light, kin to the spark that burned in both Sun and Moon. A party of uncorrupted tauren found them alone at a watering hole on the plains and took the baby with them, resting on a bed of long grass in a wagon. These tauren heard of the Earth Mother's sorrow from the winds, eventually encountered An'she and Mu'sha, and presented the babe to them. When the child began to wail, the twins recognized them as being the Earth Mother's light. Mu'sha took the babe in her arms and An'she asked what they should call them. Mu'sha replied that their mother would know, but before the twins could return to their mother, the shadows attacked them. With the elements' aid, Sun and Moon held off the darkness and protected the tauren and the babe, but An'she sustained a wound that Mu'sha was unable to heal. Mu'sha sent a plea on the wind and the Earth Mother sought out her children. Upon being presented with the babe, the Earth Mother felt a slight joy once more and named them Lo'sho.\nKnowing that the shadows would return to take the rest of the tauren, the Earth Mother decided to sacrifice herself to contain the darkness. She told Sun and Moon to permanently take to the skies, from where they would be able to chase away any shadows she could not hold. She then pressed Lo'sho into Mu'sha's arms, telling the twins to take their younger sibling with them (since they were still young and untouched by darkness), teach them to protect the tauren and the world, and let them know that they had her love, as all her children did. And so, while the Earth Mother embraced the land for the last time to hold off the shadows, An'she and Mu'sha took their eternal post in the heavens while Lo'sho watched and listened to their lessons, hearing in them the wisdom of their mother."}

{"id": "28265", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28265", "title": "Loa", "text": "Loa is the name given by &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s to the beings they worship, such as the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s, beings such as &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, or spirits like &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s. Countless loa exist, most weak, but some very powerful. Most are shapeless, whereas others have animal or creature forms. Powerful, enlightened &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; can become loa upon their death - or so it is believed. Many of the loa make their home in the &lt;a href=\"Garden%20of%20the%20Loa\"&gt;Garden of the Loa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, or across &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; more generally, with major temples found in traditional troll lands.\nBackground.\nEarly troll &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s, though varying wildly in customs and traditions, all shared a common &lt;a href=\"religion\"&gt;religion&lt;/a&gt;: the worship and reverence for the Wild Gods. The mountain range of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was home to many loa, and was thus treated as being sacred. Troll &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s are devoted to only one loa per troll, while troll &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s use the powers of several loa at once. This is something the loa do not like, as they prefer to be worshiped one at a time. &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20hunter\"&gt;Shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s commune with multiple loa as well, and the loa can even channel themselves through the shadow hunters when they use their ceremonial &lt;a href=\"rush%27kah\"&gt;rush'kah&lt;/a&gt; masks.\nThe loa can grant wondrous boons or inflict terrible punishments on trolls. Tales abound in troll culture, of those blessed by the loa with extraordinary regenerative abilities, strengthening their already powerful, natural &lt;a href=\"Regeneration%20%28racial%29\"&gt;regeneration&lt;/a&gt;. The tale of &lt;a href=\"Vula%27jin%20the%20Void\"&gt;Vula'jin the Void&lt;/a&gt; speaks of how he regrew almost his entire body after standing in a pool of &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;. But just as the loa can bless, they can also curse; troll children are taught legends of those cursed by the loa, such as &lt;a href=\"Gri%27lek\"&gt;Gri'lek&lt;/a&gt;, unable to heal even flesh wounds, to instill the proper respect for their patron spirits.\n&lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; (as well as &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;) families often worship their own family loa, cities usually have their own civic deities, and the greatest loa are worshiped by the nation as a whole. Powerful, enlightened Zandalari can become loa upon their death - or so it is believed. An example of such a case is &lt;a href=\"Zanza%20the%20Restless\"&gt;Zanza the Restless&lt;/a&gt;. Different troll tribes may call upon different sets of loa.\nTroll &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s visiting the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; have been overheard calling the &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s who reside there loa, just as they refer to &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, and the other returned &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt; as loa. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; have tried to counsel these trolls on \"correct\" druidic nomenclature, but the trolls thus far have been stuck in their ways. The loa were later confirmed to be the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;same type of being&lt;/a&gt; as the Ancient Guardians.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; was mortally wounded during the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, he thought that the loa spirits spoke to him, claiming that the death will come soon. They also whispered the name &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin, thus, named her &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; with his last breath. However, during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the spirit of Vol'jin was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ebonhorn\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ebonhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and Vol'jin revealed that it was not the loa spirits who told him to name Sylvanas Warchief but something far more powerful. He could not tell who the voices belonged to, the memory being denied by some shadows. It was eventually revealed that the culprit behind getting Vol'jin to name Sylvanas Warchief was &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;. \nSome &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; consider bird spirits to be weak, capricious, undeserving of their worship, and best left to the Amani.\nLoa gain in strength and power the more worshipers, offerings, idols, and sacrifices they receive. Carrying the symbol of a loa can help strengthen them. &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; also grows in power with every soul under his care.\nLoa &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Loa%20Speaker%20%28Isle%20of%20Thunder%29\"&gt;Loa Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can utilize their faith in the loa to bestow incredible powers upon their weaponry, as well as their bestial companions. Items and animals empowered this way are referred to as \"Loa-Infused\". Loa-Infused items are often passed down through generations, with each generation adding more power to the item.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began their invasion of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; tried to force their loa to give them more power, first subduing them and then sacrificing them. The wild deities were then considered a source of untapped power, their potent blood providing the means to repel the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s minions, who have overtaken parts of the troll nation. According to &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor%20Khufu\"&gt;Witch Doctor Khufu&lt;/a&gt;: \u201cThe power they gained from killing the natural gods of the land is transitory. What was gained in the short run will be lost to them for all eternity.\u201d\nIn the RPG.\nAll trolls worship a pantheon of primal forces; a sacred animal represents each aspect of the pantheon.\nThe &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s draw power for their &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; magics by performing rituals and invoking the Primal Gods, Old Gods, forest spirits, and ancestral spirits: their Loa spirits and gods.\nLoa spirits are more powerful than the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, but not as powerful as gods. Supposedly, these spirits are mighty entities that grant the faithful extraordinary powers. By calling upon these voodoo spirits, the &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; gains special blessings with which he can combat darkness and help those in need. The abilities granted vary according to the Loa the shadow hunter calls upon. Almost any being who has died and transcended death can be worshiped as a loa, including Forsaken &lt;a href=\"shadow%20ascendant\"&gt;shadow ascendant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt;s' faith and communion with the Loa gods grant them shadow and healing magic, and other abilities. Shadow Hunters learn magic that hinders enemies and aids allies, gaining a unique mix of spells that delve into the more occult aspects of the Loa.\nThe trolls of Zul'Aman worship primal beings they call the Forest Gods.\nItems.\nThere are several loa idols, loa-blessed, or other loa-referencing gear items:\nNotes and trivia.\nDeath.\nThere is contradicting information regarding the deaths of certain loa. Notably, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Lost%20Loa\"&gt;House of the Lost Loa&lt;/a&gt; seems to consider many loa as \"lost\", gone, or dead, despite some having been shown to return or maintain influence in some form after their death.\nIt was, however, confirmed that the lost loa are not permanently gone and that they could return.\nSpeculation.\nPossible loa.\nThe following beings were never called \"loa\" but may share similarities with them and thus may or may not be loa:"}

The theme for \"Cataclysm\" was called \"The Shattering\" by &lt;a href=\"Russell%20Brower\"&gt;Russell Brower&lt;/a&gt;. \"Mists of Pandaria\" had a Chinese-like remix of \"The Shattering\" that replaced most of the hard drum beats with wind chimes.\nIn interviews in the past, Russell Brower has discussed how he likes to keep the original idea of the login music (the theming and key elements) and build on it with each new expansion. There's an expectation of hearing a certain style of music that says to people that they're logging in to \"World of Warcraft\". It evokes emotions in many people and so he's said he doesn't want to take that away but instead, enhance and add to it with each of the expansions. If you sit and listen to the whole thing, you'll find that you've ended up on a journey of sorts through \"World of Warcraft\" history. It tells you about where you've been and where you are now or are going to depending on where you are in your gameplay.\nLogin screen trivia.\nThe total time that each login screen was used is listed here. Note that originally the loading screen would be determined by the expansions installed on the user's computer, but this was changed during \"Wrath of the Lich King\" so that all players see the current login screen regardless of which expansions they own."}

Together with her twin sister, they faced the horrors of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to put their parents' souls to rest.\nBiography.\nLieren was raised as the adopted daughter of Voldana, one of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, and was taught archery by Voldana, becoming a quick and highly accurate marksman. One evening when Voldana's old friend &lt;a href=\"Kardan\"&gt;Kardan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarf&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; was visiting them, Lieren answered a knock at the door. She was shocked to find their male neighbor &lt;a href=\"Ravic\"&gt;Ravic&lt;/a&gt; had in tow an identical teenage girl, but dressed in Wildhammer clothes, named &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt;. Lieren had lately developed an obsession with uncovering her past. Curiosity caused her to follow Kardan, her adopted parent, from Aerie Peak on his late-night excursion to visit Voldana.\nWith the truth out in the open, it is with a heavy heart that their adopted parents revealed that she and Lieren are the daughters of a human &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Dougan\"&gt;Dougan&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend they fought beside in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, whom Kardan and Voldana accompanied on his mission to rescue villagers from the cursed tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, brave hearts and noble intentions were not enough to defeat the evil from with in and they were forced to retreat. Dougan was killed in the process and was left behind. Feeling guilty that they hadn't gone back for their friend, Kardan and Voldana returned to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; and delivered the sad news to Dougan\u2019s wife &lt;a href=\"Adena\"&gt;Adena&lt;/a&gt;. Yet so immense was her grief that her mind snapped and she became unfit to raise her twin baby girls. After some time spent with Adena, it became clear that she might not ever recover. And so, after arranging for Adena to be cared for by a healer, Voldanna and Kardan decided to honor their friend by raising the twin girls as their own.\nWhile Lieren and Loania shared little in common aside from their appearance, they both insisted on seeing their mother. Voldana and Kardan accompanied the twins to the location of a house where their mother lived. However upon arrival of their old home, now called &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, the twins found the house to be empty. While there, they were attacked by ghouls but thanks to arrival of &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Dodds\"&gt;Watcher Dodds&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers, they were rescued. Eventually they learned from &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; that their mother was dead. After the loss of the good paladin and neighbor, Adena had committed suicide not long after Kardan and Voldana had adopted the twins, and was then buried in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. On the way to the cemetery with a &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; escort, it was discovered that Adena had been reborn as one of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and was headed with other undead to attack Darkshire. The girls set off on the grisly task of freeing their mother from the rotten prison of flesh by decapitating her.\nIt was then that with their mother\u2019s soul finally laid to rest that Lieren and Loania swore an oath on her grave, now in Hinterlands, to go to Karazhan to free their father\u2019s soul as they did their mother\u2019s.\nA few years later, and the teenagers are now young women. Loania has become a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, leaving behind the use of the bow. It is revealed that because the high elves of Quel'Danil Lodge no longer practice &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, Loania had to learn magic from a visiting human mage. Using her knowledge of magic, Loania used a spell to contact their father to see if he still lives. Dougan\u2019s spirit warns them to stay away, yet Lieren is determined to free him. Without Kardan and Voldana's knowledge, Loania teleports herself and Lieren from Lieren's room in Aerie Peak to Karazhan in search of their father.\nAs the twins make their way through Karazhan, Loania, being a mage, starts seeing visions. The first was a vision of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; opening the dark portal to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The second vision is of their father fighting the undead in the tower. Loania uses her vision to trace her father\u2019s foot steps which leads her to &lt;a href=\"Terestian%20Illhoof\"&gt;Terestian Illhoof&lt;/a&gt;, their father\u2019s murderer. The twins defeat him in battle but Loania is left injured. Lieren wants to get Loania to safety first before she rescues her father. They meet with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt; who ensorcells Lieren in an attempt to kill her and trap her spirit in Karazhan forever. Loania uses a spell to call out to her father once more and Dougan\u2019s spirit arrives just in time to save Lieren\u2019s life, intimidating Aran into submission. Dougan tells Lieren that it is impossible for his spirit to leave Karazhan and that he has made peace with that.\nAs danger approaches, Lieren and Loania need to teleport out of Karazhan, but Loania is so weak that Lieren offers her access to her lifeforce to beat the tower's pull. Dougan\u2019s spirit holds off the horrors of Karazhan while Loania teleports themselves out of danger and make their escape. As Lieren could only use her lifeforce to power the spell rather than magic, the strain of the teleportation caused her hair to become streaked with white, which she uses as a reminder that she can\u2019t win every battle.\nAlthough they failed to free their father\u2019s spirit, the twins take comfort in knowing that his spirit remains unbroken, just like theirs."}

{"id": "38414", "revid": "27079649", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=38414", "title": "Loatheb", "text": "Loatheb is the third and final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%23Plague%20Quarter\"&gt;Plague Quarter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. \nHistory.\nA prime example of how the plague manifested in the local flora and fauna is the twisted fen creeper Loatheb. In a twisted mockery of the plant kingdom's natural ability to regenerate, Loatheb can summon deadly spores that quickly spread a sickening miasma that turns magical healing arts against those who wield them.\n25-man abilities.\nLoatheb's melee is relatively weak. Loatheb has approximately 20,200,000 hit points. He will also enter a Berserker Rage at 12 minutes into the fight, killing anyone left alive.\n10-man abilities.\nLoatheb's melee is relatively weak. Loatheb has approximately 6,690,000 hit points.\n25-man strategy.\nThis encounter is a DPS race that also hinges on making good use of the available time to heal. You will need one tank.\nIt is important that everyone in the raid gains the Fungal Creep buff as soon as possible and keeps it. Only 5 people can get it at a time. Therefore each of your 5 groups should have an order to kill the randomly spawning spores, the highest DPS should get it first. As they spawn 5 people will move to the spore and kill it while stacked on top of it. The tank does not need or want the buff.\nTwo healers should be enough to keep the tank topped off during the available healing time, the rest of the healers will need to heal the raid. Since Necrotic Aura only applies to healing done while it is active, there are a number of tricks available to healers to increase their window for healing, namely precasting a heal so that it casts just as the aura drops, and stacking up &lt;a href=\"Lifebloom\"&gt;Lifebloom&lt;/a&gt; so that it will bloom when the aura drops (full stack of 3, ticking through the aura downtime also provides a decent heal). Priests can also use , as it does not actually heal, and so is not affected by the aura. However, Power Word Shield will not absorb Inevitable Doom damage and will absorb only part of the damage from Deathbloom, so it is best used on the main tank. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Shield\"&gt;Sacred Shield&lt;/a&gt; on the Main Tank will help to reduce his incoming damage. It is important to note that heal over time spells and healthstones/healing potions will do nothing while the aura is up so only large heals should be used. An exception to this is the Holy Priest's Circle of Healing, which can be used at the end of the healing window, when there is no time remaining to use a spell with a cast time. When not getting the spore buff the raid should remain stacked to facilitate healing. Bandages during the 3 seconds and shadow protection potions can help (these apply whether used within aura uptime or not, since they prevent damage instead of healing it). Should you divine shield or ice block Inevitable Doom the spore \"debuff\" will fall off and you will need to get it again. \nAfter a while, Inevitable Doom damage will become very difficult to heal so it is important that Loatheb is killed before this.\nThe priest's discipline tree also has the talent Divine Aegis, which shields the target for 30% after critical heals (3/3). This effect has been reported to work also during the Necrotic aura (still under investigation &lt;a href=\"http%3A//discpriest.com/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D5%26amp%3Bt%3D86\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).\n10-man strategy.\nGroup construction: One group should be made of 4 DPS + 1 AOE-capable Healer. Any remaining DPS in the raid should be instructed to follow this group. The second group should have all tanks, remaining healers, and any extra DPS.\nAssignments: One member of the DPS should be assigned to locate, announce, and pop spores. All other DPS should focus solely on moving, and DPS. A second player should be assigned to announce pre-casting for healers.\nPositions: Loatheb should be tanked in the center of the room with healers positioned half-way between Loatheb and the entry door. The DPS group will be roaming.\nSpores: When a spore appears the assigned player should announce its location. All DPS in the raid should move within 10 yards of the spore, and then resume DPS on Loatheb. The assigned player then pops the spore. All DPS should focus on being in range of a spore, and hitting the boss - that's it. The assigned player should be the only member looking for spores and popping them.\nHealers: An assigned healer should announce \"Precast!\" when there are 3 seconds left on the Necrotic Aura. All healers should then cast a 3-second spell that will succeed the moment the healing window opens. Healers should then focus on their assigned targets using the fastest spells available.\nHealers with spells that heal over time (HoT) may be able to \"load\" spells onto members of the raid before the precast announcement. This will enable the HoT to tick during the healing window. Timed Lifebloom's with an expiration within the healing window may also help boost the healing.\nNotes\nStacking method.\nThe debuff given by the spores causes 100% loss of threat from all attacks. Because of this, most raids are reluctant to allow the debuff to reach the tank. Use the Divided Method for the first two spores that enter the room. This allows the raid to sustain their DPS with the increased crit chance, but also completely diminishes their threat. During the first two spores, the tank focuses solely on raising his threat on Loatheb as high as possible (tanks doing 4k+ TPS have no problem reaching insurmountable amounts of threat within the first two spores). Positioning of Loatheb and healing assignments are the same as found above.\nOnce the third spore enters the room, all players in the raid stack on the tank, and no one chases after spores from this point on. The spores are then allowed to crawl their way to where the entire raid is standing, and the spore is popped giving the entire raid the increased critical chance and 100% loss of threat debuff. At this point, there is no downtime from DPS having to run around the room, and all raid members, including the tank, begin to crit non-stop. Because everyone in the raid has 100% loss of threat, there is no need to worry about the tank losing threat (unless someone taunts Loatheb, which should be avoided at all cost). Loatheb can be demolished with this strategy by roughly doom #10, #15 maximum.\nClasses.\nAffliction warlocks.\nAn affliction-spec'd warlock with the 51-pointer &lt;a href=\"Haunt%20%28warlock%20talent%29\"&gt;Haunt (warlock talent)&lt;/a&gt; will be able to save the raid healers some effort. Watch the debuff that prevents healing and when it ticks from 13 to 12 seconds remaining, start casting your Haunt. This will increase your DPS as Haunt always does, but it also means that the healing effect will return to you with 1500-2000 health during the three seconds when healing can take place.\nDeath knights.\nAll death knight's have an attack called &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt; - if timed properly and with 2 sets of [death, frost, unholy] runes you can heal yourself for 3500-5000 total with 2 strikes. Death Knights may also summon a ghoul and then immediately use &lt;a href=\"Death%20Pact\"&gt;Death Pact&lt;/a&gt; to restore another portion of their health.\nDeath Knights may also use &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Icebound%20Fortitude\"&gt;Icebound Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; during Dooms to help reduce the amount of incoming damage. The last two only being available for those in frost specc, or Lichborne in partial Frost specc additionally the last two will not reduce the actual Inevitable Doom damage but instead mitigate all other incoming damage.\nPaladin tanks.\nA paladin tank may heal him/herself towards the end of the combat, any support-healing in this part is a plus.\nIn addition, if the raid is having trouble healing, the paladin should consider using &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Light\"&gt;Seal of Light&lt;/a&gt;, instead of a typical tanking Seal. Since dps with the Fungal Creep debuff will not generate any threat, maintaining a tanking Seal for threat generation should be unnecessary. The additional healing from Seal of Light during the 3 seconds that Necrotic Aura is not up may help slightly to reduce the load on healers. Notably, though, some Paladin tanks will continue to prefer using a tanking Seal, if only to generate additional dps to expedite the end of the fight.\nPaladin tanks should maximize their stamina and block value (and block rating, if not already block-capped) during this fight, rather than avoidance. Loatheb's melee strikes are so modest that the majority of his melee damage can be entirely mitigated simply through blocking.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nExternal links.\n "}

This means healers will only be able to heal the Main Tank while the rest of the raid must use consumables to stay alive. Healers should set up a rotation to determine when and who heals the tank.\nLoatheb has an aura that deals Nature damage to players and pets in melee range.

This is slightly complicated by the fact that some languages may use the \"%2$s %1$s\" syntax to change the order in which format arguments appear in the string; you may wish to consider using &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowace.com/addons/libdeformat-3-0/\"&gt;LibDeformat-3.0&lt;/a&gt; to perform that conversion automatically.\nIn summary, to avoid your addon malfunctioning when run on a client of another locale, avoid using hard-coded text to identify spells, items or NPCs the names of which would be localized by the client, and be mindful of using the order of return values for some functions that return lists of names (as those tend to be in alphabetical order, which may vary with localization).\nA word on return value ordering.\nSome API functions that return lists or take indices internally sort their data alphabetically. When the client is localized, the order of returned values or correspondence between return values and indices may change.\nExamples of this behavior would include the character's spellbook (where the spells are alphabetically sorted within each school) and the list of zones on a particular continent (zones are alphabetically sorted in the returned list). It would be dangerous to rely on the order of those return values alone.\nLocalization.\nIf a player is using a localized client, they would presumably also want addons to be localized to that language. To accomplish this, all text presented to the user should be translatable; this section discusses strategies for addons to support localizations, and simplify creation of new localizations.\nLocalization in the .toc file.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"TOC%20format%23Official%20tags\"&gt;official .toc tags&lt;/a&gt; support localization by appending a locale suffix to a tag name. This mechanism allows addons to present a localized name and description of the addon in the addons interface. The following example illustrates this, by adding a french (\"frFR\" locale) title and description to the Gatherer addon:\n Title: Gatherer\n Title-frFR: Gatherer (en Francais, in French)\n Notes: Gatherer, displays stuff you gather in your minimap\n Notes-frFR: Gatherer, affiche les objets recoltes dans la minicarte\nMaking an addon localizable.\nTo begin with, you need to ensure that every time your addon displays a piece of text to the user, that piece of text \"can\" be localized. Consider the two pieces of code below:\nCode on the left could not be localized without editing the file containing it; while the code in the right wraps the output in a table lookup\u2014so if the value associated with the \"Hello World!\" key in MyLocalizationTable was altered, the text output would change. We can use a metatable to allow you to write localizable code without worrying about supplying a default localization:\n local function defaultFunc(L, key)\n -- If this function was called, we have no localization for this key.\n -- We could complain loudly to allow localizers to see the error of their ways, but, for now, just return the key as its own localization. This allows you to avoid writing the default localization out explicitly.\n return key;\n end\n MyLocalizationTable = setmetatable({}, {__index=defaultFunc});\nThis method allows you to add an easy localization mechanism to your addons, requiring minimal additional code.\nAdding translations.\nSuppose we then wanted to translate the \"Hello World!\" string from the example above to the client's language. The locale of the client is returned by (). To add localizations to the addon, we could add new files along the lines of the following:\n local L = MyLocalizationTable;\n if GetLocale() == \"frFR\" then\n L[\"Hello World!\"] = \"Hello France!\";\n end\nTo run correctly, those localization files need to be loaded after MyLocalizationTable is created, but before localization is actually used.\nCharacter Encoding in World of Warcraft.\nWorld of Warcraft supports UTF-8 encoded strings of unicode characters; in UTF-8 encoding, ASCII characters can be represented using 1 byte, while most unicode characters typically require multi-byte sequences. You can simply use a UTF-8 enabled text editor, and save unicode-containing .lua files using UTF-8 encoding.\nAlternatively, you can manually encode the multi-byte sequences required by UTF-8 using Lua escape sequences. The table below shows escape sequences for some european characters:\n \u00e0 : \\195\\160 \u00e8 : \\195\\168 \u00ec : \\195\\172 \u00f2 : \\195\\178 \u00f9 : \\195\\185\n \u00e1 : \\195\\161 \u00e9 : \\195\\169 \u00ed : \\195\\173 \u00f3 : \\195\\179 \u00fa : \\195\\186\n \u00e2 : \\195\\162 \u00ea : \\195\\170 \u00ee : \\195\\174 \u00f4 : \\195\\180 \u00fb : \\195\\187\n \u00e3 : \\195\\163 \u00eb : \\195\\171 \u00ef : \\195\\175 \u00f5 : \\195\\181 \u00fc : \\195\\188\n \u00e4 : \\195\\164 \u00f1 : \\195\\177 \u00f6 : \\195\\182\n \u00e6 : \\195\\166 \u00f8 : \\195\\184\n \u00e7 : \\195\\167 \u0153 : \\197\\147\n \u00c4 : \\195\\132 \u00d6 : \\195\\150 \u00dc : \\195\\156 \u00df : \\195\\159\nIf you don't know the UTF-8 sequence for a particular character, you can compute it from the unicode character code, or by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.utf8-chartable.de/\"&gt;looking up the desired character online&lt;/a&gt;.\nCheck the GlobalStrings.lua.\nSome strings, particularly those used by Blizzard in FrameXML, are already localized by the client. You can view the full list of such strings by reading the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.townlong-yak.com/framexml/live/GlobalStrings.lua\"&gt;FrameXML/GlobalStrings.lua&lt;/a&gt; file.\nAn Example.\nThe addon below displays a message every time the PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD event fires. The message is localized according to the client localization; new locales can be added relatively easily by duplicating the localization.de.lua file.\nLocaleDemo.toc.\n ## Title: Hello World\n ## Title-frFR: Hello France\n ## Title-deDE: Hello Germany\n ## Description: Displays a message greeting the world\n ## Description-frFR: Displays a message greeting France\n ## Description-deDE: Displays a message greeting Germany\n localization.core.lua\n localization.de.lua\n localization.fr.lua\n LocaleDemo.lua\nlocalization.core.lua.\n local addonName, L = ...; -- Let's use the private table passed to every .lua file to store our locale\n local function defaultFunc(L, key)\n -- If this function was called, we have no localization for this key.\n -- We could complain loudly to allow localizers to see the error of their ways, \n -- but, for now, just return the key as its own localization. This allows you to\u2014avoid writing the default localization out explicitly.\n return key;\n end\n setmetatable(L, {__index=defaultFunc});\nlocalization.fr.lua.\n local _, L = ...;\n if GetLocale() == \"frFR\" then\n L[\"Hello World!\"] = \"Hello France!\";\n end\nlocalization.de.lua.\n local _, L = ...;\n if GetLocale() == \"deDE\" then\n L[\"Hello World!\"] = \"Hello Germany!\";\n end\nLocaleDemo.lua.\n local _, L = ...;\n local f = CreateFrame(\"Frame\");\n f:RegisterEvent(\"PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD\");\n f:SetScript(\"OnEvent\", function()\n print(L[\"Hello World!\"]);\n end"}

It is known for its temperate climate, abandoned archaeological dig site and, until the cataclysm, the huge lake from which the region takes its name. The gray and rugged mountains rise up on all sides around the loch, and the hills are lightly wooded with pine and birch. The loch was held in place by the now broken &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Dam\"&gt;Stonewrought Dam&lt;/a&gt;, an architectural wonder of no equal on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The dam was destroyed when Deathwing burst into and flew over Azeroth, and its destruction caused the loch to drain and cause massive changes to the area.\nLoch Modan is heavily populated by hostile &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, unearthed from caves below ground by the dwarven digs. They have since settled in the surrounding mountainous area and built crude camps and caves from which to strike at passing travelers. Other dangers include dangerous wildlife, aggressive &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, and the powerful &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Mo%27grosh%20Stronghold\"&gt;Mo'grosh Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDespite its serene appearance, Loch Modan has seen its share of conflict and bloodshed. In the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; overran Loch Modan and made a stand against the defenders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; were ultimately successful in their defense, and reclaimed the area in the war's aftermath. Broken &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e can still be seen scattered about on the bottom and islands of the loch, mute evidence to the region's bloody history.\nGeography.\nThere are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds in Loch Modan. However, the &lt;a href=\"elite%20area\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mo%27grosh%20Stronghold\"&gt;Mo'grosh Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this area.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has no travel hub in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, they have to fly to &lt;a href=\"Thelsamar\"&gt;Thelsamar&lt;/a&gt; in Loch Modan and ride from there to get to &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. Newer players are often unacquainted to the higher-level activity in a teens level zone in comparison to the starting zones they have come from.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D15\"&gt;A topographic map of Loch Modan.&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nLoch Modan is home to several &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of various levels of importance. In the Valley of Kings, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rugelfuss\"&gt;Captain Rugelfuss&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young dwarves to eradicate the troggs who infest the region. At the Stonewrought Dam, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Engineer%20Hinderweir%20VII\"&gt;Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII&lt;/a&gt; seeks to rid Loch Modan of the vile and terrible Dark Iron dwarves. And at his excavation site, the unlucky &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Ironband\"&gt;Prospector Ironband&lt;/a&gt; recruits \"slightly\" more experienced adventurers to investigate the ruins of Uldaman.\nQuests.\nLoch Modan is the level 10-20 destination zone for &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s from the adjacent starting zone of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. However it is easy enough for all other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races to quest here, via the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nDig sites.\nLoch Modan only has one &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;:\nCataclysm.\nMany things happened in Loch Modan with the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, with Twilight hammer cultists attacking, dark iron dwarves up to their old tricks, the loch drained dry and murlocs, gnolls and kobolds creating an alliance.\nAreas affected:\nIn the RPG.\nLoch Modan is the heartland of the proud and feisty &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Although the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; drove the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; into seclusion and guerilla warfare in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, they have returned to their homeland and thrive once more.\nThis region is the source of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s mercantile strength.\nFew enemies can penetrate the mountains around Loch Modan, and &lt;a href=\"Algaz%20Gate\"&gt;Algaz Gate&lt;/a&gt; serves as an effective barrier, so the region is perhaps the most peaceful in the eastern continents.\nLike all Ironforge dwarves, Loch Modan's denizens are industrious. They fish, mine, cut lumber and smith weapons with great alacrity. It can be dangerous region, but it is largely civilized and subject to constant Ironforge patrols, though it bears the air of a frontier, wilderness area, and it is home to vicious predators and ever-present &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nThe rampaging &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s overran Loch Modan in the Second War, but in the war's aftermath the dwarves returned and reclaimed their land. The &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; to the north didn't have such luck as Horde and &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces devastated them in the Second and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s, forcing the Ironforge dwarves to retreat to Loch Modan and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt;s, hired by an unknown enemy, blasted &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz%20Gate\"&gt;Dun Algaz Gate&lt;/a&gt; and severely damage the edifice. The gate had to be repaired before another attack. &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; offers a sizable reward to whoever discovers the enemy behind the sabotage.\nGeography.\nThe cold, wet, and mountainous Loch Modan lies in the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. To its south are the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;; while to the north, after crossing Dun Algaz Gate, lie the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;. Loch Modan is a &lt;a href=\"lake\"&gt;lake&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the largest body of fresh water in the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It teems with fish, and the surrounding mountains are rich in timber and precious metals. Dwarves and their allies fish the lake, mine the cliffs and cut the timber.\nThe region is constantly gray and cold. The sun burns through the mist rarely, creating a twilit world of rolling wisps and limited vision. Constant rainfall keeps the land lush and green. A bitter chill claims the mornings and evenings, though warm currents from the eastern seas prevent the loch from freezing. A bit too rugged for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; sensibilities, but perfect for dwarves. The air smells better in Loch Modan, and the humidity is a stark contrast to the Badlands.\nThe loch is massive, occupying a great deal of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems no one has ever measured it. Three large islands grace the lake's interior. Upon the northernmost island are ruins from the Second War, while the southern islands are barren save for occasional &lt;a href=\"Stonesplinter%20tribe\"&gt;Stonesplinter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s. Huge gray mountains rise up on all sides around the lake, while pine forests cover the area.\nThe lake abounds with fish, including piranhalike &lt;a href=\"Frenzy\"&gt;frenzies&lt;/a&gt;, and its fish population draws a variety of predators to the area. Black &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"threshadon\"&gt;threshadon&lt;/a&gt;s frequent the shoreline, the bears snatching fish from the water while the threshadons chew on the aquatic plantlife.

It is known for its temperate climate, abandoned archaeological dig site and, until the cataclysm, the huge lake from which the region takes its name. The gray and rugged Khaz Modan mountains rise up on all sides around the loch, and the hills are lightly wooded with pine and birch. The loch was held in place by the now broken &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Dam\"&gt;Stonewrought Dam&lt;/a&gt;, an architectural wonder of no equal on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoch Modan is heavily populated by hostile &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, unearthed from caves below ground by the dwarven digs. They have since settled in the surrounding mountainous area and built crude camps and caves from which to strike at passing travelers. Other dangers include dangerous wildlife, aggressive &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s, and the powerful &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Mo%27grosh%20Stronghold\"&gt;Mo'grosh Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDespite its serene appearance, Loch Modan has seen its share of conflict and bloodshed. In the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; overran Loch Modan and made a stand against the defenders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; were ultimately successful in their defense, and reclaimed the area in the war's aftermath. Broken catapults and ballistae can still be seen scattered about on the bottom and islands of the loch, mute evidence to the region's bloody history.\nGeography.\nThere are no instanced dungeons or battlegrounds in Loch Modan. However, the &lt;a href=\"elite%20area\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mo%27grosh%20Stronghold\"&gt;Mo'grosh Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this area.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has no travel hub in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, they have to fly to &lt;a href=\"Thelsamar\"&gt;Thelsamar&lt;/a&gt; in Loch Modan and ride from there to get to &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. Newer players are often unacquainted to the higher-level activity in a teens level zone in comparison to the starting zones they have come from.\nNotable characters.\nLoch Modan is home to several &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of various levels of importance. In the Valley of Kings, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rugelfuss\"&gt;Captain Rugelfuss&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young dwarves to eradicate the troggs who infest the region. At the Stonewrought Dam, &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Engineer%20Hinderweir%20VII\"&gt;Chief Engineer Hinderweir VII&lt;/a&gt; seeks to rid Loch Modan of the vile and terrible Dark Iron dwarves. And at his excavation site, the unlucky &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Ironband\"&gt;Prospector Ironband&lt;/a&gt; recruits \"slightly\" more experienced adventures to investigate the ruins of Uldaman.\nQuests.\nLoch Modan is the implied level 10-20 destination zone for &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s from the adjacent starting zone of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. However it is easy enough for all other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races to quest here, via the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; (this is true since the opening of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbour\"&gt;Stormwind Harbour&lt;/a&gt;, allowing young &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; easy access to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;).

All three zones offer a variety of quests and the most efficient method of reaching level 20 involves visiting all three. Visit either Loch Modan or Westfall, do as many easy quests as possible, visit the other zone and do the same. By that time you can return to your first zone ready to tackle the next bunch of quests, eventually including an occasional visit to Redridge.

It should take you somewhere near your missing ally. Baine Bloodhoof was his name, yes?\nEither that, or you'll end up trapped within the tower's ever-shifting halls for all eternity.\nBut those are the risks one must take, I suppose. Best of luck!\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nYou've found him!\nCompletion.\nFinding Baine was no easy feat. But you braved the horrors of that tower and succeeded.\nWell done.\nBut I fear your work is only just beginning.\nNotes.\nRun through the Portal to Torghast. Head east to the main hall and interact with the &lt;a href=\"Wayfinder\"&gt;Wayfinder&lt;/a&gt;:\nAccept the instance invite to enter this special wing of Torghast, serving as a full tutorial. Just on the other side is an anima cell, offering a choice of powers. Accept it, trigger the Mawsworn guard, then start killing a path through enemies.\nThe trash in here are not intended to be too difficult, as this is another tutorial run. Make sure to loot mobs and &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Phylactery\"&gt;Ashen Phylacteries&lt;/a&gt; for their &lt;a href=\"Phantasma\"&gt;Phantasma&lt;/a&gt;!\nInteract with &lt;a href=\"Bound%20Soul%20Remnant\"&gt;Bound Soul Remnant&lt;/a&gt;s to free them, gaining an untimed stacking 1% buff to primary stats (strength/agility/intellect). Keep an eye out for more anima cells as well.\nIn the next, flooded room, the warden calls out:\nWaves of &lt;a href=\"Starving%20Mawrat\"&gt;Starving Mawrat&lt;/a&gt;s will aggro. Clear them, then take out the floor boss, an empowered version of a normal enemy. The floor boss drops an anima hoard, and don't forget the bound soul next to him, then head upstairs to the next floor.\nThe second floor has the first environmental enemy, Soul Emanations, which constantly launch missiles into the vicinity. Should a player get hit by one they will find themselves randomly a few yards away and stunned. Nothing to this floor, so kill a path through it up to the next.\nThe third floor is a safe floor, with no enemies to kill, plenty of souls to free, and anima cells to plunder, along with a cameo by the &lt;a href=\"Tarragrue\"&gt;Tarragrue&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, players will come across their first &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt;, who will exchange the looted Phantasma for anima powers, utility items, and anima cells. Purchase as desired, then move on. Remember that Phantasma is a use-it-or-lose-it currency - should players leave Torghast, their phantasma will be lost.\nThe fourth floor has a bonus objective, started by an out-of-the-way friendly NPC. Opt to help the friendly NPC and they will join the party, helping in combat. Get to the end of the floor, where Arkoban taunts the player, summoning two hounds: &lt;a href=\"Lor%20the%20Loyal\"&gt;Lor the Loyal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ventun%20the%20Ravenous\"&gt;Ventun the Ravenous&lt;/a&gt;. Defeat them and the floor boss before turning in the quest, which awards another anima cell, themed to the questgiver.\nThe fifth floor introduces locked chests. There are several varieties:\nThe chest, once unlocked, awards an anima cache.\nThe sixth and final floor is the boss floor. Use up as much phantasma as possible, as it won't have any use after the upcoming fight. Step into the boss arena to find &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Arkoban\"&gt;Warden Arkoban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;! Arkoban has the following abilities:\nApproach Arkoban:\nDefeat him:\nArkoban drops &lt;a href=\"The%20Forgotten%20Key\"&gt;The Forgotten Key&lt;/a&gt;, which starts a quest: &lt;a href=\"Prison%20of%20the%20Forgotten\"&gt;Prison of the Forgotten&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteract with Baine to free him:\nFollow Baine out of Arkoban back to the ground floor, then head west to the exit Torghast door:\nTake advantage of this opportunity to talk to &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Prison%20of%20the%20Forgotten\"&gt;Prison of the Forgotten&lt;/a&gt;. Hold off on returning to Torghast right now, what with Baine in tow and all, make for the waystone:\nHead through:\nReturn to the &lt;a href=\"Enclave\"&gt;Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and turn in to Bolvar.\nBeta version.\nEven with our bond, &lt;name&gt;, my vision in the tower is shadowy. Dim.\nI cannot sense our allies.\nHowever, we know where Baine might be. Find a way into Arkoban Hall.\nEven through our bond, &lt;name&gt;, my vision into the tower is shadowy. Dim.\nI cannot sense the location of our allies.\nHowever, there is an object of power nearby that beckons us. It may lead you further into the tower's halls.\nIt whispers a name... \"Arkoban...\"\nThis is no doubt a dangerous course, but it is our only clue as to where Baine might be.\nLet us hope this obelisk shows you the way. Stay on your guard.\nI dare not step inside the the tower.\nYou however don't seem to be cursed like the rest of us to remain trapped here.\nWhile I cannot tell you exactly where your comrades may be, I shall give you a gift.\nUse it inside Torghast, it should take you somewhere near to your missing ally, Baine I believe was his name.\nEither that or you'll end up trapped in Torghast's ever shifting halls for all time, but those are the risks one must take. \n&lt;Name&gt;, what happened?\nBaine is free!\nYou are my eyes, &lt;name&gt;.

You're certainly worthy of holding the key to Karazhan.\nA small problem remains.\nStrategy and tips.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20Key%20Fragment\"&gt;Second Key Fragment&lt;/a&gt; is in the pool of water, to the right of the first boss &lt;a href=\"Hydromancer%20Thespia\"&gt;Hydromancer Thespia&lt;/a&gt;, just before getting to her room, in &lt;a href=\"The%20Steamvault\"&gt;The Steamvault&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quest is now harder to solo (as of &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.7\"&gt;Patch 2.0.7&lt;/a&gt;), through &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, due to the container no longer containing anything - it triggers an event which spawns an elite guardian which must be killed in order to obtain the fragment. The Guardian only drops the number of keys needed by the group. Upon leaving the instance, your copy of the key is deleted. This prevents you ungrouping and allowing others to join and loot the key. It should also be noted that if you spawn the Guardian Mob, and consequently wipe, then it is likely that you may not be able to loot the key fragment.\nIf you bring a party to obtain the key fragment and can defeat the Bog Overlords, getting to the key is a pretty quick process. Kill the two Bog Lords on the right side as you enter and skirt that edge. Following the Bog Lords, there is a pull of a 4-group of Naga, the 2-group at the front edge of the ramp leading to Kalithresh (watch for the patrollers and pull them back). Continue straight ahead (do not turn right onto the route to Kalithresh) and pull the mob of 4 naga slightly back to avoid the patrol. Turn right and go down the ramp into the pool of water. Jump left into the water and then get your key!\nIt is possible to get the fragment with 2 players and at least 2 &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20Potion\"&gt;Invisibility Potion&lt;/a&gt;s each. This method requires the first group to be pulled and a melee/spellcaster patrol to be pulled. After the two groups are dead, careful timing is required where each party member takes turns to run into the room and drink the potion the moment before they may pull aggro. Making the run seperately can prevent a full-party wipe. Once Invisible, run straight to the pond and aim for the second column to hide on the backside directly against it, away from the \"ramp\". When the potion wears off, you should be standing evenly between a large Naga group and two Mermidon guards next to the ramp. Wait for your 10 minute cooldown on the potions to wear off. Afterward, drink and proceed to the pond. Priests can use their Mind Vision spell to locate the \"rest stop\" and guide party members. Avoid Bog Overlords at all costs, as they are able to detect you while Invisible.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Third%20Key%20Fragment\"&gt;Third Key Fragment&lt;/a&gt; is a little more of a challenge. You first of all need to enter &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt; (which requires at least one party member with a lockpicking skill of 350, or the &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Arcatraz\"&gt;Key to the Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt; obtained from starting the &lt;a href=\"Assisting%20the%20Consortium\"&gt;Assisting the Consortium&lt;/a&gt; quest-chain) and work your way to the first boss, &lt;a href=\"Zereketh%20the%20Unbound\"&gt;Zereketh the Unbound&lt;/a&gt;. If your group is only interested in obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Key%20Fragment\"&gt;Third Key Fragment&lt;/a&gt; then you can skip &lt;a href=\"Zereketh%20the%20Unbound\"&gt;Zereketh the Unbound&lt;/a&gt; and go to the stair case, which is located directly in front of you as you enter &lt;a href=\"Zereketh%20the%20Unbound\"&gt;Zereketh the Unbound&lt;/a&gt;'s room. \nUpon arrival at the top of the staircase you'll need to remove a few guard mobs, until you reach the first room - the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Key%20Fragment\"&gt;Third Key Fragment&lt;/a&gt; is located in the corner, on the right as you enter the room.\nMuch like the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Key%20Fragment\"&gt;Second Key Fragment&lt;/a&gt;, this too is now a little harder to solo through &lt;a href=\"Stealth\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; - as looting the container for the &lt;a href=\"Third%20Key%20Fragment\"&gt;Third Key Fragment&lt;/a&gt; now spawns an elite Guardian mob that must be killed in order to obtain the fragment."}

Asking a pet tamer to venture into the caverns, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt; discovered a sleeping tauren who admitted that he was responsible for the goings-on in the cavern. Rather than fight, the tauren simply jumped off a cliff and escaped by using a kite as a glider.\nSome time passed and this time, it would be the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; causing a disturbance. The same adventurer was sent yet again and after getting to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20juggernaught\"&gt;Defias juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer was confronted by a female orc. She told him, that the tauren had mentioned him and threatened him with force if he'd ever harm the tauren. She too would not fight and would leave the adventurer to fight against &lt;a href=\"Cookie%27s%20Leftovers\"&gt;Cookie's Leftovers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe next disturbance came from Gnomeregan, where mayhem started appearing all around. The same adventurer went to investigate and found a night elf interfering with the machines inside. He stunned and told the adventurer of a plan the group had been planning. He also informed him that he took something from the &lt;a href=\"Pulverizer%20Bot%20Mk%206001\"&gt;Pulverizer Bot Mk 6001&lt;/a&gt; and left the adventurer to face off against the activated mech.\nA call from &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; was next, where undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; started making a comeback. The adventurer answered the call and made his way to the &lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20House\"&gt;Slaughter House&lt;/a&gt;. Inside the building, the adventurer is confronted by a gnome and a blood elf. The gnome raised &lt;a href=\"Blackmane\"&gt;Blackmane&lt;/a&gt; and the two left the adventurer to deal with it.\nAfter discovering that they were based within &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer entered in order to stop them once and for all. From within the mountain, the adventurer is confronted by every single member. After defeating them, the Shadows were impressed and invited the adventurer to join them."}

Standing vigilant above the plains like the descending arm of twilight itself, is the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. The Citadel - serving as sanctum and haven to the &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; - is the last barrier between the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their subjugation of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;ity. Manifested in the combined magical prowess of all Mages within the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, this place must fall for the Horde to conquer Lordaeron. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; has saved his greatest weapon, ready to unleash it upon the unsuspecting Alliance at just this moment - &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\nBattle.\nBackground.\nDragons indeed were the main weapon in the conquest of the &lt;a href=\"Cross%20Island\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt;, but first Urok's forces had to raise a city to support their production. All of their military units swept quickly southward and removed all the defenders near the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;; the construction of the necessary buildings were begun in earnest. During this time, they erected many &lt;a href=\"guard%20tower\"&gt;guard tower&lt;/a&gt;s to deal with the constant harassment of enemy &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s; a &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; went up to produce &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; for the same purpose.\nWhen they started running out of gold, they assaulted the southern outpost to get &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s beyond it to another mine. The first step of this operation was to send a single sapper to blow up the western tower. With the task out of the way, they rolled catapults to remove the rest, escorted by more troops, and the way was cleared to start another &lt;a href=\"great%20hall\"&gt;great hall&lt;/a&gt; and plunder its resources. Another shipyard went up near it, to launch more destroyers on that side of the land bridge for defense against gryphons. By that time, they had four &lt;a href=\"dragon%20roost\"&gt;dragon roost&lt;/a&gt;s started. Soon the skies belonged to them. The assault on the island required the combined efforts of dragons, catapults, and ogres. The dragons did most of the destructive work, but catapults and ogres escorts were required to take out enemy guard towers, which could fire on them. Sappers also came in handy for a few of them, but most structures fell to the catapults while the dragons worked on mobile targets. With careful and constant strikes on single targets, each followed by a brief retreat, it was only a matter of time before the island was theirs. Urok believed, that very soon, they would be able to say the same for the rest of the world.\nAftermath.\nThis battle was a painful loss to the Alliance. Though razed by the battle, Dalaran was quickly rebuilt, and continued to function until its complete destruction at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Silithyst is a red crystalline dust that reaches the surface through &lt;a href=\"Silithyst%20Geyser\"&gt;geysers&lt;/a&gt; exclusive to the Silithus desert. Both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have taken an interest in this new substance, and researchers on both sides have discovered unique and valuable properties in the dust. The Horde and Alliance camps in the region have both been outfitted with turn-in stations where players can unload the Silithyst they collect.\nOverview.\nTo pick up Silithyst, locate a geyser and pick it up. The geyser will despawn, and the player will be carrying the Silithyst. While carrying it, your movement speed is reduced (abilities like \"&lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;\" will not have any effect) and you will be unable to mount without dropping the Silithyst. The other way of getting Silithyst is locating a player of the opposing faction carrying some. Upon damaging that player, he will drop his/her Silithyst, creating a &lt;a href=\"Silithyst%20Mound\"&gt;Silithyst Mound&lt;/a&gt; allowing any player to temporarily pick up the Silithyst.\nAfter collecting Silithyst, the player should run to the faction's turn in point, displayed on the map. A player may only carry one Silithyst at any time, so after each pickup, you will have to run and turn it in. The first faction to collect 200 Silithyst wins the race.\nRewards.\nA single turn in of Silithyst awards the player with the following:\nIn addition, the faction that completes the race to 200 Silithyst will receive a zone-wide buff, increasing &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle%20Reputation%20Guide\"&gt;Cenarion Circle reputation&lt;/a&gt; gained from killing monsters by 25%. The buff will apply to any player within &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s, even to those who enter them at a later time. It will persist through death until the opposing faction has collected 200 Silithyst and therefore won the race. A server reboot will reset the battle, which means both sides start at 0/200 Silithyst and lose their buff.\nThis buff is most useful in instances because of the greater amount of reputation collected from each kill. Although non-instance kills only grant 2 points of reputation (10 points as of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;), while the buff is in effect, every fourth kill will reward 4 reputation points (15 as of patch 3.0.2). This, of course, is not a large bonus, but it is still slightly faster than non-buffed reputation farming.\nUnfortunately, many may find that the honor and reputation bonus are not enough to reward their efforts. The reputation and honor given are both too low to make a day of Silithyst collecting worthwhile compared to the rewards given through the &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; or the various methods of Cenarion Circle reputation farming. As a result, there will rarely be many people collecting any Silithyst."}

Remember to also keep &lt;a href=\"Duvall\"&gt;Duvall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Efrina\"&gt;Efrina&lt;/a&gt; alive.\nThe mobs - &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Spawn\"&gt;Flesh Spawn&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Masterless%20Faceless%20One\"&gt;Masterless Faceless One&lt;/a&gt; - won't immediately engage if you don't follow them. This can be a great way to heal them back to full before entering another fight.\nStage 3: Keeper's Rest.\nKill &lt;a href=\"Masterless%20Facelesss%20Corupter\"&gt;Masterless Facelesss Corupter&lt;/a&gt;s and Flesh Spawn.\nSpeak with Travard.\nAfter clearing the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;:\nFor this fight, you may find it necessary to use &lt;a href=\"Avenging%20Wrath\"&gt;Avenging Wrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 5: Into the Dark.\nSpeak with Travard again.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt; to help deal with minor mobs and clear the area.\nDon't worry about the barrier blocking the path.\nYou have one more pack of minor mobs to kill before moving on to the next stage.\nStage 6: The Maw of the Beast.\nRecast Beacon of Light if it has fallen off of Travard. Speak with Travard when ready.\nDuring the fight you will lose Duvall and Efrina.\nAvoid the rotating beam of void energy, which inflicts heavy damage. You should have no other trouble finishing off the Horrific Aberration.\nStage 7: Escaping the Prison.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Steed\"&gt;Divine Steed&lt;/a&gt; if you have trouble keeping up with Travard.\nStage 10: Ritual Defense.\nYou will be aided by a full group this time, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Helda%20the%20Breaker\"&gt;Helda the Breaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shieldbearer%20Anak\"&gt;Shieldbearer Anak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kelissa%20Stilwell\"&gt;Kelissa Stilwell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lyanae\"&gt;Lyanae&lt;/a&gt;. Keep them all up as long as it takes for the tracker bar to reach 100%. About midway through, the boss will make an entrance.\nFinal Stage: The Silver Hand.\nThe Silver Hand is free. Claim it before Mordoth overwhelms the defenders!\nThe mobs will have been disoriented by Blinding Light, so go retrieve &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. (Interestingly, the flavor text for the spell used on the mobs states, \"The &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;mistress of the skies&lt;/a&gt; protects her children with a fury unmatched even among the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\")\nBack at the camp:\nRide the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Hippogryph%20%28Plaguelands%29\"&gt;Argent Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; for a speedy return to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and from there, to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;."}

She was a child, apparently three years old (the year before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was opened), when the &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; was in the middle of their &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;slaughter&lt;/a&gt; of the draenei on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLegends: Family Values.\nShe lost first her father, &lt;a href=\"Alius\"&gt;Alius&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to protect Leena and her mother from the approaching &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and then her mother who tried to lead the orcs away from Leena but was caught before she could get far. Both were killed by &lt;a href=\"J%27argg%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;J'argg Bloodfyre&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeena was about to be killed by J'argg before she was saved by his brother, &lt;a href=\"Jaruk%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;Jaruk Bloodfyre&lt;/a&gt;. Jaruk, who had refused to drink the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;demonic blood&lt;/a&gt; offered to the orcs by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, had enough of the slaughter and could not stand the bloodlust that was corrupting his people. Jaruk attacked his brother and damaged his left eye. The battle was stopped by an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt;. Jaruk took Leena and fled into the wilderness. As they were running, Leena needed to pee so she went behind rocks but was bitten by a Cavern Crawler Hatchling and immediately started to burn up. In Zangarmarsh Jaruk found herbs from which he created medicine for her. Soon later, a &lt;a href=\"marsh%20beast\"&gt;marsh beast&lt;/a&gt; delayed them, allowing J'argg's raid party to catch up, but Jaruk was able to stir a hive of &lt;a href=\"fireflies\"&gt;fireflies&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"spore%20walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;, which attacked the approaching orcs. With the help of Jaruk's worg mount &lt;a href=\"Fang%27gar\"&gt;Fang'gar&lt;/a&gt;, which has followed them as well, they were able to escape again. While she was a child, she called him Jork Buffire.\nJaruk took care of Leena as though she were his own daughter, and taught her the ancient ways of the orcs; their &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, customs, beliefs, how to track and hunt with a bow. They were always on the run from J'argg and his men, not wanting to unnecessarily endanger the draenei who gave them shelter. She did not remember her parents so her only family was Jaruk. On an anniversary of their first meeting (apparently a few years later), they were staying with an older draenei named &lt;a href=\"Chantu\"&gt;Chantu&lt;/a&gt;. Jaruk gifted Leena, now noticeably older, with a small cub whom she named &lt;a href=\"Pebbles\"&gt;Pebbles&lt;/a&gt;. That evening, Leena wandered off on her own to hunt boars and was captured by J'argg and his followers. J'argg revealed that he had traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a vial with the &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. He forced his brother to drink the blood, and demanded to kill Leena as a proof of his new allegiance. But Jaruk, still in control of his actions, attacked J'argg and his followers. Apparently victorious, he renounced his brother and walked off to embrace Leena. But in a desperate final act, the dying J'argg managed to thrust his blade through Jaruk's back. The shocked Leena picked up a fallen blade and pierced J'argg's neck, killing him. \nAs Jaruk laid dying, the &lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; that had previously abandoned the orcs granted him a final vision, allowing him to see a future in which Leena had grown up to be a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and worked together with draenei, orcs, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s - the latter two Jaruk, for obvious reasons, did not recognize - to restore the balance of the elements. With his dying breaths, he assured Leena that everything would be all right.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nMany years later, in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as a shaman, Leena joined &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as a follower.\nShe can only be recruited using the Headhunter's Harvest from &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nSince the vision of her future showed her working alongside orcs, tauren, and trolls, she may become or already is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "22440", "revid": "4717509", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22440", "title": "Leeroy Jenkins (video)", "text": " \nLeeroy Jenkins (aka Ben Schulz) is one of the most famous players/characters in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". The video has become a \"World of Warcraft\" phenomenon. After much debate and controversy, &lt;PALS FOR LIFE&gt;, Leeroy's guild, have admitted that this was a staged promotional video. They maintain, however, that it is essentially a &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.westword.com/2007-03-08/news/the-legend-of-leeroy-jenkins/5\"&gt;faithful re-enactment&lt;/a&gt; of a true event.\nThe original video was uploaded on May 11, 2005 on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftmovies.com\"&gt;Warcraft Movies&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeeroy's actions have caused the larger \"World of Warcraft\" community to use his name to represent any action that could be seen as potentially dangerous and/or incredibly stupid. The Leeroy movie is generally suggested to be a must-see for any and all WoW players. It has become a popular term for a person who causes a bad pull that causes a group wipe. In 2005, Leeroy was also mentioned in a question about \"World of Warcraft\" on the TV game show \"Jeopardy!\".\nOn December 22, 2017, the YouTube channel Anf Pal released the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8hmgrHohDGM\"&gt;first take&lt;/a&gt; of the famous video in the hopes of raising awareness about , stating in the YouTube video's description that \"\"I've been holding onto this for over a decade waiting for the \"right\" moment to make it public, and then last week Ajit Pai created his awful/condescending video and it riled me up so much that I decided it was finally time to unleash this gem of Internet history on the world to do my part to help out.\"\" The original video was also reuploaded along with the first take video.\nThe video.\nThe video depicts an &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; raid group carefully planning out over &lt;a href=\"Ventrilo\"&gt;Ventrilo&lt;/a&gt; a method for clearing out the &lt;a href=\"Rookery\"&gt;Rookery&lt;/a&gt;. The scene is the epitome of highly structured raid play, where order of battle, combat tactics, and numbers crunching are par for the course. Among the group is Leeroy jenkins, sitting &lt;a href=\"AFK\"&gt;AFK&lt;/a&gt; and saying nothing while the rest of his extremely cautious group discuss tactics on how to safely defeat a boss in Upper Blackrock Spire (to the point of calculating a 32.3333% (repeating, of course) chance of survival). After a full minute into planning, before his party is properly prepared, however, Leeroy suddenly returns to his computer saying, \"All right chums, time's up, let's do this...\", then screams his signature line, \"LEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEEEEENKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINS!!!!\" and he charges blindly \u2014 solo, no less \u2014 into the battlezone.\nThe other party members stand still for a moment confused, perhaps in shock, and then run after Leeroy with haste, yelling, \"STICK TO THE PLAN! STICK TO THE PLAN!!\" to complete their original goal and to \"rescue\" the helpless crusader. Meanwhile, Leeroy has proceeded to &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; nearly every creature in the chamber, while the party is quickly overwhelmed and unable to coordinate. At this point, the party &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;s (all members die), and when someone asks for a &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;, they learn that no one brought one because no one in the raid was a &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe movie concludes with the words \"At least I have chicken\", which has become a secondary catch-phrase. Schulz has said that KFC is the guild's favorite snack, and that while Leeroy was AFK, he had gone to reheat some leftover chicken in the microwave. Schulz states that he was kicked out of the guild for about five minutes until they let him back in after the incident. He also stated that they used a soulstone after the event to &lt;a href=\"rez\"&gt;rez&lt;/a&gt; everyone.\nMany people point to the video as THE premiere example of how the game can become far too serious, sapping the fun from the experience. Others would say that it shows how only teamwork and careful planning can lead to success when confronting high-end game content. Either way, the video is popular and fun. (And on a side note, Leeroy is still part of the same clan today \u2014 guess they didn't take it too hard...)\n&lt;a href=\"Leeroy%20Jenkins%20%28Heroes%20of%20Azeroth%29\"&gt;Leeroy Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; is also featured in the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;World of Warcraft Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt; as an epic ally card, number 198. \nMetzen was asked at the if the character will ever appear in \"\". He thought it was a good idea. Only time will tell if it ever happens.\nThe original player behind Leeroy Jenkins was invited for a guest appearance during &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt;. On stage, he recited the war cry of \"LEEEEEERRROYYYYY JENKKKIIINNNSS\" to the delight of the audience. He was said to be available at the after-party to meet and greet fans.\nThe player.\nLeeroy Jenkins' actual name is Ben Schulz, of Colorado, and he has been playing since &lt;a href=\"Beta\"&gt;open beta&lt;/a&gt;. He is a repair technician for industrial lighting. Although offered by EA to be a game tester after the Leeroy event, he turned it down. He came up with the name Leeroy Jenkins after a catchphrase/yell while playing \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" with some friends. Unsurprisingly, Schulz is often called upon to reproduce his famous yell.\nAnother perspective on the movie.\nThe movie was staged, and to some, an obvious joke. Even before a &lt;PALS FOR LIFE&gt; member was interviewed on a gaming news network and stated that it was a reenactment of a previous event, people pointed out the various indicators for a staged event, including the following: \nAchievement.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, there is an achievement called &lt;a href=\"Leeeeeeeeeeeeeroy%21\"&gt;Leeeeeeeeeeeeeroy!&lt;/a&gt; To obtain it, the player has to kill 50 &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"UBRS\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rookery\"&gt;Rookery&lt;/a&gt;, the same place where Leeroy and his guild wiped in the video, in under 15 seconds. Getting this achievement awards the player with the title &lt;player&gt; Jenkins.\nCheering for the whiter one.\nLeeroy's player stepped into controversy when he stated at BlizzCon 2007 that he would be cheering the \"white\" team in Starcraft tournaments, as in Caucasian. He explained, however, that \"it came out wrong but like I've tried explaining that before but until America televises video gaming to that extent and we have people that are that hyped about it... [we] are not going to produce [the] kind of players that Korea is producing right now. They are superstars. They play against the best and people strive to do that much harder than they do here. So in that, generally, Koreans kick the shit out of the white dudes. And that's what that was about. I was just doing that to root for the underdog\".\nDialogue.\nThe full dialog of the original video is difficult to reconstruct based on the material. As a consequence of this individual transcripts may vary heavily. Once &lt;PALS FOR LIFE&gt; discovered attempts of writing a transcript on Wikipedia, they got together and entered their own version at the Leeroy Jenkins Wikipedia entry. Although the dialogue portion was eventually removed, it is retrieveable from page history, and is now presented here.\nThe finalized description on Wikipedia explains that \"PALS FOR LIFE have now released as close to an 'official' transcript as is likely to be seen. Since there was no script the P4Ls have tried their hand at remembering who said what. Some of the audio is too bad to hear clearly, even for the P4Ls.\"\nThe video was recorded from Anfrony's POV, and has no spoken lines. Basphemy is nicknamed \"Bas\" for short.\nJamaal: [talking to teammates outside the Rookery] OK guys, these eggs have given us a lot of trouble in the past, uh does anybody need anything off &lt;a href=\"Solakar%20Flamewreath\"&gt;this guy&lt;/a&gt; or can we bypass him?\nRitter: Uhh, I think Leeroy needs something from this guy.\nJamaal: Oh, does he need those Devout Shoulders? Doesn't - isn't he a paladin?\nRitter: Yeah, but that will help him heal better, he'll have more mana.\nJamaal: [sighs] Christ. OK, uhh well what we'll do, I'll run in first, gather up all the eggs, we can kinda just, ya know blast them all down with AOE. Um, I will use Intimidating Shout, to kinda scatter 'em, so we don't have to fight a whole bunch of them at once. Uhh, when my Shouts are done, I'll need Anfrony to come in and drop his Shout too, uh so we can keep them scattered and not have to fight too many. Um, when his is done, Bas of course will need to run in and do the same thing. We're gonna need Divine Intervention on our mages, uhh so they can AE, uh so we can of course get them down fast, cause we're bringing all these guys, I mean, we'll be in trouble if we don't take them down quick.
