Investigating the Well releases magic upon the world.\nThe Burning Legion invades Azeroth to drain the world of its innate magic. The demons are vanquished, but vow to return.\nAfter centuries of wandering in exile, the high elves establish the kingdom of Quel'Thalas in northern Lordaeron.\nHumans establish the Empire of Arathor in Lordaeron. High elves teach humans the ways of magic.\nThe empire of Arathor fragments into seven autonomous nations.\nThe Burning Legion corrupts orcs on the world of Draenor. The once noble, shamanistic orc clans unite and become the rampaging Horde.\nThe Dark Portal is opened and the Horde begins its invasion of Azeroth.\nThe Horde conquers the kingdom of Stormwind. The seven human nations of Lordaeron unite against the Horde, with assistance from high elves and dwarves. The Alliance of Lordaeron is founded under the command of Lord Anduin Lothar.\nThe Horde invades Lordaeron and destroys much of Quel'Thalas. Alliance forces push back, but Lord Lothar is killed. Spurred by Lothar's Death, the Alliance armies crush the Horde and destroy the Dark Portal. The Alliance places Horde survivors into internment camps.\nThe shaman Ner'zhul reopens the Dark Portal between Draenor and Azeroth, sending orcs to steal artifacts to open multiple Portals on Draenor. Alliance forces venture through the Dark Portal to stop Ner'zhul. The shaman opens his new Portals, but their energies spiral out of control. The Alliance forces destroy the Dark Portal so that Azeroth is not consumed by the raging energies. The blasted world of Draenor tears itself apart.\nThe orc Thrall, raised as a slave by humans, sets out on a quest to find his lost heritage. He reunites a number of renegade orc clans and leads them in revolt against the Alliance.\nThrall becomes the new Warchief of the Horde and reintroduces his people to their abandoned shamanic culture.\nThe Horde captures Alliance ships and makes a dangerous journey past the Maelstrom to the unexplored lands of Kalimdor. A mysterious plague of undeath sweeps across the Northern realm of Northrend on Lordaeron; the Knights of the Silver Hand investigate.\nPrince Arthas, a Knight of the Silver Hand, becomes corrupted in overzealous pursuit to destroy the undead Scourge. He is transformed into a death knight and leads the Scourge in a rampage across Lordaeron. The destruction heralds the return of the Burning Legion; Alliance forces flee to Kalimdor in hopes of finding the means to defeat the demons.\nHorde and Alliance forces unite against the Burning Legion. They empower the World Tree to destroy the demon Archimonde and defeat the Burning Legion. The surviving mortal forces establish new colonies on Kalimdor.\nPresent Time. One year after the Battle of Mount Hyjal, mortal races explore and settle the wild continent of Kalimdor. Increasing encounters with demons and undead suggest that the long years of battle are not over...\nThe Aftermath... and the Future.\nThough victory was theirs, the mortal races found themselves in a world shattered by war. The scourge and the Burning Legion had all but destroyed the civilizations of Lordaeron - and had almost finished the job in Kalimdor.\nThe orcs, led by Warchief Thrall, have found a new homeland on the continent of Kalimdor and spirit brothers in the races of the tauren who lent their aid in the climactic battle. The once unstoppable juggernaut of the Horde became a loose coalition of orcs, tauren, and others dedicated to survival and prosperity rather than conquest. Their peace was short lived, regrettably, when new Alliance forces arrived from Lordaeron some months later. The fleet was under the command of Grand Admiral Daelin Proudmoore - father of Jaina Proudmoore, a hero of the Second War, and a staunch enemy of the Horde."}

They create two caretaker races to watch over and help reshape the world. The &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; are placed in charge of maintaining the earth, while the &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s watch over the waters.\nAzeroth consists of a single, giant continent known as &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. At its center is the magical &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, placed by the titans as a source of restoring energy.\nBefore the titans depart, they empower &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to watch over Azeroth and protect it from anything that might threaten the tranquility of the world.\nA race of feral, nomadic humanoids is drawn to the Well of Eternity. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, they are transformed by its power and become strong, wise and virtually immortal. Unbeknownst to them, their transformation accidentally releases magic into the world.\nThe Kaldorei begin to actively study and practice &lt;a href=\"arcane%20magic\"&gt;arcane magic&lt;/a&gt;. They bend magic to their will and use it to build beautiful cities, craft artifacts and reshape the land. Some Kaldorei resist the lure to use the Well of Eternity's power and warn others of the dangers of abusing it. Their warnings go unheeded. \nA group of upper-class Kaldorei call themselves the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and revel in the use of magic.\nThe Highborne slowly descend into decadence, obsessed with using the Well of Eternity's magical energies.\nThe Highborne unwittingly attract the attention of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a race of magic-consuming &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s from another dimension. Unable to enter Azeroth's dimension physically without assistance, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the lord of the Burning Legion,\nbegins subtly to manipulate the Kaldorei nobles. \nThe Highborne open a portal deep within the Well of Eternity. This portal stretches between dimensions and forges a path from Sargeras to Azeroth.\nThe Burning Legion pours into Azeroth, led by two of Sargeras' most powerful lieutenants: &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20the%20Destructor\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;. The demons savagely assault the Kaldorei's unprepared civilization.\nThree young Kaldorei heroes approach the reclusive demi-god &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and request assistance. The three heroes are the brothers &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; Stormrage, and the priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. \nCenarius hears their pleas and calls the ancient &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s to defend Azeroth. \nThe Well of Eternity implodes in on itself, releasing a massive shockwave. With Sargeras' link to Azeroth destroyed, the Burning Legion is expelled from the world and hurled back to their dimension. \nThe seas rush in to fill the void left by the Well of Eternity and permanently split Kalimdor into several splinter continents. A furious, unending storm of elemental energy rages above the spot where the Well of Eternity once stood. It becomes known as the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllidan Stormrage secretly creates a new Well of Eternity using water that he had stolen from the original Well. Malfurion is enraged when he finds out and locks his brother away in an underground prison. \nThree of the most powerful dragons \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 create the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. Known as &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the tree grows to massive proportions and covers the new Well of Eternity, obscuring its existence.\nThe surviving Kaldorei, now known as &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, abandon the use of arcane magic. They exile themselves in seclusion around &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and the World Tree and begin practicing a safer form of divine &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalfurion exiles the last of the Highborne. The remaining Kaldorei weave a powerful enchantment and seal the borders of their lands in a protective mist.\nThe Highborne, now called &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, land on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and establish their new home. They call it &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe high elves create a new source of magical energy and call it the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; tribes band together in the face of frequent raids by the forest trolls and form the first human nation, &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. The high elves are also hard-pressed by the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s and enter into an alliance with Arathor, teaching humans the ways of arcane magic.\nHuman and high elf &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s convene and form a secret order called the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardians of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. The order's purpose is to empower a series of individuals to wage a secret, never-ending war against the Burning Legion.\nThe race of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; awakens and emerges from the expansive titan-created city of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, located deep beneath the earth. They call their new civilization &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe human nation of Arathor grows too large and shatters into seven independent splinter nations \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe current Guardian of Tirisfal, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, learns of a growing demon presence on the continent of Northrend. With the aid of dragons, Aegwynn tracks the demons down and defeats them. \nSargeras appears and challenges Aegwynn. Although she easily slays his physical form, Sargeras' spirit secretly enters Aegwynn's body and hibernates inside of her. \nAegwynn seals Sargeras' carcass in a hidden tomb, buried deep beneath the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nSargeras' second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, discovers another world ripe for conquest. The world is &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, homeland of the shamanistic &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the peaceful &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nKil'jaeden contacts one of the most powerful orc &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. Through quiet manipulations, Kil'jaeden starts to spread violence and savagery throughout the orc race.\nNer'zhul realizes the threat that Kil'jaeden poses and cuts off contact. Kil'jaeden quickly replaces him with Ner'zhul's most powerful apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan gathers the most powerful shamans in the orc &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s and teaches them how to communicate with spirits in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. A pact is formed between Guldan's followers and the dark forces of Kil'jaeden. Together, they create the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Shadow Council begins quietly infiltrating the highest political ranks in each of the orc clans. \nAegwynn decides to bear a child and pass the mantle of Guardian of Tirisfal to him. The spirit of Sargeras quietly infects her unborn son as he grows in her womb.\nGul'dan teaches the dark arts of demon magic to other orcs, turning shamans into &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and training them in necromancy.\nThe Shadow Council manipulates the clans into forming a single, unified &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan coerces its leaders into outlawing shamanism and installing his warlocks as key advisors. \nKil'jaeden dispatches the pit lord Mannoroth to Draenor in order to bind the orcs to his will. Chieftains from each of the twelve orc clans are tempted by his promise of power and drink from Mannoroth's blood, ensnaring themselves in the curse of bloodlust and initiating a slow corruption of their entire race.\nAegwynn's son &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; turns 14 and abruptly falls into a mysterious coma. Sargeras' presence perverts Medivh's mind and soul and bends them to his will.\nThe orcs give in to rage and attack their longtime neighbors \u2014 a peaceful race known as the draenei. Virtually unchallenged, the Horde easily defeats the vastly overmatched draenei.\nThe orcs track down the last organized forces of the draenei and finally conquer all of Draenor. The widespread practice of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; finally drains Draenor completely, leaving the land dead.\nWith no enemies left to fight, the orc clans fall into anarchy and begin waging war against each other.\nGul'dan begins to explore the Twisting Nether with a projection of his mind. He desperately searches for new worlds for the Horde to conquer. \nMedivh awakens from his coma-like state and finds himself a grown man.\nSargeras, working through Medivh, sends Gul'dan a series of visions, showing him images of a rich and fertile land ripe for conquest. The land in his visions is Azeroth. \nMedivh creates a small rift between Draenor and Azeroth. The rift is initially too small for even a single orc to pass through, but it grows slowly.\nOrc &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s enter the rift and begin exploring the lands on the other side. \nA small outpost is gradually constructed in the disease-ridden marshlands around the rift's exit point, providing a military foothold for the Horde in the new world. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;, the marshlands are completely uninhabited and provide perfect cover for the Horde's arrival.\nGul'dan manages to open a permanent rift between the two worlds. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; opens fully for the first time, allowing the orcish Horde to begin its assault on Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; begins. \nInitial battles do not go well for the Horde. Expecting an easy victory against a weak opponent, the Horde rushes to assault the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, only to suffer a defeat of catastrophic proportions. Few orcs survive the initial battle. \nGul'dan invokes shadow magic to enshroud the Black Morass in a blinding mist. The mist obscures the retreat of the last remaining orcs and prevents the human forces from pursuing them. \nThe Horde is humiliated by its unexpected rout, and the tribes swiftly descend into turmoil. Chaos ensues, with factions blaming each other for the Horde's defeat.\nGul'dan manipulates a ruthless dictator onto the throne of the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Known as &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, the new Warchief rallies the tribes back together again and prepares them for a new assault on Azeroth. \nMedivh sends Gul'dan another vision, teasing him with images of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the power it contains. \nThe Horde surges into Azeroth again, decimating towns and villages and plundering everything in its path. \n&lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; clan, is ambushed and slain by rival orcs. The &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s leave Durotan's infant son for dead, but the young orc is quickly discovered and saved by a band of humans under the command of &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;. The infant is taken as a slave and given the name &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; realizes Medivh's betrayal. He leads a small band of &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;-mounted warriors to Medivh's tower and confronts the wizard. \nLothar slays Medivh's body and destroys the spirit of Sargeras. Medivh's spirit escapes, however.\nBlackhand the Destroyer is betrayed and slain by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, a trusted general and close friend. Doomhammer replaces Blackhand as Warchief of the Horde. \nStormwind Keep falls before the full might of the Horde and is sacked. During the battle, &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; is slain by one of Gul'dan's assassins, the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpies loyal to Orgrim Doomhammer capture and torture Garona. In agony, she reveals the existence of the Shadow Council and directs them to the location of Gul'dan's warlocks near the ruins of Stormwind Keep.\nDoomhammer dispatches his elite &lt;a href=\"wolfrider\"&gt;wolfrider&lt;/a&gt;s to the ruins. They slay or execute most of Guldan's warlocks and disperse the remaining members of the Shadow Council. Gul'dan pleas for mercy and offers complete submission. Doomhammer accepts and grants him mercy. \nLord Anduin Lothar concedes that the Kingdom of Stormwind has been lost. He rallies his countrymen and leads them in a desperate retreat across the Great Sea, eventually landing upon the shores of\nLordaeron.\nThe First War ends. \nGul'dan uses his powers to raise an unholy legion of Stormwind's fallen &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s and names them &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Terenas\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron offers the refugees sanctuary and convenes an emergency council to discuss the invasion. Together, Lothar and Terenas convince the others to form an alliance between the seven human nations and the kingdoms of the dwarves and high elves. \nThe Horde brings &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; allies through the portal from Draenor and replenishes its depleted ranks. \nAfraid for the survival of his people, the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; coordinates an alliance between the forest trolls and the orcish Horde.\nSir &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; founds an order of holy defenders known as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Their purpose is to serve as a last line of defense against the Horde.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; begins. \nThe Horde pushes north, rolling through the continent of Khaz Modan and up into Lordaeron. The conflict is widespread and bloody, with large portions of Quel'Thalas destroyed by the Horde.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; makes a desperate stand and stalls the Horde's advance. The combined forces of humans, high elves and dwarves manage to rally and push the Horde back to the ruins of Stormwind Keep. Gul'dan, consumed by his thirst for personal power, secretly forges an agreement with a group of demons loyal to Sargeras. They agree to help Gul'dan locate their master's tomb.\nGul'dan searches for the Tomb of Sargeras and raises it from deep beneath the ocean. When Gul'dan enters the burial chamber, however, he accidentally releases a swarm of demons that kill him. The demons surge out of the Tomb of Sargeras and inflict great damage on the forces of the Horde. \n&lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient and powerful &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;, assumes the form of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Prestor\"&gt;Lord Prestor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a young human diplomat \u2014 and infiltrates the high council of the Alliance. Using subtle magic, the dragon ensnares the minds of the human leaders and forces them to grant him the title of king of Alterac.\nThe Alliance pushes the weakened and disorganized Horde all the way back to the Black Morass, where the Dark Portal is located. Lord Anduin Lothar is slain during the Alliance's final victory. The Dark Portal is shattered. The Second War ends.\nNer'zhul opens additional portals in Draenor and flees through one. The energies from the portals conflict and create a series of violent earthquakes and storms that tear Draenor apart in a catastrophic explosion. Its floating shards eventually become\nknown as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. \nKil'jaeden captures the fleeing Ner'zhul and irreversibly transforms him into the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, encasing him in a block of ice.\nUnder orders from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, the conclave of wizards that rules Dalaran, &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vareesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; free the imprisoned Dragonqueen, Alexstrasza. Three other dragon aspects \u2014 Ysera, Nozdormu, and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are also awakened. Together, the dragons manage to defeat Deathwing and force him to flee. \nBlackmoore begins instructing Thrall in how to fight. The young orc is a good student and quickly becomes an accomplished &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, he secretly learns to read and speak the language of men.\nKil'jaeden casts the Lich King's icy prison into Azeroth, followed by a legion of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; followers. It comes to rest on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, buried deep within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. \nNer'zhul corrupts the &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and directs him to begin spreading a disease across Lordaeron. Kel'Thuzad creates the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in his mission.\nThrall begins to fight in the slave pits as a &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt; and swiftly gains a reputation as a peerless warrior.\nThrall escapes from Blackmoore's control and begins to search for his lost heritage. He learns of the existence of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; clan \u2014 the only clan remaining that is undefeated by humans \u2014 and of its ferocious leader, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrall defeats a disguised Orgrim Doomhammer in combat and earns his respect. Doomhammer appoints Thrall as his second-in-command. \nThrall, Hellscream and Doomhammer combine forces to raid the internment camps and free their fellow orcs from captivity. Thrall convinces them to reform the Horde.\nOrgrim Doomhammer is slain in battle and Thrall becomes the next Warchief of the Horde. He turns his people from the practice of demon magic and reintroduces them to the abandoned shamanistic culture of their ancestors.\nKel'Thuzad's Cult of the Damned infects Lordaeron's farmlands with the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. Uther Lightbringer and his Knights of the Silver Hand try to stem the tide of the disease, but fail. \nPrince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; fears that the spread of the disease will tear the Alliance apart and eventually lead to the downfall of the entire human race. He tracks the source of the plague to Northrend and attempts to slay the Lich King. There, Arthas falls prey to a trap and loses his soul to the cursed blade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich King transforms Arthas into a death knight. He returns to Lordaeron, assassinates his father King Terenas, and takes charge of the undead forces.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; begins. \nKel'Thuzad seizes Medivh's spellbook from the city of Dalaran and uses it to summon forth the Burning Legion. Archimonde and his host of demons arrive in Dalaran.\nThe spirit of Medivh foresees the eventual downfall of Lordaeron and begins to manipulate events in order to arrange the formation of a last-ditch alliance between the mortal races on Kalimdor. \nGuided by a mysterious vision from Medivh, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; loads several ships and sets sail through the Maelstrom to the far-off continent of Kalimdor. Simultaneously, the Horde steals several human warships and also begins traveling to Kalimdor. \nThrall's ships land on a mysterious island chain in the Maelstrom and encounter a friendly tribe of &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Thrall helps the trolls to escape from their sinking island, and the trolls respond by joining the Horde. \nThe Maelstrom scatters the Horde's fleet. After regrouping on Kalimdor, the orcs encounter a race of wise giants known as &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall dispatches Grom Hellscream to lead a group of orcs north and begin collecting &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tauren lead Thrall to the lair of a mysterious Oracle, who turns out to be Medivh. Jaina Proudmoore is already there, and Medivh introduces her to Thrall. Medivh warns both of them about the coming of the Burning Legion. \nNight elf Sentinels respond violently to lumbergathering incursions by orcs into the forests of Ashenvale. The orcs, led by Grom Hellscream, respond in kind and engage in battle with the night elves. Cenarius intervenes and temporarily halts the Horde's advance.\nMannoroth deceives Grom into drinking from a corrupted well of demon blood. The power of &lt;a href=\"chaos\"&gt;chaos&lt;/a&gt; grants Grom and his followers incredible strength and near invulnerability. The orcs strike back and slay Cenarius.\nThe night elves awaken Malfurion and the rest of the slumbering &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. \nThe Burning Legion arrives in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, seeking the World Tree and the Well of Eternity that it guards.\nMalfurion and Tyrande free Illidan from his prison. Illidan consumes power from a demonic &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and then tracks down and slays Tichondrius. However, the artifact initiates a transformation in Illidan, irreversibly changing him into a demon. He is banished by Malfurion for his actions. \nThrall's orcs and Jaina's humans join forces with the night elves in a desperate attempt to defend Mount Hyjal from Archimonde's advance. However, the demon is too powerful and systematically destroys their forces. \nThe night elves sacrifice their immortality and imbue the World Tree with the spirits of their ancestors. The World Tree becomes empowered and lashes out at Archimonde with a wave of pure magical energy, destroying the demon and all of his forces.\nThe Third War ends. \nNow mortal and possessing only a fraction of their old powers, the night elves begin the process of rebuilding their society. \nThrall leads the orcs south to the deserts of central Kalimdor. They found a new homeland, called &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and begin constructing the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. \nJaina also travels south, sailing her people to the large, coastal island of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. There, the humans disband their fleet and construct a new city in which to live.\nIllidan awakens the amphibious race of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and bends them to his will. He journeys to the Tomb of Sargeras, following in Gul'dan's footsteps. Illidan manages to find an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllidan travels to Lordaeron and uses the Eye of Sargeras to open a portal to Outland in the ruined city of Dalaran. A band of night elf heroes ambushes Illidan and tries to take him captive. However, he dives through the open portal and escapes to Outland. \nThe remaining high elf forces gather under the leadership of Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. Craving magic, they follow Illidan through the portal to Outland.\nIn Outland, Kael and the high elves pledge allegiance to Illidan. Together, they seize control of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Citadel%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Black Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, a stronghold of the Burning Legion.\nArthas' undead forces reach the continent of Northrend and approach the Lich King's throne. However, Illidan's forces return from Outland and position themselves around the Lich King's tower before Arthas can reach it. \nArthas defeats Illidan in combat and dons the Lich King's crown, infusing his body with the spirit of Ner'zhul. \nStrange human forces begin to conduct raids against Orgrimmar's outlying villages. Thrall empowers a &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt;, half-orc &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the situation.\nRexxar sneaks into the human settlement on Theramore Isle and confronts Jaina about the recent attacks on orc territories. \n&lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina's father, arrives on Theramore with the remainder of the Kul Tiras navy and reveals himself as the force behind the recent attacks. \nAdmiral Proudmoore's troops land on Kalimdor and engage Thrall's Horde in a series of battles. The Kul Tiras marines lose badly and are forced to make a last stand on Theramore Isle. Jaina pleads with Thrall for mercy on the citizens of Theramore who are still loyal to her. \nThe Horde assaults Theramore Isle, slaughtering the Kul Tiras forces and killing Admiral Proudmoore. Thrall honors Jaina's request and orders the Horde to withdraw, leaving Theramore damaged and in flames but still standing.\nThe non-aggression pact in Kalimdor between the Horde and Theramore Isle is tenuous at best, and tempers still run hot over the recent conflict. Both humans and orcs begin to expand across Kalimdor, settling in whatever habitable locations they can find. \nLordaeron remains loosely controlled by the undead, although a civil war rages between Arthas' &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Demons roam freely across the continent, terrorizing what few human forces remain. Pockets of human &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s\nand dwarven warriors slowly gather in an attempt to regroup and initiate a counterattack.\nAlthough Azeroth has been battered by bloodshed and warfare for years, there is still no indication that the turmoil will soon come to an end. Each of the mortal races begins to position itself for what could soon become the most crucial period of time in the world's history.\nOther dates.\nOther dates given by Brann or within other documents, outside of the timeline."}

The &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; maintain the land; the &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s patrol the waters.\nThe Titans place the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the source of all magic on Azeroth, in the center of world's single continent, &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe powerful well of Eternity leaks magic into the community of &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; living nearby, evolving them enough to create the first great civilization. As the kaldorei investigate the Well, they release more magic into the world.\nThe Kaldorei begin to harness the power of the Well and practice arcane magic. They build an advanced civilization, creating powerful artifacts and even reshaping the land. Some Kaldorei sense that magic abuse is a significant problem and cease practicing. They remain the Kaldorei, while those who revel in the arcane arts dub themselves the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Kaldorei's warnings were true: Corruption comes to the Highborne in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a society of magic-consuming &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; from another dimension. The demons cannot enter Azeroth physically without assistance; so &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the lord of the Burning Legion, begins subtly to manipulate the wizards. He promises more power if the Highborne will open a portal. They do so, deep in the Well of Eternity, giving Sargeras free entry into Azeroth.\nThe Burning Legion invades Azeroth, determined to drain the Well and destroy the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; civilization.\n&lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; Stormrage, and the priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, lead the battle against the demons, destroying the Well of Eternity in the process. With the portal gone, the Burning Legion is banished from Azeroth; but the magical shockwave splits Kalimdor into several continents, creating a dangerous &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the sea.\nIllidan Stormrage, loathe to lose the arcane magic of the Well, creates a new Well of Eternity using water from the first Well. His enraged brother locks Illidan away in an underground prison.\nThree dragons \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 plant &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree, over the new Well, hiding it.\nThe surviving Kaldorei, now known as night elves, abandon the use of arcane magic. They seclude themselves near &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and the World Tree and begin practicing a safer form of divine nature magic. In the following years, they exile the arcane-addicted Highborne and enshroud Kalimdor in mist.\nAfter years of a nomadic lifestyle, the Highborne, now called high elves, establish their new home on &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. They call it &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, creating their own source of magical energy, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; tribes form the first human nation, &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. The high elves enter into an alliance with Arathor, teaching humans arcane magic.\nHuman and high elf wizards form a secret order called the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardians of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; awaken in the underground, Titan-created city of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. Unaware of their heritage, they call their new civilization &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, Guardian of Tirisfal, defeats a small group of demons with the help of dragons. During the battle, the demon Sargeras infects her body and lies in wait. Unaware of her corruption, she buries Sargeras' physical body under the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nSargeras' second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, begins to meddle with the orcs on the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. He corrupts the shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and begins to twist the peaceful &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; race into a violent and savage one.\nNer'zhul's eyes open to the damage done to his race, and he cuts contact with Kil'jaeden. The demon begins working on Ner'zhuls most powerful apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan soon creates the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, designed to give demonic spirits the bodies of orcs to create a mighty army.\nAegwyn decides to bear a child and make it the new Guardian of Tirisfal. Sargeras' hibernating spirit quietly infects the unborn son.\nUnder Gul'dan's tutelage, the orcs learn demonic magic, becoming warlocks and necromancers.\nThe orc clans unite as the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, a bloodthirsty and corrupted group. Shamanism is outlawed.\nAegwynn's son &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; falls into a coma on his 14th birthday. Sargeras' spirit begins to corrupt the boy.\nAfter conquering all races of Draenor and befouling the land with their dark magic, the Horde falls into anarchy and civil war.\nMedivh is now a grown man and fully owned by Sargeras. The demon sends Gul'dan visions, showing him images of ripe-for-the-conquering Azeroth. Medivh begins to forge the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; between Draenor and Azeroth. It is tiny, but it grows.\nOrc scouts enter the Portal and begin exploring for a settlement area. They construct a small outpost in the uninhabited marshlands known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe First War begins as Gul'dan forces Medivh's Portal wide enough for the Horde to pour through and begin its invasion. The initial battles prove the orcs unprepared for the strength of humans, and they are defeated repeatedly with few survivors. Gul'dan's magic shields the orc encampment from prying eyes so the Horde can regroup.\nGul'dan forces a new Warchief to power: &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;. This cruel leader encourages the orcs to regroup for a new assault. The &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; receives another vision, tempting him with the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nLord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; discovers Medivh's betrayal. He slays Medivh, also destroying the spirit of Sargeras. Medivh's spirit escapes and lives however.\nBlackhand the Destroyer is assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, who takes the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde. He leads the Horde to sack &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, Doomhammer's loyal spies capture one of Gul'dans assassins, &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;. They extract information from her concerning the Shadow Council. Gul'dan's warlocks are killed but he is granted mercy.\nThe humans concede the loss of Stormwind Keep and flee north to Lordaeron.\nThe &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; ends.\nGul'dan raises Stormwind's fallen soldiers and names them &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; form the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, vowing to defeat the orcs. Sir &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; founds an order of holy warriors known as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde brings more forces through the Dark Portal to replenish their army.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; begins as the Horde takes its new army \u2014 complete with their new allies, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;jungle trolls&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 north. They push into Lordaeron, destroying much of Quel'Thalas. The Alliance rallies and pushes the Horde back to Stormwind Keep.\nGul'dan, while trying to aid the Horde, is still obsessed with his own ambitions. He continues his search for Sargeras' tomb, entering a pact with demons loyal to the fallen &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;. He raises the Tomb from the ocean, freeing a swarm of demons trapped inside that kills him. They do considerable damage to the Horde forces as well, weakening them.\nThe Alliance pushes the disorganized Horde all the way back to the Dark Portal. Beloved Lord Anduin Lothar falls during the final battle, but the Dark Portal is shattered. Many of the orcs who remain in Azeroth are incarcerated in prison camps by the Alliance.\nThe Second War ends.\n&lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; accidentally tears Draenor apart in a catastrophic explosion by opening too many portals to other dimensions. The world's floating shards known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, now part of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; captures Ner'zhul and transforms him into the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, encasing him in the ice of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nNer'zhul, still powerful, corrupts the Archmage Kel'Thuzad and directs him to begin spreading a plague of undeath across Lordaeron. The wizard forms the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; to aid him.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; escapes from &lt;a href=\"Blackmoore\"&gt;Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; and searches for other orcs to teach him of his heritage. He hears of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; clan - the only free orc clan remaining - and its ferocious leader, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter joining with Orgrim Doomhammer and Hellscream, Thrall frees the captive orcs and reforms the Horde.\nDoomhammer is slain in battle and Thrall becomes Warchief of the Horde. He reintroduces his people to the abandoned shamanistic culture of their ancestors.\nThe Cult of the Damned infects Lordaeron with the Lich King's plague. The Knights of the Silver Hand try to cure the disease, but fail. &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron tracks the source of the plague to the Lich King in Northrend. He loses his soul to the cursed blade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the Lich King's servant as a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas returns to Lordaeron, assassinates &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, and takes charge of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Third%20War\"&gt;The Third War&lt;/a&gt; begins.\nKel'Thuzad, now a lich himself, summons forth the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and his host of demons arrive in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Fleeing the &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance and Horde forces both travel west to the forgotten continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedivh's spirit has attained form and seeks to aid the Alliance and Horde forces against the Burning Legion. He urges their leaders \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and Thrall \u2014 to unite, but they resist.\nThe Horde unwittingly offends the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; by gathering lumber, and the following battles push Grom Hellscream to drink demon blood for greater power. &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, an Ancient is slain in a subsequent battle; and the night elves awaken the sleeping druids, including &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Desperate for help, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; frees &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; from his prison. Illidan slays the demon responsible for corrupting Hellscream and his orcs, but is transformed into a demon in the process. Malfurion banishes him.\nThe now-desperate Alliance, Horde and night elves forces unite against the Burning Legion. Their final stand at the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; fails, but the night elves imbue the Tree with their immortality and all their power. The sheer glut of power rushes out of the tree and destroys Archimonde and his forces.\nThe Third War ends.\nThe night elves join the Alliance, recognizing the need for allies now that they are without their former power. Thrall and the Horde found a homeland in the desert of Kalimdor, naming it &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina leads the Alliance to an island off the coast of Kalimdor, founding the new home of the Alliance, called &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllidan, now obsessed with finding artifacts such as the one that transformed him, awakens the amphibious race of naga. He journeys to the Tomb of Sargeras and finds the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllidan opens a portal from Lordaeron to Outland and flees there with his allies.\nArthas and his Scourge travel to Northrend to investigate the Lich King's throne. Illidan's forces return from Outland and lie in wait for Arthas' undead. Arthas' forces win the ensuing battle; he takes the Lich King's crown, infusing his body with the spirit of Ner'zhul and becomes the true lord of the Scourge. Human forces begin to raid Durotar's small villages. Thrall sends scouts to investigate the situation.\n&lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina's father, arrives on Theramore with the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; navy. He lands on Kalimdor and engages the Horde in a series of battles. The Horde pushes the battle back to Theramore, killing Admiral Proudmoore but leaving Jaina and those loyal to her alive.\nPresent Time."}

Formed from the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt;, its member are both mortals and &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. They are led by their commander &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, the prime consort of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu the Timeless One&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; directly opposes the ideals of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the Timewalkers.\nBackground.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, timeways were in flux as &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; lost his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;' powers and no longer had control over them. On the other hand, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;s lost their ability to control the flow of time, but can still travel between the timelines. Consequently, the Timeless One stated that it was now the duty of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s races to deal with them, and the bronze dragons required mortal help to police the timeways. Together they allied to reform the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; as the Timewalkers.\nWhile the Timewalkers are ever vigilant against the threats beyond the timeline, it sometimes falls to heroes and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to safeguard it as well. A proper Timewalker will never leaves a temporal crisis half-resolved. To fulfill their duty, they may use the &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"%3ATimewalker%20Staff\"&gt;:Timewalker Staff&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument for manipulating time magic as shepherding the timeways is a dangerous work.\nHistory.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, a Watcher of the Timewalkers discovered a time anomaly has been discovered on a mysterious isle off the eastern coast of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Despite it being the most perilous place in all the continent, the Timewalkers were determined to unravel its mysteries. &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and the Timewalkers were sent to investigate the nature of the isle's behavior and why it became lost in time - literally disappearing and appearing in different periods of time, while the time itself holds no matter on the isle itself. As an agent of the Timewalkers, &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; met the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and gave them a &lt;a href=\"Curious%20Bronze%20Timepiece\"&gt;pocket watch&lt;/a&gt; which take them to the Timeless Isle.\nLegion.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers received an &lt;a href=\"A%20Slightly%20More%20Urgent%20Letter%20from%20the%20Timewalkers\"&gt;urgent letter&lt;/a&gt;, in order to respectively meet &lt;a href=\"Historian%20Llore\"&gt;Historian Llore&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Historian%20Ju%27pa\"&gt;Historian Ju'pa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and which also warned that they might experience temporal disturbances. The two agents then began asking questions, in order to reflect on the events that have brought them to this moment, as a celebration of the great history of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the events that shape it. Afterwards, they explained that they felt disturbances in the timeways, coincidentally located where &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; once roamed. Consequently, they sent the adventurers to investigate for the Timewalkers, and to put an end to the strange anomalies that take place at this time of the year.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurers were &lt;a href=\"Invitation%20from%20the%20Timewalkers\"&gt;cordially invited&lt;/a&gt; by the Timewalkers at a celebration hosted by the bronze dragonflight in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, in order to remember the past and celebrate their adventures across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nDragonflight.\nFollowing the reappearance of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a contingent of Timewalkers went to the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Conflux\"&gt;Temporal Conflux&lt;/a&gt;, the bronze flight's base in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; attacked the temple and tried to corrupt the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Oathstone\"&gt;Bronze Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;, in order to turn &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; into his dark alternate self &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, it caused the timeways to become chaotic. While they were trying to restore the stability of the timeline, the Timewalkers discovered that unstable temporal energy seeped into the &lt;a href=\"Flowing%20Forest\"&gt;Flowing Forest&lt;/a&gt;, causing its wildlife to become crazy and aggressive, thus agents were sent to assess the impact and collect that &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; for the organization. They notably placed &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Collector\"&gt;temporal collectors&lt;/a&gt;, trying to gather all the errant magic to use it as extra power, as the temporal crisis drained all their resources.\nHowever, many Timewalkers went to be missing, as they were caught in stasis bubbles by the Temporal Conflux's security measures, which were activated when Eternus tried to corrupt the Bronze Oathstone. Among them, &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Captain%20Sinjoirmi\"&gt;Warden Captain Sinjoirmi&lt;/a&gt; and her Wardens were also sealed by the temple doors, as the security protocols were activated. Consequently, Nozdormu sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to help &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andantenormu\"&gt;Andantenormu&lt;/a&gt; save all the Timewalkers, to defeat the assailants, and to fix the temporal anomalies.\nAfter repelling the attack, Chronormu ordered all Timewalkers present to help defeat Eternus. However, this was not enough and when Eternus attempted to complete her goal, Chronormu attacked and the collision of their time magics sent them into an uncontrolled tumble through time. Afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt; led the Timewalkers into the &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Tomorrow\"&gt;possible future where the Primalists won&lt;/a&gt; in order to find her and to hold their connection to that alternate timeline stable.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Areniel\"&gt;Archivist Areniel&lt;/a&gt;'s research team located the &lt;a href=\"Sand-Lost%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sand-Lost Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and were able to make out &lt;a href=\"Titan%20%28language%29\"&gt;titanic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s on the outside, which referred to &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; the Highfather. However, they triggered the sanctum's defenses during their work, and a massive &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Timekeeper\"&gt;sand amalgam&lt;/a&gt; tried to kill them. They sent adventurers to defeat the guardian and find what it was protecting, which ultimately turned out to be the &lt;a href=\"%3AEcho%20of%20Duty\"&gt;:Echo of Duty&lt;/a&gt;, a precious relic that belonged to Nozdormu.\nRanks.\nThe Timewalkers seem to have six main ranks among them:\nKnown members.\nIn the TCG.\n\"Almost all the following have unused NPC-IDs associated with them, but have yet to appear in the game.\"\nSpeculation.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; when fighting the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; uses a spell named \"Call of the Timewalker\", indicating that he may be a member of the Timewalkers."}

Timewalking difficulty scales down the character's power and gear relative to the dungeon. Loot obtained during this difficulty has the tag, which scales up to an item level appropriate for use at the player's level. Timewalking is available for characters level 60 and up and requires a minimum item level of 180.\nKilling bosses in timewalking dungeons will award &lt;a href=\"Timewarped%20Badge\"&gt;Timewarped Badge&lt;/a&gt;s which can be traded for valuable items at the timewalking vendors.\nTimewalking dungeons.\nThe following dungeons are currently enabled for the Timewalking difficulty in \"\".\nBonus Events.\nThere are six different Timewalking &lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Event\"&gt;Bonus Event&lt;/a&gt;s: One for content from each expansion from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" through \"\". When one of these events is active, a &lt;a href=\"Weekend%20Event\"&gt;Weekend Event&lt;/a&gt; quest to complete five timewalking dungeons will also be available.\nBackground.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; a metaplot was started to be introduced in the Timewalking events:\nHistory.\nBlizzard announced in May 2014 that they were working on a way for higher-level players to tackle lower-level dungeon and raid content, with abilities and gear scaled down to an appropriate level. Likely using the same technology used for &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Proving%20Grounds\"&gt;Proving Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, and scaled &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, Timewalker mode would allow players to experience older dungeons and raids at a challenging level.\nThe underlying system was largely implemented with &lt;a href=\"patch%205.4.0\"&gt;patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt; in September 2013, but was not yet accessible to players. However, some players have previously been able to access the mode through a bug in certain dungeons, allowing them to experience an incomplete version of the feature. \nThe plan is to initially introduce the feature for dungeons only.\nPrior to the release of the official \"Timewalking\" name, the title \"Timewalker\" came primarily from game data listing this title as an additional category of instance. Due to the background addition of the new feature around the same time, as well as this obviously being a very fitting title for the new mode, the term has been widely adopted by players to refer to the planned feature.\nOriginal levels.\nBefore the level changes introduced in , timewalking for ' content was available for characters level 71 and up; ' for level 81 and up; \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" for level 85 and up; \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" for level 91 and up; and \"\" for level 101 and up."}

However, Timolain had created a &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt;, which eventually allowed him to resurrect as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe mage Timolain took up residency in &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; after he was commissioned by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to create powerful bows and guns to fight the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. He once visited &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and gave him a copy of &lt;a href=\"A%20Complete%20Copy%20of%20%22Nat%20Pagle%27s%20Guide%20to%20Extreme%20Anglin%27.%22\"&gt;A Complete Copy of \"Nat Pagle's Guide to Extreme Anglin'.\"&lt;/a&gt;. While there, he beseeched the prince for help, saying that he needed to fight fire with fire. When Timolain left, Tortheldrin presumed he went back to his allies.\nRumor says that the Scarlet Crusade killed him either while he was working on a remarkable weapon or after he had completed it. Two possible reasons for his murder were speculated: either the Crusade was just that distrustful of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, or he was killed to cover up evidence of his work.\nIn truth, Timolain had turned to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; and created a &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;dark crystal&lt;/a&gt;, a counterpart of the holy artifact that fuels the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Before he could put it into a blade, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Isillien&lt;/a&gt; fed Timolain to a &lt;a href=\"Large%20Vile%20Slime\"&gt;vile slime&lt;/a&gt;. During his long and excruciating demise within the slime, Timolain used his necromantic powers to bind himself to a phylactery and threw the crystal into the &lt;a href=\"Thondroril%20River\"&gt;Thondroril River&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the slime was killed by the new &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Timolain to revive from his &lt;a href=\"Timolain%27s%20Phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt;. With Timolain's help, the Highlord found and reclaimed the crystal.\nQuotes.\nYou will find no fight here, paladin. I can do you no harm, and bear no allegiance to the dark creatures you seek to destroy.\nI suspect you know. We would not be meeting otherwise.\nMy story is simple. The &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;original wielder&lt;/a&gt; of your blade proved unable to stand against the endless throngs of undead that threatened our world.\nI sought a different approach... one that could not fail.\nI devised a way to fight the &lt;a href=\"scourge\"&gt;scourge&lt;/a&gt; using their own magic against them. It was a simple process, really - I had a veritable river of souls at my disposable from the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s rampage.\nIn the end, I created a counterpart to the holy relic that fuels the Ashbringer's strength, but before I could properly seat it within a suitable blade I was found out by Isillen and his dogs.\nThe rest, as they say, was excruciatingly painful.\nBefore I was devoured ever so slowly I did two things.\nThe first, as should be obvious, was putting my necromantic learnings to the test, sealing my soul within the phylactery you found. It did nothing for the pain of death... but it has served its purpose.\nAfterward, as I was already half-consumed by the creature, I hurled the crystal into the river beside you in hopes that someone might still put it to use against the forces of darkness.\n&lt;The lich's face contorts into something of a smile.&gt;\nIf you seek it, you will find it there."}

The creators of incredible inventions, from crazy multipurpose knives to steam saws to siege engines, their devices allow them to overcome nearly any situation \u2014 and if they don't have the device they need, they just might be able to design and create a new one on the spot. Tinkers have a reputation for being dangerous companions, born mainly of reckless goblins experimenting with explosives. However, tinkers are not usually danger-prone. The real problem arises when they mess with gunpowder or try to build a better steam engine, and even then mishaps and explosions do not occur as often as many believe. However, the true heart of the tinker profession can be found in the steady craftsmanship of the dwarves and the wild-eyed curiosity of the gnomes. As tinkers begin to spread to all the races of Azeroth, the idea of the \"typical tinker\" may continue to change, but inventiveness and intelligence will always be an important part. Tinkers are most commonly found among the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s as they produce &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;rifle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s, and other technological innovations currently found on Azeroth. With their general disinterest in &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, night elves, orcs and tauren are the least likely to be tinkers.\nEpic tinker.\nCapable of building anything from peashooters to dreadnoughts, the epic tinkers craft spans the border between science and the fantastic. They have mastered innumerable disciplines and can create weapons of mass destruction from &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt;, dead leaves, and earwigs. Despite their eminence, they constantly drive themselves to ever-greater exploits. They continue to improve his technological prowess. They boost their skill at crafting technological devices and their ability to use technological devices, as well as any other craft and knowledge skills he finds useful. Defensive feats keep them alive while they aim their &lt;a href=\"Koala-zooka\"&gt;Koala-zooka&lt;/a&gt;.\nTinkers by race.\nGnome tinkers.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s are the Alliance's consummate tinkers. When a member of the Alliance thinks of a tinker, he thinks of a gnome; and when he thinks of a gnome, he thinks of a tinker. Gnomes are in a competition with goblins to produce the best and deadliest technology \u2014 a competition that is friendly or fierce, depending on the individuals involved. Gnomish technology is not quite as prone to malfunction as goblin technology, and gnomes tend to produce devices that have more specialized and unusual effects. Goblins make goblin rockets and shredders \u2014 fairly straightforward \u2014 while gnomes create gnomish shrink rays and universal remotes. The iconic gnome tinker is a mad &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;inventor&lt;/a&gt;, wearing goggles on her head as well as over her eyes, with a bandolier of equipment slung over each shoulder; she is covered with oil and scorch marks, looking forward to the next invention. Many find gnome tinkers amusing, but only a few do not also respect or fear them.\nGoblin tinkers.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s are mad inventors who produce useful gadgets despite their chaotic, crazed, and explosively-oriented mindsets. They are the ultimate &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s, competing with &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s to produce the best devices around. This competition is friendly or deadly, depending on the individuals involved \u2014 sometimes it's both. Goblin tinkers differ from their &lt;a href=\"Gnome%20tinker\"&gt;gnomish counterparts&lt;/a&gt;. Goblins enjoy instant gratification. They work on an invention until it sort of, kind of functions, then they move on to another one. They get a thrill when they finish something, even if \"finishing\" means that it works properly one out of ten times.\nGoblin tinkers also have a penchant for destructive devices. They like blowing things up and tearing them down. Thus, goblins make rockets, bombs, shredders, flamethrowers and similar devices. Even their creations that aren't directly related to warfare and flagrant environmental abuse have a tendency to explode terrifically when they malfunction. Early goblin &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s, while quite stable, functioned by using open flames to warm flammable gas \u2014 not a combination to inspire confidence in passengers. Though goblin tinkers amuse many, they do so only at a distance; those nearby eye the tinker with expressions of mixed incredulity and fear.\nThe iconic goblin inventor grins madly through a leather cap and soot-covered goggles. Devices of all sorts are strapped across his body, many of which look broken. He brandishes\u2026 something\u2026 to threaten his opponents. Goblin tinkers can speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;."}

With his Claw-Pack/Hammer-Tank combo, the Tinker's ingenuity is undeniable. Though his parts may sometimes fail and the occasional explosion does occur, the spirit and enthusiasm of this Hero are never diminished. There truly is more to the Goblin Tinker than meets the eye!\nHero names.\nGazz Stripbolt, Riket Contraption, Mekka Gobb, Tek Piecetinker, Plug Rattletrap, &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle\"&gt;Ratso Steamwheedle&lt;/a&gt;.\nInformation.\nThe Tinker is a melee hero, and the only melee one with Intelligence as the primary attribute (&lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Elder%20Sage\"&gt;Draenei Elder Sage&lt;/a&gt;s are also melee and Intelligence-based, but the only one is only present in the campaign levels). While able to create great damage, the Tinker's potential lies in disrupting enemy forces with stuns, unsuspected damage, and guerrilla warfare. He is usually considered a good Hero versus ranged-based armies, such as against Night Elves.\nA suggested strategy is either choosing Pocket Factory or the Cluster Rockets, and improve it. The Factory provides some defense (especially against creeps, because they'll get more than one target to focus on) and good damage while the Rockets provide some &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;-damage and a small stun, which is good for preventing hostile spells and attacks. Pocket Factory is often considered a better spell than the Cluster Rockets. The Engineering Upgrade will boost whatever other skill you've chosen, along with boosting the Tinker's damage and movement speed. This speed is very nifty for chasing and escaping, and gives you a great hit-and-run strategy on enemy bases when combined with Robo-Goblin.\nWhile able to make a lot of trouble and distractions, the Tinker is somewhat fragile (at least \"before\" he transforms into a Robo-Goblin). Your best shot of downing him is to ignore his clockwerk goblins (or crush the factory, if you have enough time) and all-out nuke him with whatever you got. You are likely to suffer casualities, but at least the Tinker bites the dust as well.\nSpells and abilities.\nPocket actory.\nNotes: Pocket Factory's Clockwerk Goblin production time with Engineering Upgrade bonuses:\nThis spell is very nifty because of its high damage potential. Not only do the Clockwerk Goblins explode, they will also use small wrenches to first bash away at their opponents with. At high levels, damage done by Clockwerk Goblins is great. Their Kaboom-ability deals full damage to buildings (80\u00a0hp every goblin) and they are created every 3 seconds. A Goblin Tinker in Robo-Goblin form using Pocket Factories destroys enemy buildings really fast.\nWhen you summon a factory among creeps, the first goblin is finished a few seconds later. When you are facing really strong creeps (some orange and red camps), factory could be destroyed before goblins appears. To solve this, problem, attack at night or divert enemy's attention to the Goblin Tinker or other units. Remember, that factory is not a fighting unit, so it's a secondary target and will be only autoattacked if there are not other harmfull threats nearby.\nFactory placement: Clockwerk Goblins leave the factory by the door. It might be useful to focus Goblins on one monster and force other creeps to make long walks round the building to reach those small and innocent-like Goblins.\nThe Engineering upgrade is a great help for Pocket Factory. Clockwerk Goblins are created much faster and allows Goblin Tinker to beat orange and red creep camps alone, using only pocket factories.\nThe Pocket Factory could be used to block paths. A clever Goblin Tinker could use that to circle or protect units.\nAnother good tactical use of Pocket Factory is to disrupt ranged enemy lines. Summon a factory among enemy units, and low life Archers, Headhunters, Mortar Team, Shaman will be ripped off. Remember, Goblins blow up on death so no matter if they are killed instantly when appear, nearby foes receive damage. TheFactory will not be attacked (it's not a primary target) and Goblins will do more and more damage. This strategy is also good on workers.\nAnother important thing about the Pocket Factory is that goblins don't give experience at all (and the building itself gives very little).\nAs with all buildings, simply destroying it will prevent any more damage.\nCluster ockets.\nNotes: Cluster Rockets area damage radius with Engineering Upgrade bonuses:\nRockets have a big area of effect, bigger than Blizzard or Flame Strike. That area further increases with the Engineering upgrade. Damage is low, especially at first level (35\u00a0hp really seem a joke) but there isn't any limit to the number of units affected. At level 3, 100 damage is more respectable and with it's low cooldown and cost, can be repeatedly used.\nCluster Rockets will stun everybody in a big area, not just the one you are targeting. This is often the spell's most useful attribute.\nSimilarly, rockets can be used also to break focuses. Launch them and then move your units when enemy is stunned. This permits the Goblin Tinker to redeploy his troops.\nRockets do full damage to buildings. Some players tend to put burrows or farms together, often in order to make a shield around important buildings. This, like most offensive AoE spells, is perfect to use on such piles. A combination of cluster rockets, Clockwerk Goblins and demolish can wreck an enemy base really fast.\nngineering Upgrade (Passive).\nSpeed increase is probably the most important bonus of Engineering. The Goblin Tinker is small and rarely get struck by other units or buildings. Wearing boots of speed and using engineering speed boost, makes him a very fast and agile hero, capable of chasing damaged enemies and retreating when needed.\nRoo-Goblin (Ultimate).\nNotes:\n&lt;tabber&gt;\nLevel 0=\nLevel 1=\nLevel 2=\nLevel 3=\n&lt;/tabber&gt;\nAs a mechanical unit, the Robo Goblin is similar to a building. Most spells doesn't work on him, and you can even use workers to repair him.\nBeing immune to spells such as Frost Nova, Death Coil, Storm Bolt, etc, he is good against any nuking-strategies your opponents may be using.\nOne of his specialities is storming enemy bases solo. Towers and other buildings are destroyed fast and when the enemy tries to come back, he can simply run away or use Staff of Teleportation (which is almost impossible to interrupt, as no stuns work on the Goblin Tinker) to return home.\nThe Tinker can switch between his Robo-Goblin form and tinker form whenever he want, given he has enough mana (25). This is very nifty for when you want to heal him with spells such as &lt;a href=\"Paladin_%28Warcraft_III%29%23Holy_Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shadow_Hunter_%28Warcraft_III%29%23Healing_Wave\"&gt;Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Robo-Goblin's weakness is that he cannot be healed by friendly spells. If you focus your attacks on him, you might be able to kill him before he reverts into his organic form so he can be healed.\nApril Fools' joke.\nOn April 1, 2004 &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt; announced the goblin tinker as a new neutral hero, that would be available in the next patch. A day later, Blizzard revealed that the tinker was merely an April Fools\u2019 joke. However, the tinker became subject to many forum posts and petitions that wanted the tinker to be a playable hero. On April 14, Blizzard announced the tinker to be added in patch 1.15."}

The group broke away from Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and ruler of the blood elven &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;, and offered to assist the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; in rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. They are at odds with the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt;, and compete with them for power within Shattrath and for the naaru's favor. Nowadays, the Scryers are notable for having the largest library out there, housing the \"greatest repository of lore in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;\".\nCharacters may join the Scryers by completing the &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20to%20the%20Scryers\"&gt;Allegiance to the Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, thereby becoming with the Scryers and with the Aldor.\nAs of the events of \"Warlords of Draenor\", Scryers still answer to the naaru first and foremost.\nLore.\n\"From the article \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/reputation.html%23BC\"&gt;Aldors and Scryers&lt;/a&gt;\", found at the World of Warcraft website:\nThis time, the attack [on Shattrath City] came from the armies of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. A large regiment of blood elves had been sent by Illidan's ally, Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider, to lay waste to the city. As the regiment of blood elves crossed the bridge, the Aldor's exarchs and vindicators lined up to defend the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt;. Then the unexpected happened: the blood elves laid down their weapons in front of the city's defenders. Their leader, a blood elf elder known as Voren'thal, stormed into the Terrace of Light and demanded to speak to the naaru &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;. As the naaru approached him, Voren\u2019thal knelt and uttered the following words: \"I've seen you in a vision, naaru. My race's only hope for survival lies with you. My followers and I are here to serve you.\"\nThe defection of Voren'thal and his followers was the largest loss ever incurred by Kael'thas' forces. Nor were these just any blood elves. Many of the strongest and brightest amongst Kael'thas' scholars and &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; had been swayed by Voren'thal's influence. The naaru accepted the defectors, who became known as the Scryers.\"\nHowever, the Aldor cannot forget the deeds that the Scryers committed while they were still under Kael'thas' command. Indeed, many of the Aldor had been slain by the same magisters who now serve the naaru. The Aldor are therefore deeply unhappy at sharing the city with their former enemies.\nAs the forces of the Alliance and Horde began pouring into Outland, Kael'thas and his followers originally accepted the new blood elven pilgrims. However, these new arrivals were given menial tasks and treated little better than slaves, until the Scryers discovered that Kael'thas had entered into an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through the revelations of &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; deserters. Despite this revelation some other elves still decided to join their prince, prompting a recruitment war between Kael's forces and the Scryers.\nServices.\nThe Scryers offer a variety of services to those who swear allegiance to their cause, including an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; and various &lt;a href=\"vendors\"&gt;vendors&lt;/a&gt;. Their most notable services, however, are their &lt;a href=\"Master\"&gt;Master&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Master\"&gt;Grand Master&lt;/a&gt; Enchanter &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt;s, the availability of whom allows aspiring enchanters to attain mastery over the &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; without entering &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, enchanters need not ally themselves with the Scryers simply to train as masters: the Scryer Enchanting trainers teach nothing that is not available through other trainers located in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\n&lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; gains with the Scryers correspond with a 10% greater loss of reputation with the Aldor, and often result in gains with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;. Blood elves who have not yet pledged allegiance to either the Aldor and Scryers will automatically begin as with the Scryers and with the Aldor. However, blood elves may choose to side with the Aldor once the opportunity presents itself, and are not banned from doing so simply because of their race.\nUntil Honored.\nTurning in ten to in &lt;a href=\"Scryer%27s%20Tier\"&gt;Scryer's Tier&lt;/a&gt; will grant +250 reputation with the Scryers. There is also a repeatable quest, &lt;a href=\"Single%20Firewing%20Signet\"&gt;Single Firewing Signet&lt;/a&gt;, which yields +25 reputation for each Signet ring turned in. These Signets drop from low-ranking &lt;a href=\"Firewing\"&gt;Firewing&lt;/a&gt; members found at Firewing Point Northeast of Shattrath City. Once reaching status, however, the Firewing Signet quests becomes unavailable. If no other reputation quests are done, 240 signets are required to go from to , or 360 signets from to .\nIt is possible to submit Firewing Signets to gain rep more than is needed to obtain Honored. For example, if you are 25 rep points away from Honored, you can submit 10 signets and be 225 points into Honored. Once Honored, however, you can no longer submit Firewing Signets for rep.\nUntil Exalted.\nAt level 68, characters may start turning in . These drop from high-ranking members of the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury Clan&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., blood elf &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; level 66 and higher). Although it is possible to turn in Sunfury Signets upon reaching status, it is recommended that one save these items until attaining status. For every ten Signets, characters will gain +250 reputation. Upon reaching it will take approximately 1,320 Sunfury Signets to reach if reputation from no other source is earned.\nArcane Tomes.\n may be turned in at any time to Voren'thal the Seer inside the &lt;a href=\"Seer%27s%20Library\"&gt;Seer's Library&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Scryer%27s%20Tier\"&gt;Scryer's Tier&lt;/a&gt;. This yields +350 reputation per turn-in, plus , a form of currency used to purchase shoulder enchants at the Scryer's bank. As with Sunfury Signets, it is possible to turn in the Arcane Tomes before reaching , but for the same reasons it is recommended that characters save them until after attaining that status. Upon reaching it will take approximately 95 Arcane Tomes to go from to if reputation from no other source is earned. \nSwitching to Scryers.\nIt is possible to defect from the Aldor to the Scryers, though doing so destroys all reputation progress previously made with the Aldor. Players seeking to switch factions must find , a Scryer located in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;. She offers the repeatable quest &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%27s%20Visions\"&gt;Voren'thal's Visions&lt;/a&gt;, which requires characters to turn in eight . This quest yields +250 reputation with the Scryers and -275 reputation with the Aldor per turn-in, and also provides +125 reputation with the Sha'tar if one is not yet with that faction. Voren'thal's Visions may be repeated until status is attained, at which time it becomes unavailable. \nAssuming one is with the Aldor and by the Scryers, it will take 168 turn-ins, or 1,344 individual Dampscale Basilisk Eyes, to reach status with the Scryers. Upon hitting status with the Scryers, one's reputation with the Aldor should have deteriorated almost halfway into .\nRewards.\n and are reputation vendors who sell specialized &lt;a href=\"Flasks\"&gt;Flasks&lt;/a&gt; only usable in &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; zones to characters who are with the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, the Sha'tar and the respective Scryer or Aldor faction. The flasks are only purchasable with &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20the%20Illidari\"&gt;Mark of the Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, obtained from creatures in &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye\"&gt;The Eye&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following Scryer reputation rewards can be purchased from in the Scryer Bank in southeast Shattrath City:\nThe following Scryer &lt;a href=\"Augments%23Inscriptions\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt; reputation rewards can be purchased from in the Scryer Bank in southeast Shattrath City:\nThe epic pendants sold by Shattered Sun Offensive quartermaster Eldara Dawnrunner in Isle of Quel'danas have procs that only trigger when at exalted reputation with Aldor or Scryer. What procs exactly depends on the neckpiece and which faction you have chosen.\nQuests.\nIf one has not yet chosen either the Aldor or the Scryers, complete &lt;a href=\"A%27dal%20%28quest%29\"&gt;A'dal (quest)&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"City%20of%20Light%20%28quest%29\"&gt;City of Light (quest)&lt;/a&gt;. Completing these two quests will lead to two new quests, one to become with the Scryers, the other for the Aldor. Choose carefully! Even though characters can switch between factions as described above, it will take time.\nPreviously, if you were a blood elf, you would not have the A'dal quest available, but would instead get:\nNow, however, s give you &lt;a href=\"A%27dal%20%28quest%29\"&gt;A'dal (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nShattrath City.\nRepeatable quests\nNetherstorm.\nThere are many quests for the Scryers concerning disrupting Sunfury operations and shutting down the &lt;a href=\"manaforge\"&gt;manaforge&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. These quests can be obtained at &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt; upon achieving status. Also, on the Scryer Tier in Shattrath City characters can talk to Arcanist Savan who will provide the feeder quest &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20Spymaster%20Thalodien\"&gt;Report to Spymaster Thalodien&lt;/a&gt; to talk to &lt;a href=\"Spymaster%20Thalodien\"&gt;Spymaster Thalodien&lt;/a&gt; in Area 52.\nShadowmoon Valley.\nThere are also several Scryer quest chains (and a Scryer only Flight Path) at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Stars\"&gt;Sanctum of the Stars&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. These quests require a reputation."}

Ralaar and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; sought to temper the uncontrollable rage inherent in the druid &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt; by willingly submitting to the energies of the Scythe of Elune. Rather than abate the druids\u2019 fury, however, the weapon transformed Ralaar and his followers into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;: bestial humanoids enslaved by their own primal instincts. Driven to anger by Malfurion's mockery, Ralaar\u2019s druids tore through elf and demon alike during the resulting battle. Night elves bitten by the unruly beasts contracted &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;a virulent curse&lt;/a&gt; that turned them into worgen as well.\nDesperate to stanch the affliction's spread, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; mournfully banished the worgen beneath &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; within the Emerald Dream, where they would be in peaceful slumber for all eternity. The Scythe was then entrusted secretly to &lt;a href=\"Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt; and then forgotten.\nVelinde Starsong.\n&lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt;, the niece of Mel'Thandris, was sent to cleanse Ashenvale of demons after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and prayed to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; for aid on her task. She prayed and prayed as she sought out an answer, and was eventually led to a book in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, set there by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; to expose the mistakes of Malfurion Stormrage, that explained the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt; and the Scythe of Elune. Velinde made way to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Shrine of Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt;, where she discovered the Scythe of Elune hidden away. The weapon had the power to weaken the barriers of time and space, and holding the scythe in her hands, she received a vision of chaos. Wolf-men, the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, fought savagely, as fit their primitive race, but they faced an unflinching enemy: the satyrs known as the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20the%20Emerald%20Flame\"&gt;Lords of the Emerald Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was then that Velinde realized the true power of the scythe. By focusing on it, she was able to communicate with the worgen. However, it was not speech she used to contact them. The worgen heard and understood her. By further channeling the energy of the scythe, the barriers weakened more, and she was able to draw the worgen to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. She summoned a score and a half. The worgen followed her into battle and, with their brutish strength at her command, they tore into the demons of Felwood. Later, she noticed, that though she had not summoned additional worgen, their numbers continued to increase. It was as though the scythe no longer required her intervention for the summoning process.\nVelinde heard that the archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; had also summoned worgen. She traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; to meet with him, hoping he could provide help. In &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, Velinde was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Varkas\"&gt;Varkas&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;. A case of dynamite exploded during the struggle, killing Velinde, Varkas, and his three minions, and trapping the Scythe within the cave. &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; would find it some time later, releasing the worgen into Duskwood.\nThe dark &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morganth\"&gt;Morganth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; were known to be searching for it. Ralaar Fangfire, now called Alpha Prime, was one of the worgen summoned by Arugal. Alpha Prime also sought the Scythe of Elune and created the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; to find it so he could free the rest of the imprisoned worgen and attack Darnassus.\nDuskwood.\nWhile pursuing the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; in Duskwood, the party of &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; came upon Jitters hiding in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Jitters told them that the Scythe had been rediscovered at Roland's Doom, and that the Dark Riders were seeking it. It appeared, however, that the Wolf Cult had got to the Scythe first, and were using it to perform dark initiation rituals. Having slaughtered the members of the cult, Revil liberated the Scythe from the mine. At the behest of &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt;, an agent of sent to retrieve the artifacts that the Riders had stolen, Revil used the Scythe to lure the Dark Riders into an ambush.\nThe Scythe later passed into the hands of Brink, who intended to deliver the Scythe to an unnamed night elf, most likely &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt;.\nGilneas.\n&lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt; brought the Scythe to his fellow night elves in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; mere days after its liberation from Duskwood. It was stored safely in the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;, but temporarily stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; until a worgen &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; retrieved it. Belysra Starbreeze attempted to use the Scythe to banish Alpha Prime and his &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; back into the Emerald Dream, but Alpha Prime was instead killed by the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAfter the events in Gilneas, the Scythe was returned to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, but was later approved by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to be delivered to the druids of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;. Belysra and Valorn thus traveled with the Scythe of Elune to Duskwood to further their studies of the worgen. and to meet with the new Archdruid of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;. On orders from Tyrande, they brought it to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; in Duskwood to give it to the druid &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. When the druid arrived via the Emerald Dream, however, Valorn was quickly attacked by &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt; and the Scythe was stolen, putting it in the Dark Riders' hands at last. As Belysra stayed with Valorn, the druid met with &lt;a href=\"Revil\"&gt;Revil&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Manor Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; and worked alongside him to retrieve the Scythe from the Riders at &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; plunged his sword into Azeroth, the Scythe of Elune's power (along with that of all \"Legion\" artifacts) was completely drained to neutralize .\nQuotes.\nThe quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Howling%20Vale%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Howling Vale&lt;/a&gt; sends adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Vale\"&gt;ruined shrine of Mel'thandris&lt;/a&gt; to discover the origins of the 'mysterious wolf-men' who have overtaken the area. Upon viewing the tome of &lt;a href=\"Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt;, you see a vision of &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; pleading with Elune and presumably being granted a scythe.\n\"The numbers of my companions dwindles, goddess, and my own power shall soon be insufficient to hold back the demons of Felwood. Goddess, grant me the power to overcome my enemies! Hear me, please, my need is desperate and cause is just! What... what is this? Could this be the answer to my prayers? Elune has granted me a weapon--this scythe--to defeat the demons.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Jitters%27%20Completed%20Journal\"&gt;Jitters' Completed Journal&lt;/a&gt; contains a passage about the events immediately following the re-discovering of the Scythe of Elune. The unfortunate people there to witness it were afflicted by a strange phenomenon: \n\"After the Scythe was freed, a change rippled through the mine. Light from our flickering torches warped, and the strength of our voices seemed beyond our control. Sometimes a man's whisper roared through the tunnels forcing hands on ears, and sometimes our shouts barely travelled a few steps before diminishing into a hint on the wind.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Choose the right moment to use it, as most melee classes can counter it with non-melee-based attacks: paladins can stun you with &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, druids can root you with &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;Entangling Roots&lt;/a&gt;, Outlaw and Subtlety rogues can use &lt;a href=\"Blind\"&gt;Blind&lt;/a&gt;, etc. At higher levels you can benefit from either &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, but keep this in mind anyway.\nIn any melee situation, it will significantly lessen the damage you're taking.\nUsing Evasion during certain raid encounters can be key to your raid's success.\nIf your tank dies when the &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; is almost dead, Evasion may be a lifesaver. Pop Evasion as soon as you see that the boss targeted you.

It was originally announced in the White Wolf forums as an \"\"official\" \"wink wink\"\" (translated: \"non-official\", a \"fan supplement\", or \"netbook) pdf, with updated downloadable content, with material written by rpg fan community and by writer/developer Adam Loyd (MagusRogue). It is being written without the authorization by Blizzard but apparently the \"blessing of the head of the line\" at White Wolf. \nIt is fan followup to the official sourcebooks; \"&lt;a href=\"Magic%20and%20Mayhem\"&gt;Magic and Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"More%20Magic%20and%20Mayhem\"&gt;More Magic and Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;\".

Also updated are the few pre-BC abilities and spells from the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". Two adventures were to be included. \nThe announcement of the book was by MagusRogue.

On the 1st of August 2010, this beta version was updated, with some (but not all) of the reported errors removed. The webmaster of the site is asking for more volunteers to download and proofread the beta version, to help eliminate more errors."}

An event of this kind is defined, with &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;one exception&lt;/a&gt;, by being only available in the game at certain times and not others, ranging from several times a day, to annually, to one-time historical happenings never to be seen again. Below are some of the events, which are fun if you ever get around to them.\nTypes of environment changes accompanying events include:\nOngoing events.\nOver the course of Azeroth's troubled history, the times of celebration have fallen under the shadow of the conflicts that have shaped and scarred the world. Every day, as new challenges surface, new champions answer the call to arms, relishing the glory and the rewards of battles well fought. Below are details of some of the current disturbances warranting investigation - and participation - by the world's most adventurous heroes.\nSeasonal events.\nTo help offset the strain and tension of constant warfare, the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; occasionally organize full-blown festivities for their people, centered around holidays and special events. What better way to celebrate the year's victories and other achievements than in the company of a few thousand of your closest allies?\nMicro-holidays.\nFirst introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.1.5\"&gt;patch 7.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, these new \"micro-holiday\" events offer brief holiday-style activities for players to take part in. Unlike the larger holidays like Hallow's End, which run for weeks, these micro-holidays usually only last a day or two, and often involve specific events taking place in the world or celebrate important moments in Azeroth's history. These micro-holidays are only meant for fun and therefore do not offer any significant rewards like permanent pets or mounts, but can still provide some variety and opportunities for hijinks, as well as breathing new life into some of the more static parts of the game world.\nUnique events.\nA number of one-time-only World Events have occurred throughout the game's history. Most of these events have either directly resulted in changes to the game world or were pre-cursors to expansion packs. They are distinguished from by the fact that they were planned to last only a short time after release (at most one major &lt;a href=\"patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;) rather than being removed due to either considerations for new content or gameplay concerns, updates, and other fixes. Note that simply being introduced and removed quickly (e.g. a quest added in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.5\"&gt;patch 3.3.5&lt;/a&gt; and removed for &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;The Shattering&lt;/a&gt;) does not qualify something as a One-Time Event or part of one - it must be related to a unique period or occasion."}

This is not to be confused with the yearly calendar of in-game &lt;a href=\"event\"&gt;event&lt;/a&gt;s on the official site.\nIntro.\nGuild administrators frequently use web-based or in-game calendar modules to post upcoming guild events with descriptions, date/times, and number of members desired of each class type. This is often done at the start of the week, with guild members checking their guild web site to plan out their play time so that they can be sure to log in at the requested times to join with their friends.\nThis is particularly important for use in playing end-game content, where large 10 or 25-man raids are required to combat the more difficult bosses and instances. Organizing and making sense of groups of members over 5 or so is a difficult task, and tool support can make it much easier.\nWeb Site Event Tool Operation.\nA general summary of how the web site event tools are used is as:\nGuild Site Integration.\nMany guild sites offer a raid calendar module for display on the guild web site. One example can be found at the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.guildomatic.com/meta/calendar_spotlight\"&gt;Guildomatic Calendar Spotlight&lt;/a&gt;."}

Thus, they created outposts across Draenor with magical links back to Azeroth. Unfortunately, what seemed like a prime strategic location near the Blackrock Foundry was known to the botani as The Everbloom, a sacred place within Gorgrond woodlands. The outpost was quickly overgrown, but it still contains a link to the outskirts of Stormwind...\""}

If any major threat arose, the Evergrowth could react in unison, yet such threats were non-existent, for the Evergrowth dominated everything in sight, and nothing could hold it at bay. Most of it was initially destroyed by the giant &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt; and his descendants, while many years later it was finally destroyed forever when the &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; to incinerate the armies of the &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nGrond and the Sporemounds.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; came across Draenor in his travels, he was intrigued by the world, but foresaw doom for the planet if the Evergrowth was allowed to grow unchecked, as it would eventually consume everything on the world, including the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elemental spirits&lt;/a&gt;. Once that happened, the Evergrowth would devour itself, and Draenor would be left a wasteland devoid of life. Aggramar's natural affinity for order compelled him to take action, but he did not wish to completely destroy Draenor's plant life, only to temper it. Thus, he would need to neutralize the Sporemounds, the heart of the Evergrowth's power.\nThe titan considered destroying the Sporemounds himself, but since his power was so great it risked irreparably damaging or even shattering Draenor and because he could not stand guard over the world forever, he instead decided to create a mighty servant in his own image to uproot the Sporemounds. Using a massive elemental storm, Aggramar caused a mountain to groan to life and named it &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;. The giant began marching across the world to conquer the Evergrowth until he reached the nearest Sporemound, at which point he defeated and tore it from the world's surface with ease. The other Sporemounds shivered in agony at the destruction of their kin. Mere roots would not topple Grond; instead, the Sporemounds would need to adapt.\nEach Sporemound drained the surrounding wilds of life essence, leaving behind only withered tracts of land. Infused with these energies, the Sporemounds arose to walk the world. There were three, each embodying a different region of the Evergrowth: &lt;a href=\"Zang\"&gt;Zang&lt;/a&gt;, whose hide was covered in swamps and mushroom thickets; &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;, who was covered with primal forestlands; and &lt;a href=\"Naanu\"&gt;Naanu&lt;/a&gt;, who wore a fleece of dense jungles. As one the Sporemounds moved against Grond, and Draenor buckled under the weight of the warring giants. Aggramar watched the battle from the skies over Draenor. Zang, Botaan and Naanu were determined to protect the Evergrowth at any cost, and through their communal sentience they moved in perfect unison against Grond, nearly overwhelming him. However, like his creator, Grond possessed a will of steel and refused to give up. As the calamitous battle raged, the tide shifted between each side. The Sporemounds were resilient, but could not hold out forever against Grond's attacks. Zang and Naanu both fell to Grond, and their bodies would over the ages transform into the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Sea\"&gt;Zangar Sea&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. By then the giant was weakened and scarred by the battle. Botaan sensed its opponent's weakness, but would need more power to defeat the giant. It leeched the life essence from the bodies of Naanu and Zang, absorbing the energies and growing to a monstrous size. It eventually managed to defeat Grond by entangling him in thousands of small vines that gradually burrowed into the cracks on his skin until they tore the wounds open, killing the giant.\nThe breakers and the primals.\nDuring the battle between Grond and the Sporemounds, pieces of their bodies had fallen to the earth and given rise to new types of creatures. From the seeds and roots of Zang, Naanu, and Botaan, creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt; sprouted, while &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s and myriads of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s arose from Grond's remains. While Botaan and the genesaur began to retake the lands Grond had taken from the Evergrowth, Aggramar fused titan discs to the bodies of the colossals to empower them against the Sporemound and its minions. The titan suddenly felt a &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; dying somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and left Draenor, never to return. Using guile, the colossals managed to lure Botaan away from the Evergrowth before attacking with their full might. For thousands of years they battled, with pieces of the colossals gradually breaking off and coming to life as the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt;, who ignored the colossal's calls for aid and instead went their own ways. As the colossals' numbers were dwindling, they knew they had to take drastic action to destroy Botaan. Piling onto the Sporemound, they unleashed their energy in unison, creating a massive explosion that shattered the bodies of Botaan and the colossals, caused large swathes of forests to wither and instantly killed hundreds of genesaur. For one brief moment, the entirety of the Evergrowth trembled with the shared agony of Botaan's death. Then there was silence. Botaan's demise had destroyed the communal sentience of Draenor's wilds. Forests and jungles arose wherever fragments of Botaan's body fell to the earth, while the bulk of its body became the vibrant region of &lt;a href=\"Farahlon\"&gt;Farahlon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe magnaron would gradually give rise to lesser creatures \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The common ancestry of these so-called &lt;a href=\"breakers\"&gt;breakers&lt;/a&gt; did not make them allies, but it did infuse them with a shadow of Grond's influence, and all of them were opposed to the verdant wilds. The genesaur and other plant-based life were known collectively as the &lt;a href=\"primals\"&gt;primals&lt;/a&gt;, and they traced their lineage back to the Sporemounds; much like the breakers, many of them had arisen in the aftermath of Botaan's destruction, but while the numerous spores released from Botaan's corpse had weakened the creatures of stone, they had the opposite effect on plant life, granting existing plant species sentience and causing new beings to take shape in the jungles. Among these were the diminutive &lt;a href=\"podling\"&gt;podling&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the intelligent and prolific &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;. Faint memories of the Evergrowth lingered in the botani's minds, but they did not know the full truth of the Sporemounds or their battles with Grond and the colossals. Even so, what little the botani knew of the Evergrowth had a profound impact on their culture, leading them to revere the genesaur as gods due to seeing the larger creatures as echoes of the Sporemounds.\nGnarlgar and the Apexis.\nMany years later, a &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; wandered the dense forests of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;. From the genesaur, it learned of the Evergrowth, the Sporemounds, and the ancient past of Draenor. Gnarlgar eventually became aware of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; civilization, which it saw as an immense affront to nature and an even greater threat than the breakers. Gnarlgar departed Talador in search of a weapon to use against the Apexis, and discovered a massive fossilized root - one of the last remaining intact pieces of Botaan's body. The treant returned to Talador and rallied its botani followers, telling them that they would use the root to craft a new Sporemound, greater than any that had come before it, to cast the Apexis from their lofty spire. Gnarlgar planted the root deep within Talador and began a great ritual to nourish it, in which thousands of botani willingly sacrificed themselves to allow Gnarlgar to infuse their spirits into the root. When the Apexis became aware of the primals' war preparations, they quickly launched an attack on the heart of Talador but failed to destroy the burgeoning Sporemound, which Gnarlgar had named &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt;, and lost nearly half of their forces. The Anhari order of Apexis proposed a solution in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, a massive weapon that could channel the energies of the sun. As they began to work on the mechanism, Gnarlgar quickened Taala's maturation and ordered more botani to sacrifice themselves so that the Sporemound could be awakened before the arakkoa regrouped.\nFinally, Taala stirred, and the primals began to march upon &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;. The Apexis realized they could not complete the weapon in time, but a small group of sorcerers of the Skalaxi order shrouded themselves in shadow and stalked into the forests to assassinate Gnarlgar. The treant sensed their presence and disposed of them, but not before he had been struck by a withering curse that soon caused his limbs to rot and die until he collapsed beside his assassins. Gnarlgar's death sent the primals into disarray, giving the Apexis enough time to complete the weapon. Just as Taala reached the Apexis spire, the Anhari ignited the weapon, instantly killing Taala and thousands of primals, finally extinguishing the Evergrowth forever."}

It lies at the crossroads of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;'s main trade routes and contains a &lt;a href=\"goblin%20laboratory\"&gt;goblin laboratory&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nReputation for Everlook and the Steamwheedle Cartel is mostly gained from quests in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. Having a &lt;a href=\"Friendly\"&gt;Friendly&lt;/a&gt; or higher Reputation will make the Guards help you in case of initiated violence against you.\nIn the RPG.\nEverlook, located on the far east side of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, is the only major &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; outpost in northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and this trading post serves several purposes. First, it serves as the base of operations for goblin &lt;a href=\"thorium\"&gt;thorium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arcanite\"&gt;arcanite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"miner\"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt;s, since Winterspring has some of the few untapped veins of those materials on the continent. Second, it serves as a center of trade to all races and factions, including the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. While Everlook is hardly as safe as &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, generally the two factions treat each other fairly well there. Everlook would offer a commanding view of Kalimdor, if it were not at such a high altitude that clouds constantly shroud the mountain's lower flanks.\nThe recent success of Everlook has brought more adventurers into Winterspring, which the natives hope will aid them in defeating the threat of the demons of &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdditionally, Everlook is a frequent stop-off and resupply point for the faithful who make the pilgrimage through Winterspring to &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt; as this town is the last point of civilizations before reaching the Summit. While pilgrims allowed to venture up to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; stop here, this is the highest that merchants and explorers may venture without the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' permission.\nThe town is also the home of the &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Thorium Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, a group of self-righteous &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; who think they are the best smiths in existence. Led by &lt;a href=\"Malyfous%20Darkhammer\"&gt;Malyfous Darkhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the brotherhood sells their thorium goods for ridiculous amounts of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. When visiting Everlook, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was tempted to show them what a real smith (and a real dwarf) could make, but he decided it was a waste of his time to even pay attention to them, and he suggests others do the same. Brann attached a catalogue of the garbage Malyfous tries to sell here, though even a novice would know that his prices (and the wares he offers in the first place) are simply ridiculous.\nThe goblins here recently discovered a new mine to the south of their city, not far from the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; caves of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt;. This mine is valuable due to a large amount of arcanite within it, but thus far it proves inaccessible. While not part of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s cave complex, the dragons are territorial, and so the goblins are looking for a hero that can find a way to convince the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to allow them access to the mine, in exchange of a nice reward of course."}

The swim speed bit is the important part, as Evermaw will not stop moving faster than base swim speed.\nEvermaw itself will not attack people trying to kill it, so the encounter will not require any tanks or healers. However, players in front of Evermaw stand a chance of being Devoured and killed instantly if they get too close to its mouth. The whale shark will also not reset to full health if attackers drop combat by ceasing to attack or getting out of range. By default, Evermaw will \"debuff\" players with Timeless Rapids, which allows abilities to be cast while swimming. The whale also spawns floating white and purple clouds near its body. Players swimming through white clouds gain the stacking Timeless Rift buff, increasing damage and haste by 10% each stack for 15 seconds. The purple clouds apply Time Lock and will stun players for a few seconds.\nBe aware: Evermaw swims in and out of the &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; area surrounding the Timeless Isle. Melee classes in particular need to be careful not to be so caught up in doing damage that they die of fatigue."}

It can be found in roughly the center of the commons, in the southwest portion of the city, and acts as a commercial hub for much of the surrounding area.\nNumerous stalls and shops exist throughout the bazaar, specializing in standard nightborne commodities, including the valuable &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;. The plaza has a waterfront facing into &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt; (just across the water from &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt;) and hosts a jetty to accommodate transport boats. Lately, the bazaar\u2014along with the rest of the district\u2014is heavily patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; security forces in response to the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; in Suramar.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; erupted in response to the admittance of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, the entire &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; race was thrown into upheaval. The city itself became a battleground between insurgent agents and those loyal to the regime of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. The city's western districts, where the Evermoon Bazaar is located, quickly became a major focus of both sides, with the rebels seeking to protect and gain the support of the lower classes, while the Grand Magistrix's forces attempted to brutally put down any form of insurrection.\nIn an attempt to starve the district into submission, the authorities began rationing the amount of &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; available to the residents, leading many to suffer greatly from the lack of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;'s energy needed to feed their addiction. Large stocks of arcwine could still be found in the Evermoon Bazaar, often under guard, and this became an objective of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen rebels&lt;/a&gt;. Large quantities of arcwine were frequently stolen from the bazaar by Nightfallen agents, who would subsequently distribute it to those in need. Security operated by the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; in the Evermoon Bazaar at this time remained extremely high as a result.\nAs the conflict progressed and the rebellion continued to secure advantages and allies, armed fighting between the Duskwatch and insurgents began to break out in the plaza and the surrounding district. Rebel propaganda posters started appearing throughout the bazaar, detailing the great advances made by the insurrection."}

Located along the city's southwestern waterfront, the district houses a large portion of the nightborne citizenry, particularly those of the lower and middle classes. In addition to this, the Evermoon Commons also plays host to a wide selection of shops and economic fixtures, such as the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Bazaar\"&gt;Evermoon Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCanals separate the commons from the &lt;a href=\"Starcaller%20Retreat\"&gt;Starcaller Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Artisan%27s%20Gallery\"&gt;Artisan's Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shimmershade%20Garden\"&gt;Shimmershade Garden&lt;/a&gt; in the west, and the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt; to the north. The &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, seat of Suramar's rulers, and &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt; lie a short distance across &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt; to the east.\nIn recent times, the district has been heavily involved in the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, with the Evermoon Commons itself acting as an important support base for the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;nightfallen insurgents&lt;/a&gt; attempting to overthrow Suramar's government. A great deal of sympathy for the rebellion was consistently nurtured among the district's residents, who suffered greatly from the callous policies of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Evermoon Commons occupy a section of the innermost 'ring' of the layout of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. Its name is consistent with the style of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and may have been established prior to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and Suramar's subsequent millennia-long isolation under its arcane shield.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar City was once again reopened to the world with the deactivation of its shield. Before long, a major civil conflict in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; erupted among the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; people. The &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;rebels&lt;/a&gt;, seeking the overthrow of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, quickly began to foster support in the city. In particular, the southern portions of Suramar, home to the city's lower classes, served as a major focus of Nightfallen efforts.\nIn response to this unrest, Suramar's authorities established effective martial law over much of the city. &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; security forces, frequently accompanied by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, occupied and patrolled the Evermoon Commons and surrounding districts. Its residents were regularly harassed, and sometimes even killed, in the streets in an effort to quell the rebellion. \n&lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt;, used by the nightborne to feed their addiction to the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, was severely restricted and rationed to the majority of nightborne people on the orders of the Grand Magistrix in an effort to assert control. Denizens of the Evermoon Commons in particular suffered heavily from this policy, with many dying or &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;withering&lt;/a&gt; in the streets from lack of magical energy. The Nightfallen rebels widely distributed arcwine to the district's residents at this time in order to help alleviate the suffering, and often intervened directly when citizens were assaulted by the Duskwatch.\nAs the conflict within the city escalated, harsher measures began to be imposed by Suramar's regime. This cultivated in the massacre at the &lt;a href=\"Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;, located right beside the Evermoon Commons, where Duskwatch and demonic forces systematically slaughtered dozens of civilians in what was known to be an area of the city sympathetic to the rebel cause. In the aftermath of the attack, the Nightfallen headquarters in the vicinity was moved to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Terrace\"&gt;Evermoon Terrace&lt;/a&gt; in the Evermoon Commons. \nBy the time of the final stages of the rebellion, armed insurgents began to actively take control of certain areas and safehouses in the commons, as outright fighting exploded in the streets themselves. This was coupled with a rebel propaganda campaign, which planted posters in numerous locations around the district to rally more to their cause."}

It is the &lt;a href=\"starting%20zone\"&gt;starting zone&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; race, introduced in \"World of Warcraft\"'s first &lt;a href=\"Expansion\"&gt;expansion set&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\". Eversong lies in the northern part of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and is the location of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, arguably the third largest and third oldest surviving capital in the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; after the Zandalari troll capital of Dazar'alor and then the Nightborne elf capital of Suramar City.\nThe blood elves have called the resplendent Eversong Woods home for millennia, but the stewardship of this forested region has not been without its perils. Bent on harnessing the elves' mystical &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; carved a path of destruction through the heart of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, leaving a tainted scar across Eversong Woods. Thus far the elves have worked extensively to drive the lingering undead from their lands and cleanse the wounds of Arthas's assault, but the task is far from over. As Quel'Thalas looks toward a new future, ensuring the safety and well-being of Eversong will be a critical first step.\nHistory.\nEversong Woods was once visually indistinguishable from its southern woodlands, now called the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, and together they comprised the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of years ago, the forests were claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, eventually naming themselves the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, who battled the resident &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; populace and took the land for their own. After creating the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the Highborne became nourished, which enabled them to create their cities and shape the forests. The elves established the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and northern Eversong contained the heart of their empire for millennia; the elves' capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; was established at the forest's northernmost tip, near the ocean. The elves interwove their architecture to complement Eversong's natural landscape, blending the natural and their arcane-empowered structures together in beautiful ways. The elves lived in relative harmony with the creatures of the woodlands. The &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; erected numerous &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s throughout Eversong, to serve as a dampening field that would limit the potency of all non-elven magic. They also magically locked Eversong into a state of perpetual springtime. Shortly after Quel'Thalas was founded, the elves created a legendary bow named &lt;a href=\"Thas%27dorah%2C%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Windrunners\"&gt;Thas'dorah&lt;/a&gt;, carved from the bark of the mother tree of Eversong. Named &lt;a href=\"Thas%27alah\"&gt;Thas'alah&lt;/a&gt;, or Light of the Forest, this tree was the oldest in all Quel'Thalas' woodlands, and its roots absorbed the energy of the Sunwell. From its enchanted branches, the entire region seemed to be bathed in the glow of an eternal spring.\nAlthough the woods have seen their share of battle between the elves and their relentless neighbors, the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, the region retained a harmonic and peaceful feel for much of its history, standing strong for over 7,000 years to come. Its defenses were tested during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, in which the edges of the forest mysteriously began to burn. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;invaders&lt;/a&gt; responsible reached the northern forest but were unable to overcome Silvermoon's great defenses, and the violence was soon quelled. In its aftermath, the Amani, who had allied with the fel-crazed orcs, were mercilessly hunted down within Eversong and beyond.\nThird War.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Eversong lay witness to the horrors that the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; brought upon the land during his &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;, and the forest has been permanently scarred by the death wrought by the hordes of undead - a huge, plagued tracing of land was torn through the center of Eversong, known as the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;, which now stands in stark contrast to the rest of the forest. Countless elves were slaughtered in Eversong, including their ranger-general, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The elven grand magister, &lt;a href=\"Belo%27vir%20Salonar\"&gt;Belo'vir Salonar&lt;/a&gt;, took over the defense of Silvermoon after her death, but the capital was also unable to withstand Arthas's onslaught. After Arthas had reached his goal on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; and abandoned Quel'Thalas to its fate, the remnants of elves in the woods gathered under the banner of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, who safeguarded the ruined kingdom while searching for any other survivors. \nQuel'Thalas's &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ruling council&lt;/a&gt; had been slain during the onslaught, leaving &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; as the rightful ruler. Kael rushed home to witness the damage to his kingdom with his own eyes, and reunited with his people, renaming them the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in honor of all those perished. Kael'thas left his new regent, Lor'themar, in charge of Quel'Thalas, while he took the strongest elves to battle alongside the Alliance in Lordaeron, and later &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the blood elves remained behind with their regent, seeking to reclaim their land. Downtrodden and weakened by an addiction to magic that had become apparent after the destruction of the elves' Sunwell, the elves made little progress with this until the return of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, who reinvigorated his people with the use of a technique taught to Kael on Outland: &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;mana draining&lt;/a&gt;. The elves gathered their strength and began reclaiming and rebuilding; fortunately, most of Eversong was not beyond healing, and the Scourge's defilement that had ruined the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; to the south was able to be halted at &lt;a href=\"Elrendar\"&gt;Elrendar&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the blood elves remained in Eversong to continue rebuilding, while others turned their attention to the Ghostlands, hoping to drive the Scourge out of their beloved kingdom forever. Large portions of Eversong were reclaimed, and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; rose again, but other threats, some old and some new, were looming on the horizon. \nWorld of Warcraft.\nEversong Woods is the blood elf starting zone in \"\". In the wake of Arthas's invasion, much of Eversong has been reclaimed, but not without cost. The destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; adversely affected some of Eversong's wildlife (along with the elves' &lt;a href=\"Mana%20wyrm\"&gt;own arcane creations&lt;/a&gt;), driving some erratic and hostile. Dealing with this, along with understanding every blood elf's innate addiction to magic, is among the first thing blood elf adventurers must do. Eversong is also troubled by the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;, a group of disheveled, violent mana-addicts who could not balance their dependency on the arcane. Having grown bold with the advent of the elves' recent losses to the Scourge, the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; forest trolls have made incursions into Eversong, diverting the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;' attention. A south-western portion of Eversong, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Scorched%20Grove\"&gt;Scorched Grove&lt;/a&gt;, was burned by the elves in an effort to halt the corruption and the Scourge's advance; while successful, it also turned the local &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s hostile. \nWith the Sunwell gone, the elves began using their &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Sanctum\"&gt;arcane sanctums&lt;/a&gt; around Eversong to syphon arcane power from ley lines in Quel'Thalas. They also revitalized several of the runestones to heighten their defenses, which had fallen into disrepair. \nAlthough much of Eversong is restored, the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; remains a constant reminder of the Scourge invasion. The blood elves looked into ways to heal it, but investigating magisters deemed it too tainted and beyond saving. Roughly half of Silvermoon City was reclaimed; however, its western half remains deteriorated, the Dead Scar slicing through it. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Hawks\"&gt;Blood Hawks&lt;/a&gt; seem to be the guards of the forest.\nDuring the second &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Eversong was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nMuch work has been done to retake Eversong, but much more remains before the wounds Arthas inflicted can be fully healed.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; reunited in the forest and traveled through the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; to the Ghostlands, fighting Scourge minions along the way.\nAs part of a &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;ceremony of remembrance&lt;/a&gt; held each year in the kingdom, a blood elf &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; traveled through Eversong to reenact the defense of their lands during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The evacuation of &lt;a href=\"Fairbreeze%20Village\"&gt;Fairbreeze Village&lt;/a&gt; is experienced, as well as &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s final stand against Arthas as the elves attempted to bar the Scourge's rampage. The ceremony continues on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nEversong Woods stand in perpetual spring, with some elements of autumn, with golden leaves falling from the trees.\nAs yet there are no dungeons of any kind and no battlegrounds in Eversong Woods. However, there was an unknown wooden gate at Tor'Watha, just as seen in the Ghostlands (leading to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;) in the southeastern portion of the zone. It can be assumed this was a portal leading to an unknown instance, to be implemented sometime in the future, or it could have been the original entrance to Zul'Aman.\nThe blight still spreads through Eversong Woods, but the Runestones located in the south prevent the blight from spreading any further. One Runestone has faltered though, and the blight has corrupted it.\nNotable characters.\nEversong Woods is home to several characters of note. At the Sunspire, &lt;a href=\"Magistrix%20Erona\"&gt;Magistrix Erona&lt;/a&gt; welcomes new recruits of all creeds into action. At Falconwing Square, &lt;a href=\"Aeldon%20Sunbrand\"&gt;Aeldon Sunbrand&lt;/a&gt; attempts to cleanse the tainted presence of the pitiful Wretched.

This quest is slightly more complicated than most, and the first problems come from not reading the quest closely enough: \nThe other problem many encounter is that they are overwhelmed and killed by the summoned mobs. This can be addressed by standing closer to the front door of the Blue Recluse when you read the Cantation, which usually results in fewer of the summoned mobs aggroing on you, enabling you to fight fewer at the same time.\nA good place to try is the cellar - only one rift spawn will be summoned there.\nIf the mobs are still too much for you, try it again when you are a couple levels higher."}

{"id": "196053", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=196053", "title": "Invincible", "text": "Invincible was the steed of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, both in life and death. He was the skeletal steed that Arthas rode throughout ', though his name was first introduced in ', and his backstory in the novel \"\".\nBiography.\nLife.\nInvincible was born to the mare &lt;a href=\"Brightmane\"&gt;Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Balnir%20Farmstead\"&gt;Balnir Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, in the winter of the year &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; fell. At &lt;a href=\"Jorum%20Balnir\"&gt;Jorum Balnir&lt;/a&gt;'s invitation, Prince Arthas\u2014then nine years old\u2014assisted in the foal's birth. The moment he met the foal's eyes, Arthas felt a bond between them and knew that the horse would become his mount and inseparable friend. Although he wasn't a &lt;a href=\"warhorse\"&gt;warhorse&lt;/a&gt;, as those were a separate breed, he would bear Arthas in ceremony and daily life. The &lt;a href=\"Balnir\"&gt;Balnir&lt;/a&gt; family, who bred horses used by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Menethil\"&gt;royal family&lt;/a&gt;, gave the horse to Arthas two years later. Arthas considered naming the horse \"Snowfall\" or \"Starlight\" because of his white coat, but in the informal tradition of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeronian&lt;/a&gt; knights and nobles naming their steeds after a quality (&lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;'s was \"&lt;a href=\"Steadfast\"&gt;Steadfast&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;' \"&lt;a href=\"Courageous\"&gt;Courageous&lt;/a&gt;\"), he named the colt \"Invincible\".\nOne of the prince's favorite activities whenever he needed an escape from his royal duties was to go riding on Invincible through the Tirisfal countryside, and in particular to guide the horse in a leap over an embankment near the Balnir Farmstead. Mount and rider were always completely in tune, with Invincible obeying Arthas' every command, and the prince often felt that the stallion flew rather than galloped.\nOne winter afternoon when Invincible was ten years old, a few months before Arthas was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the two went riding despite a growing snowstorm. When Arthas tried to guide the stallion over their favorite jump, Invincible lost his footing on some icy rocks and, instead of landing smoothly, fell and shattered his forelegs. Too far from help and unable to heal the stricken horse, Arthas was forced to kill him by stabbing him through the heart with his sword in order to relieve his pain. The stallion was buried on the grounds of the Balnir Farmstead at Arthas' request. The guilt and trauma of Invincible's death left a deep impact on Arthas, who long viewed the incident as his only failure in life. He never revealed the truth of what had happened to anyone else and instead let them believe that it had been an accident. In response to the horse's death, Arthas made a private vow to always protect others no matter what sacrifices were required and to never again let himself be caught unawares and unable to help, which influenced several of the decisions he made later in life.\nUndeath.\nSeven years later, the night after he landed in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to pursue &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas had a dream of Invincible's fatal injury and of having to kill him again. This time, however, the prince found himself holding a &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;very different sword&lt;/a&gt;. When he pulled it out of Invincible's body, the horse didn't die but was instead miraculously healed and made stronger than before. Arthas felt that the dream was a joyous omen.\nAfter murdering &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas\u2014now a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;\u2014ran directly from &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; to Invincible's grave at the Balnir Farmstead. With the power of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas resurrected the horse as his undead steed. He decided that Invincible's death seven years earlier had not been a mistake on his part, but rather an essential part of his destiny. He believed that the now undead horse was proof that he had never been wrong about anything in his life\u2014if the stallion had been alive, he would've feared the death knight, but now the two could be reunited. Although he hadn't been bred to be a warhorse, Invincible's resurrection made him immune to hunger, pain, and exhaustion, making him the perfect steed for Arthas. Now fully living up to his name, he could move with unnatural swiftness as well as become a spectre and disappear, to be resummoned by Arthas at any time.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; confronted Arthas in single combat, severing Invincible's forelegs with his runeblade, &lt;a href=\"%3AFelo%27melorn\"&gt;:Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, to dismount him. Witnessing Invincible's injuries brought on a surge of memories and sent Arthas into a rage, during which he shattered Felo'melorn and struck down Anasterian. This time, however, Arthas was able to necromantically repair the injuries. At the start of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;Plaguelands civil war&lt;/a&gt;, as Arthas' powers weakened and the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt; turned much of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; against him, the death knight was relieved to find that he could still effortlessly summon Invincible. He felt certain that the stallion still loved him and was the one creature that would never turn against him\u2014\"the one thing he had done completely right\".\nInvincible continued to serve as his master's mount even after Arthas became the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. The horse was known to stalk through &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and fly on the winds around the spires. &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; has also been referred to as the Lich King's mount.\nFollowing Arthas' defeat, Invincible's saddle was lost beneath Icecrown. Years later, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; retrieved the saddle and used it to create steeds for the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nInvincible's grave.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", Invincible's empty grave can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Balnir%20Farmstead\"&gt;Balnir Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. A plaque on the headstone reads:\nThe grave was added to the game in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; and was the first place to mention the name \"Invincible\", before the novel \"\" was released and expanded on the horse's backstory. The plaque is absent in the post-&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; phase of the zone, apparently a developer oversight.\nInvincible's Reins.\nWhen defeated on &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic difficulty&lt;/a&gt; in 25-player mode, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; has a small chance to drop Invincible as a flying mount.\nAppearance.\nAt birth, Invincible's coat, mane, and tail were gray, but by the age of two they had turned white as snow. This was a rare color even among the &lt;a href=\"Balnir\"&gt;Balnir&lt;/a&gt;-bred horses, who mostly had light gray coats. His eyes in life were brown.\nThe depictions of Invincible as an undead are noticeably inconsistent, with different sources portraying the horse's appearance in wildly different ways. His original look in \"\" is that of a partially &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt; with horns, identical to the mounts ridden by other &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; units in that game. 's &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3\"&gt;patch 3.3&lt;/a&gt; introduced a new, unique design with the &lt;a href=\"Invincible%27s%20Reins\"&gt;Invincible's Reins&lt;/a&gt; mount: a flying undead steed with bat wings and larger portions of his skin and flesh still intact. Most subsequent depictions in \"World of Warcraft\" and other sources fluctuate between these two versions of his design."}

Unlike &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;, it is of magical origin. There is no chance to detect an invisible target without a detection effect. However, detection effects reveal invisible units at any range. Even when detected, invisible units are transparent and do not display a name tag.\nJust like &lt;a href=\"Stealth%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Stealth&lt;/a&gt;, Invisibility comes undone if you take most actions other than movement. This does not necessarily apply to mobs, most of whom remain invisible when attacked. While invisible, the player can only be seen by party members, and those with special invisibility detection (see below).\nThere are only a few items in the game that provide invisibility. They are: (requires level 23 to use; lasts 15 seconds with a 10-minute cooldown), (requires level 37 to use; lasts 18 seconds with a 10-minute cooldown), (requires 200 Engineering to use; lasts 10 seconds with a 1-hour cooldown) and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20Field\"&gt;Invisibility Field&lt;/a&gt; (requires Engineering 500 to use; lasts 15 seconds with a 5-minute cooldown). The only spells which allow invisibility are the &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Invisibility\"&gt;Lesser Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. All currently available invisibility effects are limited to their caster.\nInvisible mobs.\nThere are several invisible &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s in the world. There are the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Citizen\"&gt;Lordaeron Citizen&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Unseen\"&gt;Unseen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, the shades of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and the infamous invisible patrols in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; West.\nThen there are the &lt;a href=\"Eyeless%20Watcher\"&gt;Eyeless Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s in the 3 main encampments in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and of course the &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Naxxramas\"&gt;Eye of Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther than those in Dire Maul and Eastern Plaguelands, however, most invisible mobs of the world tend to be neutral, and won't attack unless provoked, which means that you wouldn't know they were there unless you had invisibility detection or happened to hit them with an AoE (in which case they would engage you, but remain invisible).\nThere are also the &lt;a href=\"Skulking%20Witch\"&gt;Skulking Witch&lt;/a&gt;es in the &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvisibility detection.\nThere are a few items and abilities in the game that provide limited ability to see through invisibility:\nMobs with invisibility detection.\nEach of the major cities has patrolling guards with Stealth and invisibility detection abilities, and some mobs in instances (some were added to Stratholme in patch 1.6, for example) can also detect some grade of invisibility.\nIn the RPG.\nThe spell is named incorporeality.

The fallen keeper relies upon lightning itself. Ionar and its cohorts were given sanctuary within the Halls of Lightning in exchange for their unquestioning loyalty and willingness to slaughter any who seek to confront their new master.\"\nTactics.\nAll of Ionar's abilities have easy to spot visual cues. If you can avoid them the fight is relatively simple. \nWhen fighting Ionar he will periodically throw a lightning ball that hits for ~5k at the ground where the targeted player is standing. (much like Void Reaver) The ball travels slower than most spells and can be dodged. \nAdditionally, Ionar will debuff one person with a debuff similar to static charge from &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and everyone must spread out, away from that player.\nEvery 20 percent, Ionar will disperse into a number of small sparks which begin slowly crawling around on the ground. These lightning \"spiders\" will follow players around and stretch the range of the lightning effect, which deals 500 damage every 0.5-&gt;1 seconds. You must run away from the spiders.\nHeroic.\nNot much different than &lt;a href=\"normal%20mode\"&gt;normal mode&lt;/a&gt;. Avoid the spiders, either by running around on Ionar's platform or by running down the stairs. Have the tank run down the stairs in the middle (the spiders will follow) and then sneak back up on the right or left side (the spiders are too slow to catch up) to arrive back at Ionar when the dispersion ends."}

She became an instrumental player in the battle of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and the death of &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIridi traveled with an unnamed draenei shadow priestess and an apprentice, along with her unnamed draenei friend, to an unnamed &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. When they finished their studies, they were each given a powerful staff by the naaru. They eventually made their way to Azeroth with the hopes of using their power to help people. When Iridi's comrade was murdered by &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s cousin &lt;a href=\"Zendarin\"&gt;Zendarin&lt;/a&gt; - who in the process stole the staff from the corpse of the draenei - Iridi took it upon herself to travel to Grim Batol in order to retrieve the stolen staff. She also sought to find and rescue the nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring her quest, Iridi eventually arrived at &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Kingdoms. While staying in the city, a dwarf by the name of &lt;a href=\"Garthin%20Stoneguider\"&gt;Garthin Stoneguider&lt;/a&gt; accompanied her. After she learned that she would have to stay in the harbor, a group of raptors attacked the town. Garthin immediately went to battle against them and insisted that Iridi stay safe. She followed him, however, and the dwarf took her to a secret passageway. There she used her magic to render him unconscious, assuring that he was all right before leaving him in the tunnel. Free to venture forth in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, Iridi came into contact with the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt;. Iridi learned about the creation of &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; - an avatar of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; - as the two dragons argued with one another, as Kalec was bitter about Krasus's meddling.\nIn time Iridi became separated from the dragons and encountered &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, as well a group of dwarven warriors under the command of &lt;a href=\"Rom\"&gt;Rom&lt;/a&gt;. After surprising them by revealing her knowledge of Krasus, Rom ordered the others to carry out their duties. Once alone, Rom was questioned by Vereesa about why he looked older than he should. He confided to her and Iridi that it was due to the evil inside Grim Batol. Veterans like himself had aged quicker and a good many had died before their time. The group later came under attack by &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, causing Iridi to become separated from her companions. She came across &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; as he searched for his wife, Vareesa. The duo forged an alliance with the local raptors, who had formed a sort of army due to the ominous events at Grim Batol. During the attack that followed, Iridi ended up separated from her compatriots yet again. She encountered Rom and the two freed Zzeraku, who was quick to engage the twilight dragon Dargonax in battle. As the two dragons clashed, Rom directed her to join Rhonin's side. Rom took the battle to &lt;a href=\"Rask\"&gt;Rask&lt;/a&gt; and the two killed one another as Iridi watched, helpless. Her fallen friend would be avenged, however, when Zendarin was killed by Vereesa. \nMeanwhile, as the two dragons clashed in the skies above Grim Batol, it seemed that Zzeraku was doomed. In his darkest hour, Iridi gave all of her staff's power (and most of her life energy) to empower Zzeraku. Even with the powers of Iridi and her staff, however, Zzeraku was unsuccessful in fighting Dargonax and was devoured by the latter. In one final, desperate hope to slay the twilight dragon, Iridi - with help from Rhonin, Vereesa, Krasus, and Kalec - used the last of her energy to destroy Dargonax. The major loss of power proved too much for Iridi. After telling her new-found friends that she wished to see Outland one last time, Iridi died knowing that she had played a large part in saving &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Granting Iridi's last wish, Kalec took her body to Outland to give her the burial she deserved."}

Along with his brethren, he rejected the gift of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and turned to the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s instead, becoming an incarnation of &lt;a href=\"earth\"&gt;earth&lt;/a&gt; itself. The eldest of the four Incarnates, his mastery of the earth allows him and his siblings to move about the world undetected. While his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; is just as strong as he is, Iridikron's greatest strength is his intelligence. His all-consuming hatred led him to embrace war against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; the most among his siblings, being the last- and most difficult to contain of the Incarnates. Having made deals with both the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Iridikron ultimately plans to unmake the titans' work and steal &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from them. He currently appears to be amassing massive amounts of magical power in the form of &lt;a href=\"Shadowflame\"&gt;Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;'s hunger, leaving the war to his siblings. \nIridikron is fought as a &lt;a href=\"Iridikron%20the%20Stonescaled\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, but can only be reduced to 85% health before the fight is interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. He is one of the main antagonists of . \nBackground.\nAncient history.\nWhile the proto-dragons who would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; accepted the gift of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s, the proto-dragons who would become the Primal Incarnates rejected it. Tensions rose between the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; who wished to cleanse the world of the titans' \"stain\" and the dragonflights, breaking out into open rebellion about 20,000 years ago when &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; struck first by leading an assault on &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; army on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. In the battle, she destroyed &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, the titan relic which Neltharion was using to control the dracthyr. This caused Neltharion to give in to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time and use their power to seal her away within the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nA cataclysmic conflict ensued between Primalists and dragonflights known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Scaleborn\"&gt;War of the Scaleborn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; were ever loyal to the Incarnate's ideals, but Iridikron truly embraced the war. At the end, he struck terrible bargains to keep their cause alive. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes the other incarnates never knew the true depths of his depravity. Despite the Primalists' alliance with the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; to end the dragons' reign, the remaining Primal Incarnates were ultimately defeated, with Iridikron being the last captured and the hardest to contain. But Alexstrasza, having failed to restore peace between the two groups, still couldn't bear to kill them given they had once been as close as clutch-mates, and decided to imprison them instead, within the titanic &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\n20,000 years later, &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth the Storm-Eater&lt;/a&gt; was freed by &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, and schemed to release her kin from the Vault. The Aspects were fearful of \"Iridikron's hunger\" being unleashed. Though Raszageth died, she succeeded in her endeavor and Iridikron, Fyrakk, and Vyranoth were released. Seeing how Raszageth's haste led to her downfall, Alexstrasza speculated that the Incarnates would take their time to gather their strengths first, and that Iridikron's mastery of the earth would harbor them in the meantime.\nFyrakk was eager to take revenge for their sister, but Iridikron did not want to rush in and believed they needed to even the scales with the Aspects first. The Incarnates adventured to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; as the last echoes of Raszageth's storm faded, where they breached an ancient vault belonging to &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and found a device that would give them the location of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, the Earth-Warder's secret underground domain. They had no interest in the laboratory of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus\"&gt;Aberrus&lt;/a&gt; itself, but in the molten fire that could be found below. &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; followed behind them secretly to claim Neltharion's legacy.\nThey found one of the hidden entry points to Zaralek right below &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, where they broke through the ground and sent Fyrakk down, blazing through the earth, to claim the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; power below and wake the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;'s Elders at the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20Caldera\"&gt;Zaqali Caldera&lt;/a&gt;.\nIridikron soon struck a dark bargain with the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, traveling back to the past to acquire the essence of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. During the encounter, adventurers and Chromie ventured to the upper impact area of Galakrond's corpse, where they engaged in battle against the Incarnate. While the adventurers provided an opening for Chromie to destroy the artifact Iridikron was using, &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; managed to trigger the birth of &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, Chromie was forced to undo their victory over Iridikron - traveling back in time to stop Deios. By saving &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, Iridikron was able to complete his mission and departed from the past through a void portal.\nFollowing the defense of Amirdrassil and Fyrakk's death, Vyranoth would inform Azeroth's champions that she had received a message from Iridikron himself, requesting a parlay with her alone. She agreed and meeting with the Stonescaled in the snowy mountains of Valdrakken, Iridikron condemned Vyranoth for abandoning the Primalists' war but Vyranoth countered that Iridikron abandoned the war and Fyrakk to his death for some \"trinket\" that Neltharion left behind. Iridikron clarified that the \"Dark Heart\" is no trinket and it was now in the hands of the Harbinger. Vyranoth voiced her disgust towards Iridikron for his willingness to use the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, stating that its power cannot be trusted. Iridikron, unmoved, stated that he trusted the Void's hunger to aid him in removing the Titan's \"stain\" from their world before giving Vyranoth one last chance to join his cause. The former Frozenheart answered by proclaiming that she would have no part in his war leaving the Stonescaled disappointed and angered, stating that the bond of the Incarnates are truly at an end. Iridikron took his leave but not before giving Vyranoth a final warning to stay out of his way.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He was known all throughout &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; for his excellent work in creating magical weapons that represent the &lt;a href=\"Air%20elemental\"&gt;air spirits&lt;/a&gt; that live there, but his pride proved to be his undoing.\nBiography.\nIrmaat was a master without peer among the tol'vir and one of the most exceptional minds to have lived in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. He worked tirelessly to arm his brethren with the finest instruments possible. He considered his work to be his calling: he saw his hands as extensions of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s' will, and he wanted nothing less than to give his creations the ability restore order to all chaos. He began to imbue his weapons with &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, using different sources of power to inspire him. He was particularly interested in the power of air and secretly observed the creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of air in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. He forged a set of four scimitars, each representing one of the &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; lords of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Wind\"&gt;Conclave of Wind&lt;/a&gt;. One of them was the &lt;a href=\"%3AScimitar%20of%20the%20Sirocco\"&gt;:Scimitar of the Sirocco&lt;/a&gt;. Then, in a ritual that stunned the tol'vir with its audacity, Irmaat summoned and bound those very four lords within the weapons themselves. Stories of the weapons rapidly spread and messengers from other tol'vir posts came to beg Irmaat for more wonders. However, the weaponsmith's satisfaction was short-lived, for he knew that even the might of four captured djinns was nothing but a light breeze in comparison to the true power of the Skywall.\nIrmaat carefully crafted two new weapons\u2014a pair of handblades which he named &lt;a href=\"%3AAl%27burq\"&gt;:Al'burq&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AAlra%27ed\"&gt;:Alra'ed&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. He declared them to be his finest work and intended for them to be able to control the wind itself. All that was left was to infuse them with the ultimate power within the Skywall: &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; of air. Irmaat slowly began the ritual, not wanting to warn the Windlord of his plan. It took weeks of preparation, but once he was ready, it was over in an instant. The weaponsmith cast his spell, intending to open a portal to the Skywall and bind Al'Akir's essence. There was a great flash of light and a rush of air, and when it was done, Irmaat could feel his weapons trembling with elemental power. He believed he had succeeded and done the impossible. Unbeknownst to him, however, Al'Akir had learned of his capture of the four djinns, and now the Windlord could enact his vengeance. The power that Irmaat felt quivering within the blades was not Al'Akir's spirit, but Al'Akir's trap. When the tol'vir hefted his two weapons, an uncontrollable hurricane spilled forth, destroying Irmaat, his forge, and the city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahmtul\"&gt;Ahmtul&lt;/a&gt; and burying them beneath the sands. The weapons themselves were hurled miles away, and the tol'vir who first tried to recover them were similarly destroyed. Al'Akir had made Irmaat's greatest creations unusable by filling them with so much power that no one could ever hope to control them. The tol'vir carefully buried the weapons. For millennia, nobody dared to touch them or repeat Irmaat's folly.\nAfter his death, his soul entered the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and was sent to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;."}

A meta gem socket only accepts a \"meta gem\".\nMeta gem requirements.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, each meta gem had a set of requirements. These requirements were that the wearer's equipment also had a particular number of other gems. If those requirements were met, the meta gem provided its bonus. If they were not, the meta gem was inactive.\nExample:\nFor this meta gem, if the character's gear had\nthis meta gem would be active.\nA gem that matched more than one required color (purple or prismatic, for the above example) would satisfy any requirements that it matched. For instance, this meta gem would become active with as little as one blue gem and one purple gem socketed in equipped items.\nA &lt;a href=\"prismatic\"&gt;prismatic&lt;/a&gt; gem on your gear counted for all meta gem color requirements. One &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Tear\"&gt;Nightmare Tear&lt;/a&gt;, for example, was enough to activate your &lt;a href=\"Destructive%20Skyflare%20Diamond\"&gt;Destructive Skyflare Diamond&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeta gems added in \"\" did not have this requirement.\nWhat equipment has meta gem sockets?\nMeta gem slots are &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt;s that (currently) only appear on particular varieties of . Most often, meta gem slots are found on items intended for \"end game usage\": level 70/80/85/90 gear, arena gear, \"dungeon sets\", and so on.\nMeta gem properties.\nMeta gems of the same name adjective have the same effects, but may have different activation requirements."}

For example, if a meta gem needs 3 red and 2 yellow to activate, then 3 orange (red/yellow) gems can activate this gem. Also, a gem does not have to match its socket to contribute to a meta gem; therefore the player may choose to lose an item's gem bonus in order to activate the meta gem's bonus.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"}

His two special abilities, however, hit quite hard. He will Toss Energized Metal on the ground, spawning an object that lasts for roughly a minute and zaps any units within 10 yards with a Charged Bolt for 50,000 Nature damage each second. The area of effect is marked by a red circle, so get out of it. He will also occasionally wind up a big Whirling Attack, which is telegraphed with a boss emote. Get out of the area of effect, this time denoted by lightning clouds on the ground. Try to not aggro any nearby &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Electrocutioner\"&gt;Shan'ze Electrocutioner&lt;/a&gt;s. \nTo get the &lt;a href=\"Speed%20Metal\"&gt;Speed Metal&lt;/a&gt; achievement, some electromancer killing will be required. Electromancers have ~500,000 health, and on death, will drop an orb of lightning on their corpse. Getting the stack started is the hard part, as the first stack only has a 10-second duration. Before pulling Mono-Han, try to kill two at close to the same time as possible, then run over both of their corpses before the orbs despawn. Each application will double the duration of the buff up to a 2-minute length. Quickly keep killing Electromancers, but after the fourth stack, the time constraint is not an issue. Get to nine or ten stacks, then pull Mono-Han. The buff should maxed out at 2 minutes on the pull. If it looks like not enough damage is getting put out quickly enough to kill Mono-Han before the buff drops, stop DPS on Mono-Han, turn to an electromancer and blast it to smithereens to refresh the buff, then finish Mono-Han off."}

Mezzamere is centered around a cluster of ancient &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; ruins. Since the waters around Nazjatar were parted during the &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Campaign\"&gt;Nazjatar Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Mezzamere and the surrounding area have become dry land, and now accommodate a large &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; presence, new allies of the ankoan.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; killed their leader as part of a long-standing conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade Ankoan&lt;/a&gt; resigned themselves to death or vengeance by invading their enemies' bastion. Mezzamere was founded as the base of operations for the Waveblade as they took their war against &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite their determination, the ankoan remained hopelessly outmatched until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. To trap these latest newcomers, Azshara pulled the sea itself from the region, and in so doing exposed Mezzamere and the Waveblade to the surface for the first time.\nThe ankoan would become particularly impressed by the stranded Alliance force as it battled desperately against the naga. When &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Okani\"&gt;Blademaster Okani&lt;/a&gt; approached &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; with an offer to work together, they accepted. Okani would then lead them back to the Waveblade stronghold. Before long, Mezzamere would become the center of the Alliance's efforts in Nazjatar against Queen Azshara and other foes."}

The fleet was hit by a powerful storm generated by the Cataclysm, and the \"Elune's Radiance\" started to sink. Having a leg broken during the storm, Mia could not move and &lt;a href=\"Tess\"&gt;Tess&lt;/a&gt; remained with her refusing to leave, so they both risked drowning. Genn, refusing to lose the last two members of his family, assumed &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; form and joined the rescue efforts of the night elf sailors from his ship. He reached their room inside the ship and brought them out, carrying Mia in his arms and Tess on his back, then he dropped them into the sea, where they were reached by the night elves lifeboats. Mia's broken leg was healed by the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, and after the storm, both the women reached &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; safely.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was busy evacuating refugees from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. With King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; preoccupied with advising King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; for the upcoming war, a respected authority figure was needed to calm the Gilnean people at the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt; and organize their evacuation to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Queen Mia was the most suitable person available and was eager to fulfill the role when Genn asked her to, especially after &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; was nowhere to be found. It was mentioned that Anduin admired her quick wits and kind heart, and that while Mia lived in Stormwind with her husband, she spent half her time in Darnassus to support her people settled there, and was a frequent visitor to their encampment, having also formed a close friendship with &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Priestesses%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMia asked &lt;a href=\"Maelir\"&gt;Maelir&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, to help evacuate her people from Darnassus, to which he agreed, replying that it was his honor to assist the Gilneans. After most of her people were successfully evacuated from the city, Mia, having developed a deep love for the people of Darnassus, was determined to aid in the night elven evacuation as well, acting as the ambassador of Stormwind, and she remained until the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and still attempting to aid the priestesses at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; - despite Genn's urging her repeatedly to leave Teldrassil before it was too late. Although she realized that it was impossible to evacuate their entire population, Mia vowed to Astarii that Genn would lead those who came to reclaim the World Tree from the Horde afterwards. After Tyrande Whisperwind returned to help Malfurion Stormrage, believing that defeating Sylvanas would disorganize the Horde and perhaps give her people more time to evacuate, Mia told the night elves to honor their high priestess as she joined her husband in battle against the Horde.\nWhen Sylvanas and the Horde launched their final assault on Teldrassil, Mia still refused to leave and attempted to help organize the remaining night elves scrambling to enter a portal, despite Astarii's insistence that she return to her husband. Mia was seriously wounded trying to protect &lt;a href=\"Finel\"&gt;Finel&lt;/a&gt;, a night elven infant, from collapsing rubble within the Temple, which trapped her beneath their debris and broke her legs. After Genn arrived to rescue her, Astarii managed to heal her wounds. Although Mia told Genn to take Finel and leave her, Genn stubbornly refused, and managed to rescue both of them, bringing them to Stormwind. With the World Tree and their second home destroyed, the surviving Gilneans moved to Stormwind, where Mia helped priests tend to the injured Gilnean and night elven refugees in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Anduin was unable to directly provide assistance for Tyrande Whisperwind and at her people, Genn mentioned that Mia would likely charge off to battle without him if he did not assist the night elves. Although the Queen of Gilneas did not join the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; herself, her daughter Tess and many of her people subsequently traveled to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, openly aiding the kaldorei forces fighting against the Horde.\nShadowlands.\nAter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Mia was present in &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed Tyrande's speech about Horde's defeat in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, after Genn received an invitation to the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and refused to attend it, Mia elected to go in his stead. During the reception, she spoke with &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and the queen whispered something that made bursted into laughter the elven ranger. During the party, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; delegation consisting of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; were uncomfortable at Genn's rejection but Calia noted that it was a pleasure to see the queen again."}

The majority of Suramar's nobility reside within the Midnight Court, which can be found in the most affluent area of the city. The &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Estate\"&gt;Jeweled Estate&lt;/a&gt;, one of the largest and most ornate buildings in the city, dominates the northern section of the court.\nThe location can be accessed via the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gilded%20Market\"&gt;Gilded Market&lt;/a&gt; in the west, which connects it to the rest of Suramar, and has access to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Moonlit%20Landing\"&gt;Moonlit Landing&lt;/a&gt; to the south. A canal, beginning near the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Terrace of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, runs all the way through the center of the Noble District, terminating in the Midnight Court just short of the Jeweled Estate.\nThe Midnight Court and its surrounding district would become a major target for the insurgents during the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; due to its association with the city's ruling powers. Much like the Gilded Market, the area was under extremely heavy guard for the duration of the rebellion, hosting contingents of &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20construct\"&gt;nightborne constructs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felborne\"&gt;Felborne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; society developed independently for the 10,000 years it spent totally isolated under their arcane shield following the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The people of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; would continue to maintain the rigid class structure they inherited from the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; before them, with a wealthy aristocratic elite holding political power. This segregation of nightborne society was evident in the city's very layout; the lower classes generally inhabited the districts in the west, while the nobility occupied the eastern areas, mainly the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt;. The Midnight Court and the &lt;a href=\"The%20Gilded%20Market\"&gt;Gilded Market&lt;/a&gt; would form the nucleus of this Noble District.\nWith the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the lowering of the great shield, Suramar City was thrown into chaos. The &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; would eventually erupt, as &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;insurrectionist nightborne&lt;/a&gt; sought to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her aristocratic supporters and expel the Burning Legion from Suramar. As a result, the Midnight Court and its surrounding district would quickly become a major target for the rebels, though the area had since been heavily occupied by demons and other forces loyal to Elisande. In particular, an elite demonic guard was known to protect the square and the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Estate\"&gt;Jeweled Estate&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Talixae%20Flamewreath\"&gt;Talixae Flamewreath&lt;/a&gt; and her council.\nDuring a ball held at the Jeweled Estate on the Midnight Court relatively early in the conflict, Elisande herself was due to make an appearance in order to reassure her supporters after recent events. The &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen rebels&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to neutralize the Grand Magistrix early on, managed to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; with agents in disguise. After fighting their way to the Midnight Court, the rebel group engaged Talixae Flamewreath and her demonic forces guarding the entrance to the Jeweled Estate itself and entered the party undetected. Though they would not succeed in eliminating Elisande, they did slay &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Melandrus\"&gt;Advisor Melandrus&lt;/a&gt;, a high-ranking figure.\nRebel agents also operated throughout the Midnight Court later on orders of &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lady Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to discover the identity of an enemy adherent in &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%23Noble%20Houses%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;House Stelleris&lt;/a&gt;. Ly'leth's operatives succeeded in interrogating Stelleris nobles, and would go on to assassinate the thug &lt;a href=\"Corvelyn\"&gt;Corvelyn&lt;/a&gt; in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Moonlit%20Landing\"&gt;Moonlit Landing&lt;/a&gt;.\nNightfallen operatives would continue to carry out further assassinations of key figures within the Midnight Court and Noble District. &lt;a href=\"Callus\"&gt;Callus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garion\"&gt;Garion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Leleyna\"&gt;Leleyna&lt;/a&gt; were three such &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; lieutenants eliminated as part of this effort to consolidate the insurrection's successes.\nAs the conflict progressed, the Nightfallen began to launch direct attacks on the Midnight Court itself, highlighting how powerful and far-reaching the rebellion had now become. Through the use of &lt;a href=\"Telemancy%20Orbs\"&gt;telemancy orbs&lt;/a&gt; provided by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt;, insurgents were able to teleport entire squads of &lt;a href=\"withered\"&gt;withered&lt;/a&gt; into the district, which fell upon the &lt;a href=\"Loyalist%20Sycophant\"&gt;noble loyalists&lt;/a&gt; and caused heavy casualties.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a poet contest between &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; took place here."}

One of his heads was always cheerful if not a little foolish, while the other was sly, calculating and had an almost dead look to its eyes. While initially a mere &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and not being that bad as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Blade\"&gt;Veiled Blade&lt;/a&gt;, he became exposed to the necromantic side of magic and ended up delighting in summoning forth the souls of the banished dead of &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt;. After quitting his mercenary company he enrolled at the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; but ended up assassinated by Lord Valthalak's minions.\nKormok was one of the 4 random bosses that must be killed for the left or right piece of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Lord Valthalak's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%202\"&gt;Dungeon Set 2&lt;/a&gt; questline. He could be summoned in &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt;'s room by using the &lt;a href=\"Brazier%20of%20Beckoning\"&gt;Brazier of Beckoning&lt;/a&gt;, and was tougher than he looked; however, Ras Frostwhisper's room no longer exists due to the \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" revamp of Scholomance.\nStrategies.\nStrategy 1.\nOther than hitting for a respectable amount of damage and throwing off an occasional shadowbolt volley that hits for moderate damage, Kormok can be looked at as an upgraded &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20Dark%20Summoner\"&gt;Scholomance Dark Summoner&lt;/a&gt; fight.\nThe trick here lies in maintaining proper &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Consecration\"&gt;Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Challenging%20Shout\"&gt;Challenging Shout&lt;/a&gt; etc. are all excellent ways to keep the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s off of casters while the melee does its thing. 3-4 &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Explosion\"&gt;Arcane Explosion&lt;/a&gt;s will also take care of a wave of skeletons. Depending on how your group is built you may want to alternate CC'ing the adds with &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;'ing them down in order to make things more manageable for the healer(s).\nHe will summon waves of 4 skeletal warriors every 10\u201315 seconds. They are non-elite with 1500 life and will go down easy to AoE. At 50% and 25% of life he will summon 2 lvl 60 elite Skeletal Mages. They will focus fire on healer immediately. They also will cast a Fire AoE spell centered on themselves every 5 seconds. The key to the fight is to switch DPS and kill mages as soon as they spawn. If DPS on Kormok continues, it's possible to have 4 of them spawned at same time.\nKormok's Bone Shield should be dispelled whenever it's up as it will absorb damage and reflect a lot of shadow damage to your melee attackers. He starts the battle with it on and will recast it periodically throughout the fight.\nStrategy 2.\nAfter a few tries in which we went mainly for DPS on the spawns, we arrived at the conclusion that all spawns are time based, not % based.\nWe then proceeded to ignore the spawns and DPS the boss down with all cooldowns and a 2h recklessness bomb by our warrior. He has about 25k health, and goes down faster than you can say \"weakling\". He also hits like a kitten (800 on cloth, about 400 on a zerking warrior).\nIgnore the spawns wasn't quite what happened, as we wanted the priest to be able to do (surprise!) DPS, as such, the warrior and the rogue each used a &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water&lt;/a&gt; on the skeletons after the second spawn wave aggroed on the priest. This is enough to kill both waves, and his shield can take the rest of the punishment.\nWe're mostly high-end blue geared, friends group, definitely not lvl 58's with greens. Your mileage may vary. The recklessness bomb is highly recommended.\nAlso, note that the reason for our going a different path was the lack of a mage - the group's spellcaster is a warlock.\nStrategy 3.\nThis is the strategy that worked best for us so far. All hug him and start high DPS. He doesn't hit that hard. Make sure his shield is dispelled at all times. When spawns come have a mage or warlock AoE them. That way Kormok takes damage as well. Have a rogue take care of the first set of mages and try to interrupt the other. They don't hit that hard anyway. This way Kormok goes down fast and you don't have to go through a gazillion spawned non-elite skeletons to kill him."}

But then the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; came, trapping the behemoth and attempting to break his will. They were entirely unsuccessful... that is, until the rise of , and the fel power that Kormrok could not resist.\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"In general, the lower floor of Hellfire Citadel reflects the Iron Horde as it was before the influence of Gul\u2019dan, whereas the upper reaches reflect the and the Legion more directly. Alongside siege machinery, the massive beasts of Gorgrond were the other lynchpin of the Iron Horde\u2019s invasion force, so it should come as little surprise that Gul\u2019dan would seek to corrupt and empower them with fel energies.\"\nOverview.\nKormrok periodically jumps to the nearest fel pool of energy, empowering one of his abilities for a short duration depending on which pool he entered.\nAbilities.\nMutating Hatred.\nKormrok will use different abilities against his current tank target based on the last pool he leapt into. Getting hit with any of these abilities afflicts the victim with Fel Touch.\nStrategy.\nThe fight requires 2 tanks due to the Fel Touch ability he places on tanks whenever he uses one of his Mutated Hatred abilities. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; should be used as soon as Kormrok completes his first leap. The boss will use the same three abilities (Grasping Hands, Explosive Runes, and Fel Outpouring) throughout the encounter, but once he jumps into the pool that corresponds to that ability ,(Green=GH Orange=ER Purple=FO) that ability will become temporarily empowered. The normal abilities are usually a mere hindrance, but the empowered abilities are all deadly. The raid should decide before the fight starts which order of pools they will do, as Kormrok jumps into the pool he is close to, but not one he has jumped into recently. This means the raid will go through his full set of empowerments before the pools reset. \nThe raid must decide beforehand which order they want to do the pools in. As Empowered Explosive Runes is the ability most likely to cause a wipe due to the unorthodox mechanic of pushing the runes, many raids choose to start with orange as it gives immediate practice with one of the fight's hardest mechanics.\nBasic Abilities.\nExplosive Runes will cause several glowing red runes to spawn around the arena. If left unattended, they will grow and explode, causing massive fire damage to the raid Decide on a team of about 5 players beforehand to handle these runes by simply stepping on them. Grasping Hands causes hands of earth to reach out and grab the players, hurting them over time and keeping them immobile. Once the hands come up, they also inflict heavy damage to those within 4 yards of those inflicted. For this reason, the raid should stack \"loosely\" around a player marked with a raid marker, keeping 4 yards apart: far enough to avoid the initial damage, but close enough for AOE to hit most of the hands. Fel Outpouring will cause small waves of water to pour slowly from the purple pool toward the raid. They are slow enough to dodge without much trouble unless Grasping Hands are still up. Lastly, Kormrok will use Pound to cause raid-wide AOE damage that is amplified if raiders are within 6 yards, so spread out during Pound. Pound is Kormrok's only offensive ability that is not affected or empowered and is used throughout the fight. \nEmpowered Abilities.\nThe orange pool grants Explosive Burst and Empowered Explosive Runes. Tanks who are hit with Explosive Burst will become immobile and radiate fire damage to those close by. The other tank should pull the boss away and the raid should stay away from the afflicted tank until the debuff wears off. Empowered Explosive Runes will spawn and do damage the same as normal runes, but with the twist that, once a rune is stepped on, it will respawn a distance away where the character who stepped on it was facing. Ergo, when a character steps on the runes, they are effectively pushing it where they are facing. All of the runes must be pushed to the center of the arena, as once they are all bunched together, they cannot respawn on top of each other. The rune team should ideally consist of players with speed buffs who can take care of the runes quickly before they explode, before returning to the boss. \nThe green pool grants Crushing Hand and changes Grasping Hands to Dragging Hands. Crushing Hand will hit the tank with a Grasping Hand with more HP and does more damage over time. Kill it to free the tank, but Dragging Hands take priority. These hands will grab all raid members (aside from the tank currently fighting Kormrok) and begin dragging them towards the pool closest to them. For simplicity's sake, stack up closer to the green pool than the others, and destroy the hands, as one can still attack and cast while being dragged. Channeled AOE like &lt;a href=\"Blizzard\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; will be less reliable here due to the hands moving. \nThe purple pool will grant Swat and Empowered Fel Outpouring. Swat will fling Kormrok's current tank very far backwards, which can lead to a tank's death if they are not back against a wall and they land in a pool. There are 2 ways a group can handle this. They can stack against the wall of stone in between the purple and green pools, allowing quick tank-swapping and minimal movement. Alternatively, they can stand against the wall of iron between the purple and orange pools, allowing the raid more time and room to dodge the Empowered Fel Outpouring. Empowered Fel Outpouring will send larger waves from all three pools toward the center of the arena, though they will keep moving until they hit a wall. Standing near the center of the arena is not recommended, as you will need to be dodging all three pool's waves at once, while standing near one of the walls sees only one or two pool's waves coming at you. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
