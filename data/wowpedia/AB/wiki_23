With his army of undead, Arthas killed Sage Truthbearer, Ballador the Bright, Uther the Lightbringer, and their forces. On the corpse of his former master, Arthas took the urn of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; for himself.\nBurial.\nUther's body was retrieved by his remaining soldiers, and buried in a great tomb built for him to the south of the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, vigilantly guarded by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thel%27danis\"&gt;High Priest Thel'danis&lt;/a&gt;, the caretaker of the tomb.

Its High Priest summoned a protective barrier over the tomb. Thel'danis and &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; were then aided by the paladins of the Silver Hand.\nThe priest champions of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; visited the holy tomb as one of the sites to get &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;pure Light&lt;/a&gt; from.

Many of the &lt;a href=\"Cleric\"&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt;s were slain during the First War, and so the Archbishop devoted himself to rebuilding the Order as to provide the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with hope and faith. Knowing that this war with the unholy &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s could not end soon, Uther discerned that the Archbishop's new Order must be able to defend the people as well as heal them. Thus, young Uther took up sword and shield and issued the call to the most pious amongst the &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Many great Knights heeded Uther's beckoning and joined the Order which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. With the strength of arms - and faith - possessed by these &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, Uther hopes to bear witness to the free people of the &lt;a href=\"Northlands\"&gt;Northlands&lt;/a&gt; that the Orcish Horde can be cast back into the stygian pits that spawned them.\nSpells.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;spirit of mankind&lt;/a&gt; is everywhere, so the Holy Vision of the Paladin extends to all corners of the land. The area unveiled by this incantation grants the Paladin knowledge of the terrain and of all those who may dwell there. When this spell dims, the Paladin maintains knowledge of the lands he has seen, although he loses sight of the denizens in these lands.\nAiding our brethren in times of pain and illness remains the fundamental concern of any within the holy &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt;. By focusing his spiritual powers, the Paladin can heal those who have been wounded in battle. While only one being at a time may be healed in this fashion, it serves to replenish the strength and courage of all who strive for victory against the unfeeling &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCalling upon the forces of &lt;a href=\"light\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; and purity, the Paladin is able to dispel the &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;walking dead&lt;/a&gt; that plague the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Exorcism can be used to cause injury to entire groups of these &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; terrors, or to utterly eradicate a lone creature. These creatures of Hades seem to gain strength in numbers, thus the greater number of undead that are exorcised within a group, the less actual damage each undead will take. This act is extremely taxing upon the Paladin, making it necessary for him to observe a period of rest before once again invoking this great power."}

He was held to be the wisest and most noble of all the holy paladins.\nFollowing the war, Uther and his paladins kept the peace in Lordaeron for years, settling civil disputes and quelling &lt;a href=\"demi-human\"&gt;demi-human&lt;/a&gt; uprisings throughout the realm. A hero of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and a faithful ally of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, he became the master of his son &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and made him a paladin of the order.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Uther fought the undead across the Kingdom of Lordaeron and investigated the source of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. When Arthas ordered the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, Uther refused to purge the city and its infected citizens and departed with his men to warn the king after the Silver Hand was suspended by the prince. During the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Uther was betrayed and murdered by his beloved pupil, while defending the &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt; carrying the ashes of Terenas at &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the moment of his death, &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; shattered Uther's soul into two fragments, with one being held captive inside the &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; while another was brought to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; plane of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; to become one of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt;, albeit with fragmented memories. Uther played a key role in the rise of the rebel &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; alongside their leader, &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt;, but he later realized the error of his ways. After his memories and soul were healed, he led the Forsworn to rejoin the rest of the kyrians and helped the heroes of Azeroth to stop &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nRise to paladinship.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Uther was an accomplished &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; and a devout worshiper of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; since his youth. He was also a student of &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, having met the priest when he was simply a &lt;a href=\"bishop\"&gt;bishop&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and the latter served as Uther's spiritual advisor and mentor.\nWhen the survivors and &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; from the south emerged in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Uther went to &lt;a href=\"Balnir%20Farmstead\"&gt;Balnir Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; in order to get Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who was watching the birth of his steed &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, back to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. On their way back, the knight told the prince about the fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the coming of Prince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;royal palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fall of Stormwind, and the slaughter &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Order%20of%20Northshire%20Clerics\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, made Faol realize that sometimes faith was not enough to combat the evil forces of the world. With Lothar's permission, and the aid of Uther, the Archbishop recruited a handful of knights to create a new order that could fight the enemy with both the gift of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and martial prowess. He offered Uther a place among them, as one of the five candidates from Lordaeron to start the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile traveling with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s army, Uther and the others were trained vigorously day and night by Faol, who taught them how to use the Light to comfort their allies, to smite their enemies and how to lead by example, as they would be more than weapons but beacons of hope to guide the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As their training progressed, Faol presented each of the paladins with enchanted &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s that were among the church's most ancient relics. Each libram represented a core trait of the Silver Hand that Faol challenged his students to become the living embodiment of, and Uther was given the Libram of Justice. At the &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, Uther became the first and Supreme Leader of the new order. It was a glorious moment for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and believers of the Holy Light. As Lothar often checked on the emergent order, he was so pleased by what he saw that he asked for Turalyon and Uther to serve as his lieutenants, and the Archbishop was happy to accommodate the supreme commander, but he did not release the paladins from his care yet. It would be weeks before Uther and the others were ready to set foot on the battlefield.\nSecond War and aftermath.\nAs the Supreme leader of the Silver Hand, Uther participated in some of the bloodiest conflicts of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. During the first major battle between the Orcish Horde and the Alliance of Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, Uther and his paladins had finished their training and rode through the Alliance lines, their presence filling their fellow soldiers with hope and courage. When the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; entered the field and began to slaughter the Alliance troops, a blazing white light appeared from Uther and his holy knights, striking down the reanimated human corpses and sweeping away the death knights' corruptive fog. On the battlefield, Uther's command had such presence that his knights at times seemed both invincible and unstoppable.\nFollowing the end of the battle, Uther embarked on the island of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; on a mission to aid and comfort those suffering from the war, there he was ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; pirates. After the naval battle, some of the sailors were captured and Uther uncovered a conspiracy that would reveal that Alterac had betrayed the Alliance. During questioning in Lordaeron's capital, they confessed their nation's treachery to the Alliance, leading to Alterac's eventual ruin.\nDuring the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, Lothar sent Uther and his paladins to Lordaeron, in order to make sure that the region was safe again from the orcs. After Uther completely eliminated the orc presence in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he also aided Lothar in the final battle of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Uther expressed his happiness at seeing Turalyon's faith finally emerge, and he was named \"Lightbringer\" by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, a brother paladin who he had trained and the lieutenant of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. Against the latter's expectation, Uther did nothing against Turalyon's promotion as Supreme Commander of the Alliance of Lordaeron, and instead was delighted that it was he who took the place of Lothar. Eventually, the Lightbringer led the final assault against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; alongside Turalyon, the Azerothian side of the Dark Portal was destroyed, thanks in part to the bravery and skill of Uther the Lightbringer and the Order of the Silver Hand.\nAfter the Horde's defeat at the end of the Second War, Uther along with Turalyon and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; were stationed in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with their main base being the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. The city was still being rebuilt after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, and the Cathedral was one of the few places complete. There Uther helped the sick, injured, orphaned, old and occasionally helped women give birth. Even &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; shared a tease about the paladins being reduced to 'nurses'.\nIn the years following the Second War, Uther continued to serve as a stalwart &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, protector of the Alliance and its people, a shining example to aspiring &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s. With his paladins, he maintained peace in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; by settling civil disputes among men and suppressing &lt;a href=\"demi-human\"&gt;demi-human&lt;/a&gt; uprisings throughout the realm. As he became the most elite of the remaining paladins, he began to tutor King &lt;a href=\"Terenas\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt;'s talented son, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, in the way of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and in fighting. He had to keep an eye on Arthas during his youth. They became good friends and knew each other like family. Considering the prince more of a favored nephew than a pupil, Uther has taken a keen interest in Arthas' development and his wish to see Arthas become worthy of his father's crown is the only thing that has kept him from retiring and taking his due rest. Uther once accompanied Terenas on a diplomatic mission to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Uther was also present at Arthas' ceremonial of becoming a paladin and gave him a pair of ceremonial shoulder plates and the blessing of the Light. Arthas continued to train under Uther. With the passing of time, Uther increasingly withdrew into the spiritual aspect of the Light.\nLater, when news of an upstart &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; rallying the few remaining &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;orc clans&lt;/a&gt; in revolt against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; internment camps began to unfold, King Terenas sent Uther and his &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to quell the warchief's uprising. The crafty orcs could never be found, however. The young warchief proved to be something of a tactical genius \u2013 and evaded Uther's best efforts to corral his hit and run attacks.\nOf Blood and Honor.\nYears later, Uther led the &lt;a href=\"Major%20trial\"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. After he heard the statements of Tirion as well as &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barthilas\"&gt;Barthilas&lt;/a&gt;, he managed to convince the jurors - Archmage &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, Archbishop Faol, Prince Arthas, and Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; - to give Tirion another chance in light of his long years of service to Lordaeron and its allied kingdoms: to reaffirm his commitment to Alliance and forsake his vow of honor to &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, which would grant Tirion a full pardon. While Tirion reconfirmed his commitment to the Alliance, however, he could not throw away his vow to Eitrigg. Disappointed with this answer, Uther &lt;a href=\"Excommunication\"&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; Tirion to be cut off from the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, the paladinship and to be sent into exile. Because of their friendship, however, Uther's last courtesy to the former paladin was that his family, &lt;a href=\"Karandra%20Fordring\"&gt;Karandra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Taelan&lt;/a&gt;, did not have to be exiled.\nComing of the Scourge.\nAs the troubles of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; first began, King Terenas feared that Thrall would soon manage to gather all the remaining renegade orcs hidden in the lands of Lordaeron, which would be critical for the kingdom, he ordered Uther with the Knights of the Silver Hand and his son to ride towards southern Lordaeron, in order to contain the orcish threat and deal with them once and for all. The old paladin was honored that Arthas joined him in defending the town of &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; from raiding &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; renegades of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blackrock Clan&lt;/a&gt;. While Uther defended the town, Arthas engaged the encamped orcs. With Uther's help, Arthas managed to destroy the encampment, and kill the blademaster.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; released the plague of undeath upon Lordaeron, Uther was to visit &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt; once again, but the island fell to the plague before that. Consequently, he and his fellow paladins investigated the infected regions in the hope of finding a way to stop the plague, but despite their efforts, the plague continued to spread and threatened to tear the Alliance apart.\nAt some point, he unexpectedly met &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, she had come rushing from &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; with news that the town was under heavy attack by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Uther rushed to the defense with the Silver Hand at his back, but the town had taken severe damage, and Arthas was barely holding out. Horrified, humiliated, and disturbed by his near-defeat, Arthas quickly left for &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, where he hoped to engage &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;. When Uther joined Arthas on his quest, he sensed that something was amiss with the young paladin, but it did not concern him, as he knew his apprentice could be headstrong. The prince simply wanted to do what was best for his people, and Uther believed he would come to his senses. At Stratholme, Uther discovered how wrong he was, the citizens had already been infected with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, and Arthas ordered Uther to purge the city. The old paladin was horrified and refused to do so, he and his paladins were disgusted at the thought of killing innocents. They would take no part in this slaughter, and their disobedience pushed Arthas to charge them with treason, he then relieved him from command, suspended the paladins from service, and sent them away (&lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand%23Status%20during%20the%20Third%20War\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the conflicting info).\nFollowing the purge, Uther informed King Terenas Menethil of his son's inhumane actions in Stratholme, and much to the sorrow of the King, they agreed that Arthas' judgment, and perhaps sanity, was wavering. Together they decided that Arthas had been compromised, most likely from the stress he endured at Hearthglen, and ordered an emissary to find him and order him to return from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The prince finally did return some weeks later, though he was somehow different. Nevertheless, &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s capital erupted in a festival to celebrate their returning hero. The festivity turned to horror as Arthas proceeded into the throne room and impaled his father on the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nFour days after the death of Terenas, Uther ordered &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Champions of Peace&lt;/a&gt; to guard the cemetery near &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, where the remains of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; were buried. As the Scourge swept over Lordaeron, panic seized the living and many gave in to despair, while some looked to the holy paladins for salvation. Lord Uther was the greatest of these righteous warriors, and if anyone had the power to stop the fallen prince, it was him. At the same time, Terenas was ceremonially cremated and ensconced within a &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;magical urn&lt;/a&gt;. Having lost two friends to the darkness, Uther volunteered to personally guard the urn in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nDespite the horrifying conditions, Andorhal was one of the few places in Lordaeron still under Alliance control. There, Uther and many of the surviving paladins had gathered in the city. They use it as a headquarters from which they launched attacks against the Scourge. The town was later raided by Arthas and his undead minions, who sought the magical urn for necromantic purposes. The Supreme commander stood against Arthas and his minions in an epic battle and initially had the upper hand. The &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; Frostmourne clashed with Uther's legendary &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Hammer of the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, and each weapon blow erupted in a shower of warring energies. It was a struggle between Light and Darkness, between life and death. The legendary paladin held his own against Arthas and did what no one else ever had, he bested the death knight in combat and sent the unholy warrior sprawling to the ground. Sending Frostmourne flying from his hands, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;'s aura around Uther grew blindingly bright as he prepared the killing blow, when suddenly the sword seemed to find its own way back into Arthas' hands and he was granted more power by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. The battle began to turn in Arthas's favor. Eventually, Uther, covered in blood from his wounds, fell to his knees and told Arthas he hoped there was a special place in hell waiting for him. Arthas replied that they may never know because he intended to live forever, then delivered the killing blow.\nAt the moment of his death, the Lightbringer was praying to the Light to save his soul. Frostmourne shattered Uther's soul into fragments: one was devoured by the blade, while another was brought by the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. His soul was not divided into one noble and one cruel part; rather, it was as the portion of his consciousness devoured by Frostmourne became frozen in time while the rest of his soul carried on.\nThe Paragon &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; personally welcomed Uther's soul upon his arrival in Bastion, informing him that his selflessness in life had earned him the opportunity to shed his mortal burdens and train to become a kyrian Ascended ferrying souls to the Shadowlands. Uther struggled to accept his new purpose, as he felt that his work was not done and that he still had to bring Arthas to justice. As time passed, Devos continued watching over Uther's soul, concerned that his soul seemed broken and that this was why he was failing to let go of his memories and ascend.\nEventually, Devos looked into Uther's memories and discovered that his soul had been literally wounded by Frostmourne, which she recognized as an instrument of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the realm of eternal suffering. She realized that the power of the Maw was running rampant on Azeroth and that if Uther's memories had been purged as the path demanded, the kyrian would've never learned of this danger. However, when she brought her concerns to &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt;, she was dismissed. In response, Devos returned to Uther and asked if he still wanted to punish Arthas. When Uther responded that he did, Devos allowed Uther to ascend without purging his memories, and told him that on the moment of Arthas' death, the two would claim his soul.\nUther's Tomb.\nFollowing his battle with Arthas, Uther's death heralded the end of Andorhal's resistance and the city fell under the control of the Scourge. Later, Uther's body was recovered and buried in a &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;great tomb&lt;/a&gt; built for him to the south of the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. Located in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, east of &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;, the tomb is the only light in a land of darkness and is vigilantly guarded by its caretaker &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thel%27danis\"&gt;High Priest Thel'danis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Uther himself appeared at his tomb as a ghost. Following the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth and their introduction into the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Truuen\"&gt;Anchorite Truuen&lt;/a&gt; wished to honor Uther by finding and bringing to his tomb a holy relic he possessed at the time of his death. After the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; joined the Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;blood knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; wished to defile the aforementioned relic, and subsequently the tomb itself, in order to seek revenge for Uther's training of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; - the despoiler of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Both of them involved &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to travel &lt;a href=\"Taelan%27s%20Tower\"&gt;outside&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the &lt;a href=\"%3AMark%20of%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;:Mark of the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a result of his tomb's defilement, Uther's spirit was compelled to confront the Horde adventurer, and expressed sorrow that Mehlar's heart had turned so dark, and hoped that his former pupil would see the Light again and turn his efforts to restoring &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. For bringing him back his sacred relic, Uther's spirit manifested and thanked the draenei and the adventurer for their tribute.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the portion of Uther's spirit trapped within &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; was summoned forth from the blade by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;. He warned them that someone must take the place of the Lich King if Arthas is destroyed and that the Lich King can only be destroyed at the place he was created - the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Uther was also involved in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Return%20of%20Quel%27Delar%20quest%20chain\"&gt;reforge&lt;/a&gt; of the prismatic blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;. When an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; entered the Halls of Reflection with the &lt;a href=\"%3ATempered%20Quel%27Delar\"&gt;:Tempered Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; and approached Frostmourne's altar, the sword came to life and attacked them, while Uther appeared to warn them that the blade draws the essence of evil from the place and that if they wish to cleanse it, they must take it to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Arthas was ultimately defeated at the Frozen Throne, the kyrian portion of Uther's soul claimed his spirit alongside Devos at the moment of his death. However, instead of bringing him to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to be judged by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, the two brought Arthas directly to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to cast him into it. Uther initially hesitated, remembering that the Lich King had once been his student. Devos urged him to take his vengeance; Uther replied that it was not vengeance, but justice. He then let go of Arthas and watched with satisfaction as he fell into the Maw.\nAfter the Lich King's death, an adventurer that successfully helped to create &lt;a href=\"%3AShadowmourne\"&gt;:Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt; found a &lt;a href=\"%3ASealed%20Chest\"&gt;:Sealed Chest&lt;/a&gt;, containing multiple objects, among them was a &lt;a href=\"%3ABadge%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;:Badge of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. When they brought it to Uther's soul at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, recently freed from the grip of Frostmourne, the paladin thanked them for bringing him the medal he gave to the prince when he became a paladin, and announced that after so many years of suffering, his soul could finally rest in peace.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, in the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;'s disappearance during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Lord Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; believed that contacting Uther's spirit would allow them to discover the current whereabouts of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, Maxwell and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Champion of the Light&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; and entered after putting the nearby awakened ghosts to rest. Through the power of the Light, Maxwell was able to contact Uther, who revealed that they had to hurry if they wished to recover the Ashbringer and that Tirion still clung to life. Uther then departed, despite Maxwell trying to call him back.\nShadowlands.\nAs &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s journeyed through the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, they encountered Uther who was struggling against dark forces that sought to transform him into a symbol of retribution.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20storyline\"&gt;Bastion storyline&lt;/a&gt;, Uther was seen among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt;, renegade kyrian who fought to retain their memories. When adventurers relived the memories of &lt;a href=\"Lysonia\"&gt;Lysonia&lt;/a&gt;, the lieutenant of Uther's mentor Devos, they found that Uther (\"the vengeful one\" as Lysonia calls him) was deliberately kept unaware of the pact with &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, as he was judged \"unready\". During the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Campaign\"&gt;Kyrian Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, in the ascension ritual for the aspirant &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;, Devos eventually revealed herself as the leader of the Forsworn, and she, Lysonia, and Uther led the attack against the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Spires of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Crest of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; to ensure there could be no more Ascended. After Devos was slain by the adventurers, Lysonia took control, with Uther at her side.\nAfter the kyrian and their mortal allies rebuilt the crest and caught up to Lysonia in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Uther was horrified to discover that Lysonia was in fact under the thrall of &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn was pledged to the Jailer. Lysonia was urged by Helya to take Uther's power to transform herself in order to topple the Archon, &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia the Firstborne&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers were able to stop Lysonia's ritual, and allowed Uther to escape. After he admitted that he had turned a blind eye to Devos' allies, and was blindly loyal to Lysonia, he asked to not be left in the Maw, and thus accompanied everyone back to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the final confrontation at &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;, Lysonia revealed that the wound in Uther's soul caused by Frostmourne opened the power of the Maw to her, just as Uther himself arrived and joined the fight against her. After Lysonia fell, Uther submitted to the Archon's mercy, admitting he did not understand what kind of monsters he had served. &lt;a href=\"Thenios\"&gt;Thenios&lt;/a&gt;, the Paragon of Wisdom, volunteered to take Uther under his care to properly understand the damage done to him by Frostmourne. Uther accepted, saying that he too would like to understand. Uther also confided in the Maw Walker who had joined the Kyrian that he regretted what he did to Arthas, rejecting his prior claim that it was justice.\nChains of Domination.\nUther was in the process of being escorted out of &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; by two ascended when &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who had secretly been turned into an unwilling servant of the Jailer\u2014entered the hold to steal the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; of the Archon. The sight of Anduin caused the former Lightbringer to reach up and touch the wound on his chest.\nThenios concluded that since Uther was killed by a &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt;, his soul had been shattered into fragments and would not be able to heal until the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20Justice\"&gt;lost piece&lt;/a&gt; was recovered. During the covenants' campaign in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, the Paragon therefore sent a Maw Walker to obtain the fragment from the &lt;a href=\"Ossuary%20of%20the%20Banished\"&gt;Ossuary of the Banished&lt;/a&gt;, a vault in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;the Jailer's tower&lt;/a&gt; where he kept soul fragments that Frostmourne had torn from its victims. The hero brought the fragment back to Uther at the &lt;a href=\"Eonian%20Archives\"&gt;Eonian Archives&lt;/a&gt;, where Thenios and &lt;a href=\"Polemarch%20Adrestes\"&gt;Polemarch Adrestes&lt;/a&gt; were discussing how to create a new kyrian sigil to replace the one Anduin stole from the Archon, something that could not be done without appointing a new Paragon of Loyalty and retaking the Forsworn-occupied &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Citadel of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt;. Uther suggested that they should proceed \"through compromise and understanding\" and that he might be of help.\nUther tried to connect to his soul fragment, but the ritual failed despite the help of the Maw Walker, Kleia, and &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;. Thenios concluded that the fragment had been darkened by Frostmourne and that Uther, in order to move past his grief, needed to re-experience his past. His allies used the Paragon's soul mirror to walk Uther through his memories and help him come to terms with the emotions and truths they contained. First, they helped him relive the day that he became a paladin in &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt; and swore to uphold the Three Virtues of respect, tenacity, and compassion, a memory that twisted together with the memory of the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and the grief and regret he felt over Arthas. The group delved deeper, helping Uther relive the day Arthas became a paladin in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. The present-day Uther exclaimed that he should never have convinced the prince to become a paladin and that he was responsible for setting Arthas on the path that led him to slaughter countless innocents, despite Adrestes and Kleia trying to tell him that the prince's betrayal was not his fault. He regrets not listening to Arthas on his doubts and anxiety and instead, put more pressure on the prince about the great expectations that awaited him. The final memory Uther decided he needed to relive was the day of his death in Andorhal. He stated that, on that day, he had failed to uphold the virtue of compassion by facing Arthas as a foe instead of trying to save him. He regrets speaking in anger towards his fallen student about hoping there is a special place in hell just for him. Afterward, Pelagos told Uther that he could rid himself of the painful memories in time, but the Lightbringer replied that they served as \"a reminder of lessons learned\" and that he would never let them go if given the choice.\nThis caused Adrestes to realize that restoring the Citadel of Loyalty was not the right choice for the kyrian and that a new path was needed. Along with Nikolon and other Forsworn who regretted their alliance with the Maw, Uther joined Adrestes as the polemarch addressed the Archon at Elysian Hold and suggested that Loyalty should be replaced with a new virtue: Devotion. The Archon agreed and declared that they should learn from Uther's example: from then on, all kyrian would be offered a choice between keeping their memories or letting them go. Adrestes would become the Paragon of Devotion, with Kleia serving as his Hand. Adrestes, Uther, and the others traveled to the Citadel of Loyalty to reclaim it. While Adrestes, Kleia, and &lt;a href=\"Kynthia\"&gt;Kynthia&lt;/a&gt; worked on rededicating the temple, Uther and Nikolon accompanied the Maw Walker in channeling &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;, collecting &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt; cores, and convincing Forsworn to rejoin the kyrian (with mixed results). Uther took the opportunity to apologize to Nikolon for recruiting him to the Forsworn. Nikolon replied that he had already lost faith in the Archon by the time Uther showed him \"the truth\", but Uther insisted that Nikolon had suffered because of his actions and that he wouldn't let it happen again. After completing their tasks, Uther, Nikolon, and the Maw Walker helped defend Adrestes from a Mawsworn attack while he used the anima to change the path of the temple and turn it into the Temple of Devotion.\nUther and the other Forsworn and kyrian subsequently gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Archon\"&gt;Seat of the Archon&lt;/a&gt; to witness the ceremony in which Adrestes would be promoted to Paragon and the kyrian sigil would be remade. &lt;a href=\"Eridia\"&gt;Eridia&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Lysonia's &lt;a href=\"Soulbinding\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt;\u2014confided in Uther that she still grieved for Lysonia, but Uther assured her that she would heal in time, just as he would. To the Maw Walker, Uther stated that he had let pain and vengeance consume him when he first arrived in Bastion and that he did not know if he could ever forgive himself for what he'd done to Arthas. However, the hero had started him down the path of healing, one that he had to follow to its end even if it pained him. Finally, Uther thanked the Maw Walker for helping him \"find the Light again\". After the ceremony, Pelagos asked Uther what he and Devos had done to Arthas' soul and realized that the fallen prince could've had a chance at redemption if he'd been brought to the Arbiter instead of being thrown into the Maw. Pelagos added that while some souls might never be forgiven, Uther had shown that they must at least be treated with compassion. Uther took those words to heart, now knowing it was not his place to judge Arthas' soul and cast it into the Maw.\nAfter the attack on the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Uther and other covenant representatives were summoned to &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; and delivered their respective sigils to the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; so that he could use them to pursue &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; to his destination. The Lightbringer subsequently stayed at the respite and commented to Maw Walkers that being reunited with the missing part of his soul had caused him to reflect upon the choices he'd made. Uther also reunited with Jaina Proudmoore, whom he had last seen in Stratholme after the culling (not counting the time that the other portion of his soul spoke to her in the Halls of Reflection). The two barely recognized each other at first, with Jaina commenting that becoming a kyrian suited the old paladin. The two shared their memories of Arthas, whom both had loved in their own ways, and Uther advised Jaina that she could choose to leave her painful memories of Arthas behind and instead carry her love forward with her so that it could lend her strength. Jaina thanked him for the advice and asked him to stay a while so that she could talk more with him.\nEternity's End.\nAt the end of the battle in the Sanctum of Domination, the Jailer had discarded his ally &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; after returning a missing fragment of her soul to her. This had caused her to fall unconscious, and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; had brought her to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; for interrogation. Uther, who'd suffered a fate similar to Sylvanas', examined her soul and found that it was divided: the missing fragment, torn from her during her first death, was now forced to endlessly relive the atrocities that the undead Sylvanas had committed. As long as this was the case, she could not wake up. Jaina, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; believed that it was best if she stayed that way since they'd never be able to trust her, but &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; reminded them that she was the only one who could tell them about the Jailer's plan.\nUther got an idea and brought Sylvanas' hand to his own scar from Frostmourne, allowing him to enter her consciousness. He told the Ranger-General portion of her soul that the Banshee Queen was in fact the same person as her, not a separate being wearing her face like she believed. The Ranger-General refused to accept this at first, but Uther backed up his words by revealing how his own soul had also been split by Frostmourne. He then asked if Sylvanas would prove the Jailer right by allowing this realization to destroy her, or if she would accept that the Banshee Queen's legacy was also her legacy and tell the heroes of Azeroth how to stop him; although she might never find forgiveness, they would all be doomed if she didn't make a choice and act soon. Having done all he could, Uther retreated from Sylvanas' mind and stayed by her side in Oribos until finally, his efforts bore fruit and she awoke.\nUther traveled to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt; to bring this news to Bolvar, who argued that it was too risky to trust Sylvanas. However, Uther claimed that he'd make sure Sylvanas didn't betray them again. The Lightbringer later brought Sylvanas herself to meet up with Jaina and Bolvar at the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. She told them that they needed to find a way to resist the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat him, and that rescuing the dominated &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; might be the key. Jaina declared that she would never trust Sylvanas, who had been the one to dominate Anduin in the first place. In response, Uther told her \"Then trust in me\". Jaina was quiet for a moment, then reluctantly replied \"Always, Uther\" and agreed to work with Sylvanas.\nThe Maw Walkers eventually fought their way to Domination's Grasp and confronted and defeated Anduin. Despite the Jailer's efforts, Anduin was able to free himself from Zovaal's control by splitting Kingsmourne in half. This also released the source of his Domination: the last, fading remnant of Arthas Menethil's soul. When Jaina asked if this was all that remained of the prince, Uther confirmed that it was the last flicker of Arthas' scarred spirit, consumed by the forges of the Jailer. Uther silently and mournfully watched as Sylvanas gave her final words to the remnant, closing his eyes as it faded away.\nFollowing Zovaal's death, Sylvanas agreed to face the new &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Arbiter's&lt;/a&gt; judgment in Oribos. As Uther and the Maw Walker escorted Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Arbiter's chamber&lt;/a&gt;, the denizens of the Shadowlands and the souls from Azeroth were given permission to let their voices be heard. Upon hearing their jeers, Uther questioned if they desired justice or vengeance, to which Sylvanas remarked that their anger and pain made it difficult to tell the difference. He then attended Sylvanas' trial, which ended with Tyrande sending her to the Maw to free all of the souls trapped therein. He was amongst those to personally see Sylvanas enter the Maw to begin her penance, where he remarked how everyone has darkness in their hearts and reflected on how his decision to send Arthas into the Maw could easily have been his first step on a path to damnation. He then stated his belief that understanding came from compassion and that compassion that save anyone from darkness, even though it doesn't come easily.\nLegacy.\nAlthough his body was slain, it was not enough to destroy the great champion of Light that Uther was. People visiting his tomb in Western Plaguelands might be able to see the meaning of the words carved on the marker stone by his tomb, for his spirit does live on, appearing to adventurers, members of the Alliance and Horde alike. His ghost expresses wisdom; words of gratitude to those who have come to honor his memory, and words of forgiveness to those who would wish harm for him, even in death.\nUther is generally viewed as a hero and a martyr who was loyal to his nation, order, and king to the death. Being the creator of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, a commander during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and instrumental in rallying the shaken Alliance to victory after the death of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; has immortalized him as one of the greatest knights and holy men ever to live in the eyes of many.\nWestern Plaguelands.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, the headstone shows him in a heroic pose, a tome of Light in one hand, his warhammer in the other. The marker stone before it, written in the Common tongue, reads:\nCaverns of Time.\nUther briefly appears in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; wing &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, reenacting the events of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Culling%20%28WC3%20Human%29\"&gt;The Culling&lt;/a&gt;\", warning &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a statue of Uther replaced that of &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Square\"&gt;Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Terran%20%22Justice%22%20Gregory\"&gt;Terran \"Justice\" Gregory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deva%20Marie%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Deva Marie&lt;/a&gt; honored this great hero's memorial. The plaque of the statue reads:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; recovered the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20Uther\"&gt;Shroud of the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; as well as other artifacts, that they relocated to the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Having all been killed and then raised as undead, the Crusaders couldn't touch the holy artifacts, and so instead kept them in chests. &lt;a href=\"Korfax\"&gt;Korfax&lt;/a&gt; assigned an adventurer to recover all the artifacts on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nSanctum of Light.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, Uther is remembered by the Knights of the Silver Hand through his statue located in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Champions%20%28Sanctum%20of%20Light%29\"&gt;Hall of Champions&lt;/a&gt;. His plaque says: \nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand received the book &lt;a href=\"The%20Light%20and%20How%20to%20Swing%20It\"&gt;The Light and How to Swing It&lt;/a&gt;, written by Uther for Arthas, after &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Mykos\"&gt;Lorekeeper Mykos&lt;/a&gt; removed the mark from the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum%20%28Dire%20Maul%29\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt; and donated it to the Sanctum of Light's archives, thus allowing all paladins to read it.\nEquipment.\nMany items were either owned by Uther or are named in his honor.\nIn the RPG.\nUther is the one who signed the official &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29%23In%20the%20RPG\"&gt;ousting&lt;/a&gt; of the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; nobility.\nPersonality.\nThough zealous and weathered, Uther's eyes show kindness and wisdom. He is Lordaeron's self-appointed defender, but regrets that violence is the only way to solve some problems. Possessing a rich, commanding voice and great physical strength, Uther is also capable of gentleness and compassion, though he does not suffer fools. He is the epitome of the paladin warrior \u2014 a mighty foe to his enemies and a bastion of hope to his allies.\nIn combat.\nUther strides directly into melee, placing himself in the center of the most brutal combat. He places himself in danger to spare his allies. He is at his peak against demons and undead, and brings his full array of spells and abilities to bear against these creatures \u2014 smites, banishing strikes, power turning, searing light from his hammer, hooks of binding and dispel evil. He uses lay on hands to blast undead that resist his hammer. Against truly mighty opponents, Uther attacks with his Big Smash feat. He prefers leading others into battle but fights alone if the situation warrants. Uther endangers himself to help others if he must, and is willing to sacrifice himself for others \u2014 but he does not do so foolishly, as he knows how valuable he is to Lordaeron.\nEquipment.\nHammer of the Lightbringer.\nThe two-handed hammer\u2019s haft is polished mahogany, while the head is &lt;a href=\"adamantine\"&gt;adamantine&lt;/a&gt;. A silver hand emblem rests in a bed of &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; design on either side. This mighty weapon was forged when Archbishop Faol created the Knights of the Silver Hand, and the archbishop bequeathed it to the order\u2019s first Grand Master \u2014 Uther the Lightbringer. A group of paladins recovered the hammer after Uther's death, but none has thought himself worthy of carrying the legendary weapon.\nGloves of the Silver Hand.\nUther Lightbringer is said to have been the first to enchant these gloves to aid him in the battle against the Scourge. These are large, padded leather and mail gloves bleached pure white with the holy symbols of the Silver Hand burned into the palms. Although they are large mail items, they are remarkably light.\nShroud of the Lightbringer.\nAlthough the original shroud that covered the fallen paladin Uther Lightbringer of the Knights of the Silver Hand was lost years ago in frequent skirmishes between the Scourge and the Alliance, rumors of the shroud remain. Some of the remaining priests of the Holy Light have infused linen with power in honor of their fallen champion. These shrouds are made of soft, white linen, about 6 feet by 3 feet. The divine magic used to create these creates a gray image of a dead paladin, usually the face of the creator of the shroud.\nThe Lightbringer.\nUther is universally known as the Lightbringer but he hasn't been always addressed as such. In fact, it was General &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; who got the idea of this nickname after seeing the inspiration that the leader of the Silver Hand had on his men. When he was charged by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and Uther as Supreme Commander of the Alliance he responded:\n\"\"And I thank you, Uther the Lightbringer,\" Turalyon replied, and he saw the older Paladin's eyes widen at the new title. \"For so shall you be known henceforth, in honor of the Holy Light you brought us this day.\" Uther bowed, clearly pleased, then turned without another word and walked back toward the other knights of the Silver Hand, no doubt to tell them their marching orders.\"\nIn previous sources, he had been known as Uther Lightbringer before that point.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nUther is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\". He also guides the player through the game's initial tutorial.\nAlternate timelines.\nA version of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; existed in a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; where history turned out completely different and which was entered by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; era.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" (non-canon to \"World of Warcraft\"), there are five versions of Uther - Uther the Lightbringer, Master Uther, &lt;a href=\"Judgment%20Armor\"&gt;Judgement&lt;/a&gt; Uther (who survived his clash with Arthas and now serves Varian), Lumberjack Uther, and Medic Uther.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer&gt;&lt;/vplayer&gt;"}

He was the author of \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Dominion%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;The Dominion of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;\", which recorded the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde's&lt;/a&gt; actions during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. He was called \"Scratcher\" because of his habit of scribbling rather than mindlessly killing, but he would soon be the one who laughed. For too long his people had ignored their need to record their methods. He was confident that his chronicles would benefit only those who recognized this need, but mostly because there were very few of his kind who could read.\nAs a follower of the mystic arts, he was intensely aware that the devouring of a world was of the highest possible honor in the eyes of their dark &lt;a href=\"God\"&gt;God&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Great Portal&lt;/a&gt; had allowed them the opportunity to do just that, and it was Utok's intent to arm every &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; ally of their clan with knowledge in addition to power; bloodlust was their nature, but passion for destruction required direction. Knowing this he compiled maps from scouting reports, accompanied by descriptions of their orders and military tactics for clarification. The pages were to be the weapon with which his clan ascended above all others, to claim the honor of annihilating the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;new world&lt;/a&gt; and its inhabitants.\nBackground.\nUtok recorded the battles from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;. His unit later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and take their heads. However, they failed their finish and ended up taking the heads of decoys. They then traveled back to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; as the battle continued, to assist in the siege of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey then joined the battle at Lordaeron. They managed to destroy &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;the city's&lt;/a&gt; outer structures and defense and reached its center. They managed to destroy the towers guarding the walled section of the city and the keep. Utok stated all that was left was to start on the interior. He believed the battle was all too easy and it was their destiny to devour the world; however, his report cuts off without discussing the final outcome of the battle in detail.\nSpeculation.\nSince Utok never finished the outcome of the battle, it is possible that he died during the siege of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Or, since the Humans won this war, perhaps Utok was too embarrassed from the outcome."}

Disguised as a Scarshield Infiltrator, he infiltrated Blackrock, where he was joined by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who possessed an &lt;a href=\"Unadorned%20Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Unadorned Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;. The seal had three empty sockets, which had to be filled with three gemstones representing the leadership's command, the &lt;a href=\"Smolderthorn\"&gt;Smolderthorn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Spirestone\"&gt;Spirestone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodaxe%20Legion\"&gt;Bloodaxe&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the seal had to be forged in the flames of the black dragonflight.\nFew of the black dragonkin, outside of those in the upper citadel, had the ability to forge the seal with their own flaming breath. &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Wyrmthalak\"&gt;Overlord Wyrmthalak&lt;/a&gt;, master of the lower citadel, was one such dragonkin, but he would never do it willingly. Instead, the adventurer was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmbog\"&gt;Wyrmbog&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, where they broke the will of the ancient black drake &lt;a href=\"Emberstrife\"&gt;Emberstrife&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Draconic%20Energy\"&gt;Orb of Draconic Energy&lt;/a&gt; on his weakened form, the adventurer managed to take control of his mind and directed his fiery breath toward the seal. Returning to Vaelan, the red dragon cast the final invocation of protection, imbuing the artifact with powerful protective wards. The &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; was complete.\nWhen the heroes confronted &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, they used the Seal of Ascension to summon a projection of Vaelastrasz, who helped them take the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; down. Vaelan later tracked &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; and engaged in a direct confrontation with him. As the heroes entered &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wing%20Lair\"&gt;Shadow Wing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, they witnessed Nefarian, in his human form, magically bending Vaelastrasz to his will. Unleashing the red dragon upon the newcomers, Nefarian retreated from the scene. Before the corruption took completely hold of him, Vaelastrasz blessed the heroes with a fraction of his power, before being forced to face them, and die by their hands.\nVaelastrasz was the holder of a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;shard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, which Nefarian stole from him.\nQuotes.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Warchief Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; encounter use the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; and Vaelastrasz the Red will come to fight with next dialogue during it.\nIn decades past - of now ancient wars and conflicts - our kind was driven to the brink of extinction. Much we have endured, &lt;race&gt;. The onslaught of the Burning Legion. The Demon Soul. The Aspects divided. The ascension of Deathwing. The enslavement of our Queen, Alexstrasza, by the Dragonmaw. Through it all, we have been the unshakable will of the dragons - the undaunted force that has fought to represent our waning existance in this world.\nReaching Vaelan pre-Cataclysm.\nVaelan could be found on a platform above, to the left, just as one entered Hordemar City (Hordemar City is the first area of LBRS after the entrance-hall area). First, players would clear the immediate area. Then they would walk down the rock rumble to reach a path leading straight upwards on the left. It can be dark here and difficult to see. As Vaelan was approached, he'd instantly turn into his human form."}
{"id": "20026", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20026", "title": "Vaelastrasz the Corrupt", "text": "Vaelastrasz the Corrupt is the second boss of &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;. He was corrupted by Nefarian and now serves him unwillingly. \nAbilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Vaelastrasz starts with a much higher percentage of health. In addition, Essence of the Red is now a stacking buff that increases your haste and damage while also dealing damage over time.\nStrategy.\nVaelastrasz is considered one of the most intense fights WoW has yet to release. While the fight can be unbelievably frustrating taking some guilds months to get their first kill once he finally goes down it becomes a favorite of most people who experience it.\nVaelastrasz is an intense, time-critical encounter. It must be completed while Essence of the Red is active. Essence of the Red gives casters 500 mana per second, rogues 50 energy per second, and warriors 20 rage per second. While it is active, mana, energy and rage conservation are non-issues, but it will wear off three minutes after the fight begins, and then healers will no longer be able to keep up with the damage being constantly dished out to the raid. Encounters with Vaelastrasz are often described as \"won at 2:45\" or \"wiped at 3:15\".\nGiven the short time window, Vaelastrasz is most easily killed when the raid has tremendous DPS and adequate healing power. The encounter is a balancing act between threat control and DPS. It will test the raid's abilities on both counts.\nFor the first attempt, Vaelastrasz will be lying on the floor, flagged as friendly. The encounter will begin when the puller (the first main tank) talks to Vael. Should the raid wipe, Vaelastrasz will be positioned in the middle of the room and the raid must stick to the walls when getting repositioned. In this case, the main tank should approach Vaelastrasz head-on to begin the encounter safely.\nPositioning for Vaelastrasz is critical because he has powerful raid-wiping attacks in both the front (cleave) and the rear (tail swipe). These are some suggestions:\n1) Casters (warlocks, mages, and their healers) should be positioned on one side of Vaelastrasz, against the wall, clumped together. Hunters and the tanking line up should be positioned opposite the casters. Rogues will be meleeing Vaelastrasz broadside, staying between front and hind legs to avoid the rear tail swipe knockback and the front cleave attack. Offtanks should be hacking away closer to Vael's front, around his shoulders, ready to move to the main tank's spot. To reduce healing strain, only the next warrior should move toward this position at a time, due to chaining cleaves. The rest should be in a similar position as the rogues.\n2) Ranged DPS and healers should stand against the wall to Vael's right. Melee DPS should be positioned at or just behind Vael's right shoulder (don't get too close to his front). Tanks should stand on the opposite side (Vael's left) near the rear leg. The off-tank should be positioned somewhere near Vael's left foreleg. The purpose of this positioning is to limit the damage that chain cleaves can do. The inevitable spreading-out that melee classes will do if they aren't careful can leave a lot of players vulnerable to chain cleaves, which will propagate from the main tank through the off-tank through the rogues. Every such chain cleave can kill several melee DPS players, and you simply can't afford those losses. If DPS players stay by the right foreleg, they will not be hit by a tail swipe when Vaelastrasz rotates to his left to attack the OT.\nBurning Adrenaline and MT Transitions.\nEvery 15 seconds, Vaelastrasz inflicts a member of the raid with Burning Adrenaline. This debuff effectively turns its target into ticking AoE time bomb, who must move away from their group to avoid a wipe. Every third Burning Adrenaline will be targeted toward whoever is at the top of Vael's hate list (the main tank). All other BA's will be targeted toward random mana users in the raid. Rogues and Druids in feral cat form should not be affected by BA unless they gain aggro, in which case it is generally a guaranteed wipe.\nWhen the main tank is afflicted with BA, the next tank on his hate list must move into his position and take over as the main tank with healing shifting over to the new tank after about 10 seconds, giving the BA-afflicted MT time to deal out some high-damage moves before dropping dead. If the next tank does not pick up aggro after the main tank dies, Vaelastrasz will likely turn toward the side groups and wipe them out with his flame breath. When mana users are afflicted, they must move away from the raid. A good spot for casters is in the very back of the room, behind Vael's tail where they can unload a series of instant cast nukes before they die, helping to mitigate the loss of DPS.\nTips.\nDuring tank transitions, it is important for rogues to &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; and for hunters to &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;. This helps ensure that they aren't above the tanking lineup on Vael's threat list. Mages, Warlocks and Priests generally do not have to worry about their DPS out-threatening the tanks; DPS warriors who gain too much threat can more readily move in to main tank, as can feral druids in bear form. When BA hits the main tank, the next tank in line should move to the tanking spot, spamming threat-generating moves to ensure that Vaelastrasz focuses on him when the MT drops dead.\nThroughout the fight, mages (hopefully with &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Subtlety\"&gt;Arcane Subtlety&lt;/a&gt;) should chain-cast Arcane Missiles, rogues should continuously Backstab and Feint, and other classes should keep as many DoT's on Vaelastrasz as possible (Serpent Sting, Corruption, Shadow Word:Pain, etc.). Warlocks should have Curse of Shadows, Curse of Elements, and Curse of Recklessness on Vaelastrasz at all times to bolster DPS. Priests must make sure to renew their Shadow Word: Pain between heals.\nThe main challenges in mastering Vaelastrasz are having smooth tank transitions, having enough well-geared warriors to constitute the tanking lineup (4-5 is good), careful threat management from the rogues and hunters, having sufficient healing and having sufficient fire resistance on everyone. Mages and Warlocks aren't generally challenged in this fight since their mana is constantly replenished by Essence of the Red. Priests are likewise under no pressure to conserve mana, though they have to watch their timing as usual.\nRogues can do tremendous damage in this fight, especially those that are dagger-specced. Rogues are essentially set free by Essence of the Red. They can repeatedly backstab with little or no thought to their energy level. It is critical to use &lt;a href=\"Feint\"&gt;Feint&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible throughout the battle, however, and to use &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; on the first transition or when the first MT gets BA. This will keep the rogue's threat relatively low so the second Warrior can hold aggro. \nOne technique that can prove useful is having a suitably geared druid in bear form as the first tank. As long as they are specced and equipped appropriately, they will have no aggro problems, and this keeps one more warrior alive to &lt;a href=\"Execute\"&gt;Execute&lt;/a&gt; when Vael's health drops below twenty percent.\nFire Resistance.\nHaving high fire resistance for everyone in the raid is critical in this fight. Main tanks in particular should max out on fire resistance so they take as little damage as possible from Vael's fire nova and flame breath. Healers should also make fire resistance a top priority; the Essence of the Red buff provides essentially unlimited mana, so spirit and mana regeneration gear is unnecessary, while intellect gear is only useful for its increased spell critical bonus. \n\"Hint:\" Take your raid (10 players at time) to &lt;a href=\"UBRS\"&gt;UBRS&lt;/a&gt; and Mind Control one or more Scarshield Spellbinder (you can find them just at the entrance under the bridge). These mobs can provide all players with a +81-83 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20resistance\"&gt;Fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; buff. This buff stacks with all other buffs that provide fire resistance. This takes a lot of time, so it is preferable to do it once your strategy is very well understood by your raid. A Blizzard representative (Caydiem) has confirmed that this is not an exploit.\nYou may also find it handy to bring along a batch of &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Resistance%20Potion\"&gt;Magic Resistance Potion&lt;/a&gt;s. They are cheap to make and last exactly three minutes. For raids with players that aren't especially well-equipped, this buff can make a difference, enabling tanks and DPS classes to replace inferior fire resistance equipment with something that provides better endurance and damage output (helping to end the fight within the crucial three minute window). Keep in mind, however, that magic resistance potions do not stack with Fire Resist auras or totems; these potions are therefore most useful for members of those groups that do not have a shaman or paladin, or players that are too far away to receive those FR buffs. \nAnother option for extra fire resistance is the &lt;a href=\"Juju%20Ember\"&gt;Juju Ember&lt;/a&gt;, which adds +15 fire resist for 10 minutes.\nMages should Hotkey their Fire Ward and use those few precious seconds to fire off some Frostbolts. If timed right, you can get off two. In the long run, anyone with the following talent build will do much more damage with those two frostbolts every 30secs than all the Arcane Missiles being spammed.\nAlthough fire resistance is a must for this fight, it's important to remember that the fight needs to be over within three minutes, so when preparing for the encounter you should make sure your raid does not sacrifice too much DPS. Mages, rogues, warlocks, hunters, and pure-DPS warriors should all ideally have at least 180 fire resistance, but after that DPS is important too. If you can't bring Vaelastrasz down by the time Essence of the Red expires, the battle will likely be lost no matter how strong your fire resistance is!\nAnother good idea would be to get a trinket it adds 15 FR and has a use effect that increases fire resist by 50 more points as well as reducing all fire damage by 25.\nVaelastrasz was the first real guild killer in World of Warcraft. Guilds have broke down over Vaelastrasz. Spending hundreds of gold on repairs singly! He is arguably harder then Nefarian himself. - The World of Warcraft Dungeon companion.\nSolo strategy.\nVaelastrasz casts Burning Adrenaline on a mana user after 15 seconds, and Burning Adrenaline will kill its target regardless of level in less than 20 seconds. Vaelastrasz has 1 million health, and generously assuming a mana user lasts 30 seconds, they must put out 33,310 DPS to kill Vaelastrasz before the Burning Adrenaline finishes the player off. To beat the Burning Adrenaline cast, players must put out 66,620 DPS as an absolute minimum. Non-mana users will not have Burning Adrenaline cast on them until 45 seconds in, so they require 22,200 DPS.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The original Val'kyr are warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; created to serve the Prime Designate &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; by bringing the spirits of the glorious dead to his &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. The Val'kyr of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; acted as the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s agents in the spirit world and were described by &lt;a href=\"Thoralius%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Thoralius the Wise&lt;/a&gt; as fearsome creatures made of pure nightmare. After the defeat of the Lich King, several Val'kyr came to serve the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. After the Banshee Queen's desertion of the Forsaken and the Horde, her remaining Val'kyr followed and returned to directly serving the Jailer's forces.\nBackground.\nThe first Val'kyr were created in ancient times by the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;titanic keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, who disagreed with the other keepers' uplifting of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and decided to form his own elite army to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He offered &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; warriors who died in glorious combat the opportunity to become part of his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. However, Odyn first had to find a way to take the spirits of these departed vrykul from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; to the Halls of Valor. With the help of his adopted daughter, the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; sorceress &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;, Odyn contacted the powerful spirit &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; and sacrificed &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;his eye&lt;/a&gt; to him in exchange for the ability to gaze into the Shadowlands. There he saw the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, winged beings responsible for ferrying the souls of the dead to the afterlife, and decided to create his own beings based on them. These \"Val'kyr\" would travel between the Shadowlands and the physical world to guide souls to the Halls of Valor, but would also be cursed to a wraithlike existence for eternity. Since no vrykul volunteered for the task, Odyn decided to create his servants by force, a plan Helya vehemently objected to. Seeing Helya's disobedience as a threat to his plans, Odyn shattered her physical form, twisted her spirit into the first Val'kyr, and ordered her to begin transforming other unwilling vrykul into Val'kyr as well. Helya was forced to obey Odyn's commands but nursed resentment against him for millennia, ultimately causing her to rebel against him with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the current day, Valarjar Val'kyr are ascended warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt;, who prove their worth to &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; in order to become Val'kyr. As Val'kyr, they take worthy vrykul warriors who die with glory in battle to the Halls of Valor, where they will feast and battle for eternity as part of Odyn's Valarjar. Val'kyr are considered \"sunborne\" when they are honored in the presence of Odyn. They are also considered warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, which Odyn also follows.\nFrom the vrykul in his service, the Lich King learned of the Val'kyr and their ability to corral spirits and even delve into the Shadowlands, the realm of the death. The Lich King tried to create his own Val'kyr, but the task proved difficult even for him. After missteps, he finally succeeded and the Scourge Val'kyr were born. The Val'kyr greatly enchanted his ability to control the dark powers of undeath. Some of his Val'kyr were also corrupted original Val'kyr, twisted and bent to his will.\nThe vrykul bard, &lt;a href=\"Helgus\"&gt;Helgus&lt;/a&gt;, who lived in the town of &lt;a href=\"Nifflevar\"&gt;Nifflevar&lt;/a&gt;, wrote three sagas, one of which was the &lt;a href=\"Saga%20of%20the%20Val%27kyr\"&gt;Saga of the Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. This is ancient knowledge. It is unknown if other mentions of the Val'kyr in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; are references to the original Val'kyr, or are direct references to the Lich King's Val'kyr forces.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; Val'kyr were described as warrior maidens of old and each was the greatest warrior of her generation. They are sisters who served the warriors of the north in life, and chose to continue [their] service in death. An unknown amount of them were created from the female &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valkyrion\"&gt;Valkyrion&lt;/a&gt;, who fought and trained to receive the Lich King's unusual gift. At least &lt;a href=\"Svala%20Sorrowgrave\"&gt;one example&lt;/a&gt; exists of a female vrykul being turned into a Val'kyr at another location as well. Those that were deemed worthy underwent the transformation from vrykul to Val'kyr. It is said that the Val'kyr serve to judge the fate of vrykul combatants, transforming the favored contestants to &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;Ymirjar&lt;/a&gt;, and the failed contestants to the ranks of the undead &lt;a href=\"Vargul\"&gt;Vargul&lt;/a&gt;. Val'kyr are considered \"unborn\" until they vanquish a creature of high nobility.\nBeyond this, the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20Battle-maiden\"&gt;Val'kyr Battle-maiden&lt;/a&gt;s also watched the fates of the training &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Acherus\"&gt;Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, making sure the newly born warriors didn't fall in battle before their time. These Val'kyr were acting much like &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Healer\"&gt;spirit healers&lt;/a&gt;. If they fell in battle, the Val'kyr would return them to their unlife. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Ebon%20Hold\"&gt;Battle for the Ebon Hold&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the death knights were freed, they were aiding the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Annhylde%20the%20Caller\"&gt;Annhylde the Caller&lt;/a&gt; was a part of the &lt;a href=\"Ingvar%20the%20Plunderer\"&gt;Ingvar the Plunderer&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Upon Ingvar's death, Annhylde judged Ingvar and found him unworthy. Annhylde resurrects him as &lt;a href=\"Vargul\"&gt;Vargul&lt;/a&gt; and begins phase two of the fight giving him a second chance.\n&lt;a href=\"Geirrvif\"&gt;Geirrvif&lt;/a&gt; was appointed to oversee the trials of &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;; judging those worthy to ascend to the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;Ymirjar&lt;/a&gt;, while those unworthy became &lt;a href=\"Vargul\"&gt;Vargul&lt;/a&gt;s. She is notably extremely friendly to the adventurers, expressing genuine joy at seeing them return to fight in the arena and holding no ill-will or threats towards them.\n&lt;a href=\"Fjola%20Lightbane\"&gt;Fjola Lightbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eydis%20Darkbane\"&gt;Eydis Darkbane&lt;/a&gt; are two very powerful Val'kyr that were originally sent by the Lich King along with their &lt;a href=\"Vengeful%20Val%27kyr\"&gt;Vengeful Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; army to disrupt, destroy, and terrorize the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; and its citizens. But during this attack, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress\"&gt;Argent Confessor Paletress&lt;/a&gt; came to the defense of the tournament and battled the twins. Paletress was victorious, and Fjola and Eydis were captured. Their bonds were maintained by &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Alorah\"&gt;Priestess Alorah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Priest%20Grimmin\"&gt;Priest Grimmin&lt;/a&gt;. They later appeared as the final challenge of the coliseum after the raid defeated the Faction Champions.\nEdge of Night.\nAfter the events took place within the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, and the death of Arthas, nine of the Scourge's Val'kyr remained at the Frozen Throne. These nine, led by &lt;a href=\"Annhylde%20the%20Caller\"&gt;Annhylde the Caller&lt;/a&gt;, were bound to the will of their new dormant Lich King. Imprisoned atop the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, possibly for eternity, they hungered for their freedom. To gain this freedom they needed a vessel, one like them, a sister of war, strong, and who understood life and death. Someone who had seen the light and the dark. Someone worthy of power over life and death. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, after having just committed suicide off the Frozen Throne, was shown what would happen to her people and herself if she was gone. Using this information, they convinced her to make a pact with them. In this pact, the Val'kyr would be free of the Lich King forever, but their souls would be bound to the Dark Lady. Sylvanas will walk with the living once again but through the sisterhood of the Val'kyr. As long as they live, so too will Sylvanas. All of them will have their freedom, life, and power over death.\nSylvanas agreed to this pact if only to prolong her fate, which filled her with terror. Annhylde took Sylvanas's place in death as the pact was made and the remaining eight sisters were bound to their new leader.\nPart of the Forsaken.\nThe Forsaken had one major flaw working against them; they could not reproduce. The Lich King was the one who created the Scourge, and now that the Lich King was gone, there were no Scourge left to turn to Forsaken. The Val'kyr were her salvation and solution to her dilemma. Since the Val'kyr could raise the undead, they were essentially the key to keeping the Forsaken \"alive\" as a viable race. After leaving Northrend, a few of the Val'kyr were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Deathknell%20Graves\"&gt;Deathknell Graves&lt;/a&gt; to \"recruit\" any remaining corpses there into the Forsaken, while the Dark Lady made her way to Silverpine to prevent her people from being slaughtered by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh's&lt;/a&gt; command. With her were the rest of the Val'kyr making their presence known.\nAfter Garrosh backed down and allowed Sylvanas to take command of the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;campaign for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas had decided that her people would no longer be carelessly used or squandered away for some &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;. They would be used wisely and with a purpose, as a bulwark to safeguard her and their kingdom. A bulwark that grows stronger as the Val'kyr raises the living's dead to bolster their numbers, even with former &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ataeric\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt; joining their ranks. This is due to the fact those raised by the Val'kyr who die in combat or under extreme stress, enter into a violent, frenzied state. Undead in this state are easily manipulated and their rage is often directed at the foes of those who raised them. After the effects wear off, the remaining resurrected are given the option of joining the Forsaken or being returned to the grave.\nThe Val'kyr themselves have been deployed into several battles since their conscription, notably throughout &lt;a href=\"Silverpine\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, both of which were sound Forsaken victories due to the Val'kyr's input. However, the Val'kyr were only able to reanimate &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; corpses as Forsaken. The humans trapped in the conflict with the Forsaken sought to escape that fate by turning into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, and thus the surviving leaders and refugees of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; were willing to take the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; and became &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Worgen\"&gt;Hillsbrad Worgen&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the Forsaken from raising them into undeath.\nWhen Sylvanas was killed in Silverpine Forest, Agatha, Arthura and Daschla sacrificed themselves to revive her once more. Then later in the battle at Andorhal, the Alliance would kill Aradne, thus leaving only four dark Val'kyr in existence. It's unknown where they currently are, but they're likely in a safe area continuing to raise more Forsaken members.\nLegion.\nDuring the battle at the Broken Shore, Sylvanas called her Val'kyr. Two of them took Baine and Thrall to her position and later, five of them arrived and picked the bodies of fallen heroes of the Horde.\nThe Val'kyr loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; are encountered for the first time in the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the ones that were bound to servitude by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Val'kyr residing within these halls are pure beings that are warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. They are tasked with bringing the souls of deceased Vrykul heroes from &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; and Northrend to these halls for eternal feasts.\nThe &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; shieldmaidens of &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt; employ a rite of ascension to be granted access to a vault which provides an audience with &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and was granted a magical lantern called the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt; which Sylvanas intended to subjugate Eyir with and force her to make more Val'kyr for the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas had an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; undergo the rite of ascension to gain access to the vault in Skold-Ashil and used the Soulcage to bind Eyir. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; followed Sylvanas into the vault, however, and foiled Windrunner's plan by smashing the lantern and freeing Eyir.\nVal'kyr under &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; appear in &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Trial of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped several of the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; val'kyr, including &lt;a href=\"Danica%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Danica the Reclaimer&lt;/a&gt;. She intended to corrupt them all into &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;, using Odyn's sacrificed eye as a weapon of darkness.\nExploring Azeroth: Northrend.\nDuring their exploration of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; inspected the city of &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt;. There, they found that the Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Geirrvif\"&gt;Geirrvif&lt;/a&gt; continued her duties at &lt;a href=\"Valhalas\"&gt;Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;; though her people no longer have a [[Lich King|death god] to serve. Notably, this makes her the last of the known named [[Scourge]] Val'kyr; and the only one of them to have not joined with the Nine or the [[Knights of the Ebon Blade]].\nThe nine.\nAfter the defeat of the Lich King, only nine of his Val'kyr remained present in his citadel. These nine bound themselves to Sylvanas and in order to seal the pact, the strongest Val'kyr [[Annhylde]] sacrificed herself to save the banshee's life. Later, in Silverpine, [[Agatha]], [[Daschla]], and [[Arthura]] sacrificed themselves to revive the Dark Lady once more after she was shot dead by [[Lord Godfrey]]. In Andorhal, [[Aradne]] was killed by Alliance forces.\nMultiple [[lesser Val'kyr]] maidens were spotted in the skies during the [[Battle for Andorhal]], and though they can raise corpses these lesser Val'kyr are not part of the original pact and are thus not strong enough to revive Sylvanas. How exactly they are created remains unknown, and where they dwell now is a mystery. It is known that they are bound to greater Val'kyr, as when Aradne was slain, these Val'kyr dissipated.\nAt this point, though five Val'kyr died and thus only four should remain. The number of Val'kyr who appeared during the [[Battle for the Broken Shore]] cinematic was five; though these could have been Lesser Val'kyr.\nIn the [[Arathi Highlands]], [[Nathanos Blightcaller]] ordered Val'kyr to raise several powerful slain enemies.\nIn [[Darkshore]], [[Brynja]] was killed by [[Tyrande Whisperwind]]. The Val'kyr left alive are: [[Signe]], [[Kyra]], and one other.\nThe Val'kyr are able to raise corpses into undeath, which is how more Forsaken are created. The power of the Lich King previously allowed them to raise more powerful undead in the form of [[death knight]]s. They can still extremely rarely use their own powers to reshape the body of an active undead and make it stronger, though it is an arduous endeavor that they are reluctant to undertake. For this reason, Sylvanas cannot have all the Forsaken undergo the ritual, and the only known person to have done it is [[Nathanos Blightcaller]].\nIn the [[Sanctum of Domination]], the final Val'kyr is revealed to be [[Skyja]]. The remaining three Val'kyr and Sylvanas raise the six who died back, so that they can block the heroes' progress and protect Sylvanas. This resurrection was seemingly incomplete, or somehow rested on Skyja, as the six are only able to take a supporting role in the ensuing battle with the Maw Walkers, and once Skyja is struck down, the fallen six vanish. When the heroes finally reached the pinnacle of the Sanctum of Domination, [[Bolvar Fordragon]] announced to Sylvanas that all of her Val'kyr were eliminated, and that she would die here for the last time. Sylvanas was undeterred, coldly comparing the losses of her Val'kyr to that of an archer losing their arrows.\nSpeculation.\nThe [[Lady of the Sword]] mentioned in [[Revenge for the Vargul]] may be a Val'kyr, or [[Eyir]].\nA possible reconciliation for the suggested link between Val'kyr and spirit healers is that the Val'kyr who refused to join Helya were instead sent to Bastion by the Arbiter after they entered the Shadowlands and became kyrian due to their commitment to their duties. They would therefore become kyrian who would become spirit healers.\nReferences.\n[[Category:Val'kyr| ]]\n[[Category:Scourge]]\n[[Category:Forsaken]]\n[[Category:Valarjar]]\n[[Category:Dark Mirror]]\n[[es:Val'kyr]]"}

They both share the same health pool, much like the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Twin Emperors&lt;/a&gt;.\nFjola and Eydis are two very powerful val'kyr that were originally sent by the Lich King along with their &lt;a href=\"Vengeful%20Val%27kyr\"&gt;Vengeful Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; army to disrupt, destroy, and terrorize the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; and its citizens. But during this attack &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress\"&gt;Argent Confessor Paletress&lt;/a&gt; comes to the defense of the tournament and battles the twins. Paletress is victorious, and Fjola and Eydis are captured. Their bonds are maintained by &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Alorah\"&gt;Priestess Alorah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Priest%20Grimmin\"&gt;Priest Grimmin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey later appear as the \"final\" challenge of the coliseum after the raid has defeated the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Champions\"&gt;Faction Champions&lt;/a&gt;.\nConcentrated Essences.\nFloats around the room. When a player of the same Essence absorbs it, they gain Powering Up. When a player of the opposite essence absorbs it, they take damage.\n25-player abilities.\nEydis Darkbane.\nEydis uses an arsenal of shadow related spells\nFjola Lightbane.\nFjola uses an arsenal of holy (thus unresistable) related spells\n10-player abilities.\nEydis Darkbane.\nEydis uses an arsenal of shadow related spells\nFjola Lightbane.\nFjola uses an arsenal of light spells (which deal fire damage)\nNormal mode strategy.\nAs usual, the encounter is started by talking to the NPC. The Twins and four portals spawn: two portals near the Twins, and two on the opposite side (near the NPC and the door). If the whole raid stays close to the NPC, the Twins will not aggro. It's also safe to use the portals on the NPC side of the room. The four portals - two light, two dark - are the central element of the encounter. Using one of them gives the player either a light or a dark buff. This buff reduces damage against same-color targets by 50%, but increases the player's damage against opposite-color targets and makes the player immune to same-color damage.\nTo address this mechanic, the raid should be divided into two halves. Both halves should have one tank, a similar number of healers, and be able to deal similar DPS. One half of the DPS takes the light buff and sets up near ; the other half takes the dark buff and goes to . Each tank takes the buff of the opposite color as the boss they will be fighting, as otherwise they will not be able to keep aggro. The Twins' melee damage is not modified by the tanks' colors so this is a non-issue. The Twins share a health pool and will die simultaneously without any special coordination on the raid's part. \nOrbs.\nOnce the encounter is started, light and dark orbs spawn from the walls at regular intervals and move randomly around the room. If they touch an opposite-color player, the player takes 7000 damage. To mitigate raid damage from these, healers should attune to the opposite color of the DPS group they are healing and act as soakers for orbs of their color. For example, a light-attuned healer should intercept light orbs headed for the group of dark-attuned DPS attacking Lightbane, but allow the dark orbs through. (&lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Shadow Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; may also be helpful, as the light orbs do Fire damage and the dark orbs do Shadow.)\nIf the orbs touch a same-color buffed player, the player receives a stacking speed and damage buff called Powering Up. At 100 stacks, this will trigger Empowered Light or Empowered Darkness, which increases damage dealt to opposite-color targets by 100% for 20 sec. Thus both DPS and healers should actively seek out orbs of the same color as their essence to acquire this boost.\nSpecial Abilities.\nThe Twins share the same two main abilities: Vortex and Twin's Pact. If either Twin uses either of these abilities, the other half of the raid must swap their color buff, wait until the effect is over, and then switch back to their original color. The abilities are used in a random order, but the Twins will cycle through all four abilities - Light Vortex, Dark Vortex, Light Pact, and Dark Pact - before repeating one. This gives the raid some limited ability to predict which is coming next and preemptively swap colors if necessary.\nVortex.\nWhen one boss casts Vortex (8 sec. cast), each player must be sure to have the same-color buff as the boss who is casting or they will take a total of 30,000 damage. After the Vortex is finished, the affected players should switch back to their original color. This swapping is made simpler by tanking each Val'kyr next to a portal of the same color so that, for instance, light-attuned melee attacking Darkbane can quickly and easily attune dark to survive her Dark Vortex, then run to the light portal to reattune.\nTwin's Pact.\nIf either Lightbane or Darkbane casts Twin's Pact, that twin shields herself and begins a 15 second cast which heals the Twins for 20% of their maximum HP. In order to interrupt the cast, the shield must be removed by damage. All damage dealers should change to the appropriate color to bring down the shield. Once the shield is down, the cast must still be interrupted. In standard UI, if the enemy cast bar is turned on, the cast bar will be in metal frame indicating it is uninterruptable. The moment the shield is down the frame will disappear so it can be used as an visual clue. Deadly Boss Mods will also throw up a warning saying \"Interrupt Now\" when the shield is broken.\nYou can also just have all DPS swap to the other target immediately, since by the time most people get to the opposite color, get back, and start DPSing again, the shield timer will be almost done and the heal will most likely go through.\nIn addition, when Lightbane or Darkbane cast Twin's Pact, the other gains Power of the Twins for 15 seconds. The tank on the Twin not casting will take increased damage during this time, as each melee hit the Twin lands increases her attack speed until Power of the Twins fades.\nOtherwise, the Twins deal insignificant tank and raid damage. Players just need to focus on the following list:\nFocus-fire alternate strategy.\nHave the majority of the raid attune to one color and attack only one Twin. If, for example, the raid attunes light and attacks Darkbane, this trivializes Dark Shields and Light Vortexes, and the raid only really needs to worry about the other two abilities. To further simplify the encounter, raids who choose to focus damage on only one Twin often ignore shields on the other Twin and allow the 20% heal to go off. However, this is only viable if your raid has high enough DPS to compensate. Healers should still attune to the opposite color of their targets and act as orb soakers.\nHeroic mode strategy.\nTwin's Pact now heals for 50% rather than 20%. This means interrupting it is almost essential. You can allow them to get off one heal and still defeat the encounter, but two heals will mean hitting the enrage timer.\nThe Twins also gain a new ability called Touch of Light and Touch of Darkness. This is cast on random players during the encounter and causes them to inflict AOE damage to players around them who are of opposite attunement. It can be preemptively removed if the affected player swaps colors. However, Touch of Light/Darkness will not harm players with the same attributes as the Touch, so if the raid is segregated properly this poses little threat. \nFinally, light and dark orbs now do significant amount of damage to players of the opposite attunement (around 15000 HP). It is a guaranteed swift death to anyone who is not a tank if they take two orbs of the wrong color or are affected by Touch of Lightness/Darkness. You can deal with the orbs in one of two ways: \nWith both methods, you may end up with uneven number of DPSers of each attunement. Because Empowered Darkness lasts longer than Empowered Light on Heroic mode, assign the greater share of DPS to attune dark.\nBeyond the positioning, the Soaker Strategy is exactly the same as normal mode. However, the Doorway Strategy is quite different. For this approach, the raid remains dark-attuned during the entire fight to maximize DPS time and simply tries to heal through the Light Vortexes via raid healing techniques (e.g. paladin's &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Mastery\"&gt;Aura Mastery&lt;/a&gt;). Everyone must blow their defensive cooldowns to help the healers during a Vortex of the opposite color. Warlocks and holy/disc priests have no such abilities and should be placed together in one group for &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; spam. Due to the length of some classes' cooldowns, it may not be possible for the raid to survive two Light Vortexes. Thus a major goal of this strategy is to get the Twins down after only 4 or 5 special abilities have been used.\nAnother issue with this strategy is dealing with the dark twin's shield. Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.2a%20%28undocumented%20changes%29\"&gt;Patch 3.2.2a&lt;/a&gt;, Twin's Pact only healed the Twins for 20% and could be safely ignored. However, with the increase to 50%, this is no longer an option. Because the raid remains dark-attuned, DPS is nerfed by 50% against Darkbane. All DPS should save their offensive cooldowns for a dark shield, and preemptively target the dark twin when a special ability is incoming to get a head start in case a \"bad\" shield occurs.\nLoot.\nAs with the other bosses in the instances, there are separate versions of each item for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; raids and for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raids. Fjola drops two items from her loot table and Eydis drops one when slain.\nTrivia.\nThis boss encounter may have been inspired by &lt;a href=\"http%3A//tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Ikaruga\"&gt;Ikaruga&lt;/a&gt;, a game with a similar mechanic: absorb one color of bullet, avoid the other color, and switch on demand which color you want to absorb.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It is covered by a thick forest, and is the cradle of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druidic&lt;/a&gt; culture. It is home to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The zone is currently contested by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"satyrs\"&gt;satyrs&lt;/a&gt; attempting to spread the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nOriginally, this ancient forest lay within the great and undivided realm of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. It was best known as the home to the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, the Lord of the Forest. It was within this region that Cenarius taught the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; the way of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism, with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in &lt;a href=\"Lorlathil\"&gt;Lorlathil&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the first druid under his tutelage. Val'sharah can thus be regarded as the birthplace of druidism.\nSoon, the region became the pinnacle of druidism on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Its forests were specifically molded by druids to be a reflection of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 no more than an echo, but as close to the Dream as the real world could ever be. The forest was considered to be sacred by the druids, and was populated by night elves, the children of Cenarius (&lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;), as well as &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"moonkin\"&gt;moonkin&lt;/a&gt; and others. The elves considered these races their allies.\nAt some point thousands of years ago, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; was planted here. Over the ages, it grew, towering over the area and pushing its roots deep into the land. It became the protector of the region. The druid base of &lt;a href=\"Shala%27nir\"&gt;Shala'nir&lt;/a&gt; was established at the base of the tree.\nApart from civilian settlements, the region also became the home to one of the most famous night elven fortresses \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;. This mighty but somber keep was chiseled into the solid rock by the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Ravencrest\"&gt;House of Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; over multiple generations. It was a well-guarded and mostly impenetrable fortress. Relying on their military might, the Ravencrests rose steadily within the elven society, eventually being considered second to the royal house only. The region was also home to the elven martial city of &lt;a href=\"Kal%27delar\"&gt;Kal'delar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nThe region saw heavy fighting during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. It was within the forests of Val'sharah that the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; fought a delaying battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces bound for &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Although she was able to kill the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;annihilan&lt;/a&gt; general &lt;a href=\"Ronokon\"&gt;Ronokon&lt;/a&gt;, the being's self-destruction immolated Ashamane and burned a crater into the forest. The Wild God's actions brought a precious time for the &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;city of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to raise a protective shield. She thus saved countless lives. The elves eventually erected a &lt;a href=\"Ashamane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;great shrine&lt;/a&gt; at the place of Ashamane's sacrifice.\nThe War of the Ancients also saw a demonic attack on Black Rook Hold. Lord &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Guard\"&gt;Moon Guard&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of the fortress. They eventually succeeded, albeit only at the price of Illidan sacrificing the lives of the other Moon Guard members to absorb their energy. Famous combatants in the battle included &lt;a href=\"Broxigar%20the%20Red\"&gt;Broxigar the Red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Legion also tried, and failed, to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; located within the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Vale\"&gt;Crescent Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The war ended with the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, which blasted Kalimdor into pieces. Val'sharah broke off from the mainland and mostly survived as part of the isle group known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar, and others. Suramar City cut itself off from the surrounding land behind a protective barrier, further isolating Val'sharah from the outside world. In essence, the ancient forest was forgotten by the outside world with the exception of druids. After the war, the surviving &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s of the forest were assembled together and placed into a deep hibernation under the roots of &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDruid refuge.\nEven after its isolation, Val'sharah has remained central to druidic culture. The main druidic organization is the order of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamweavers\"&gt;Dreamweavers&lt;/a&gt; (also called the Druids of Val'sharah), who have protected the Emerald Dream since time immemorial. Many of its members are ancient enough to remember &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; taking root. After the Great Sundering, they trained under Cenarius's tutelage, and acquired unparalleled knowledge in the ways of the druids. Their main base of operation is the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;, which is directly linked to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;, a portion of the Dream that serves as a travel hub to key locations across Azeroth. The location is protected by ancient magic, creating a sanctuary here. The leader of the Dreamweavers is archdruid &lt;a href=\"Rensar%20Greathoof\"&gt;Rensar Greathoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nVal'sharah is also the home of several of the strongest druidic individuals alive. The demi-god Cenarius, the Lord of the Forest, lives within the Grove of Cenarius. &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ancient%20of%20lore\"&gt;ancient of lore&lt;/a&gt;, resides with his acolytes in the ancient grove of &lt;a href=\"Thas%27talah\"&gt;Thas'talah&lt;/a&gt;. A group of druids live within the &lt;a href=\"Moonclaw%20Vale\"&gt;Moonclaw Vale&lt;/a&gt;, charged with the protection of Val'sharah. The &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; make their home in &lt;a href=\"Steelclaw%20Vale\"&gt;Steelclaw Vale&lt;/a&gt;, dedicating themselves to observing the Emerald Dream. The &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fin\"&gt;Druids of the Fin&lt;/a&gt; patrol &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Bay\"&gt;Emerald Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ashen\"&gt;Ashen&lt;/a&gt; druids guard the legacy of Ashamane in the &lt;a href=\"Mistvale\"&gt;Mistvale&lt;/a&gt;. There are several &lt;a href=\"barrow%20den\"&gt;barrow den&lt;/a&gt;s located here, including the &lt;a href=\"Sleeper%27s%20Barrow\"&gt;Sleeper's Barrow&lt;/a&gt; in Steelclaw Vale and the &lt;a href=\"Tel%27Andu%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Tel'Andu Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt; within the Dreamgrove.\nThe druids had several key artifacts in their possession. The Ashen guarded the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20Ashamane\"&gt;Fangs of Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; within their shrine. Meanwhile a branch of &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient Mother Tree, was kept in a shrine beneath the roots of Shaladrassil called the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Circle of Spirits&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Idol\"&gt;Malorne's Idol&lt;/a&gt;, a gift by the Wild God herself, was held at the shrine called &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Malorne's Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; is also represented within the region. Their main base of operation is the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Crescent%20Vale\"&gt;Crescent Vale&lt;/a&gt;, which predates the War of the Ancients. This location also served as the hiding place for the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact that is part of the group of relics known as the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe night elves have several villages scattered throughout the area. These include the travel hub of &lt;a href=\"Lorlathil\"&gt;Lorlathil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ash%27theran\"&gt;Ash'theran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightsong\"&gt;Lightsong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfen\"&gt;Shadowfen&lt;/a&gt;, the enclave of &lt;a href=\"Shala%27nir\"&gt;Shala'nir&lt;/a&gt; and others. Several other sentient races also inhabit the forest, including the &lt;a href=\"Cenarius%27s%20children\"&gt;Cenarius's children&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"moonkin\"&gt;moonkin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"grell\"&gt;grell&lt;/a&gt;. Recently a new village, &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt;, was founded on the west coast by uncorrupted humans from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. Val'sharah has a very vivid fauna and flora.\nLegion.\nDuring the Burning Legion's &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, Val'sharah was assaulted by the satyr lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. He was able to wake up the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s slumbering below &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and corrupt the World Tree itself. With its roots deep within the ground, the great tree then began to corrupt the forest. The satyrs broke through and overran &lt;a href=\"Shala%27nir\"&gt;Shala'nir&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing this, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; began to manifest itself throughout Val'sharah. Cenarius was overtaken by an affliction that caused him to lie unwaking in his grove; he was eventually successfully corrupted and yanked into the Nightmare itself. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the satyrs while trying to free his erstwhile mentor. The Wild God Malorne was also lost in the Nightmare. Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Thaon%20Moonclaw\"&gt;Thaon Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt; was also corrupted by Xavius, and eventually slain. Furbolgs, moonkin, keepers of the grove, dryads, ancients and &lt;a href=\"sprite\"&gt;sprite&lt;/a&gt;s succumbed to madness en masse.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; sent their troops in the region to destroy a rampaging satyr warband, led by &lt;a href=\"Illbringer%20Zizzifrax\"&gt;Illbringer Zizzifrax&lt;/a&gt;, in order to help the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; who have their hands full with the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. They also attacked &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;s in southern Val'sharah, in order to collect their weapons crafted from &lt;a href=\"Lumenstone\"&gt;Lumenstone&lt;/a&gt;, and later investigated about the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s of the region who appear to have come under the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic influence of a &lt;a href=\"man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt;, named &lt;a href=\"Summoner%20Djobi\"&gt;Summoner Djobi&lt;/a&gt;, who was taken down by the paladins.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; arrived at Val'sharah to intervene, seeking to recover the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; from the Temple of Elune to cleanse Cenarius. However, Xavius got to the artifact first, and managed to corrupt Ysera herself with it. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; tracked down the Nightmare Lord, although not before losing the archdruid Elothir to the corrupting influence. In the climactic battle at the Temple of Elune, Tyrande and her companions were forced to kill Ysera, reclaiming and cleansing the Tears of Elune in the process.\nThese dramatic events caused heavy damage to the forest and its inhabitants. Shala'nir was completely lost to the Nightmare, its luckier inhabitants evacuating the village. A similar fate befell Shadowfen, which was hastily abandoned. Whole sections of the forest, such as the area of Dreadwood and Moonrest, were lost to the affliction. Crazed creatures began appearing throughout the land, and brazen satyrs and their allies attacked several locations. Many elves escaped to places such as &lt;a href=\"Starsong%20Refuge\"&gt;Starsong Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, or even crossed the border into Suramar. The corrupted tendrils of Shaladrassil followed them even there.\nThe Burning Legion also assaulted the region directly. The heroes of Azeroth helped the Dreamweavers and other locals repel the assault. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s attacked several key locations, including the &lt;a href=\"Ashamane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Shrine of Ashamane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sundersong%20Glade\"&gt;Sundersong Glade&lt;/a&gt;.\nA wholly different crisis emerged around &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; reanimated the spirits of Lord &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers, who started assaulting &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, the villagers were eventually able to repulse this threat. Shadowsong and adventurers then pushed into Black Rook Hold itself. After heavy fighting, they were able to slay the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dantalionax\"&gt;Dantalionax&lt;/a&gt;, and finally put the spirits of Ravencrest's soldiers to rest.\nAdventurers eventually followed Xavius into the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, managing to free Malfurion Stormrage. Eventually, the adventurers entered the Emerald Nightmare itself, freeing Cenarius and slaying Xavius. With the immediate danger gone, the druids began the work to cleanse the Nightmare from the land, hoping to reclaim Shala'nir and safeguard the roots of the World Tree. However, it remains to be seen if the corruption can ever be fully cleansed.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, and after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Val'sharah and its &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; are among the few remaining night elf communities on Azeroth.\nAn Alliance adventurer was sent to &lt;a href=\"Mevris%20Ghostdancer\"&gt;Mevris Ghostdancer&lt;/a&gt; for assistance in seeking out raw materials to create the &lt;a href=\"Drums%20of%20Primal%20Might\"&gt;Drums of Primal Might&lt;/a&gt; by his wife &lt;a href=\"Daniss%20Ghostdancer\"&gt;Daniss Ghostdancer&lt;/a&gt;, who sought a means of vengeance against the Horde for the lives they destroyed. The night elves of the Temple have established active trade ties with the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Bradensbrook&lt;/a&gt;, sending and receiving supplies to and from the villagers via ships.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; is trying to recover one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; is on a mission to figure out what happened to his mentor, the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightmare is starting to take hold and the satyr &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; has designs on the Tears and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. Can adventurers sort everything out in time?\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Not all the \"sets\" are complete. One set look alike in particular will be sought after by the new generation of Paladins as there exists a recolored version of each of the models in the &lt;a href=\"Judgment%20Armor\"&gt;Judgment Armor&lt;/a&gt; set which remains one of the most popular designs of epic armor. Although there is mixed opinion on the color choices of the new items, the purple color of the recolored Judgment pieces may even be considered appropriate for the skin coloring of draenei paladins. &lt;a href=\"Zorus%20the%20Judicator\"&gt;Zorus the Judicator&lt;/a&gt; is a draenei paladin wearing this.\nBoth Rare and Epic recolorations of the Tier 1 and Tier 2 sets exist.

Should Setesh ever fall to corruption, the results would be disastrous.\"\nSetesh is one of the guardians of the Halls of Origination. Like the other constructs within the halls, Setesh was created to protect the powerful device capable of resetting all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the keepers has a sphere of influence. &lt;a href=\"Isiset\"&gt;Isiset&lt;/a&gt; presides over magic; Setesh, chaos; &lt;a href=\"Ammunae\"&gt;Ammunae&lt;/a&gt;, life; and &lt;a href=\"Rajh\"&gt;Rajh&lt;/a&gt;, the sun.\nIn the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Kamses\"&gt;High Commander Kamses&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that Rajh and the other keepers were dead.

He has no threat table whatsoever. What the tank needs to do is to damage Setesh whenever possible and tank all the adds that emerge from the Chaos Portals.\nAround every 30 seconds, Setesh will open a Chaos Portal. Each portal summons a two Void Wurms, 10 seconds later: a Void Seeker and another 10 seconds later, a Void Sentinel will emerge.\nDamage dealers must interrupt Anti-Magic Prison and kill the Void Seekers whenever they emerge. Other than that, they must always focus their attacks on Setesh.\nHe also casts an AoE around him at certain periods. Simply avoid that.\nHeroic mode.\nIn heroic mode, the only difference is that the damage dealers must close the Chaos Portals as fast as possible. The portals have 193k hp. This is to reduce the number of void creatures that are summoned. By ignoring the portals, the group will be very quickly overrun.\nThe Chaos Portals, once opened, will summon a Void Sentinel and 2 Void Wurms. A short time later, a Void Seeker will emerge. Destroying the portals quickly will prevent the Void Seeker from coming out and wreaking havoc on the tank. If they manage to get an Anti-Magic Prison over the tank, the tank will swiftly go down due to large numbers of summoned adds.\nDamage dealers will need to destroy the portals as quickly as possible before focusing their attacks on Setesh.\nIn Hearthstone.\nSetesh appears as that can be encountered in the adventure in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He was ancient enemies with &lt;a href=\"Anzu%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, the other major deities of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;. Sethe was cold-blooded and scornful. When he flew, the winds bit his flesh. He would sun himself on the mountainsides, but he could never taste warmth. His scales were frosted glass, and his children were the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. He is the source and namesake of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, an affliction that causes any arakkoa who touches the blighted waters to become broken and flightless.\nBiography.\nThe Gods of Arak.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt; that saturated the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; birthed many kinds of animals, but almost all of them were consumed by the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s. But with the end of the Evergrowth by the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s, life had a chance to thrive on Draenor once more, and the remains of &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt; became forests that teemed with Spirit and accelerated the development of new species. The first to arise were enormous creatures with extraordinary power over the land: some tapped into the power of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;, some the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, and others the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. Yet survival was a challenge because of the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Breakers\"&gt;Breakers&lt;/a&gt;, and winged species proved to be most suited to thrive on Draenor for they could fly out of reach of both forces. Most of Draenor's avians developed in a region called &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;, dominated by a massive spire that towered over dense woods. Three godlike creatures who took form in Arak were &lt;a href=\"Anzu%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, and Sethe.\nSethe's wings were short and leathery, and he could not fly as high as Rukhmar. He had an affinity to the shadow energies--the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;--that existed in the universe. For ages, the three largely kept to themselves, fighting off attacks from Primals and Breakers. Only Anzu dreamed of a better world for him and his feathered kin. He called on Rukhmar and Sethe to work together to transform Arak into a sanctuary for winged creatures of all kinds. As one, Anzu and his allies drove the children of stone and root from Arak. With the Primals and Breakers gone, Arak became a haven for winged species. Anzu, Rukhmar, and Sethe settled in as caretakers of the land and its varied species. Sethe ruled the smaller &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s and lived with them among the shadowy nooks and crannies at the spire's base. He did not treat his followers with the same respect that Anzu showed the ravens. Sethe was a cruel and demanding master of the wind serpents.\nOver the years, Sethe became envious of Rukhmar. He coveted the favor of the wind and the warmth of the sun that Anzu and Rukhmar had. Sethe believed Anzu was also jealous of Rukhmar who looked down on them from the spire and tried to convince Anzu to help him slay her, but Anzu was cunning and cared little for the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition, Anzu had a secret affection for Rukhmar but never mustered the courage to confess his feelings. In the dark of the night, Anzu sent one of his dread ravens to warn Rukhmar of Sethe's plot. Anzu watched from the top of a mountain spire as Rukhmar and Sethe clashed. Thanks to Anzu's warning, Rukhmar avoided Sethe. She flew high, put the sun at her back, and dove at Sethe. With a flap of her wings, she split the sky upon Sethe like the crack of a whip. Sethe crashed into the spire where they fought with such force that it crumbled and fell around him, creating the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Spire\"&gt;Broken Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnzu stepped into the battle then, pinning Sethe under his foot. Looking up at the raven god, Sethe uttered a dying curse: that his blood shall blacken the sea until it runs thick as tar, and his flesh shall fester and soil until the very sky rots with it. Anzu responded that they shall then leave no blood nor flesh and devoured Sethe whole, picking the bones clean. But a small trickle of blood escaped and blighted the valley below, creating the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnzu felt Sethe's hatred coursing through him. His body contorted, his wings shriveled, and he became cursed without flight. His mind was wracked with painful visions. Anzu had contained Sethe's curse by taking it upon himself, and he would grapple with the curse for some time. In revenge, Anzu had his &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt;s slaughter Sethe's &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s; in one bloody night, Sethe's children were eradicated. Though Sethe's curse weakened Anzu, it also gave him new power: the power of the Void that Sethe had once commanded. As Anzu grew more familiar with his abilities, he shrouded himself in a realm of shadow to hide from Rukhmar forever, horrified at what he had become and how she would react.\nLegacy.\nContact with the pools of Sethe's blood at the Sethekk Hollow curses an arakkoa into a broken, wingless state mirroring Anzu's own. Sethe's curse is also passed on through lineage, and arakkoa born of cursed parents are cursed themselves. So strong was Sethe's hate that it animates his blood even in the current day, eons after he was slain by his fellow gods.\nThe Sethekk eventually abandoned their worship of Sethe in favor of an &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Old%20God\"&gt;unnamed Old God&lt;/a&gt;. When Draenor became &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the destruction of the Spires of Arak would have taken Sethe's remains with it."}

When winged &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; touch the waters of the Hollow, they are infected with the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, twisting their bodies into a hunched, flightless form and driving them to the brink of insanity. Only the powers of the dread raven god &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; are able to restore the sanity of those arakkoa who are cast into the pools, and the Arakkoa Outcasts regularly attempt to save those they can from the maddening visions brought on by the curse. \nIt was here that &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; and his disciples, the first of the cursed arakkoa, were saved by Anzu and given not only the shadowy magic of the raven god, but also &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;The Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt; with which to commune with him. Using the Eye, they went on to save others cast into the Hollow, and build for themselves a civilization of &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSethekk Hollow was named for the dead god &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, whose blood corrupts the ground in accordance with his dying curse upon his own flesh. \nAlong with &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, Sethe was one of the avian primal gods of the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;; but while Rukhmar enjoyed the warmth of the sun and Anzu the shade of the Spires, Sethe felt only the cold bite of the wind. Jealous of Rukhmar's warmth, he plotted with Anzu to kill her. Anzu, however, cared little for Sethe, and shared the bitter god's plans with his prey in secret. In the ensuing battle, Sethe was cast down by the forewarned Rukhmar, crashing into what is now &lt;a href=\"the%20Broken%20Spire\"&gt;the Broken Spire&lt;/a&gt;. As Anzu stepped in to deliver the killing blow, Sethe cursed his own flesh and blood to thicken the seas and blacken the skies. Ever the cleverest of the three gods, Anzu responded by devouring Sethe and picking his bones clean, attempting to leave no cursed blood nor flesh to ruin the world. But a trickle of blood did escape, and the valley it blighted become known as the Sethekk Hollow. \nThe curse carried by Sethe's blood is potent and eternal, if only for the primal gods and their children: just as Anzu became crippled and flightless after devouring Sethe, when Rukhmar's children, the arakkoa, touch the waters of Sethekk Hollow, they are instantly and irrevocably transformed. Though this curse will carry on to any descendants they may have, it does not appear to affect any other mortal races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;."}

Sethir was one of the few satyr who is considered to be &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;.

The sethrak are an empire on the rise and throwing a wrench in everyone's plans. Wherever the sethrak go sand begins to spread as they magically change the environment into what they are comfortable with.\nBackground.\nThe sethrak once lived together as one as their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; would have wanted. Thousands of years ago, they and &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s lived in harmony in Vol'dun and worshiped Sethraliss together.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; between the trolls and the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; roughly 16,000 years ago, the &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi warbringer &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; descended upon Vol'dun. He slaughtered trolls and sethrak alike. Sethraliss sacrificed herself to save them, but though she struck Mythrax down, Mythrax was still able to destroy the disc at the heart of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. After witnessing the destruction firsthand, the sethrak knew that something had to be done to prevent anyone from raising Mythrax again. &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; worked together to seal Mythrax within the great pyramid.\nFollowing Sethraliss' death, the jungles of Vol'dun transformed into a vast desert, causing most of the trolls to abandon the region. This left only the sethrak, who continued to survive and thrive in Vol'dun, which they considered the holiest of holy grounds.\nAs the sands continued to spread, Korthek grew power-hungry and sought to free Mythrax, intending to use it as a weapon to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. He gathered like-minded sethrak, who became known as the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt;, and declared himself emperor. The sethrak who follow Vorrik and still worship Sethraliss, known as the &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt;, have been fighting the Faithless ever since.\nThe sethrak appear to have inhabited the troll city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt; long ago, before Korthek's betrayal, as the three &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20%28sethrak%29\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; are immortalized as equals there.\nThere is a sethrak incursion into the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, looking for shadow magic to power their &lt;a href=\"Skycaller%20Gem\"&gt;Skycaller Gem&lt;/a&gt;. They have also destroyed the village of &lt;a href=\"Dol%27watha\"&gt;Dol'watha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nThe Devoted sethrak worship the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; and wield lightning magic. There is an ancient sethrak belief that loa can be reborn.\nThe sethrak &lt;a href=\"skycaller\"&gt;skycaller&lt;/a&gt;s, gifted with the power to command the storm, use their magic to summon great spires that turn the earth into sand. Lightning strikes that hit sethrak spires are used to send messages across large distances in a manner similar to smoke signals.\nKorthek's empire has slave markets comprised mostly of &lt;a href=\"Vulpera\"&gt;Vulpera&lt;/a&gt;. They even sell children.\nSethrak weapons are crafted from glass and other materials that can only be found in Vol'dun.\nSome sethrak practiced the ways of blood inscription since before the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt; split."}

She has power over lightning. Her &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt; is located in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;Temple of Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLong ago, Sethraliss represented the lush jungle region of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, where she was worshipped by both the &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s. During the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt; roughly 16,000 years ago, &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; descended upon Vol'dun. He slaughtered troll and sethrak alike. Sethraliss sacrificed herself to save them, but though she struck Mythrax down, Mythrax was still able to destroy the disc at the heart of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, Sethraliss' devoted followers transported her remains and built a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; around them while they awaited her rebirth. After witnessing the destruction firsthand, the sethrak knew that something had to be done to prevent anyone from raising Mythrax again. &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; worked together to seal Mythrax within the great pyramid.\nYears later, Korthek grew power hungry and sought to free Mythrax to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. He gathered like-minded sethrak and declared himself emperor. Vorrik and other sethrak who were still loyal to Sethraliss were forced into hiding. To Korthek's &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt;, Sethraliss became forgotten or, more often, reviled. However, the &lt;a href=\"Devoted\"&gt;Devoted&lt;/a&gt; still felt Sethraliss' presence and believed that she would one day be returned to them. When Vorrik returned to his &lt;a href=\"Vorrik%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;personal sanctum&lt;/a&gt; years later, he could still feel the ancient power of Sethraliss there, which he took as a sign that his loa endured.\n&lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt; allied with Korthek, and though Korthek was slain Jakra'zet successfully stole the keys to Atul'Aman and completed the ritual to revive Mythrax by sacrificing himself. The sethrak needed Sethraliss more than ever before, but although she should have been reborn by now, someone or something in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;Temple of Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; had prevented her awakening.

By far, the most useful feature is that it can read an file and know exactly how your XML is supposed to be structured (the only other XML editor I know of that can do this will set you back $500). This means that, for the most part, you don't have to memorize tag names, what tags can go where, attribute names, and in many circumstances, attribute values. As soon as you type the opening bracket, it will provide you with a drop-down list of all available tags that are legal given your current position in the code. Once you select a tag and hit space, you'll be presented with a list of all possible attributes for the tag. Select one, and if it's not a free-form value (like name, or val) it will present you with a list of all possible choices.\nNot only does this save time, but it can also be a great learning tool. For instance, I accidentally found out that a lot of common structures can be simplified:\n &lt;Size&gt;\n &lt;AbsDimension x=\"320\" y=\"200\"/&gt;\n &lt;/Size&gt;\ncan written simply as:\n &lt;Size x=\"320\" y=\"200\"/&gt;\nVisual Studio.\nChances are, you don't just have a copy of Visual Studio hanging around for your coding pleasure. Thankfully, Microsoft has released parts of VS for free. The Microsoft Visual Studio Express Editions are simplified copies of the most popular components: C++, C#, Visual Basic, SQL Server, &amp; Visual Web Developer. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.microsoft.com/express/\"&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; and install whichever component you think you might get some use out of since all we're really after here is the basic editor environment. If you are a student, you can also get full versions of Visual Studio from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.dreamspark.com/\"&gt;Dreamspark&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft portal for academic software.\nBe sure to set up VS as your default XML editor. For Windows XP the easiest way to do this is to right-click on any XML file, click Open With...-&gt;Choose Program, select Microsoft Visual Studio from the list (the name may be different depending on the edition you select), check Always use the selected program, and hit OK.\nThe Ui Tag.\nNow you need to change the Ui tag in your XML files to point to the XML schema. The simplest way to do this is to use the following tag:\n &lt;Ui xmlns=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/\n http://wowprogramming.com/FrameXML/UI.xsd\"&gt;\nThis will pull the schema from the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowprogramming.com\"&gt;WoWProgramming website&lt;/a&gt;. If you'd rather use a local copy, you can either download &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowprogramming.com/FrameXML/UI.xsd\"&gt;that file&lt;/a&gt;, or extract it using . Then change the location in your Ui tag from http://wowprogramming.com/FrameXML/UI.xsd to the location of the file you downloaded (e.g. \"C:/Program Files/World of Warcraft/Blizzard Interface Data (enUS)/FrameXML/UI.xsd\")\nThat's all there is to it!"}

First among them was &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty fortress city of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; tribe located in the regions south of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. This bastion became the capital of the nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, which saw its number grow as humans from all over the land traveled there to the protection and safety of Strom.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; defeat at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; and the death of &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;, the Arathorian king, the younger generations of Arathor \u2014 then an empire \u2014 sought to expand beyond the borders of the lands surrounding the capital. Among them, a group of magi journeyed north because they felt fettered by the strict laws governing magic in Strom. On the southern shore of &lt;a href=\"Lordamere%20Lake\"&gt;Lordamere Lake&lt;/a&gt;, these fledgling spellcasters founded &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the second Arathorian city-state.\nDuring the following centuries, other city-states arose across the continent. Among them were the militaristic &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; (both strong supporters of the empire), whose mighty armies explored the mountainous southern lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and made first contact with the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. On an &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;island&lt;/a&gt; south of the imperial capital, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; was built and developed a prosperous economy based fishing, shipping, and commerce. Meanwhile, Dalaran became the chief center of learning for magicians throughout the land. Although the four city-states had their own customs and commercial workings, they all held to the unifying authority of Strom, which acted as the central hub of the expansive empire.\nAs the economy of Arathor flourished, its strongest elements began to disintegrate. The nobles of Strom, seeking lusher lands, purity, and enlightenment, decided to leave the arid surroundings of the imperial capital against the arguments of the royalty. Far to the north of Dalaran, the greater citizenry founded a city-state named &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;region&lt;/a&gt;, which became a mecca for religious travelers and all those who sought inner peace and security.\nLeft within the crumbling walls of ancient Strom, the Arathi descendants decided to travel south past the rocky Khaz Modan. After many long seasons of journey, they settled in the southern region of the continent they would name Azeroth and founded the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly became a self-sufficient power in its own right.\nMeanwhile, in the almost silent Strom, the few warriors still left decided to remain and guard the ancient walls of their city. As Strom was no longer the center of the empire, the soldiers developed it into a new martial nation known as &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;. Though each of the seven city-states became prosperous in its own right, the empire of Arathor had effectively disintegrated. As each nation developed its own customs and beliefs, they became increasingly segregated from one another and humanity lost the unity achieved during the rule of King Thoradin.\nIn time, the kingdoms gradually developed rivalries, as before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the human kingdoms of Lordaeron faced challenges and obstacles from each other as the games of politics played out. Decades before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, while Azeroth enjoyed a time of relative peace, villages squabbled with villages, and kingdoms spied on kingdoms. In the Eastern Kingdoms, humans engaged in rigorous trade with dwarves, gnomes, and high elves. Some nations, like Lordaeron, acted as regional leaders and trendsetters, mediating disagreements between smaller kingdoms and used their strong militaries to impose order over the land. Still others focused their resources on defending themselves from old rivals.\nAmong the history books in &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Library\"&gt;library&lt;/a&gt;, some mentioned references of genocides, assassinations, and massacres between humans of the seven kingdoms, using claims of nobility, heritage, and honor to justify their conflicts. Among these battles, there were military conflicts between the nations of Alterac and Stromgarde, as the proximity of the two and the apparent ambiguity of their mountain borders had led to several wars and skirmishes.

Although the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; were abandoned by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, her use of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; has rendered the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; as well as much of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; uninhabitable to both her people and the living. The remaining lands of Lordaeron remain largely divided between the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; (although the latter two were largely inactive during most of the Fourth War, which did not involve the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; for the most part). However, the Alliance has made considerable gains during the conflict, capturing &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; with its surroundings in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, as well as reclaiming and rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;."}

Following the exodus to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he was chosen by the Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; to become the last founding member of the Order of the Silver Hand.\nA hero of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and a respected paladin, he protected Lordaeron for years. However, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, while he and his paladins were in charge of guarding the buried remains of the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor years, his soul was imprisoned and tortured inside &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, until he was freed by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;. As a wandering soul in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, he finally found eternal rest after being freed by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe First War.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, between the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; decided to use the orcs' mobility against them and placed large numbers of human troops under the command of the loyal &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; Gavinrad the Dire. In some cases, small units of human knights were able to bring down entire orc raiding parties without any casualties.\nNear the end of the war, when Lothar led a war party to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to confront &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, he charged Gavinrad with commanding &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses in his absence. Shortly thereafter, the Horde began laying siege to Stormwind, and &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn I&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;. When Lothar returned, he ordered a mass evacuation of the city. He, Gavinrad, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining soldiers gathered &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Varian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taria%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Taria&lt;/a&gt; and any other citizens they could find and led them toward the harbor to escape on the remaining ships. They fought street by street, losing many along the way, including Taria.\nThe Second War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;exodus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Gavinrad accompanied Lothar and the other refugees. The battle-hardened knight was considered one of the most pious of Lothar's troops, and Lothar recommended to Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; that Gavinrad join &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; as one of the first members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and the Archbishop agreed.\nWhile traveling with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s army, Gavinrad and the others were trained vigorously day and night by Faol, who taught them how to use the Light to comfort their allies, to smite their enemies and how to lead by example, as they would be more than weapons but beacons of hope to guide the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As their training progressed, Faol presented each of the paladins with enchanted &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s that were among the church's most ancient relics. Each libram represented a core trait of the Silver Hand that Faol challenged his students to become the living embodiment of, and Gavinrad was given the Libram of Compassion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, Gavinrad accompanied Uther to fight the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. One of them managed to get close enough to the paladin to grab his arm, with darkness radiating from the grip, but Gavinrad's holy aura shone brighter and drove the darkness away, causing his attacker to shrink back and duck a blow from his hammer. Thereafter, Gavinrad fought on many other battlefields until the end of the war.\nFollowing the Second War, he, Uther, Saidan, and Tirion were present during the introduction ceremony in the order of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time they had all been together after many years, and Gavinrad was the one who gave Arthas the hammer known as &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Vengeance\"&gt;:Light's Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;.\nScourging of Lordaeron.\nIn the beginnings of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; turned the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; into undead, Uther the Lightbringer thought it would be wise to ensure that the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, killed by Arthas Menethil, would never be allowed to walk again. Consequently, he stationed Gavinrad and his &lt;a href=\"Champions%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Champions of Peace&lt;/a&gt; to guard the cemetery near &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, where the necromancer was buried.\nHowever, during the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve and resurrect the remains of Kel'Thuzad, and so Gavinrad ended up face to face with the treacherous prince, now a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, who advised the paladin to step aside. When Gavinrad refused and asked where was the holy hammer he once gave him, Arthas unleashed his undead forces upon him and his paladins, and personally killed the paladin to feed his soul to &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough Arthas threatened to raise Gavinrad from the dead, the paladin's body was simply left where he fell.\nCataclysm.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korfax\"&gt;Korfax&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%27s%20Sigil\"&gt;Gavinrad's Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, one of the holy artifacts of the Silver Hand kept by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces in the &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;. He mentioned that it belonged in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;righteous&lt;/a&gt;, then delivered it to &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; was shattered by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, Gavinrad's spirit was freed, but his soul began to wander &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; as Gavinrad the Cruel. Having been driven mad by the cursed blade, he also attacked anyone who came near him, considering them as blights to be removed from this world.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to reforge the shards of Frostmourne into &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;two new swords&lt;/a&gt;, was forced to grant Gavinrad's spirit a final death to claim the shard that he was guarding.\nHis last words were a relief to finally be free from his torment.\nShadowlands.\nA missing fragment of Gavinrad's soul, crystallized as \"The Champion of Peace\", came into &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s possession after &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;'s shattering. When Uther had to delve into his memories, in order to face his past and accept his mistakes, the ghost of Gavinrad appeared among the victims of Arthas whom he could not stop.\nSpeculation.\nConsidering that he was a &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwindian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; before becoming a paladin, Gavinrad was likely originally a member of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Horse&lt;/a&gt;."}

On the final buoy far off shore, Gazrix's accompanying note revealed that the Cartel knew of Nuggle's deception and had dumped the payment to the bottom of the ocean as punishment.

The actual spawnpoint of the graveyard is located further west, across the rope bridge, in an area known &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20Hold\"&gt;Winterax Hold&lt;/a&gt; (although no fortifications or buildings remain). &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Dagger%20Pass\"&gt;Frost Dagger Pass&lt;/a&gt; passes under the bridge connecting the two.\nIt is a key graveyard for the offensive / attacking fraction as it allows them to continue storming the enemy defenses. However, this comes at some costs of defense. Players killed whilst north / south or around Snowfall Graveyard whilst it is under their control can not respawn at &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Graveyard\"&gt;Stonehearth Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Graveyard\"&gt;Iceblood Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. This means that, if the opposite faction gains the upper hand against the attacking force (and does not capture Snowfall Graveyard), defending players cannot adequately reinforce &lt;a href=\"Icewing%20Chokepoint\"&gt;Icewing Chokepoint&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Chokepoint\"&gt;Iceblood Chokepoint&lt;/a&gt;. In some cases, players that are resurrecting at Snowfall Graveyard are behind the enemy\u2019s main force and are cut off from their defending players (which are subsequently weakened as their players are resurrecting behind the enemy force and unable to meet up).\nDue to the natural terrain of Alterac Valley, Snowfall Graveyard is first captured more often by the alliance, who often travel south on the western side of the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Field of Strife&lt;/a&gt;. Horde players often travel north on the eastern side of the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Field of Strife&lt;/a&gt;, therefore a horde player at the start of the battle would have to divert and travel (most commonly into the alliance forces traveling south) west a considerable distance to capture the graveyard at the start of the battle.\nSince they are only two ways to reach the Snowfall Graveyard are up two paths / ramps / slopes (one north one south), it is an easily defendable location in itself to hold. Since enemy players must run up one of the two paths to reach the graveyard, there is often enough time to alert others on the battleground to the incoming and mount a reasonable defense - if there is a willingness to defend the graveyard."}

The orcs, in return, share their food with the wolves, heal their injuries, and protect their cubs. It is a relationship of equals looking out for one another, rather than the master/pet relationship one might expect. While Thrall was living among the Frostwolf clan, Snowsong chose to bond with him for life.\nStormrage.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; enveloped Azeroth, Snowsong mourned her \"hunting-brother\" &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; who has been claimed by the Nightmare. It was also Snowsong who first catches the scent of the shadowy invaders assembling outside &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s walls, simultaneously alerting the defenders that the lookouts already have fallen prey to the Nightmare.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nDuring Thrall's journey to Feralas, Snowsong accompanied Thrall. Thrall helped the local night elven druids in their troubles against the hostile elements. He then learned that his true journey has just begun. Thrall alongside the green dragon &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt; went to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; and Snowsong was said to be delivered to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Crimes.\nSnowsong is revealed to be too old to ride into battle any longer, but Thrall still takes her out for spirited runs. Thrall took his son &lt;a href=\"Durak\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt; on a ride to &lt;a href=\"One%20Keg\"&gt;One Keg&lt;/a&gt; during a recess in the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDespite her old age as revealed in \"War Crimes\", Snowsong accompanies Thrall to the alternate Draenor thirty-five years in the past, where she serves as his mount throughout his time there.\nLegion.\nAfter Thrall gives the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;new Farseer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, he leaves to think. Snowsong stays behind at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Snowfang\"&gt;Snowfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nStarting in \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20Rising\"&gt;Shadows Rising&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Moonpaw\"&gt;Moonpaw&lt;/a&gt; has replaced Snowsong as Thrall's battle mount. While it is possible that the aged Snowsong has simply retired, it may be that she has died from old age. Thrall's outfits in \"Battle for Azeroth\" onward are partly comprised of white fur, which may mean he is wearing Snowsong's pelt in the same way that his father &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; wore the pelt of Geyah's late wolf companion &lt;a href=\"Stormfang\"&gt;Stormfang&lt;/a&gt;."}

These gophers have great noses and can smell a tuber from fifty paces away.\nOnly the trained ones can be commanded with the &lt;a href=\"Snufflenose%20Command%20Stick\"&gt;Snufflenose Command Stick&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThe crate of snufflenose gophers is provided for the quest &lt;a href=\"Blueleaf%20Tubers\"&gt;Blueleaf Tubers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;. The spawned gopher will walk along until it finds a &lt;a href=\"Blueleaf%20Tuber\"&gt;Blueleaf Tuber&lt;/a&gt; nodes, then will \"dig\" and a lootable blueleaf tuber object will appear on the ground. \nThe snufflenose gopher can only be &lt;a href=\"spawn\"&gt;spawn&lt;/a&gt;ed in the trench of Razorfen Kraul (which is the only place the blueleaf tubers can be found). The snufflenose gopher will &lt;a href=\"despawn\"&gt;despawn&lt;/a&gt; if you leave, if it dies, or if you die.\nEach &lt;a href=\"Crate%20With%20Holes\"&gt;Crate With Holes&lt;/a&gt; can be used to spawn up to five snufflenose gophers. One snufflenose gopher is sufficient to do the quest. Spawning all five at once does not reveal nodes significantly faster, and the extraneous gophers can get out of control. \nYou can start or recall your snufflenose gopher with the &lt;a href=\"Snufflenose%20Command%20Stick\"&gt;Snufflenose Command Stick&lt;/a&gt;. You can somewhat aim your gopher forward or backward by the way you are facing when you command him to start. \nInitially, when no &lt;a href=\"Blueleaf%20Tuber\"&gt;Blueleaf Tuber&lt;/a&gt; nodes have been harvested, the gopher should not have to travel far to find one, but with several people on the quest, the nearby nodes will be cleared out, and the gopher can travel quite far. \nThe snufflenose gopher might appear to be a temporary &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;, but will draw &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; like a &lt;a href=\"combat%20pet\"&gt;combat pet&lt;/a&gt;, even though it does not fight. Be aware that if you have not cleared the trench, the gopher may well wander into a group of boars or an ooze. Recall is useful if your gopher is wandering into an area with hostile mobs.\nIt is faster for each player to run a gopher in a different section of the trench than to hunt for tubers in a crowd (and the gear for the quest is an object of the quest, so all the players on the quest have the ability to spawn and control a gopher), but in fact, only one player \"need\" spawn a gopher, and can run it for every one on the quest, allowing them to loot the nodes they need.

{"id": "21961", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21961", "title": "Socket", "text": "A socket is a special slot on an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; into which &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s can be inserted to provide bonuses similar to those gained from &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nSockets can be located on every piece of armor; however, each expansion has a different set of armor pieces that can have sockets.\nDepending on the source, from \"\" onwards, certain items that don't usually have sockets have a chance to drop with a socket.\nPlacing gems in sockets.\nGems can be added to sockets in the \"Item Socketing\" window, which can be opened by holding shift and right-clicking on a socketed item. The gems are then dragged into the slots, and the \"Socket Gems\" button is pressed to apply the gems.\nYou may replace currently socketed gems by placing a new gem in the same socket, but doing so will destroy the old gem (much like overwriting enchants). Currently, the only way to remove a socketed gem is by using the &lt;a href=\"Jewelhammer%27s%20Focus\"&gt;Jewelhammer\u2019s Focus&lt;/a&gt;. It can only be used by jewel crafters with maximum skill in either Zandalar or Kul'Tiran jewel crafting. In addition, your level must be level 50 or lower; Usually, this will be accomplished by entering any timewalking dungeon.\nSocket types.\nSockets are separated into the following types:\nPrismatic sockets.\nPrismatic (or uncolored) sockets are the default socket found in any item with gem sockets. They can also be added to an item by &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; skills (or items created with blacksmithing such as the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Belt%20Buckle\"&gt;Eternal Belt Buckle&lt;/a&gt;). Any gem (except meta gems) may be placed in them.\nItems that have a &lt;a href=\"%23Sha-Touched%20sockets\"&gt;Sha-Touched socket&lt;/a&gt; can have one prismatic socket added to them by using &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Black%20Prince\"&gt;Eye of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\nCogwheel sockets.\nCogwheel sockets are \"&lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;-only\" sockets first introduced in \"\". Any class is capable of adding cogwheels to these sockets as long as they have the engineering skill to do so. Currently, the only items that have cogwheels are the epic helms crafted by engineers with 75 skill points in Cataclysm or Pandaria engineering, and the Ghost Iron Dragonling.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Iron%20Dragonling\"&gt;Ghost Iron Dragonling&lt;/a&gt; is unique when it comes to cogwheel sockets. First, unlike the epic helms, it does not require an engineering skill to equip. Second, it does not require engineering to insert and use Pandaria cogwheel sockets. This means non-engineers can use the Ghost Iron Dragonling with cogwheel gems.\n\"Cataclysm\" cogwheels are purchased in &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cogwheel\"&gt;several other places&lt;/a&gt;, using other engineering crafted items as currency.\n\"Mists of Pandaria\" cogwheels can be made by Pandaria engineers.\nMeta sockets.\nMeta sockets are only found on high-level head gear from \"The Burning Crusade\" to \"Mists of Pandaria\" (currently only in particular varieties of head items). Meta sockets only accept &lt;a href=\"meta%20gem\"&gt;meta gem&lt;/a&gt;s, and meta gems may only be placed in meta sockets.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, a meta gem introduced before \"Mists of Pandaria\" would be inactive unless certain requirements were not met, such as equipped items being socketed with a certain number and color of other gems.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, Meta gems from Pandaria are no longer obtainable. If you have obtained one in the past but no longer are in possession of it, you may buy it back from the &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Blacktalon Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nSha-Touched sockets.\nSha-Touched sockets are only found on weapons from &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tsulong\"&gt;Tsulong&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shi\"&gt;Lei Shi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;. Sha-Touched sockets only accept &lt;a href=\"Sha-Touched\"&gt;Sha-Touched&lt;/a&gt; gems.\nDomination sockets.\nDomination sockets were introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt; from items dropped in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. They can only be filled with Shards of Domination, which also drop from the raid. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; on any difficulty will always drop a Shard of Domination.\n\u203bAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%209.2.0\"&gt;patch 9.2&lt;/a&gt;, Shards of Domination become completely inert when taken out of &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;the Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, only the set bonus was disabled while outside the Maw.\nEach armor type has a different set of pieces that have domination sockets on them. There will always be a domination socket on any of these pieces from the Sanctum of Domination.\nCloth: Head, Shoulder, Chest, Wrist, Waist.\nLeather: Head, Shoulder, Chest, Hands, Feet.\nMail: Head, Shoulder, Chest, Waist, Feet.\nPlate: Head, Shoulder, Chest, Wrist, Hands\nPunchcard sockets.\nPunchcard Sockets are only available on the &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pocket-Sized%20Computation%20Device\"&gt;Pocket-Sized Computation Device&lt;/a&gt;. This trinket earned from the quest &lt;a href=\"Upgraded\"&gt;Upgraded&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;. It has slots for specific punchcard \"gems,\" and has three punchcard slots colored red, yellow, and, blue. Only the punchcard with the matching color can be placed in the socket. Punchcards have a &lt;a href=\"Punchcard\"&gt;variety of effects&lt;/a&gt;.\nPunchcards drop from bosses in , as well as from rare mobs in Mechagon.\nColored sockets.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of sockets found on equipment were Red, Yellow, and Blue sockets. While any gem could be put in any of these socket types, the item socket bonus would only be activated if all of the sockets were filled with the matching gem color.\nWith the exception of &lt;a href=\"meta%20gem\"&gt;meta gem&lt;/a&gt;s, all gems matched one or more of these colors.\nHistory.\nSockets were introduced in \"\" and modeled after a similar concept using gems in \"Diablo II\", though the method of replacing them is different. The rune word system in the \"Diablo II\" expansion \"Lord of Destruction\", which added additional bonuses if a particular set of runes was inserted in a particular order, has not been replicated in WoW \u2014 special combinations of gems do not confer any bonuses except the item's pre-defined socket bonus, unless using a meta gem.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; with skill level 400+ are able to permanently place an additional &lt;a href=\"Socket%20Bracer\"&gt;socket on their bracer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Socket%20Gloves\"&gt;glove&lt;/a&gt;, making the socketed item &lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;soulbound&lt;/a&gt;. Blacksmiths were originally given the ability to socket one-handed weapons, but this appears to not have been implemented in a patch release (although it is referenced in the game files).\nA blacksmith with skill level 425+ can make an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Belt%20Buckle\"&gt;Eternal Belt Buckle&lt;/a&gt;, which can be used by anyone (even sold via the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;) to add a prismatic socket to a belt, making the belt soulbound.\nStarting with \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", no items have a socket by default. Instead, every item that drops from a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; has a small chance to have a prismatic socket."}

An echo of him called Councilor Othaar can still be found there, watching a &lt;a href=\"jed%27hin\"&gt;jed'hin&lt;/a&gt; match at the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Aspirants\"&gt;Circle of Aspirants&lt;/a&gt;. Othaar likes to think they must practice such a basic ritual as jed'hin to remind themselves of how far they have come and that Argus has much to be proud of.\nDraenor.\nUpon arrival on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; decided to establish a &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;council of sages&lt;/a&gt; that would look after the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Othaar was chosen as the fourth &lt;a href=\"Exarch\"&gt;Exarch&lt;/a&gt; as a leader of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari\"&gt;Sha'tari&lt;/a&gt; order. They were tasked with studying and analyzing the injured &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; and its kin in order to learn how to communicate with the other naaru and draenei beyond Draenor.\nOutland.\nAt an unknown point, he betrayed the draenei and joined the Legion.\nHe ruled the Burning Legion forces from his throne named &lt;a href=\"Socrethar%27s%20Seat\"&gt;Socrethar's Seat&lt;/a&gt;. Socrethar could be seen talking as an &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Socrethar\"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Culuthas\"&gt;Culuthas&lt;/a&gt;, who had found the legendary &lt;a href=\"Spirit%27s%20Song\"&gt;Spirit's Song&lt;/a&gt;, granting him immense amounts of power. Culuthas then broke away from the Legion, and started summoning his own demons. Socrethar ordered him to bring the Ata'mal crystal to the Legion or else face definite death.\nAbilities.\nHe is easily kiteable and affected by Crowd Control such as &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt;. If \nyour healer is low on mana it may be wise to banish Socrethar in order to allow the healer to regain mana. If you do try to kite him, be aware of his Anti-Magic Shield.\nKaylaan the Lost: (Aldor only)\nAvenger's Shield: Hurls a holy shield at the enemy, dealing 203 to 247 Holy damage, Dazing them and then jumping to additional nearby enemies. Affects 3 total targets. \nBurning Light: Inflicts 150% weapon damage. \nConsecration: Consecrates the land beneath Paladin, doing 25 Holy damage over 5 sec to enemies who enter the area. \nDivine Shield: Protects the caster from all attacks and spells for 8 sec., but also increases the time between attacks by 100% during that time. \nHeal: Calls upon Holy magic to heal an ally for 50 health. \nHoly Slam: Inflicts normal damage plus 30 to an enemy and knocks nearby enemies back. \nKaylan's Wrath: Unknown. \nResurrection: Resurrects a target, healing them for full health.\nKaylaan typically attempts to heal himself when he is between 30% to 40% health, if you get him below 30% health, he will no longer be aggressive. His Heal will normally heal him to full health. Kaylaan hits for a lot even on a properly geared tank, and ironically he hits more than Socrethar does.\nScryer Version.\nAdventurers allied with the Scryer can receive &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%27s%20Presence\"&gt;Voren'thal's Presence&lt;/a&gt; increasing damage dealt to Socrethar by 300%. This makes it possible that &lt;a href=\"Warlocks\"&gt;Warlocks&lt;/a&gt; can drain life him to death.\nAldor Version.\nThe Aldor version is much more difficult but has more lore. Upon arrival at Socrethar's Seat you are greeted by several Aldor &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, talking to one begins your advance upon Socrethar. As the champions of the Aldor confront Socrethar, Socrethar calls upon an ally of his own. &lt;a href=\"Kaylaan%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Kaylaan the Lost&lt;/a&gt; appears, the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; was once the Aldor champion &lt;a href=\"Kaylaan\"&gt;Kaylaan&lt;/a&gt; who had remarkable potential, but he saw his brother get killed by &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal\"&gt;Voren'thal&lt;/a&gt; himself. Seeing Voren'thal and his Scryer allies being accepted in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; was a breaking point for Kaylaan, he turned to Socrethar for power to fight his enemies. Socrethar further empowers him causing Kaylaan to go into a rage-like state and thus released upon you and your Aldor allies. Getting Kaylaan down to low life spawns High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Ishanah\"&gt;Ishanah&lt;/a&gt;. Socrethar proceeds to one shot Ishanah, Kaylaan seeing his beloved mentor die breaks out of his condition and proceeds to resurrect Ishanah. Socrethar seeing this betrayal right infront of him proceeds to claim Kaylaan's soul. Now along side Ishanah, Aldor champions proceed to kill Socrethar. Ishanah at the end of this ordeal remarks not even her strongest prayer could bring back Kaylaan."}

Following his death in during the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Campaign\"&gt;Garrison Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, his soul was taken by his &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; and placed into a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-tainted &lt;a href=\"vigilant\"&gt;vigilant&lt;/a&gt; construct so he could become immortal. \nThe battle with Socrethar the Eternal is one of the easier fights in the upper wing of Hellfire Citadel. So long as the tank who pilots the construct in phase 2 understands his abilities, the fight is quite simple. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The greatest warriors of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; have their souls imbued into gleaming constructs, serving as eternal &lt;a href=\"Vigilant\"&gt;Vigilant&lt;/a&gt;s in defense of their people. Originally a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt; before his descent into darkness, Socrethar has perverted this holiest of rituals, and used a warped fel construct to preserve his soul after his defeat in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDesigner notes.\n\"Another familiar name, Socrethar represents one of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt; with whom players contended in Talador. His soul is ensconced in a construct, a twisted version of &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Kaathar\"&gt;the first boss&lt;/a&gt; of , giving us a chance to play with a boss design idea that we haven\u2019t really seen since &lt;a href=\"Razorgore\"&gt;Razorgore&lt;/a&gt; all the way back in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;: What if you let the player control a raid boss and use all its abilities for a period of time?\"\nOverview.\nSocrethar begins the encounter occupying the &lt;a href=\"Soulbound%20Construct\"&gt;Soulbound Construct&lt;/a&gt;. When players deplete the Soulbound Construct's health, Socrethar's spirit will be ejected from the construct, and a player can take control of it. The Sargerei then stream into the chamber, and together with Socrethar attempt to regain control of the Construct. When the Construct's health is depleted when controlled by a player, they are ejected and Socrethar regains control, beginning the cycle again. Players must destroy Socrethar's soul to complete the encounter.\nAbilities.\nSocrethar and the Sargerei.\nOnce Socrethar is ejected from the construct, players can take control of it. The Sargerei join the battle in attempt to wrest control of the Construct back from the raid.\nStrategy.\nSocrethar the Eternal requires 2 tanks, one to pilot the construct in phase 2 and one to tank Socrethar himself, as well as tank swapping in phase 1. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; should be used when the first dominator comes out in phase 2.\nSocrethar starts the battle in the soulbound contruct and must be brought to 0 health to eject him. He will use Reverberating Blow on the tanks in a cone in front of him, so keep him pointed away from the group and positioned in the center of the room. Tanks should swap when they get to 4 or 5 stacks. When he casts FEL Prison, move away from the green circle on the ground. If someone does get caught in it, dps need to switch to the fel crystal to break the trapped person free. When afflicted by Gift of the Man'ari, move away from the group to let it fall off.Ranged should be stacked in the back-middle of the room. Set up 2 markers and decide where the group should drop Felblaze Charges and fel orbs: in the left and right corners of the room. When targeted by Felblaze Charge, a player should move to the designated side so when Socrethar rushes the player and leaves behind green fire, it won't be near the group. SAME concept for Unstable ORBS: move to the side so only 1 player will get hit by the damage instead of the whole group. \nWhen the Soulbound Construct reaches 0, the Soul of Socrethar will be ejected with 1 tank picking it up and the other tank jumping into the construct. The construct is weakened when under player control and must avoid taking damage because if it reaches 0, the player will be ejected, Socrethar will regain control and phase 1 will begin again. Three portals will spawn: Red (dominators), purple (Enemy casters), and light blue (GHOSTS). Players should move and position Socrethar next to the red portal. As soon as the Sargerei dominator spawns, all dps must switch to it to make the shield protecting Socrethar drop. The boss will attempt to cast Exert Dominance to greatly damage the construct which must be interrupted. He cannot be interrupted when the dominator's shield is up. If no dominators are up, ranged dps should prioritize the ghosts that spawn from the blue portal that fixate and run towards a random player. After the ghosts, the dps should kill the caster adds that spawn. After all adds in range are dead, then focus on the boss.\nMuch of the responsibility of the fight rides on the tank piloting the construct. To beat the enrage timer, the tank must keep 5 stacks of Reverberating Blows on Socrethar as well as plenty of autoattacks. To keep the ghosts from reaching where the party is stacked on the red portal, the tank must use Felblaze Charge so the flames form a straight line from the ghosts to the group so that they are slowed down and vulnerable to the party's ranged attacks for as long as possible. Use charge as often as possible to keep the line of fel fire as long and thick as possible, as it only takes a few ghosts getting through to cause a wipe. If a tank is seasoned enough, they can also throw an Unstable Orb at the ghosts to cause some extra damage. Half-way through the fight, the portals will change locations and the whole raid must reposition accordingly. Due to the fact that the ghosts are likely to spawn their next wave before the tank has enough time to make a large-enough line of felfire, use Fel Prison on the first ghost wave to keep them at bay long enough to set up the felblaze charges. \nVideos.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpKUsJvxhS0U\"&gt;Heroic Socrethar the Eternal - Mage - Boss Voice&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeVhDuIkl_hY\"&gt;Mythic Socrethar the Eternal - Mage - Boss Voice&lt;/a&gt;"}

Present during the battle against &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, he made her become a slave within her very own mind. Her blood had been corrupted by his dark magics and her arms are now covered in black marks left behind by the corruption that had erupted from her skin. The experience had only served to increase the intensity of her sadism. Her attire of choice is adorned with sharp spikes of twilight &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter convening with her fellow warlocks on the Council, Shinfel was partnered with &lt;a href=\"Zelifrax%20Wobblepox\"&gt;Zelifrax Wobblepox&lt;/a&gt; to hunt down the scattered remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cult\"&gt;Twilight Cult&lt;/a&gt;, and glean what knowledge (and, consequently, power) they could from the cultists -- one way or another.\nLegion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Shinfel and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; sought out &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;a powerful warlock&lt;/a&gt; to take place as the Sixth member of the Council, having since lost &lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt;. They met in the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Sewers\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to open a portal into the deepest parts of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and bind a powerful demon to their will in order to grow stronger against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Things went wrong as the powerful demon they managed to summon, &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt;, overwhelmed the Council, killed &lt;a href=\"Zelifrax%20Wobblepox\"&gt;Zelifrax Wobblepox&lt;/a&gt;, and took the others captive on his personal world, &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;.\nShinfel, after being tortured by demons and find them boring, was eventually freed by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Sixth&lt;/a&gt; of the Black Harvest alongside the other members but &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn%20Flamescowl\"&gt;Ritssyn Flamescowl&lt;/a&gt;, who had succumbed from his wounds. Together, they infiltrated the archives of Jagganoth and stole the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Blighted%20Implements\"&gt;Tome of Blighted Implements&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, they were discovered; Jagganoth, burning with rage, attacked them and knocked all the members of the Council to the ground, except for the Sixth who managed to flee and return to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Calydus\"&gt;Calydus&lt;/a&gt;, a demon that joined their cause.\nThe captured members were thus sent to the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; on the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;.\u00a0As the only free members of the Council of the Black Harvest, &lt;a href=\"Ritssyn%20Flamescowl\"&gt;Ritssyn Flamescowl&lt;/a&gt; - who had been resurrected - and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the Sixth&lt;/a&gt;, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Iresoul\"&gt;Kira Iresoul&lt;/a&gt;, created a demonic gateway to the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;, the First entered the portal searching for the captive members and saved them from the Legion, but Shinfel was nowhere to be found. However, her &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Golarb\"&gt;Golarb&lt;/a&gt;, explained to the First in his dying breath that her mistress was gone, taken by the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt;. This was terrible news to the Council: if Mephistroth managed to break Shinfel, he would be able to mount a devastating attack against &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt; armed with her power and knowledge.\nThe Council needed to gather the tools to perform a powerful enough ritual to summon her back to Dreadscar. In order to create the anchor needed for the ritual of summoning, they needed to link something of\u00a0Shinfel's to an unclaimed soul. The soul would act like a beacon, guiding Shinfel through the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and back to Dreadscar Rift. Shinfel's staff provided them with the link they need, but the soul was a bit harder to find: the First had to slay the\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Amalgam%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Amalgam of Souls&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0within\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0to retrieve a powerful, lost and forgotten soul.\nCreating the anchor required more power than the Council members' soul shards were able to provide, so they sent the Dreadscar troops, which were capable of amassing a large amount of soul shards when they defeated enemies, gather more. Ritssyn then harvested the soul shard supply and used it to craft the anchor.\nRitssyn thus finally bound Shinfel's soul to her staff and he, alongside &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Iresoul\"&gt;Kira Iresoul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the First&lt;/a&gt;, proceeded and summoned Shinfel. But she was dizzy, and in pain: she had been afflicted with a Curse of Doom by the Eredar Twins,\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sacrolash\"&gt;Lady Sacrolash&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0and\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Warlock%20Alythess\"&gt;Grand Warlock Alythess&lt;/a&gt;. The First went seeking for the knowledge of the alchemist Mad Ernie, who had worked with Ritssyn in the past, and who was now living in a Gilnean farm in Val'sharah. He told the First that the magic of a doom curse grows stronger as time goes on, eventually leading to death, and that only the caster of the curse can remove it. He crafted an elixir that would slow its progression for Shinfel by weakening it for some time.\nSince only the caster of a curse could remove the curse entirely, the Council decided they had to summon the powerful Eredar Twins to force them to cure Shinfel. Having previously fed &lt;a href=\"Bloodstone%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Kira Iresoul's Bloodstone&lt;/a&gt; with the blood of hundreds of demons, the Council summoned the Eredar Twins and managed to enslave them using the Bloodstone, forcing them to cure Shinfel.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI will do whatever is needed to defend Dreadscar Rift from the Burning Legion."}

A shipyard community has the skills and materials to build sailing vessels. The community is situated on a river, lake or sea. The community can build and maintain a fleet of sailing vessels, or it can take on repair work for other communities as a means of gaining additional income. Partially completed sailing ships can be seen near the water; as well as large stocks of timber planking, equipment for heating and bending timber.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAny &lt;a href=\"harbor\"&gt;harbor&lt;/a&gt; or dock could potentially be a shipyard because of the scaling issues in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", for even a small seaside settlement could be considered in lore to be an important naval community. A good example of that ambiguity is &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Harbor\"&gt;Sun's Reach Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;: it is an harbor where &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven_destroyer\"&gt;elven destroyers&lt;/a&gt; are moored, but it is not confirmed to be a shipyard where they are also actually built. Most naval powers of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; should have their own shipyards, excepted the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, for their navy is composed of ships dredged up from the bottom of the ocean, most of which were once among Lordaeron's fleets.\n&lt;a href=\"Solog%20Roark\"&gt;Solog Roark&lt;/a&gt; is considered a genius around a drydock and designed most of the naval facilities of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;."}

He is located at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Bridge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Bridge of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. Though he looks like an &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;, he is actually an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; construct created by &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Shirrak was constructed by Exarch Maladaar to guard over the fallen draenei spirits who wander the Auchenai Crypts. A necrotic mass of eyes, teeth, and tentacles, this undead construct absorbs arcane energy with hungry abandon, and will not suffer the living to pass.\"\nStrategy.\nThis fight is fairly straight-forward, but the party must have room to maneuver. This means that you must fight him on the elevated areas where he spawns after you first enter the bridge of souls. Fighting him on the stairs and bridge will spell disaster in most cases. \nOpening: The main tank should charge Shirrak and either tank him in the middle of the elevated area or pull him over to one of the walls, in order to give the rest of the party plenty of room to move. As soon as the tank charges, the rest of the party should move past Shirrak to the large flat area behind him and take up position. All casters should stay at their maximum cast range and stay spread out to avoid flares (below).\nThe Fight: Shirrak's debuff will affect all casters so healers will need to put some lead time into their casts. DPS casters should focus on instant to provide consistent damage. Channeled spells are also reportedly affected by this debuff. Melee classes have to deal with the stackable Carnivorous Bite. It's best to get out of melee range to let it fade if this gets stacked to 3. \nAll the while, Shirrak will drop his flare bombs on randomly selected party members, announcing it each time with \"Shirrak the Dead Watcher focuses his energy on &lt;target&gt;\" text in the center of the screen. These bombs travel to the current location of the &lt;target&gt;. Giving that location a wide berth until the flare explodes will mitigate the issue. \nYou will have approximately 3\u20135 seconds to vacate the area after the raid message appears, so ignore accumulated combo points, forget about that skill you were just about to use or that spell you were in the middle of casting\u2014RUN! Strafing away is often the quickest method of leaving the area. One untried strategy includes running behind the abutments along the wall (out of line-of-sight), which should also disrupt the damage.\nFinal thoughts: Another way that has worked for some groups is to use a warlock Felguard to tank the boss. The warlock is able to spam his pet heal while the healer keeps the rest of the party up. This especially works when your party has tons of melee DPS to take Shirrak down before mana pools are exhausted. \nHealing.\nThe Inhibit Magic debuff stacks more times depending on how close you are to him, so try to stay as far away from the boss as possible. The outer range for the debuff is about 45 yards and a priest's heals have a maximum range of 40 yards, so it is impossible to heal the tank without at least one application of the debuff. The debuff becomes active the moment you step within 45 yards of the boss, or maybe a half-second or so after that, so you can't really avoid it by moving in and out. It is \"critical\" to stay positioned so that you only have a 50% cast time penalty; unless you are a Restoration-spec'd Druid, it is unlikely that you can keep the tank up with just instant-cast HoTs, and with a 100% time debuff you just take way too long to cast even 1.5-second spells like &lt;a href=\"Flash%20Heal\"&gt;Flash Heal&lt;/a&gt;. Running out and back in does nothing to reduce the debuff, but it does reduce the time you are healing or attacking, so don't move unless you get a flare bomb near you or Shirrak moves towards you (for example, if the tank has to move Shirrak to avoid a flare bomb).\nIf you position the tank on the far side of the boss and your other melee DPS on the near side, you \"might\" be able to heal the melee DPS and ranged DPS with no penalty, but then you won't be able to reach the tank at all. This doesn't seem too worthwhile, since ranged DPS takes very little damage in this fight. It might make sense for a secondary healer to try to position themselves this way, however, as it would make keeping everyone but the tank up a trivial job.\nThe bleed effect due to Carnivorous Bite DoT on melee DPS is sometimes the hardest part to deal with. Keeping HoT spells active on melee DPS is a good idea.\nIf you get knocked back, reposition yourself immediately. If you are the &lt;target&gt; of the \"Focus Fire\", abort your spell-casting and run. It goes without saying that in order to do this, you have to have an eye out for the raid warning that pops up in the center of the screen, don't just be looking at your party's health bars.\nTotally solo heal-able, and an absolute cakewalk if you have two classes along with HoTs.\nSecondary healer.\nHaving a main and off-healer can be a life-saver, especially with the casting debuff. The main healer can focus on the tank while the off-healer catches the rest of the party. This also gives you backup when a flare focuses the main healer and they have to run.\nA secondary healer, especially one that can transition between dps and healing, helps a lot during this fight.\nIf your other DPS can do the job, even a feral druid with good healing gear can be valuable in this fight as a second healer. Simply stand in the middle between melee and ranged groups, using nothing but HoTs to get around the cast time debuff.\nTanking.\nOne of the biggest risks to the tank are being hit by a \"focus fire\" attack on either the tank directly or on a nearby DPS unit. Tank the boss to the left or right, and when a flare appears strafe to the other side ASAP to avoid the damage. Since healers can't spam big heals, standing in range of a flare when it detonates is the primary cause of tank death.\nNon-conventional tanking strategies of using warlock or shaman pets have proven successful for some groups. Shaman pets are immune to bleed effects (i.e. Carnivorous Bite) and some have reported that Shirrak doesn't target pets for his \"focus fire\" attack. Hunter pet is not an option because hunter pets are not immune to Carnivorous Bite.\nDPS.\nIt is a great advantage in this fight to have at least some physical-based DPS, since the debuff will cripple casters. A hunter is ideal since they will remain mobile and not run the risk of attracting the boss' \"focus\" near the tank. An affliction-spec'd warlock is also an asset: using dots and drain life, he will pretty much do as much damage as in another fight, while healing himself and avoiding bites. \nMelee DPS is great for avoiding the cast time debuff, but it increases the chance the tank will have a flare appear under them. Melee DPS might have to run to the healer to get heals if they are positioned on the far side of Shirrak from the healer. If you get more than 2-3 stacked Carnivorous Bite DoTs on you, it's a good idea to step back out of melee range to let them fade\u2014especially if it looks like the healing is having trouble keeping up with it.\nCaster DPS should be at MAX range. They can bandage or get a heal if the healer can spare it. A good caster strategy is to simply chain-cast instant spells, disregarding the Inhibit Magic debuff. Keep in mind that caster DPS will be severely decreased for this fight, whatever strategy is undertaken. Wait until you are pulled in to the boss (by his Attract Magic ability) before trying to evocation or bandage, as his Attract Magic will interrupt evocation and bandage.\nHeroic mode.\nThe abilities are the same except the damage is increased. The Focus Fire is increased to nearly 3800 Fire damage, and there are 3 balls of flame shot at the target. At the end of the fight his Carnivorous Bite can tick up to 2,500 damage every 3 seconds. A good strategy is to have the healers stand on opposite sides of the area to prevent getting double fire-balled while healing and have them use and &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; liberally. HoTs help out considerably on this encounter. As long as you pay attention to the flare/fireball area the encounter is simple.\nTo avoid taking heavy damage from high stacks of carnivorous bite, it is possible for the tank to move out of melee range when Shirrak focuses on a player and stay out of range long enough for the debuff to fade. This will prevent Shirrak from adding another stack of carnivorous bite onto the tank (which also resets the fade timer on the carnivorous bite). At high stacks the damage from carnivorous bite is high enough to negate two druids HOTs, and only the best healers can heal through it. This tactic is made easier if the tank positions Shirrak on one side of the room early in the fight. Since Shirrak moves slowly, there is a good chance that carnivorous bite will have faded by the time he reaches the tank again. Obviously, DPS party members must not pull aggro while the tank is waiting for carnivorous bites to fade. \nIf there is an off-tank in the group, a potentially easier way to avoid this \"carnivorous bite\" problem is to have an off-tank pick up the boss when there are three or more stacks on the main tank. The main tank can then move out of melee and let the debuff fade before retaking aggro.\nIf you have a paladin in your group, he can use blessing of protection to clear the bleed from the tank (and a quick follow up with another blessing will prevent Shirak from going after anyone else). A good time to use this is after the fourth Attract Magic/Carnivorous Bite combo, while running back to position.\nA group make-up including a healing paladin, any type of shaman, and leatherworker is ideal. Since Shirrak has relatively low HP, one good round of healing should be enough to keep the party up long enough to burn him down. The group should wait until several members of the party need drastic healing (60% health remaining). Shirrak should be at around 40-70% by then. The Paladin should use Divine Shield to remove the casting slow effect. At the same time have the shaman use Heroism and the LeatherWorker throw out his drums. This will enable the paladin to quickly restore everyone back up to full while still dps-ing. If the party is still getting in a bind, using holy shock as a fast heal (since it is an instant cast) works the best (albeit mana inefficient)."}

It takes around 30 seconds for a guild member to submit his guild recruitment status and after the data is validated by a Realm History Administrator it will become visible on our site in the respective realm \"Guild Recruitment\" section but also in the worldwide \"Last Recruiting Posts\" page which will be browsed by players from all realms that are looking to transfer.\nAnother function which we just added is the Screenshot Gallery. You can either browse the screenshots from a specific realm or from all the realms and you can view the newest screenshots added, or the most popular ones.\nRealm Features:\n- Screenshot Gallery (new)\n- Guild Index\n- Guild Recruitment (new)\n- PvE Progression\n- Rare Crafts database\nWorldwide Features:\n- Instance Status\n- Guild Search by PvE progress and Recruitment Status (new)\n- Last Recruiting Guilds (new)\n- Last Downed bosses\n- Screenshot Gallery (new)\nThe idea behind this site was to come with a fresh take on the whole handling of data that realm communities feel the need to record during their process of organization. The painful updating of endless threads on the official forums, dealing with cumbersome excel tables or rudimentary hosted charts constituted the drive of the project and we think we have come to the point where we are able to offer an easy, fast and appealing interface for best reading and appealing interface for best reading and updating your realm's guild index, PVE progression and rare crafts' list.\nAt the moment our incipient network provides services for about a dozen of realm communities and around another dozen is being brought up to date by our administrators so as to be released in the near future.
