The &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; in particular would bear the brunt of these attacks due to &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; refusing to drink from the &lt;a href=\"Cup%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Cup of Unity&lt;/a&gt;, and his notable reluctance in attacking the draenei. &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; managed to maintain peace by ordering the clans to submit their finest warriors for &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;controlled, one-on-one or small party fights&lt;/a&gt; in public display.

{"id": "171392", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=171392", "title": "EPGP", "text": "EPGP is based on the concept of Effort Points and Gear Points. Effort Points quantify the effort each member put towards the (common) guild goals and Gear Points quantify what each member got back in return. Loot priority is computed as the quotient of the two; priority (PR) is equal to EP/GP.\nIn a sense EPGP is like zero sum, but without all the need to rebalance the system, or impose taxes to give points for other effort put into the guild. Zero sum awards GP/N points to each player for each item dropped (GP the value of the item and N the number of players in the raid) so that the sum of all points for the members of the guild is zero. EPGP on the other hand is by definition self balanced since priority (and hence chance to receive loot) is directly proportional to the effort you put and inversely proportional to the rewards you got. It is also much more flexible than zero sum since it doesn't require a specific balance point (sum to be equal to zero for example). As such points can be awarded for almost anything without any taxation or over complicating the system (see below). Also another problem with zero sum is the random value of each boss. A boss kill is a boss kill and the effort to kill it is the same no matter if it happened to drop 1 or 2 epics. With zero sum since the amount of effort points the members get is proportional to the loot dropped which is definitely not representing fairly the effort each member puts in the guild.\nPoint changes.\nEP can be awarded through a multiple activities:\nGP points are accounted through some other set of action:\nClearly each guild can choose to use any combination (or even come out with its own point assignment) of the above points. Assignment of points for each activity/action is not something that EPGP tries to solve. This is solely left to the guild management, as it is out of the scope of the core of the system (and is also the case with many popular loot systems).\nAnother twist in EPGP, that makes it different than other loot systems is the fact that EP and GP decay over time. The decay can be set by the guild master (it can also be disabled if it is set to zero). With a decay of N%, after each raid the guild participates in, each member gets her EP and GP reduced by N%. This eliminates EP (DKP) hoarding.\nBecause of the fact that EP decays over time, we can use a simple metric to estimate attendance: Min EPs. Given a value for Min EPs we choose to give PR = 0 to those that have less than Min EPs. As an example, assume a guild where about 500 EPs are awarded per member per raid and a Decay of 10%. If Min EPs is set to 1300 then a member needs to be in at least the last 3 raids to be eligible for loot (500+450+405), or the last 4 raids before the last one 450+405+365+329. This is arguably a better measure than attendance, as attendance is a somewhat loose criterion: if a member came to a raid for 1 hour only and the rest were in it for 4, do they all count as the attended the raid? Since EP measures the effort of each member, having a Min EP puts the cut-off at an effort point which will work both for new members and old members. An old member that is idle for a long time will loose EPs gradually so she might get lower than Min EPs which makes her ineligible for loot. A new member starts with EP equal to zero so he needs to attend some raids in order to get his EP above Min EP to be eligible for loot.\nAnother way to combat people with 0 GP skyrocketing on the PR meters (trials or inactive members that just became active) is with Base GP. With Base GP set to X everyone's effective GP becomes X + Individual GP. Effective GP will never go below X. Using Base GP has a major ramification:\nGP values.\nEPGP also adds a tooltip line to items displaying the GP value of the item. The GP value is computed using the item level and the equipping slot of each item as follows:\nGP = item value2 x 0.04 x slot value\nItem value is computed using the method on the right:\nSlot mod is given by the following table:\nJust giving some examples, using the above formula gives the following GP values for the following items (mainly priest items).\nChest pieces:\nStaves:\nAs you can see this model of assigning values to items, scales well between rare and epic items alike. In the above list there are blue items that are of better quality than epics and their GP value correctly models this fact.\nSpecifics.\nEach member starts with EP = 0 and GP = 0. As such PR = 0. As EP are awarded PR goes up and as GP are awarded PR goes down. Let us look at an example. Assume 3 members A, B and C, EP per raid 10, GP per item 10, and DECAY_P = 10. Also assume that member A attends all raids, member B and C only 2 out 3.\nHere's how EPGP look like before the start of raiding:\nIn the first raid the all attend, and A and B receive loot:\nNotice that the when GP is 0 when computing PR we take it as 1. In the start of the second raid EP and GP will decay by DECAY_P%. The standings will look as follows:\nIn the second raid all participate so the next to receive loot is C and lets say that B receives loot as well (member B is tied with member A so they roll):\nIn the beginning of the third raid we decay all EP and GP again. The standings table will look as follows:\nNotice that even though A and C attended the same raids and received the same loot A's PR is higher than C's. This is because A received an item earlier than B so that item's value decayed for more time than B's item.\nNow in the next raid only A participates and receives a piece of loot:\nTime for the next raid. The starting table will look as follows:\nEveryone participates. Next in line to receive loot are C and A. And they do in which case the final table will look like this:\nProblems and solutions.\nEP hoarding.\nThis problem is non-existent in EPGP because of the use of the EP and GP decay. Only temporal EP and GP are accounted; the later you \"use\" your PR lead, the less benefit you receive. The earlier you take an item, the faster its value will decay.\nNew members vs veterans.\nBecause of the decay, new members become equal under the system much faster. EPs decay over time so with a 10% decay in about 15 raids a veteran has about the same EP as a new member (if they both attended the same raids). The only barrier to entry for new members is reaching Min EPs in order to be eligible for loot.\nMembers that are geared up vs members that are not.\nMembers that are geared up already will end up with the highest PR possible and will have first priority over a new (and possibly rare) drop. This will satisfy these members. Members that are not geared up already will end up getting loot in most raids which will keep their priority low. So they will still gear up but they will not threaten members that wait for a special piece to drop in order to get their satisfaction as well.\nComplexity.\nUnlike Zero Sum with taxation, which is very similar, there is no need to rebalance when members join/leave guild, and no changes in tax/decay because of more tries on new content. The reduced complexity of the system allows more people to understand it, which keeps the queries to the guild master low and member satisfaction up.\nHard to assign item values and boss kill/tries values.\nBecause effort points are decoupled from gear points it is easier to assign \"good\" values for each category. Guild Masters/Officers can focus on balancing different boss kill/tries, materials farming rewards separately from item values. If you notice in the above example nothing would change if each raid was awarding 987 EP and each piece was worth 123 points. Balancing rewards and items is extremely hard; balancing them in isolation is much simpler.\nRandomness on boss value in zero sum.\nZero Sum's major flaw is that for the same encounter, you might end up getting more or less points, depending on the loot (which is random). This introduces a major cause of unfairness to the system, since the same boss, which requires the same effort, is worth more in some runs and less in others. In EPGP each boss awards the same EP every time, adding to the fairness of the system."}

Eadric will go to great lengths to cull those without the moral conviction to enter &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategy.\nBefore facing Eadric himself, players will have to deal with three groups of three mobs consisting of an Argent Lightwielder, an Argent Monk and an Argent Priestess: \nThe priestess drops lightwells, casts Holy Smite and Shadow Word: Pain. On heroic, she will also try to Mind Contol someone unless interrupted.\nThe lightwielder melees and casts cleave. \nThe monk has Final Meditation (on heroic only) which encases him in bubble at 1 hp and slows attack and move speed or nearby players, therefore, the monks should be killed last to avoid the other trash mobs from creating dangerous situations.\nEadric himself is mostly a tank-and-spank. \nHealers should expect heavy damage when he casts Hammer Of The Righteous. Dispelling Hammer of Justice promptly will prevent this damage and permit the subject of Hammer of the Righteous to catch the hammer he throws and throw it back for massive damage on Eadric.\nWhen he begins to cast Radiance, if all party members turn their back to him, they can avoid the holy damage. Melee can step forward until it goes off, then step back, or turn in place, as best suits their method of play. Because healers do not need to be facing their healing targets, healers can play with their backs turned to Eadric for the entire fight.\nQuotes.\nThat was an impressive display. But are your ready for your next challenge?\nOR\nSound Files.\nSee \""}

It was published in 2003. It contains descriptions and game statistics for a large number of creatures that inhabit the Warcraft setting. As the book was published before the release of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", it only covers a few creatures that were introduced in the &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; and mostly covers material from the &lt;a href=\"Real-time%20strategy\"&gt;RTS&lt;/a&gt; series.\nThe book is out of print. However, it can still be obtained in a PDF format. A new creature source book for the \"\" was released on February 7, 2007 called \"&lt;a href=\"Monster%20Guide\"&gt;Monster Guide&lt;/a&gt;\". It covers new creatures that appear in \"World of Warcraft\" and updates some of the creatures from \"Manual of Monsters\" with new game statistics and rules of the new \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;\" game. \n&lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; was a co-author and a member of the \"Design Assistance and Additional Material\" staff for the book.\nContents.\nAppendix Two: Villains of Warcraft.\nIn Appendix Two the book also contains descriptions and game statistics for the following major villains of the \"Warcraft\" universe:\nAppendix Three: Other Monsters in Warcraft.\nFinally, Appendix Three contains original lore for monsters and creatures adapted into the \"Warcraft\" setting from other d20 books (', &lt;a href=\"http%3A//rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php%3Fproducts_id%3D3238%26amp%3Bit%3D1%26amp%3Bfilters%3D0_0_0_10123\"&gt;Creature Collection Revised&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//rpg.drivethrustuff.com/product_info.php%3Fproducts_id%3D3319%26amp%3Bit%3D1\"&gt;Creature Collection II: Dark Menagerie&lt;/a&gt;, and \"'). According to the book, the updated lore takes precedence over descriptions found in the previous non-\"Warcraft\" books. The section also contains information on how to incorporate other monsters into a campaign for the \"Warcraft RPG\". The background lore could be used by someone who wanted to include the monsters in their campaigns.\n\"Other Monsters in Azeroth... Some creatures in \"Manual of Monsters\" are similar to the described in the \"MM\"-&lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s, and so on. In some cases the \"MM\" descriptions are suitable for use as-is, such as for elementals. Under circumstances, the creature receives no listing in the \"Manual of Monsters\". In other cases, monsters are different enough in their ecology or abilities to require a new description here. When a creature is listed in the \"Manual of Monsters\" with the same one as the \"MM\", the description in this book takes precedence for a \"Warcraft\" campaign. The same is true for an animals or vermin particular to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, as described in Appendix One. In the case of identical types of animals the ones in the \"Manual of Monsters\" takes precedence.\nMany of these creatures are unique, and have not appeared in previous \"Warcraft\" video games (although a few like the \"&lt;a href=\"Observer\"&gt;floating eyes&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt;s\", \"&lt;a href=\"bone%20golem\"&gt;bone golem&lt;/a&gt;s\" and others were incorporated later). A few entries (&lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;) seem at first glance to contradict other known lore on the subject; however, the book explains that they are unique or rare variations of those creatures. Some of these rare variations appears to be in later sources (&lt;a href=\"Centaur%23Centaurs%20from%20the%20Eastern%20Kingdom\"&gt;Centaur from the Eastern Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dryad%23Dryad%20%28tree%20spirit%29\"&gt;Dryad (tree spirit)&lt;/a&gt;, and others).\nIt's also notable that Appendix III expands upon creatures that were referenced in other chapters, appendices, and sections of the book, for example &lt;a href=\"mite\"&gt;mite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nymph\"&gt;nymph&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shambling%20mound\"&gt;shambling mound&lt;/a&gt;s. Some sections from the Appendix Three, such as articles about &lt;a href=\"giant%20eagle\"&gt;giant eagle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"sprite\"&gt;sprite&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nymph\"&gt;nymph&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"devourer%20%28RPG%29\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s, and a few others, have been referenced or expanded upon in later sources. The article about the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Centaur%23Centaurs%20from%20the%20Eastern%20Kingdom\"&gt;Centaur from the Eastern Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, were derived from and expand upon ideas made in previous \"Warcraft\" games.\nAppendix III is not the only \"Warcraft\" source to establish original \"Warcraft\"-related back stories to creatures from the \"D&amp;D MM\" and other non-\"Warcraft\" sourcebooks. Some of the earlier chapters in \"Manual of Monsters\" incorporated a few creatures not included in Appendix III, including references to &lt;a href=\"darkmantle%20%28monster%29\"&gt;darkmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"girallon\"&gt;girallon&lt;/a&gt;. Even more original creatures were established in other \"Warcraft\" sourcebooks including \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20%26amp%3B%20Light\"&gt;Shadows &amp; Light&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Magic%20%26amp%3B%20Mayhem\"&gt;Magic &amp; Mayhem&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20The%20Roleplaying%20Game\"&gt;World of Warcraft The Roleplaying Game&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Monster%20Guide%20Web%20Supplement\"&gt;Monster Guide Web Supplement&lt;/a&gt;\", such as: &lt;a href=\"dire%20lion\"&gt;dire lion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lizard\"&gt;lizard&lt;/a&gt; familiars, or &lt;a href=\"steam%20mephit\"&gt;steam mephit&lt;/a&gt;s, which are found in the story \"Dark Iron Chains\" that &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; recounts in \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Appendix Three was split into several sections which sometimes included a small background explanation on how the material related to biology or history of Azeroth. The following is a listing of some of these quotes;\nThe Kaldorei count many more allies than have been documented so far. Amongst these allies are several species from the Tome of Horrors by Necromancer Games. Some are ancient allies, others newly recruited (or reclaimed) allies, befriended by the night elves in the wake of their lost immortality.&lt;br&gt; The minions of the Burning Legion are countless, yet below is a list of shock troops, animal cohorts, and generals alike.&lt;br&gt; In addition to quilboar, tauren, elves, and orcs, other sapient species populate the world of Azeroth. Three of them are described in the Tome of Horrors.&lt;br&gt; Orcs and goblins are not the only &lt;a href=\"goblinoid\"&gt;goblinoid&lt;/a&gt;s on Azeroth. Some of the previously unknown species are crossbreeds, while others seem to be races unto themselves. Three of these species are discussed briefly below.&lt;br&gt; The diversity of animal life on Azeroth is limitless. In addition to the creatures described elsewhere in this book, several species described in the Tome of Horrors can also be found on Kalimdor and throughout Azeroth.&lt;br&gt; In addition to the diversity of life on the surface of Kalimdor, the seas of Azeroth are also teeming with life. Much of this life is mundane, if monstrously large, though the sea has her secrets \u2014 and threats. The following aquatic creatures listed in the Tome of Horrors can be found in the rivers, lakes and oceans in around Kalimdor.\nMonsters Ranked by Challenge Ratings.\nThe final section is a table showing a variety of monsters, how much of a challenge they are, and what classes they tend to be."}

Lordaeron hosts a vast variety of undead, so while many of the types covered below may be uncommon on Kalimdor, nearly any sort of undead may be discovered streaming out of the north.\nThe Burning Legion (Other Fiends).\nThe minions of the Burning Legion are countless, yet below is a list of shock troops, animal cohorts, and generals alike. Cerberus is presented as an example of how to adjust the backgrounds of unique individuals to fit the meta-story of the Warcraft universe.\nThe Lost Tribes (Other Humanoid Species).\nIn addition to quilboar, tauren, elves, and orcs, other sentient species populate the world of Azeroth. Three of them are described in Tome of Horrors.\nOther Goblinoids.\nOrcs and goblins are not the only goblinoids on Azeroth. Some of the previously unknown species are crossbreeds, while others seem to be races unto themselves. Three of these species are discussed briefly below.\nAnimals.\nThe diversity of animal life on Azeroth is limitless. In addition to the creatures described elsewhere in this book, several species described in the Tome of Horrors can also be found on Kalimdor and throughout Azeroth.\nThe Dwellers Underneath (Aquatics).\nIn addition to the diversity of life on the surface of Kalimdor, the seas of Azeroth are also teeming with life. Much of this life is mundane, if monstrously large, though the sea has her secrets - and threats. The following aquatic creatures listed in the Tome of Horrors can be found in the rivers, lakes and oceans in and around Kalimdor.\nBarracuda; Bunyip; Caribe, Giant; Clam, Giant; Crab, Monstrous; Crayfish, Monstrous; Dragonfish; Eel, Electric; Floating Eye; Jellyfish, Monstrous; Quipper; Tiger Barb, Giant.\nThe Others.\nSome creatures, some entities, are beyond classification; however, they are still possible encounters on Kalimdor and beyond.\nTemplates.\nIn addition to the aberration template mentioned above (see gorilla bear), three other templates from the Tome of Horrors are applicable to the world of Azeroth.\nSpectral Troll.\n__NOEDITSECTION__"}

You can display your coordinates with many &lt;a href=\"AddOns\"&gt;AddOns&lt;/a&gt;. It consists of a set of x/y coordinates, which is two numbers ranging from 0 to 100, representing a location on the current &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; map.\nUsers of the Cosmos addon can show their current position under the minimap by typing codice_1.&lt;br&gt;\nVarious other &lt;a href=\"AddOns\"&gt;AddOns&lt;/a&gt; are also capable of displaying your current location. Examples include:\nChecking coordinates without addons.\nIn-game, simply copy the following:\n /run z = C_Map.GetBestMapForUnit(\"player\"); pos = C_Map.GetPlayerMapPosition(z,\"player\"); print(C_Map.GetMapInfo(z).name, math.ceil(pos.x*10000)/100, math.ceil(pos.y*10000)/100)\nGo into the game, open a chat box, paste, hit enter. Your present coordinates for the zone will appear in the default chat frame. This code can also be placed in a &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;.\nMultiple coordinates for the same point.\nBecause the zone maps are always rectangular but the zones themselves are not, your location can sometimes be visible on more than one zone map at different coordinates. Thus, if you've manually changed the map to a different zone, or zoomed it out while in a city, you'll need to change it back before giving coordinates. The above script does this, but some add-ons won't.\nShowing coordinate locations in Wowpedia.\nYou can use the templates and to indicate locations on a map using the map coordinates.\nTooltip.\nYou can also add coordinates (with a map tooltip), as a note, to an item or NPC using :\nExample: &lt;a href=\"The%20Rokk\"&gt;The Rokk&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "33249", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=33249", "title": "Storm Peaks", "text": "The Storm Peaks are a &lt;a href=\"mountain\"&gt;mountain&lt;/a&gt; range and region located in the northeast of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. To most, it is a dangerous place that requires caution, as the cold is enough to freeze someone, and its winds are so strong they could pluck people right off a mountain. Due to high winds and avalanches, the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; recommend bringing at least two companions if venturing into the dangerous Storm Peaks.\nAs the home of the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s, nearly every mountain of Storm Peaks carries their mark. Among them, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"titan%20watcher\"&gt;titan watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, is located on this peaks. The third known &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; is also located here.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20North%20Wind\"&gt;The North Wind&lt;/a&gt; was once the elemental ruler of the Storm Peaks, crushing the land and its denizens, including the tribes of the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;, in its iron grip. Seeking to end the North Wind's domination of his people, the taunka hero &lt;a href=\"Stormhoof\"&gt;Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;, brother of &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Swiftspear\"&gt;Chieftain Swiftspear&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Tunka%27lo\"&gt;Camp Tunka'lo&lt;/a&gt;, did battle against the North Wind in the &lt;a href=\"Plain%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Plain of Echoes&lt;/a&gt; and weakened it, but did not manage to defeat it before he fell. Biding its time as it regained strength, the North Wind plotted an insidious revenge against both Stormhoof and his people: it would erase the hero from history, altering the timeline and ensure its continued domination of the Storm Peaks. It changed the recorded history of Tunka'lo, portraying Stormhoof as a servile insurrectionist executed for his \"crimes\", rather than the hero who had liberated his people.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited the region and were excited to greet the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s, and to see all the titan sites again, now that they're more likely to be operating correctly and less likely to be filled with people who want to kill him on sight.\nGeography.\nThe highest mountain in the Storm Peaks is also the highest point in all of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and atop it sits the open-sided, titan-made &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;.\nDig sites.\nThe Storm Peaks has three &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s:\nWild creatures.\nRare creatures.\n&lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Proto%20Drake\"&gt;Time-Lost Proto Drake&lt;/a&gt; is known to live in the Storm Peaks.&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml%3Fi%3D44168\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nRare Elite NPCs associated with the achievement.\nIn the RPG.\nFrom the name, you would think the Storm Peaks are mountains but that is not entirely accurate, though they have the highest elevation of any region in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. However, they are not mountains, they are cliffs. The \"peaks\" are the spots where wind has not cut away the ice and rock, as opposed to the narrow paths it has carved. Through large parts of this region you can literally leap from peak to peak, provided the wind does not throw you over the edge.\n&lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, like much of Northrend, is sparsely inhabited. The &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s stay hidden, their &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20golem\"&gt;golems&lt;/a&gt; don't bother you unless you approach the giants' homes, and the &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt; are infrequent and large enough to spot from a distance. It is a good place to be alone with your thoughts if you don't mind the biting wind, the searing cold, and the repetitive stretches of ice and rock.\nThe Storm Peaks have treacherous paths, powerful winds, jagged cliffs and hungry monsters. They are also home to the &lt;a href=\"storm%20giant\"&gt;storm giant&lt;/a&gt;s, one of the oldest races in the world and the keepers of the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s' legacy.\nHistory.\nLong ago the Titans lived here. They created Ulduar as their city, and from there they worked their experiments. The storm giants began here, and perhaps the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s as well. Then the Titans disappeared, leaving the races to survive on their own. The dwarves moved south, into warmer climates, but the storm giants remained and claimed Ulduar. They developed &lt;a href=\"crystalline%20golem\"&gt;crystalline golem&lt;/a&gt;s to aid them in their research and to defend them. Over time the giants have dwindled in number and grown ever more reclusive. Now only a handful remains.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invaded Northrend, the storm giants, who might have been strong enough to stop him, hid away in the Storm Peaks and avoided all contact.\nDuring one of the frequent storms, a lightning shattered a small peak, revealing a cave hidden within. Some explorers saw that the cave walls had clearly been fashioned by an artisan, and resembled a strangely organic city or house. One of them brought word back to &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; and created a stir. They speculated if the cave could have been a Titan home and wondered what secrets remain hidden there. A group of heroes decided to mount an expedition and explore the cave before the storm giants could find it and claim it.\nPeople and culture.\nThe &lt;a href=\"storm%20giant\"&gt;storm giant&lt;/a&gt;s make their home here. They are impressive, more than 30 feet tall and powerfully built and they can even summon small storms. They normally keep to themselves, hidden in their caves and tunnels below the surface, and avoid visitors. The giants like their privacy, and their &lt;a href=\"crystalline%20golem\"&gt;crystalline golem&lt;/a&gt;s help maintaining it. The same golems can be found down in &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, gathering crystals to bring back here. There they are servants and couriers but here they function as door wardens and bodyguards, making sure no intruder gains entrance to the giants' lairs.\n&lt;a href=\"Magnataur\"&gt;Magnataur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt; roam the peaks, fortunately they are solitary, and easy to spot.\nGeography.\nOn the edge of the peaks you can look out over &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; to the south, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, and the ocean to the north.\nThe two biggest dangers in the Storm Peaks are not necessarily its inhabitants. The wind is fierce and constant, and can easily tug a grown dwarf off a cliff. One look at those paths it has cut through them and you realize how deadly wind can be.\nThe second danger is sunlight. That might sound strange but the peaks are covered in ice and the light reflects from every angle. Icecrown Glacier has the same effect, but the ice there is composed of flat sheets so you can't look down easily. Up here the ice is everywhere. Wearing dark glasses is the only way to survive \u2014 otherwise you are blinded every time you move your head, and before long you step wrong and tumble off a cliff or down a ravine. The weather doesn't help \u2014 it is either clear and sunny, with that nasty glare, or dark as night and pouring, with sheets of freezing rain, hail or snow battering you and making every surface as slick as oil.\nThe peaks are handsome in an austere way. Little grows here \u2014 a random bush sprouting in a nook along a cliff face, a few tough blades of grass in a crack. Everything else is stone and ice. Animals appear to be rare, so what the wendigo and magnataur eat to survive is a mystery. Probably each other and any travelers they can find perhaps.\nNo one lives here except the storm giants, their golems, and beasts like the wendigo and magnataur. The latter have caves they have found or dug into the ice and rock. The giants have their city, &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are sometimes summoned by &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration.\nThe name is likely inspired by \"\", in which Gandalf is addressed as \"Storm Crow\" as an insult due to his habit of bringing bad news. \nThe term itself is a nickname of the , which often crows on warm humid days before a thunderstorm arrives. Note however that the cuckoo bears no resemblance to a crow.\nIn the RPG.\nTheir habits are much like that of their lesser brethren, but their size and speed earns them special regard. Superstitions say that seeing a solitary storm crow flying across the sky above the horizon means that a great storm is on its way. Storm crows are most famous for the fact that druids can take their shape. They are not brave, so any serious injury to a fellow crow causes them to break off. Storm crows are one of the animals that druids take as companions. Their call sounds more like a loud &lt;a href=\"crow\"&gt;crow&lt;/a&gt; than a raven. Crows in temperate zones and raven in cold climes are under some competition with storm crows, but are not completely shouldered out.\nAppearance.\nStorm crows resemble &lt;a href=\"raven\"&gt;raven&lt;/a&gt;s or common crows, but are far larger, averaging 3 to 4 feet in height, though their frames remain slight. They have a wingspan of 10 feet.\nSociety.\nA murder (a group usually ranging from 2 - 8 storm crows) of storm crows controls a rough territory and will kill any other storm crows that wander in. They also have no problem eating their own dead. In the winter, several groups will assemble into large roosts of 30 - 40. Storm crows, however, are more likely to be solitary than other crows; these solitary birds may wander great distances.\nGathering food.\nLike most crows, storm crows are omnivorous and they feed on carrion, fruit, and the occasional insect; they rarely attack large, live prey. If they do, several storm crows fly around a target, pecking and clawing before wheeling away. Storm crows hunt by sending one or two members to inspect the situation, who attempt to grab the food while the others wait. If all is safe, the entire group descends. In &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo beasts'&lt;/a&gt; nests are particular targets. Much of the murder will caw and raise a commotion above the kodo beasts' heads while one or two storm crows try to grab the eggs and fly away. As with most birds, storm crows have a very limited sense of smell. Those dwelling in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; often hunt other birds to tide them over until they can spot a large kill. Then they will cry loudly and sometimes many dozens of storm crow will gather to eat.\nCombat.\nStorm crows occasionally nest near settlements, eager for opportunities. Scraps of food, young livestock, eggs, and sometimes young children may become targets. Several storm crows will fly around a target, pecking and clawing before wheeling away. They are not brave, and any serious injury to their members will cause them to break off."}

Most, if not all, storm dragons appear to be capable of speech and the &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; brood presides over the Trial of Will to determine the worth of those who seek the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Storm dragons normally live in colonies. Storm dragon whelplings hunger for the flesh of animals, but the young ones cannot stomach it raw. Cooking the meat with lightning allows the whelps to consume it.\nThere are several identified broods of storm dragons within Stormheim: "}

They are found in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and are led by &lt;a href=\"Gymer\"&gt;King Gymer&lt;/a&gt;. However, the storm giants were recently decimated by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, who had the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; raise them back into &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;, or use their corpses to create mindless &lt;a href=\"flesh%20giant\"&gt;flesh giant&lt;/a&gt;s. They were also used to create the stitched-together aberration known as &lt;a href=\"Thrym\"&gt;Thrym&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nStorm giants are a mysterious race of &lt;a href=\"giant\"&gt;giant&lt;/a&gt;s that once resided in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. They were in charge of the &lt;a href=\"crystalline%20golem\"&gt;crystalline golem&lt;/a&gt;s that collect crystals from the &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are impressive, more than 30 feet tall and powerfully built. Storm giants are capable of summoning small storms. Myths say the titans created them. When the titans disappeared, the storm giants remained and claimed Ulduar. They developed crystalline golems to aid them in their research and to defend them. Over time the giants dwindled in number and grew ever more reclusive. They usually kept to themselves, hidden in their caves and tunnels below the surface, and avoided visitors. Soon only a handful remained. The giants are a dying race desperately trying to avoid their fate. They seemed to think another race would vanquish them some day, and so they hid in the Storm Peaks and Ulduar rather than girding for battle. They are too frightened to battle the Scourge, though apparently they hate it. Some resided in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;."}

To govern these towns, Azshara placed &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt;, an elf of considerable magical power. Athrikus was at first loyal to his queen, but eventually he grew bored of his post, and would spend most of his days in the Tower of Althalaxx, some ways removed of the towns.\nApproximately 10,000 years later, a dark theory about the Tower of Althalaxx has proven true: A cult gathered at the &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt; with many &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s amongst their number, including a foul &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;. They called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cult of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt;, and Athrikus was indeed their leader, although why they were assembling at this time was at first a dark mystery.\nAs it turned out, this cult was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. Athrikus was eventually defeated, but even when he was long since dead, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; looters led by &lt;a href=\"Teegan%20Holloway\"&gt;Teegan Holloway&lt;/a&gt; continued to scour the area for the remains of his work. Additionally, during the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear\"&gt;Shatterspear&lt;/a&gt; tribe of trolls and the night elves of Darkshore, Shatterspear shaman have been seen in the area led by &lt;a href=\"Lorenth%20Thundercall\"&gt;Lorenth Thundercall&lt;/a&gt;. The Shatterspear have since been discovered to have allied with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the tower, killing all of the cultists and burning it to the ground.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Tortured%20Spirit%20%28Darkshore%29\"&gt;ancestral spirits&lt;/a&gt; at the Tower of Althalaxx were driven to madness by the Horde, including Athrikus who returned as a &lt;a href=\"spectre\"&gt;spectre&lt;/a&gt;. Some of Narassin's soul gems still remained in the tower, and were shattered by adventurers to free the Highborne spirits trapped inside. The Horde gathered pages of dark magic from the corpses of its Forsaken looters, who had been killed by the spirits.\nBefore the Cataclysm.\nThe Tower of Althalaxx was one of the major sites of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; revolving around &lt;a href=\"Athrikus%20Narassin\"&gt;Athrikus Narassin&lt;/a&gt; and repairing the damage he has caused along with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;."}

The river patterns are roughly the same, and there is a river dividing &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; much like there is a river on the battlefield. The bridges may have been razed and the infrastructure removed completely. Also, the tileset may indicate that it did take place in a grassy field much like the former Brightwood (prior to its corruption) and Elwynn Forest."}

Their first task was to train more &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s to plunder the nearby &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;, for they needed its contents for their coming land raid. Their force would consist mostly of knights and ballistae, so a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; was required as well as a &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt;. They also built &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s at the eastern and western openings of the base to fend off occasional raids by orcs. Although they had the research and training available for rangers, their commander was confident that knights would be more would be more suitable for the attack, and they spent much time and resources enhancing their weapon and armor.\nThe attacking force gathered just outside camp. It consisted of nine knights and three ballistae for heavy artillery. &lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;s had located &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;three narrow land bridges&lt;/a&gt; leading to the enemy; they chose the most direct route, down the center one. The knights rode in front of the slower war machines, occasionally waiting for them. As they neared the end of the land bridge, a large party of mixed Horde monsters attacked, but they were no match for their great mounted warriors. Close to the south, they spotted a few peasants from their home camp and set them to work on their own temporary &lt;a href=\"barracks\"&gt;barracks&lt;/a&gt; on the same spot, while their knights stood guard impatiently. For good measure, they also built cannon towers on both sides of the barracks and, with those completed, sent the workers back home. One of their knights was sent toward the enemy to lure them out; the Alliance ballistae made quick work of their towers after most of the defenders were dead. From that point, it was only a matter of demolition and slaughter as new knights and ballistae emerged from the makeshift barracks to replace those lost in battle. For the first time in months, all of Milan's forces were feeling hope that the Horde could be stopped, but the road to final victory would be long.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The outpost had repeatedly beaten back &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; troops while raiding the surrounding farmlands, and it was was a vital staging area for Horde troops.\nA major battle was eventually fought to retake Dun Modr from the Horde. Alliance forces struck from the nearby island citadel of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, their taskforce of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; warriors laying siege and capturing the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish outpost. They forced the orcs into a southwards retreat to their secondary outpost at &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde forces ultimately made a counter-attack, retaking Dun Modr and even bringing their forces to bear against Tol Barad itself.\nWhen the Horde lost the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;battle for Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; pushed them back into &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; through the Thandol Span. After the war, the city remained under the Alliance's control.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; soldiers gave their lives in far off territories in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarven lands fell prey to the evil deeds of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. They laid waste to the Thandol Span, and southern Dun Modr fell soon after. The Dark Irons were led by a powerful warlock named &lt;a href=\"Balgaras%20the%20Foul\"&gt;Balgaras the Foul&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that the Dark Iron dwarves of Dun Modr were, in fact, loyal members of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; led Alliance heroes in driving them out, retaking Dun Modr for Ironforge.\nIn the RPG.\nDun Modr is a fallen &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; city in the north of the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; that was claimed and occupied by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.

Their service proved invaluable to Alliance forces, and between dwarven brawn and gnomish brains, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s never succeeded in taking either capital. During the intervening period between the wars the gnomes and dwarves grew closer together, working jointly on a number of major projects. Since the destruction of Gnomeregan, the remaining gnomes have been forced to flee and seek protection within Ironforge. This peaceful region is now threatened by the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s who have begun appearing all over the area.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Dun Morogh was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the threats of the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s have increased.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; targeted Dun Morogh as one of their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion points&lt;/a&gt;.

Dun Morogh is the starting area for the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and so it contains a very sheltered 1-5 leveling area - &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;.

The capital city of the dwarven realm, Ironforge, lies within Ironforge Mountain in Dun Morogh's iced heart. Dwarves and their allies range out from Ironforge, trying to hold a diminishing protectorate against encroaching enemies on all sides (Troggs, Trolls, Dark Irons). Dun Morogh is a high altitude region, covered with constant snowfall and great pine trees. Winds howl through the peaks in symphony with the wolves that prowl the crags. Southwest of Ironforge is Coldridge Valley, which hosts the dwarven smithing enclave of Anvilmar. Northwest of Ironforge's massive stone battlements is the ancient city of Gnomeregan. This ruined city was once home to the gnomes, but vile Caverndeep troggs devastated the populace and drove the survivors to Ironforge. Gnomeregan is now a wild place of adventure and mystery. To Ironforge's west is Frostmane Hold, home of the aggressive Frostmane ice trolls. Crime is almost nonexistent in dwarven lands, as dwarves know that they must stick together against their myriad enemies. Murder and treason are capital offenses, while lesser crimes result in exile or prison.\nThe region is snow-swept and forested, with gray, craggy mountains and slinking wolves. &lt;a href=\"Trogg\"&gt;Trogg&lt;/a&gt;s recently overran Gnomeregan, the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s' former capital, and drove its citizens to Ironforge. &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; menace dwarven patrols. Several villages and towns dot the landscape, and though the trade routes can be perilous, dwarven mountaineers and warriors keep their settlements safe.\nHistory.\nCenturies ago, the Dark Iron dwarves split from their Ironforge brethren, summoning Ragnaros and devastating the land in the process. The warriors of Ironforge drove the Dark Irons to near extinction, and the few survivors fled deep underground in the Blackrock Mountain to their fiery lord. In the fourth year since the opening of the Dark Portal, Dun Morogh's dwarves and gnomes joined the Lordaeron Alliance in the Second War. Ironforge dwarves and gnomes were key in the Horde's defeat, and many nurse grudges against orcs to this day. Not long ago, gnomes in Gnomeregan unearthed the mythic troggs.

Dun Morogh is home to both the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and the Ironforge &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and is the location of the major city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The Khaz Modan mountains surround Dun Morogh on all sides, making it accessible only by certain passes that are currently watched over by dwarven troops.\nThe center of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; culture and ingenuity, Dun Morogh holds the capital of Ironforge. The region is snow-swept and forested, with gray, craggy mountains and slinking wolves. &lt;a href=\"Trogg\"&gt;Troggs&lt;/a&gt; recently overran Gnomeregan, the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s\u2019 former capital, and drove its citizens to Ironforge. &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; menace dwarven patrols. Several villages and towns dot the landscape, and though the trade routes can be perilous, dwarven mountaineers and warriors keep their settlements safe.\nIntroduction.\nHomeland of the Ironforge dwarves and ruled by mighty Bronzebeard Clan, Dun Morogh is the center of dwarven culture and ingenuity. The capital city of the dwarven realm, Ironforge, lies within Ironforge Mountain in Dun Morogh\u2019s iced heart. Dwarves and their allies range out from Ironforge, trying to hold a diminishing protectorate against encroaching enemies on all sides (Troggs, Trolls, Dark Irons). Dun Morogh is a high altitude region, covered with constant snowfall and great pine trees. Winds howl through the peaks in symphony with the wolves that prowl the crags. Southwest of Ironforge is Coldridge Valley, which hosts the dwarven smithing enclave of Anvilmar. Northwest of Ironforge\u2019s massive stone battlements is the ancient city of Gnomeregan. This ruined city was once home to the Ironforge gnomes, but vile Caverndeep troggs devastated the populace and drove the survivors to the capital. Gnomeregan is now a wild place of adventure and mystery. To Ironforge\u2019s west is Frostmane Hold, home of the aggressive Frostmane ice trolls. Crime is almost nonexistent in dwarven lands, as dwarves know that they must stick together against their myriad enemies. Murder and treason are capital offenses, while lesser crimes result in exile or prison.\nHistory.\nCenturies ago, the Dark Iron dwarves split from their Ironforge brethren, summoning Ragnaros and devastating the land in the process. The warriors of Ironforge drove the Dark Irons to near extinction, and the few survivors fled deep underground in the Blackrock Mountain to their fiery lord. In the fourth year since the opening of the Dark Portal, Dun Morogh\u2019s dwarves and gnomes joined the Lordaeron Alliance in the Second War. Ironforge dwarves and gnomes were key in the Horde\u2019s defeat, and many nurse grudges against orcs to this day. Not long ago, gnomes in Gnomeregan unearthed the mythic troggs. These tribal creatures slaughtered Gnomeregan\u2019s populace and drove the gnomes to Ironforge, where they hide and nurse their wounds. This catastrophe explained why Ironforge gnomes did not take part in the Third War. The troggs also prove an excellent distraction for Ironforge\u2019s forces, allowing the Frostmane trolls to invade Dun Morogh in an attempt to reclaim their ancient lands.\nThe snowy peaks of Dun Morogh have been the home of the dwarves and gnomes for centuries. The two races have generally lived on friendly terms, trading between their own respective cities, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, both races joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s invaded &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Their service proved invaluable to Alliance forces, and between dwarven brawn and gnomish brains, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s never succeeded in taking either capital. During the intervening period between the wars the gnomes and dwarves grew closer together, working jointly on a number of major projects. Since the destruction of Gnomeregan, the remaining gnomes have been forced to flee and seek protection within Ironforge. This peaceful region is now threatened by the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s who have begun appearing all over the area.\nPeople and culture.\nIronforge dwarves, the most prominent race in Dun Morogh, are a hearty, good-natured people who enjoy working with their hands, drinking ale and firing blunderbusses. Dwarves are ingenious, and about half of all technological devices in Azeroth are dwarven-made. Ironforge dwarves are particularly adept at crafting and wielding firearms, and their riflemen proved an invaluable help in the Third War. Feisty and strong, Ironforge dwarves possess a strong sense of humor and a forgiving nature.

Ironforge dwarves take pride in their beards and wear them long. When patrolling Dun Morogh, dwarves carry axes, rifles and other weaponry and wear heavy armor. Gnomes rarely leave Ironforge, but those who do so are similarly equipped. Like dwarves, gnomes are adept tinkers and engineers and often walk about with safety goggles on their foreheads and various gadgets strapped to their belts.\nGeography.\nThe snow-swept land of Dun Morogh is covered with forest and craggy mountains. Dun Morogh is a high, mountainous region and is cold, windy and wet. Snowfall is common, and a white blanket constantly covers the ground. Great wolves and snow leopards stalk the forests, and troggs and Frostmane trolls find many ambush spots. Ferocious bears are known to live in many of the shadowy dens that are riddled into the mountainside. Dwarves used to have to battle few monsters in their own homeland, but things have changed. Dun Morogh has not seen true peace in decades. Ironforge is the capital of the dwarven realm and provides protection and succor for its citizens. Though the dwarves\u2019 enemies have multiplied in recent years, several smaller villages also stand against the burgeoning evils.\nDun Morogh contains no raid dungeons, micro dungeons, or battlegrounds. &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, an instanced dungeon for adventurers levels 28 to 35, can be found in the western part of the zone, beyond Brewnall Village. Dun Morogh is the starting area for the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and so it contains a very sheltered 1-5 leveling area - &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarven city, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, can also be found in this zone, and is one of the major &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; trade and travel hubs.\nTravel hubs.\nThe only flight path in Dun Morogh is in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; is one of the busiest travel hubs for the Alliance, since it is situated near the center of the continent and is also a capital city and a center for trade.\nNotable characters.\nDun Morogh is home to several dwarves and gnomes of status. From the base camp in Coldridge Valley, &lt;a href=\"Grelin%20Whitebeard\"&gt;Grelin Whitebeard&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young dwarves and gnomes out into the world. In Brewnall Village, &lt;a href=\"Rejold%20Barleybrew\"&gt;Rejold Barleybrew&lt;/a&gt; leads the effort to discover the best recipe for ale, and in Kharanos, &lt;a href=\"Senir%20Whitebeard\"&gt;Senir Whitebeard&lt;/a&gt; seeks to eradicate the foothold the ice trolls have established in the region.\nQuests.\nSince Dun Morogh is the starting zone for &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, the quest range here is level 1-12. Quests in Dun Morogh include explorations from &lt;a href=\"Brewnall%20Village\"&gt;Brewnall Village&lt;/a&gt; in the west to the &lt;a href=\"North%20Gate%20Outpost\"&gt;North Gate Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"South%20Gate%20Outpost\"&gt;South Gate Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast. There are battles against &lt;a href=\"Leper%20Gnome\"&gt;leper gnomes&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Bolar%20Quarry\"&gt;Gol'Bolar Quarry&lt;/a&gt;. There is range of things to do from the fun of replacing a to the danger in a &lt;a href=\"Vagash\"&gt;dangerous yeti&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt; is the starting &lt;a href=\"subzone\"&gt;subzone&lt;/a&gt; with the level 1-5 quests. &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt; is the central village for those following most zone quests. &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; is the capital city with quests geared towards leading to other zones."}

Not long ago, quakes roused numerous &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s from their subterranean dwellings, and caused the savage &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; to abandon their usual holdings on &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and encroach upon dwarf-occupied areas.\nKharanos.\nUpon arriving in &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s are recruited by its citizens to deal with the local &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt; and Frostmane threats, which were everyday encroaching further upon dwarven lands.

As soon as they arrive, a party of raiders sneak into the stables to steal the &lt;a href=\"ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt;s, so they help &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Flinthammer\"&gt;Sergeant Flinthammer&lt;/a&gt; fending the trolls off.

Bahrum reveals that with all the chaos in Dun Morogh, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; had taken over &lt;a href=\"Ironband%27s%20Compound\"&gt;Ironband's Compound&lt;/a&gt; to the south, beyond the lake.

The adventurers quickly head back to Gol'Bolar and hop on &lt;a href=\"Mathel%20Rustwrench\"&gt;Mathel Rustwrench&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mathel%27s%20Flying%20Machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; to get to the airfield. Once they get there, the attack is already occurring. However, using one of the&lt;a href=\"Repaired%20Bomber\"&gt;repaired bombers&lt;/a&gt;, they manage to repel the Dark Irons and their &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt; constructs and finally kill &lt;a href=\"General%20Grimaxe\"&gt;General Grimaxe&lt;/a&gt; to end the assault.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; had to be informed of the Dark Iron clan's betrayal. The adventurers take &lt;a href=\"Stonebreaker%27s%20Report\"&gt;Stonebreaker's Report&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"High%20Seat\"&gt;High Seat&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge, and confront &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. Turns out the Dark Irons had been betrayed from within, and some of the dwarves remained loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult. &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Slaghammer\"&gt;Ambassador Slaghammer&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarf behind the attacks, is arrested before he could escape the city and brought to the dungeons of Ironforge. However, he was certainly not the only dwarf allied with the Twilight's Hammer, and Moira reminds the council they must remain vigilant against the Twilight's neverending schemes."}

A \"valid\" party consists of one &lt;a href=\"tank%20%28role%29\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, one &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, and three &lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage dealers&lt;/a&gt; (melee or ranged). Players can travel to the dungeon themselves (or be summoned with a &lt;a href=\"Meeting%20Stone\"&gt;Meeting Stone&lt;/a&gt; or warlock's &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Ritual of Summoning&lt;/a&gt;), or they can use the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; tool to queue for specific or random dungeons.\nDungeons contain mostly &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; creatures, which are more powerful than normal creatures. Dungeons are more challenging and take longer than &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, but are not as difficult or as time-consuming as &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s. All dungeons starting with those from \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" feature &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt;s, which are more challenging and contain better loot than the normal counterpart.\nNormal dungeon &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es typically drop , , and very rarely quality &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt;. Heroic dungeon bosses typically drop and loot.\nCompleting \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" heroic dungeons, \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" normal and heroic dungeons, and \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" normal and heroic dungeons at the appropriate level used to award &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt; which were redeemable at vendors for gear. However, this currency was removed along with &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Points\"&gt;Valor Points&lt;/a&gt; at the end of \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%206.2.0\"&gt;patch 6.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, a new difficulty called \"&lt;a href=\"mythic\"&gt;mythic&lt;/a&gt;\" was introduced. They are designed to be more challenging than &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; dungeons and award far superior, rare-quality loot with a chance at epic-quality loot from the end bosses.\n&lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;Farming&lt;/a&gt; dungeons for loot is one of the main ways for players to acquire entry-level gear for &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTimewalking.\nTimewalking is a dungeon difficulty added in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.2.0\"&gt;patch 6.2.0&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", allowing players to queue up for a randomly selected dungeon from a previous expansion. The difficulty scales down the character's power and gear relative to the dungeon. Loot obtained during this difficulty has the tag, which scales up to an item level appropriate for use at the player's level.\nMegadungeon.\nThe term \"megadungeon\" has been used to describe , &lt;a href=\"Tazavesh%2C%20the%20Veiled%20Market\"&gt;Tazavesh, the Veiled Market&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; (retroactively), and &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt;, which are massive 5-player dungeons that use a lockout system similar to a raid.\nInfinite dungeon.\nThe term \"infinite dungeon\" is used to describe &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "18496", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18496", "title": "Dungeon Finder", "text": "Dungeon Finder is a tool for finding groups for 5-player &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as a means of directly entering those instances. Dungeon Finder can be accessed through the &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt;, found via a button on the &lt;a href=\"micro%20menu\"&gt;micro menu&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the &lt;a href=\"user%20interface\"&gt;user interface&lt;/a&gt;. Dungeon Finder is unlocked at level 15.\nDungeon Finder selects players to form a party from all servers in the &lt;a href=\"battlegroup\"&gt;battlegroup&lt;/a&gt;, so there need not be a full group of players on one specific &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;. Note that it is not possible to queue for dungeons outside of the player's level bracket or expansion level; e.g. level 80 players cannot queue for classic or \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" dungeons.\nThe first screen players see shows the role selection toggles and the type of dungeon desired. By default, the selection is for a random dungeon. This can be changed via the Type dropdown to such options as Random Lich King Heroic, Random Burning Crusade Dungeon, or Random Classic Dungeon. Running a random dungeon confers additional rewards in the form of emblems and gold.\nSelecting a specific dungeon or dungeons can be accomplished by choosing the very first option in the Type dropdown. The UI changes to show a list of dungeons, all of which are selected. To narrow the list, click the checkbox next to the category line to select/deselect all dungeons in that category. Players can also collapse categories of dungeons by clicking the +/- box just to the left of the category checkbox.\nUsing the Dungeon Finder.\nQueuing for a specific dungeon example.\nTo tell the UI that you only wish to run &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Halls\"&gt;Scarlet Halls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"5-player%20Heroic%20mode\"&gt;5-player Heroic mode&lt;/a&gt;:\nLooking for more.\nSo the tank left, or a healer disconnected, or a DPS got kicked. How does the party add a replacement member?\nRemoving a player.\nYou can remove a player from the group via the &lt;a href=\"Vote%20Kick\"&gt;Vote Kick&lt;/a&gt; System.\nLeaving a group.\nWhen you join a group you got via the Dungeon Finder you will be on Dungeon Finder cooldown, preventing you from joining another random group for the next 30 minutes (from the time you were matched with a dungeon). There are the following exceptions:\nAdditionally, if you leave or are kicked from a group before one of the bosses is killed, you will receive the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Deserter\"&gt;Dungeon Deserter&lt;/a&gt; debuff, which will prevent you from using the Dungeon or Raid Finder for 30 minutes.\nDungeon Finder: Call to Arms.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms%20%28dungeon%29\"&gt;Call to Arms&lt;/a&gt; dungeon system is intended to lower queue times by offering additional rewards for queuing as the currently least represented role. To be eligible for the additional rewards you must solo queue for a random level-90 Heroic in the role that is currently being Called to Arms, and complete the dungeon by killing the final boss. Every time you hit these requirements (there is no daily limit) you'll receive a goodie bag that will contain some gold, a chance at a rare gem, a chance at a flask/potion, a good chance of receiving a non-combat pet (including cross faction pets), and a very rare chance at receiving a mount.\nLookingForGroup channel.\nIn addition to Dungeon Finder, everyone in &lt;a href=\"Capital\"&gt;capital cities&lt;/a&gt; automatically joins the LookingForGroup channel. It can be used to manually search for groups instead of, or in addition to, both Dungeon Finder and &lt;a href=\"Looking%20For%20Raid\"&gt;Looking For Raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nThe item rewards depends on the dungeon type and the character's level. Additional rewards are available through the &lt;a href=\"Call%20to%20Arms%20%28dungeon%29\"&gt;Call to Arms&lt;/a&gt; system.\nThe Daily money and XP rewards depends on the character level. The following table contains the rewards for each levels first random dungeon of the day, any other runs during the same day will yield approximately half the money and experience:\nDungeon Finder instance breakdown.\nMany of the classic dungeons have been broken up into separate events to allow achievement of the Dungeon Finder rewards in a comparable amount of time.\nBurning Crusade dungeons.\nAll Burning Crusade Heroic-level instances have a level range of 70 to 75, and due to a recent patch involving the removal of the key ring, no longer require keys to enter. All have the same completion criteria as the Normal-level instance.\nNote that an optional third boss &lt;a href=\"Anzu%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt; is now at the end of heroic Sethekk Halls, but not in the Normal version. This boss is not required to complete the instance.\nWrath of the Lich King dungeons.\n&lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Saron\"&gt;Pit of Saron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Champion\"&gt;Trial of the Champion&lt;/a&gt; are not included in the random dungeon pool and must be queued for specifically.\nWrath of the Lich King heroic instances can no longer be accessed via Dungeon Finder since &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm dungeons.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.6\"&gt;Patch 4.0.6&lt;/a&gt; onward, you do not need to discover entrances to the Cataclysm dungeons in order to be able to queue for them in the Dungeon Finder.\nCataclysm dungeons also have a minimum average item level (ilvl) in order to use the Dungeon Finder. You can get around this restriction if you walk through the instance boundary with your own hand-picked party.\nHistory.\nAt the launch of the game, there was only the LookingForGroup &lt;a href=\"chat\"&gt;chat&lt;/a&gt; channel. This channel was available in all zones, but it was not a linked global channel. This was problematic since zones of the same level range are spread out throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. At this time, many players relied on their &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"friends%20list\"&gt;friends list&lt;/a&gt;, or even &lt;a href=\"whisper\"&gt;whisper&lt;/a&gt; to find groups. Otherwise, they would travel to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; respectively, find a group, then travel back out to the site of the dungeon, making dungeons far away from these cities very unpopular. As a result, warlocks were also very popular at this time, as they played an important role in forming groups. Blizzard eventually added a queuing system related to the &lt;a href=\"Meeting%20Stone\"&gt;Meeting Stone&lt;/a&gt;s in front of the instances, but it was rarely used, and was generally a failed feature. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.9\"&gt;Patch 1.9&lt;/a&gt;, the LookingForGroup channel became global, although it was restricted to the major cities. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.11\"&gt;Patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, the LookingForGroup channel became truly global, no longer restricted to chat in cities only.\nWith the release of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expansion and &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.0.1\"&gt;Patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt; came the release of the new Looking For Group interface pane as well as the conversion of &lt;a href=\"Meeting%20Stone\"&gt;Meeting Stone&lt;/a&gt;s from a queuing system to a summoning mechanism. At this time, the LookingForGroup channel was completely removed, since the interface was intended to replace it. Instead, players began to use the Trade channel for LFG, guild recruitment, and general global chat. Blizzard responded by hotfixing a rate limit of so many messages per minute. However, this was eventually lifted, and Trade channel continues to be a mixture of trade and other uses even today. After much community feedback, in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.1.0\"&gt;Patch 2.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, the LookingForGroup channel was restored, although it was only available while actively using the Interface Tool.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.1.0\"&gt;Patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, after the release of &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Looking For Group panel was improved to include the role which your currently logged character is able to fulfill (&lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dps\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;), specify leadership, and identifying groups or individuals via the &lt;a href=\"Looking%20for%20More\"&gt;Looking for More&lt;/a&gt; pane.\nFirst announced at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202009\"&gt;BlizzCon 2009&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; saw a new cross-&lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;server&lt;/a&gt; Looking For Group (and &lt;a href=\"Looking%20For%20Raid\"&gt;Looking For Raid&lt;/a&gt;) system. This is the second cross-server feature Blizzard has added to the game, after Battlegrounds. Cross-server features are generally used to help users on low-population realms find groups, which was previously nearly impossible any time other than peak hours.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, the Dungeon Finder was merged into the new &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt; interface. The distinction between the Dungeon Finder and other associated utilities was clarified; the Dungeon Finder now found groups only for dungeons, while scenarios and raids were found through the wider (if not perfectly named) Dungeons &amp; Raids interface."}

Collecting these won't take long, maybe 15 minutes.\nEctoplasms.\nAfter assembling the Ectoplasmic Distiller, Mux will give you an item &lt;a href=\"Mux%27s%20Quality%20Goods\"&gt;Mux's Quality Goods&lt;/a&gt;, which contains several &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Rocket%20Fuel\"&gt;Goblin Rocket Fuel&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ez-Thro%20Dynamite%20II\"&gt;Ez-Thro Dynamite II&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"Discombobulator%20Ray\"&gt;Discombobulator Ray&lt;/a&gt;. Mux sends you off with it to gather Ectoplasms in the quest &lt;a href=\"Hunting%20for%20Ectoplasm\"&gt;Hunting for Ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;. You need 12 &lt;a href=\"Scorched%20Ectoplasm\"&gt;Scorched Ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, 12 &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Ectoplasm\"&gt;Frozen Ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; and 12 &lt;a href=\"Stable%20Ectoplasm\"&gt;Stable Ectoplasm&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The Ectoplasmic Distiller is an item that you Use (right click) to drop in the game world, like a Shaman's totem. Doing so consumes 1 Goblin Rocket Fuel. The Distiller will remain on the ground for around 5 minutes. When you are nearby, you receive a buff that allows you to collect Ectoplasm from the corpses of dead ghosts. You must have the buff at the time you loot the mob in order to be able to loot the Ectoplasm. \nBurning Steppes: &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Lord%20Bokk\"&gt;Magma Lord Bokk&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you've taken these back to him, he gives you the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Portable%20Power%20Source\"&gt;A Portable Power Source&lt;/a&gt; and tells you to go back to Burning Steppes and kill &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Lord%20Bokk\"&gt;Magma Lord Bokk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/%3Fm%3D1010982\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;) and bring back his Magma Core. Bokk is non-elite, and quite easily soloable. You can find him hanging out at the northern tip of the lava pool (it shows up on the map) that's just west of the &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Ash\"&gt;Pillar of Ash&lt;/a&gt;, loc around 35,58. He looks like a big &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;. It's worth noting that he typically comes with an add, and has three procs: a ~600pt Earth Shock, ~100pt Knock Away, and a brief Ground Tremor stun.\nWinterspring: Fel Elemental Rod.\nNext, Mux will give you the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Shifty%20Merchant\"&gt;A Shifty Merchant&lt;/a&gt; and send you to Winterspring to get a &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Elemental%20Rod\"&gt;Fel Elemental Rod&lt;/a&gt;. It is purchased from the imp &lt;a href=\"Vi%27el\"&gt;Vi'el&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.allakhazam.com/db/mob.html%3Fwmob%3D16015%23map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;), who resides in a cave near the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. Travel south along the road from Everlook, and cross the bridge. You can sneak past the two elite Hederine Slayers at the entrance to the gorge, and also past the elite &lt;a href=\"Felhound\"&gt;Felhound&lt;/a&gt; at the mouth of the cave if you pay careful attention to its patrol route. Purchase the rod from Vi'el for and take it back to Mux. Note: there is now a level 59 elite Succubus near the mouth of the cave, so you will have to do some fighting.\nThis completes step two, and you will receive your dungeon set 2 belt and gloves\nStep three: Pants, Shoulders, and Boots.\nPants, shoulders and boots are next to be upgraded\nQuest chain.\nSee: &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%202/Pants%2C%20Shoulders%20and%20Boots\"&gt;Dungeon Set 2/Pants, Shoulders and Boots&lt;/a&gt; for details\nThis completes step three, and you will receive your dungeon set 2 pants, shoulders, and boots.\nStep four: Helm and Chest.\nHelm and chest are last to be upgraded.\nQuest chain.\nFor details see: &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%202/Helm%20and%20Chest\"&gt;Dungeon Set 2/Helm and Chest&lt;/a&gt;\nThis completes the upgrade quests, and you will receive your dungeon set 2 helm and chest.\nNotes.\nThis type of item set is sometimes referred to as \"Tier 0.5\" by players.\n&lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%201\"&gt;Dungeon Set 1&lt;/a&gt; is upgraded to form Dungeon Set 2.\nOn completion of the final step of the quest chain (&lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Bodley\"&gt;Return to Bodley&lt;/a&gt;), you gain access to all four of the summon's from step four (&lt;a href=\"Kormok\"&gt;Kormok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarien%20and%20Sothos\"&gt;Jarien and Sothos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Grayhoof\"&gt;Mor Grayhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Isalien\"&gt;Isalien&lt;/a&gt;) and the ability to summon &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt; again. You are also provided with a book that you can read in game for some background on and the locations of the summonable bosses."}

Go to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and talk to a male gnome ghost named &lt;a href=\"Bodley\"&gt;Bodley&lt;/a&gt; right outside the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; entrance using your ghost revealer. He stands (as of 8/17/06) right on the balcony where people traditionally enter the instance (not below near the actual entrance as had been previously described). He gives you the quest &lt;a href=\"Three%20Kings%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Three Kings of Flame&lt;/a&gt; which requires you to collect 1 &lt;a href=\"Incendicite%20of%20Incendius\"&gt;Incendicite of Incendius&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Ember%20of%20Emberseer\"&gt;Ember of Emberseer&lt;/a&gt;, 1 &lt;a href=\"Cinder%20of%20Cynders\"&gt;Cinder of Cynders&lt;/a&gt;, and 1 &lt;a href=\"Hallowed%20Brazier\"&gt;Hallowed Brazier&lt;/a&gt;. To get these, you have to kill &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyroguard%20Emberseer\"&gt;Pyroguard Emberseer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href=\"Duke%20of%20Cynders\"&gt;Duke of Cynders&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, and obtain honored with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; to buy a Hallowed Brazier () from an Argent Dawn Quartermaster. All three items are group drops and are lootable by all characters who have the quest. The Duke of Cynders will be the hardest, since you must collect all the twilight gear to summon a duke, and have only a one in four chance of getting the Duke of Cynders. You must be at least Friendly with &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; faction in order to get the quests required to create the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Cultist%20Medallion%20of%20Station\"&gt;Twilight Cultist Medallion of Station&lt;/a&gt;. Note that if you turn in &lt;a href=\"Encrypted%20Twilight%20Text\"&gt;Encrypted Twilight Text&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Hermit%20Ortell\"&gt;Hermit Ortell&lt;/a&gt;, he may send you a scroll in the mail that will allow you to make a signet that allows you to summon the correct duke. The item you want is . This is only necessary if you plan to summon the duke yourself, if you just want to finish the quest you can tag along with someone else who is summoning a duke, and, as long as its the right duke, your item will drop. It will drop even if you're in a raid.\nThe Left Piece of The Amulet.\nYou receive one of the following quests at random. People of the same and different classes have received different quests. You will need to complete that quest before moving on to your \"summon\" quest, which is the step after this. There does not appear to be a pattern as far as the first quest \"pair\" you get determining the second - apparently it is completely random.\nThere has been some speculation about the quest pair being dependent on a player's class and faction. If you're doing any of these quests, please have a look at the page and help verify this.\nEach of these quests requires you to get 1 item from somewhere in the game world, and return it to the ghost in BRM. The drop rate on each quest seems to be about equal, anywhere from 5\u201320 kills. Easily doable by 2 people.\nWhile you can summon these bosses in a raid group, your piece of the amulet will only drop in a regular party.\nEven though it is possible to loot your piece of the amulet by killing any of these summon bosses when helping others out, the quest will now also require you to actually slay the boss itself too. So, it is not possible to complete this quest simply by helping with someone else's summon.\nI See Alcaz Island In Your Future....\n&lt;a href=\"Bodley\"&gt;Bodley&lt;/a&gt; will send you on the quest &lt;a href=\"I%20See%20Alcaz%20Island%20In%20Your%20Future...\"&gt;I See Alcaz Island In Your Future...&lt;/a&gt; to gather 20 &lt;a href=\"Bloodkelp\"&gt;Bloodkelp&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. Bloodkelp can drop in quantities of 1\u20132 from the 59\u201360 Elite Nagas or in quantities of 1\u20133 from \"Bloodkelp Baskets\", usually found near or inside the various buildings on the island. The quest is easily doable by 2 people. Bloodkelp drops every one to three kills. Most Bloodkelp baskets are guarded by several Naga, but there are few unguarded and guarded with ounly one Naga so rogue with sap can solo this quest without fighting at all.\nThe Right Piece of The Amulet.\nNow you need to do &lt;a href=\"More%20Components%20of%20Importance\"&gt;More Components of Importance&lt;/a&gt; who is one of the chain as listed at The Left Piece of The Amulet.\nThe quests are once again random and you may receive the right piece the same way you received your left piece.\nUpon returning to &lt;a href=\"Bodley\"&gt;Bodley&lt;/a&gt;, make sure you bring &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Lord Valthalak's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; (not just the right piece). You can do this by clicking any one of the pieces once all three are in your inventory to create the amulet.\nSmall thought: There may be a connection between the quest you get for the Left Piece and the Right Piece. I had the quest to kill in &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; first and then grind for &lt;a href=\"Starbreeze%20Village%20Relic\"&gt;Starbreeze Village Relic&lt;/a&gt; and kill boss in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;. Any contradictions or additions; add them here.\nUpper Blackrock Spire.\nReturn to &lt;a href=\"Bodley\"&gt;Bodley&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Lord Valthalak's Amulet&lt;/a&gt; and he will send you on the quest &lt;a href=\"Final%20Preparations%20%28Blackrock%20Spire%29\"&gt;Final Preparations&lt;/a&gt; to gather 40 &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Bracer\"&gt;Blackrock Bracer&lt;/a&gt;s off of Orcs in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as well as bringing him a &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Supreme%20Power\"&gt;Flask of Supreme Power&lt;/a&gt;. \nAccounts state that the Orcs in UBRS have a much higher drop rate than the Orcs in LBRS. A full UBRS run usually yields 30\u201340 bracers, so one or two UBRS runs should be enough to get all bracers to one person.\nOnce again return to &lt;a href=\"Bodley\"&gt;Bodley&lt;/a&gt;. Give him the bracers and a &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Supreme%20Power\"&gt;Flask of Supreme Power&lt;/a&gt; and he will give you what you need to summon &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Beast\"&gt;The Beast's&lt;/a&gt; Room in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; in the quest &lt;a href=\"Mea%20Culpa%2C%20Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Mea Culpa, Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt;.\nClear to The Beast's room. Kill The Beast. Summon &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt;, kill him, and use the amulet on his corpse. The Spirit of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt; will then appear and give you the quest &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Bodley\"&gt;Return to Bodley&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you fail to kill Lord Valthalak, he will remain in the middle of the Beast's room until the instance is reset. The Brazier has unlimited charges, so you can of course return another time with a stronger party if you are unsuccessful.\nTalk to the Spirit of Lord Valthalak and THEN AND ONLY THEN:\nReturn to &lt;a href=\"Bodley\"&gt;Bodley&lt;/a&gt;. He will give you a quest (&lt;a href=\"Back%20to%20the%20Beginning%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Back%20to%20the%20Beginning%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;) which sends you back to &lt;a href=\"Deliana\"&gt;Deliana&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Mokvar\"&gt;Mokvar&lt;/a&gt; where you started the entire quest chain. You can then turn in your Dungeon Set 1 helm and breastplate for the Dungeon Set 2 equivalents (&lt;a href=\"Saving%20the%20Best%20for%20Last%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Saving%20the%20Best%20for%20Last%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;).\nNOTE: On completion of the final step you gain access to all four of the summon's from step four (&lt;a href=\"Kormok\"&gt;Kormok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jarien%20and%20Sothos\"&gt;Jarien and Sothos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mor%20Grayhoof\"&gt;Mor Grayhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Isalien\"&gt;Isalien&lt;/a&gt;) and the ability to summon &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Valthalak\"&gt;Lord Valthalak&lt;/a&gt; again. You are also provided with a book that you can read in game for some background on and the locations of the summonable bosses."}

He is in front of the &lt;a href=\"Meeting%20Stone\"&gt;Meeting Stone&lt;/a&gt;, click on your E.D.G.R. to see and interact with him. The effect of the E.D.G.R. has a cooldown of 1 minute and a duration of 10 minutes. He will give you the quest &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Man%27s%20Plea\"&gt;Dead Man's Plea&lt;/a&gt; and asks you to rescue &lt;a href=\"Ysida%20Harmon\"&gt;Ysida Harmon&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;. After you accept the quest, travel to the second entrance of the dungeon. The quest is a timed event, requiring the group to engage Baron Rivendare in combat within 45 minutes once the second gate from the Stratholme service entrance has been opened.\nGathering Mats.\nAfter the 45 min baron run you return to the ghost in the quest &lt;a href=\"Proof%20of%20Life\"&gt;Proof of Life&lt;/a&gt; and he gives you another quest called &lt;a href=\"Anthion%27s%20Strange%20Request\"&gt;Anthion's Strange Request&lt;/a&gt; which asks you for 3 &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Bar\"&gt;Dark Iron Bar&lt;/a&gt;, 3 &lt;a href=\"Mooncloth\"&gt;Mooncloth&lt;/a&gt;, 20 &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Leather\"&gt;Enchanted Leather&lt;/a&gt;, and 4 &lt;a href=\"Cured%20Rugged%20Hide\"&gt;Cured Rugged Hide&lt;/a&gt;. After you turn these in, he sends you to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; library to talk to Falrin Treeshaper in the quest &lt;a href=\"Anthion%27s%20Old%20Friend\"&gt;Anthion's Old Friend&lt;/a&gt;.\nOgre Warbeads.\nFalrin Treeshaper in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; gives you the quest &lt;a href=\"Falrin%27s%20Vendetta\"&gt;Falrin's Vendetta&lt;/a&gt; to gather 25 &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Warbeads\"&gt;Ogre Warbeads&lt;/a&gt; off the ogres in Dire Maul and &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Lower Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Dire Maul North is Highly Recommended!! The droprate goes (roughly) as follows: Dire Maul (Outside): 1:50, Dire Maul (North): 1:7, Lower Blackrock Spire: 1:7. Among those only DM outside is soloable easily. Your best bet is to find a party for DM north.\nJeering Spectre's Essence.\nOnce you have 25 Ogre Warbeads, you return to Falrin Treeshaper. He will send you on the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Instigator%27s%20Enchantment\"&gt;The Instigator's Enchantment&lt;/a&gt; to gather 4 &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Rune\"&gt;Dark Rune&lt;/a&gt;s, 8 &lt;a href=\"Large%20Brilliant%20Shard\"&gt;Large Brilliant Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, and 1 &lt;a href=\"Jeering%20Spectre%27s%20Essence\"&gt;Jeering Spectre's Essence&lt;/a&gt;. The essence is a group drop off ghosts in DM West, and it drops only if you have the quest as of 7/26/06. This is unfortunate as in the past it was easier because you could have previously assembled all the items needed and immediately turn them in at this point. Afterwards, return to the librarian. He gives you a &lt;a href=\"Banner%20of%20Provocation\"&gt;Banner of Provocation&lt;/a&gt; to take to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. Take caution because immediately after receiving the banner, you will be attacked by 5 to 6 ghosts which will spawn close by. It does not seem to matter if you win the battle or not.\nTop Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet.\nOnce you have received the banner, proceed to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; for the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Challenge\"&gt;The Challenge&lt;/a&gt; for the task of killing Theldren's team of gladiators to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Top%20Piece%20of%20Lord%20Valthalak%27s%20Amulet\"&gt;Top Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet&lt;/a&gt;. \nEnter the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Law\"&gt;Ring of Law&lt;/a&gt; arena and use the &lt;a href=\"Banner%20of%20Provocation\"&gt;Banner of Provocation&lt;/a&gt; while the dwarf is sentencing you. The dwarf will open one gate and two waves of non-elite trash will enter the room suitable for AoE. Recover as quick as possible as the dwarf will open a second gate and the group of PvP mobs (see below) will quickly enter. \nThe Top Piece of Lord Valthalak's Amulet will be found on Theldren's corpse after the fight is complete. In the event of you miss any part of the Amulet, Bodley will be able to offer a new one.\nList of possible mob outcomes for the team entering the arena:\nThey cannot be taunted, so they often go for healers (Priests must be ready to use ). Using &lt;a href=\"Hamstring\"&gt;Hamstring&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; is a must as they move constantly and are hard to follow but can be slowed with a mage. If you get Rezznik, polymorph him instead of Va'jashni to keep him from causing trouble. Every enemy who fights with Theldren is immune to a warrior's taunt, but are not immune to &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Psychic%20Scream\"&gt;Psychic Scream&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Howl%20of%20Terror\"&gt;Howl of Terror&lt;/a&gt;, using these and Polymorph as crowd control makes things much easier.\nThe completion of the event spawns a chest of loot called &lt;a href=\"Arena%20Spoils\"&gt;Arena Spoils&lt;/a&gt; in which you get to keep the banner in case you want to be able to restart the event in the future. The Arena Spoils behaves like a chest but has &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; items inside. It can easily be &lt;a href=\"loot%20ninja\"&gt;ninja loot&lt;/a&gt;, so be sure of the intentions of all the group members.\nThe mobs will not despawn should you wipe, and any you have killed prior to a wipe will resurrect. If there is a rogue in your party, &lt;a href=\"sap\"&gt;sap&lt;/a&gt; one before the second try. Sometimes they move right in front of the gate where they come from and stop moving in which it would now be safe. However, sometimes they continue to roam the room and when they are still moving you can restart the event. The gates will close if you step in the Arena. Even if the gates are closed and you are outside the Arena, they can aggro and will walk right through the gate to get to you.\nYou are now able to turn in the quest to &lt;a href=\"Anthion%20Harmon\"&gt;Anthion Harmon&lt;/a&gt; at the Stratholme entrance at which point he will send you back to Ironforge (&lt;a href=\"Anthion%27s%20Parting%20Words%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;) or Orgrimmar (&lt;a href=\"Anthion%27s%20Parting%20Words%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;).\nIF/Org Quest Giver.\nReturn to your city and collect the next part of the chain, which tells you to collect the Pants, Shoulders, and Boots of your Dungeon Set 1.\nWhile the set pants for all classes drop from &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the drops for shoulders and boots vary by class. Most of them have a drop chance of about 10%, so expect to visit these instances multiple times.\nOnce you have your Dungeon 1 Pants, Shoulders, and Boots, return to Ironforge or Orgrimmar."}

As of \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", dungeon difficulty includes &lt;a href=\"Normal\"&gt;Normal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mythic\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic+&lt;/a&gt;, each with progressively increasing difficulty. These settings have gradually been made available throughout the history of World of Warcraft, with the latest addition of Mythic+ in \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe Burning Crusade.\n' has brought a new dungeon system which incorporates a dungeon difficulty setting. The simple concept of the dungeon difficulty spans across two levels. Firstly there is the &lt;a href=\"normal\"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt; setting, in which players will experience average loot as would be expected in any &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; 5-man dungeon. &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt;, however, is a little different.\nOfficial Introduction.\nFrom Frank Pearce's Interview for the Official EU (en) site\nQ: Dungeon difficulty setting?\nThe differences between Heroic and Normal.\nIt should first be noted that heroic mode dungeons are not generally available for WoW Classic dungeons. However certain dungeons did receive them in later expansions: for example in the release of \"Cataclysm\", &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; gained heroic settings.\nIn heroic dungeons, the enemies that you encounter will not just be of increased level, but also an increased difficulty far greater than their level would indicate. All enemies in heroic dungeons will be in the range of levels from the level cap to three levels above. However, heroic dungeons are substantially more difficult than the normal dungeons. Expect the trash mobs to hit well-geared plate tanks pretty hard for some particularly strong mobs. Also, expect bosses to hit harder, use their abilities more frequently, and often have new abilities.\nGaining access to heroic dungeons.\nTo be able to access a heroic dungeon as a &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt;, each member of the group must be at level 70. If all party members are level 70, the party leader can set the dungeon's difficulty to normal or heroic via menu options available by right-clicking his or her own portrait, or queuing via &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; tool.\nRewards.\nEach boss drops a loot on par with or better than loot from normal level 70 dungeons.\nEnd bosses are guaranteed to drop one item from their loot table in addition to a second, , item. They also usually drop a .\nWrath of the Lich King.\nGaining access to heroic dungeons.\nIn order to access Northrend's dungeons in heroic mode, each member of the group must reach the level 80.\nRewards.\nEach boss drops a loot on par with or better than loot from normal level 80 dungeons.\nEnd bosses are guaranteed to drop one item from their loot table in addition to a second, , item. They also drop a .\nPatch 3.2.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;Patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt; brought the use of &lt;a href=\"normal%20mode\"&gt;normal&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty for 10 and 25-man raids in the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers will find new options when right clicking on their own portrait.\n\"Note: If a heroic raid mode is selected, the previous raids which did not use this new feature will be launched in the selected mode (10 or 25-man).\"\nPatch 3.3.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; brought new changes to dungeon difficulty settings, which at the time were similar to &lt;a href=\"raid%20difficulty\"&gt;raid difficulty&lt;/a&gt; settings.\nCataclysm.\nGaining access to heroic dungeons.\nIn order to access Cataclysm's dungeons in heroic mode, each member of the group must reach level 85.\nRewards.\nEach Non-Zandalari Boss drops a item with &lt;a href=\"Item%20Level\"&gt;Item Level&lt;/a&gt; 346. The End Bosses will drops two item with &lt;a href=\"Item%20Level\"&gt;Item Level&lt;/a&gt; 346.&lt;br&gt;\nEach Zandalari Boss drops a item with &lt;a href=\"Item%20Level\"&gt;Item Level&lt;/a&gt; 353. The End Bosses will drops two item with &lt;a href=\"Item%20Level\"&gt;Item Level&lt;/a&gt; 353.\nJustice and Valor Points.\nWhatever heroic dungeon you complete via Dungeon Finder(at your level) you will receive some extra reward other that Experience and Money.&lt;br&gt;\nKilling each Burning Crusade Heroic Bosses you will receive 5 Justice Points.&lt;br&gt;\nCompleting Wrath of the Lich King Random Heroic you will receive 24 Justice Points and 16 each boss.&lt;br&gt;\nCompleting Cataclysm Random Heroic you will receive 70 &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Point\"&gt;Valor Point&lt;/a&gt;s, and 70 Justice Points each boss.&lt;br&gt;\nCompleting Rise of the Zandalari Random Heroic you will receive 140 &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Point\"&gt;Valor Point&lt;/a&gt;s, and 70 Justice Points each boss.\nLater expansions.\nAs with prior expansions, reaching the maximum level was required for accessing heroic dungeons.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" would introduce the &lt;a href=\"Challenge%20Mode\"&gt;Challenge Mode&lt;/a&gt; variant of Heroic Difficulty. It granted rewards other than gear, it lasted until Legion.\n&lt;a href=\"5-player%20Mythic%20mode\"&gt;Mythic&lt;/a&gt; difficulty was introduced during \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.2.0\"&gt;patch 6.2.0&lt;/a&gt; and was subsequently rolled out to all of the dungeons in the expansion. Mythic difficulty is above and beyond Heroic, and on Mythic, bosses' loot contained gear of a higher quality than heroic loot. This difficulty would become available to all subsequent dungeons in further expansions.\nIn \"Legion\", &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic+&lt;/a&gt; was introduced, further increasing difficulty over Mythic, and adding random modifiers (affixes) to dungeons in numerically increasing levels of difficulty. Unlike previous settings, a &lt;a href=\"Mythic%20Keystone\"&gt;Mythic Keystone&lt;/a&gt; is required for each dungeon run. Loot dropped scaled according to the level of the keystone.\nIn \"Battle for Azeroth\" and \"Shadowlands\", various changes were made to Mythic+ as a particular difficulty level to increase the challenge and rewards available to players, but these did not affect the structure of the existing difficulty system. For example these changes included &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B%23Level%2010%20Affixes\"&gt;seasonal affixes&lt;/a&gt; that were attached to Keystones over a certain level, and &lt;a href=\"Valor\"&gt;Valor&lt;/a&gt; was reintroduced as a way to increase the item level of rewarded items from Mythic+."}

It's about dungeons and raid of Ulduar implemented in the game.\nThe original article, formerly located at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/dungeons/wrath-ulduar.xml, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website.\nDungeons - Ulduar.\nHalls of Stone.\nFor ages, the mortal races of Azeroth have sought to uncover the origins of their existence. Tirelessly scouring the far reaches of the world, many have spent their entire lives chasing the ghosts of the past.\nNestled among the frigid cliffs of the Storm Peaks, a recently discovered titan city known as Ulduar might finally expose the secrets of Azeroth's puzzling history.\nLegendary explorer Brann Bronzebeard spent countless hours piecing together clues about the mysterious city while combing through artifacts scattered across the region. He deduced that a titan library might lie within one wing of the complex: the Halls of Stone. If so, the archive could prove to be his greatest discovery to date.\nHowever, in his attempts to access the library, Brann encountered foul creatures roaming the Halls of Stone. Infused with evil and shaped from iron, crazed dwarves had seized control of the city and spread throughout the Storm Peaks. To Brann's disgust, they had even turned their weapons on Ulduar, tunneling through its walls and carving out monstrous crystal giants from the very heart of the mountains surrounding the city.\nThe source of these destructive iron dwarves is said to be the Forge of Wills, an incredible titan device capable of creating life itself. Rumored to have fallen into the hands of the maddened vrykul Sjonnir the Ironshaper, the forge has unleashed unthinkable evil upon Ulduar and the Storm Peaks.\nIf wrested from its vile operator, the titan machine could be used to purge the dark presence that has taken hold of the city, but a powerful evil watches over the Halls of Stone, ensuring that Sjonnir and the forge continue their work undisturbed.\nThe forge is heavily guarded by impenetrable constructs and savage monsters awakened by the iron dwarves' ceaseless tunneling, and so securing control of it will be a formidable task. Yet if the chaotic iron legions overrunning the city are not stopped soon, priceless information within the Halls of Stone may be destroyed and lost... forever. \nHalls of Lightning.\nUpon departing Azeroth, the titans entrusted loyal protectors to safeguard the city of Ulduar. From atop the snowy mountains of the Storm Peaks, these guardians watched over the enigmatic halls of the complex as history unfolded outside its walls. Designated supreme among these guardians was Keeper Loken, but with the power of the titan city in his hands, he turned to darkness.\nRepudiating his oaths and unraveling the delicate plans of his masters, the treacherous protector turned ally against ally, breaking pacts long held by the ancient races of the Storm Peaks. His deceitful schemes swept through Ulduar and afflicted the city's other protectors. Amassing a powerful force of iron dwarves, the fallen watcher ravaged the surrounding area, striking down any who opposed his dark will.\nFrom his throne within the Halls of Lightning, Loken continues his unabated assault, brooding over a celestial image of the world.\nUlduar's loyal builders, the earthen, are struggling against the corrupted watcher, and they warn that Loken has acquired the allegiance of ferocious allies to bolster the ranks of his iron minions. While vrykul bristling with runic energy prowl the corridors of the Halls of Lightning, fierce elementals swarm around blistering forges, tirelessly churning out new followers.\nOnly putting an end to Loken's reign will ensure the safety of Azeroth. Although the arrival of Horde and Alliance forces has chipped away at the evil gripping the region, the true key to victory may lie with the beings long deceived by Loken's trickery, scattered among embittered enclaves throughout the Storm Peaks.\nLoken's brother, Thorim, wanders grief-stricken outside Ulduar. If he can be convinced of his brother's betrayal, he may turn the tide of battle in favor of the earthen and other heroes fighting to reclaim the city.\nYet as powerful as Loken is, there have been whispers of an even greater evil at work behind the fall of Ulduar. Perhaps only with Loken's last breath will the truth be revealed.\nUlduar.\nSince discovering Ulduar in the Storm Peaks, adventurers have journeyed to the magnificent titan city in hopes of unearthing its relics and learning the secrets of the past. Yet they are not fully aware of the purpose behind Ulduar's imposing edifice. It is not merely a repository of artifacts and titan research, but also a prison.\nLong ago, the titans encountered a race of horrifying aberrations known as the Old Gods. Their destructive powers threatened to unravel Azeroth, eliminating all life and order. Alerted by this danger to their central tenets, the titans went to war against the Old Gods. Ultimately the titans used their prowess in architecture and construction to imprison their foes deep underground. The Old God of death, Yogg-Saron, was shackled in the depths of Ulduar and placed under the watch of mighty guardians \u2013 Loken, Hodir, Thorim, Freya, and Mimiron. They pledged to keep the monstrosity contained there for all eternity. The watchers of Ulduar endured their vigil with fortitude, but the Old God's insidious whispering could not be ignored forever.\nWith time, the prison's head guardian, Loken, succumbed to the will of Yogg-Saron. Betraying his allies, he seized control of the city and began directing its forces toward deadly new ends. Armies of iron dwarves destroyed the titan safeguards in the Storm Peaks, leaving all of Northrend exposed to the growing danger. Several regions have already felt the corrupting presence of Loken's servants, complicating the war against the Lich King.\nFaced with the peril of Yogg-Saron's imminent freedom, a band of mortals has established a staging ground outside of Ulduar. They are preparing to launch a sweeping assault on the city, and they have called on Azeroth's mightiest heroes for aid. Overcoming the legions of iron minions and the towering defenses at Ulduar's entrance would take tremendous strength, but even that may not be enough to conquer the madness that dwells below.\nHaving turned the minds of its former captors, Yogg-Saron is preparing to exert its full power. With vast iron armies to command, the Old God is nearly ready to break its last bonds. It draws ever closer to annihilating the titans' creations and sinking the world into primitive chaos.\nThe preservation of Azeroth depends on Yogg-Saron's defeat, but the fall of Ulduar has other grave repercussions. A silent observer has arrived within the city to survey all of the damage that has occurred on the planet since the titans' departure. His cold logic will determine whether the world will be spared or destroyed.\nOnly Azeroth's heroes can alter the final judgment, for despite their many conflicts and transgressions, their resolve to confront evil in all of its manifestations has earned them the right to determine their ultimate fate."}

He has a &lt;a href=\"frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolf&lt;/a&gt; companion named &lt;a href=\"Winter\"&gt;Winter&lt;/a&gt;. As the son of two powerful &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, Durak is widely expected to follow in his parents' footsteps, though the youth himself is not certain if this is the path he wants for himself.\nBiography.\nChildhood.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; herself announced that &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt; was pregnant with her and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s first child moments after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Durak's birth, his parents moved with him to &lt;a href=\"the%20Den\"&gt;the Den&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war%23Darkspear%20uprising\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall went to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; on his own and asked &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to take care of his mate and son should something happen to him.\nGo'el and Aggra (who at this point was pregnant again, this time with &lt;a href=\"Rehze\"&gt;Rehze&lt;/a&gt;) brought the infant Durak with them to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; for the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Having lost &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;his own father&lt;/a&gt; when he was an infant, Go'el was determined to be actively involved in Durak's rearing. During a break in the trial, he took his sleeping son on a ride on &lt;a href=\"Snowsong\"&gt;Snowsong&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"One%20Keg\"&gt;One Keg&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Aggra initially stayed on Azeroth to care for Durak and the newborn &lt;a href=\"Rehze\"&gt;Rehze&lt;/a&gt;, but she later joined her life-mate on . At the start of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, just after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Durak was briefly seen in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with his parents. After the invasion, Thrall and his family retired to a farm near &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Durak and Rehze often played in the pools near the farm, and Aggra taught both of them to weave. Thrall told Durak many stories about the heroic deeds of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. When Thrall returned to Azeroth to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, his family stayed in Nagrand.\nDragonflight.\nYears later, Durak and his family were among the guests at &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;'s wedding at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; noted that the youngsters seemed to be well behaved.\nAs Durak approached the age for the &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt; rite of passage, his parents brought him and Rehze to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; to introduce them to &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, as well as take the opportunity to discuss the boy's future. Durak was widely expected to become a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; like both of his legendary parents, but he himself wasn't certain if this was what he wanted. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and an orc &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; came to Drek'Thar to discuss bringing back the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. Aggra suggested the simultaneous introduction of a new rite, the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, to replace the om'riggor. The adventurer completed a combat challenge to prove themselves worthy of being the first to complete the rite, after which Drek'Thar appointed Aggra as the one who would preside over both the Kosh'harg and the om'gora. While Thrall and Eitrigg went to gather the clans, Durak, his family, and the adventurer returned to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Tusk\"&gt;Broken Tusk&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to prepare the om'gora.\nAggra left to prepare the rite while the adventurer flew with Durak and Rehze to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, where the Kosh'harg would be held, on the family's &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s. Durak confided his doubts about his future to the adventurer, as well as his hope that watching them complete the om'gora would help him decide his own path. On arrival, Durak stayed with Rehze while the adventurer went to begin the om'gora. Durak asked to accompany the hero on one of the rite's portions, the Blessing of the Ancestors, which required cooking a feast for the spirits. He helped them gather ingredients from around Razor Hill and then place the feast outside Razor Hill. This caused the spirits of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and other famous orcs to briefly appear and give the adventurer their blessing. Before disappearing, Varok also spoke to the disbelieving Durak personally, assuring him that he'd find his path in time and that it would lead him to greatness.\nAfter the adventurer completed the om'gora, the Kosh'harg concluded with a feast in their honor. Durak told the hero that they'd done great with the rite and thanked them for alleviating his worries and showing him what would be required of him once he was old enough to undergo it himself a few years later.\nSpeculation.\nIt is unknown who took care of Durak and Rehze while their parents were on . It may have been &lt;a href=\"Ryal\"&gt;Ryal&lt;/a&gt;, their grandmother."}

Although already consumed by Illidan, the skull still holds power and is in Illidan's possession.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart by demons in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. One of the surviving warlocks found Gul'dan's remains as he was escaping the temple. He believed that even dead they still held power and took the head with him. The warlock was later killed by a warrior, who was in turn killed by &lt;a href=\"Hurkan%20Skullsplinter\"&gt;Hurkan Skullsplinter&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer&lt;/a&gt; chieftain. Not realizing its power, Hurkan wore the skull as a symbol of his station before he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Grom delivered the skull to &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; so he could use it to reopen the rift in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; from Azeroth, Ner'zhul no longer needed the skull to open new portals to other worlds. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; demanded it as payment for his services for purposes unknown. Ner'zhul was reluctant to part with his trophy of triumph over his apprentice.\nThe skull appeared to hold some shard of Gul'dan's soul within, enabling the dead warlock to communicate with Ner'zhul. Additionally, it is implied several times that the Skull has corrupting properties on its wielder as the voice of Gul'dan slowly tempts him over time. It wasn't just delusion on Ner'zhul's part, as the otherworldly whispers were the reason why Deathwing noticed the Skull of Gul'dan to begin with.\n&lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; managed to claim the Skull of Gul'dan from Deathwing and find the Book of Medivh, which Ner'zhul had left behind when he escaped through a portal. Khadgar used both artifacts to close the Dark Portal. As it crumbled, he sent the artifacts back to Azeroth via &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;, which ended up in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nThe skull was stolen years later during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Siege of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; at the same time that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; claimed the Book of Medivh.\nThe skull was used by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt the forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. The Skull also augmented the powers of &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;. The skull's powers were eventually consumed by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; who, upon absorbing its power, became half &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; and half &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;. With his newfound power, he struck a major blow to the Legion by killing Tichondrius. Illidan retained memories of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; from Gul'dan, which he used in tandem with his own knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhen Illidan \"consumed\" the skull it was not destroyed, and Illidan kept it in his possession. The opening cinematic of &lt;a href=\"the%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;the Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; features him holding the skull in his claws, and he can be seen in-game doing the same thing. The skull is now part of Illidan's &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage%20%28tactics%29%23Loot\"&gt;loot table&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate universe Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; is defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, the recently revived Illidan kills him by burning him from the inside out with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; until only Gul'dan's skull remains. Illidan then shatters the skull with his hand.\nPowers.\nIn \"\", consuming The Skull of Gul'dan doubled Illidan's base attack damage (from 34-56 to 75-123) and allowed him to deal chaos damage, which was fully effective against all types of armor (including the Divine Armor of Tichondrius). In addition, it metamorphosed Illidan in a powerful demon with a ranged attack. It also increased Illidan's strength, agility, and intelligence which resulted in his health points increasing by 300 and his mana points by 90."}

To begin it, have someone use the Grimoire when standing on/near the altar. This will cause a \"Soulgrinder\" object to spawn on the altar. During the first phase, non-elite L70 ghosts will occasionally spawn and move towards the altar, attacking the Soulgrinder. You have to kill them to keep them from destroying it; after about 2 minutes the first phase will end and Skulloc will spawn. You can track your progress somewhat by watching the pylons near Skulloc; one will light up about every 30 seconds, then he will spawn once all four are lit. You should attempt to conserve mana during this portion of the fight; also, because it takes a while, you can use potions early on and have them available again for Skulloc himself. (Note: during the first phase ONLY, anyone with a Grimoire and standing near the altar can right-click it to fear all the currently spawned ghosts for about 10\u201315 seconds. While this can help if you are overwhelmed, it also makes it hard to actually kill them. Chain fears may trigger DR.)\nOnce Skulloc spawns, he will move towards the group and attack. He has three primary abilities. First, he occasionally spawns groups of the same ghosts you fought in the first wave. The Grimoire no longer fears them, so you must actually kill, CC, or offtank them. Second, he will occasionally banish a group member for about 10 seconds (he did not seem to use this on the tank). Third, he will occasionally cast Corruption on various group members. This should be dispelled ASAP, as the damage adds up. Skulloc does not deal a tremendous amount of damage himself, although if your DPS is not extremely high, the adds can start to become a problem. Undergeared groups may want to bring additional help."}

The weak, however, are condemned to be the hunted in Kros' afterlife. With that in mind, it should be noted that the Saur-Priests do not hunt themselves, they merely eat from the kills of others. With the aid of the Filthmongers, the Saur-Priests have promoted the idea that cultivating filth will keep enemies of the tribe away, for fear of sickness. To this end, they are protective of their roaches, rotting meat, and partially consumed corpses. A dead Skumblade is food for the tribe and filth to keep the enemy away. Flesh and the consumption of flesh denotes strength to them.\nBrutes would logically be held in high regard, for they are physically the strongest of their kind, while Fleshrippers and Scavengers seem to be middling in terms of rank in the tribal hierarchy. Seadragons are held in lower regard, for they keep the shores filthy and hunt in water, which the Saur-Priests regard as &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;al. Regardless, the task of keeping the waters filthy must go to someone, so they are tolerated. The lowest of the low, however, are the Shortfangs, who are too weak to defend themselves, and thus must rely upon a trained pet, generally an indigenous basilisk. They are shunned and abused by other members of the tribe. They are last to eat when Kroshik is being sacrificed. Shortfangs can ascend from their position, though it also possible for a higher ranking Skumblade to fall into disgrace and become a Shortfang.\nThe Skumblade view all outsiders as a threat, but enjoy reaping the rewards of their conflict, as the corpses left behind mean more meat and filth for the scavengers to collect."}

Sky'ree was eternally loyal to Kurdran and would willingly sacrifice her life for him.\nBiography.\nThe Second War.\nWith her master, Sky'ree gained a spectacular reputation among the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, bearing him into battle against the red dragons enslaved by the Horde during the Second War. Kurdran had nine dragons on his death toll during the war. The pair later traveled through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, where Kurdran acted as a scout during the excursion into &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Kurdran and Sky'ree were captured during the raid on &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, but were rescued by the Alliance.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nKurdran and Sky'ree survived the destruction of Draenor and resided at &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. While Kurdran tended to the business of running Wildhammer Stronghold, Sky'ree was tended to by her keeper, &lt;a href=\"Eli%20Thunderstrike\"&gt;Eli Thunderstrike&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; caused the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Sky'ree accompanied Kurdran to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; when he joined the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, and she laid a clutch of three eggs shortly after arriving, in a nest at the city's gryphon roost. Sky'ree had grown quite old; the cloud of age was thick in her eyes, and while she had easily flown Kurdran to Ironforge, laying the clutch had severely weakened her. She became so frail that even a daily walk with Kurdran was an uncertainty. Nevertheless, when she could do so she seemed to enjoy exploring every nook and cranny of the city.\nWith the roost overcrowded with Wildhammer gryphon nests, a group of ten &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; tried to pass by with kegs of what presumably was &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Ale%20Mug\"&gt;Dark Iron Ale&lt;/a&gt;, but one slipped on some straw, causing a smashed keg to spill all over the roost. The Dark Irons instigated a brawl, eventually knocking over a brazier and setting the gryphon roost ablaze. Though two other gryphons tried to work together to airlift the weakened Sky'ree by her wings, she refused their assistance, wanting to protect her clutch from the fire. Unfortunately, her efforts were for naught, and both Sky'ree and her unhatched eggs perished in the fire.\nHowever, Sky'ree's keeper, &lt;a href=\"Eli%20Thunderstrike\"&gt;Eli Thunderstrike&lt;/a&gt; who had been tending to the Wildhammer gryphons at the roost, discovered a miracle. He found that the gryphon that had been huddled beside Sky'ree was holding an egg. Since none of the other gryphons had been tending to a clutch, Eli realized that it could only have been one of Sky'ree's eggs, which the gryphon had clutched to his chest as he escaped the flames.\nWhen the Wildhammer dwarves &lt;a href=\"Keegan%20Firebeard\"&gt;Keegan Firebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fanny%20Thundermar\"&gt;Fanny Thundermar&lt;/a&gt; got married, Kurdran gave the happy couple Sky'ree's last egg, entreating them to honor and care for the hatchling. After it hatched, they named Sky'ree's daughter &lt;a href=\"Sky%27reen\"&gt;Sky'reen&lt;/a&gt;. They brought her to &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt;."}

She also owns a &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Rogers%27%20Personal%20Gyrocopter\"&gt;gyrocopter&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, Sky Admiral Rogers led the \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" on a mission to rescue the &lt;a href=\"White%20Pawn\"&gt;White Pawn&lt;/a&gt;, only to discover &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; in the process. After arriving over the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Rogers and her team immediately set to work on eliminating the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost and ships that had preceded their arrival. When the survivors tried to swim ashore, she ordered &lt;a href=\"Rell%20Nightwind\"&gt;Rell Nightwind&lt;/a&gt; to kill them. After the Horde presence was completely gone, Rogers relocated to &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt; from where she directed an attack against &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; and dispatched &lt;a href=\"Nodd%20Codejack\"&gt;Nodd Codejack&lt;/a&gt; and an alliance hero to examine the &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20the%20Vanguard\"&gt;Wreck of the Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;. When Taylor was healed in &lt;a href=\"Pearlfin%20Village\"&gt;Pearlfin Village&lt;/a&gt;, Rogers appeared only to tell him that she couldn't let him the \"Skyfire's\" strength because she was called back to regroup and advised him to use the SI:7 agents and local pandaren and jinyu instead.\nLandfall.\nSky Admiral Rogers later commanded the \"Skyfire\" in its siege of &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt; and in &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Zan%27vess\"&gt;Assault on Zan'vess&lt;/a&gt;. She was also present at the summit of Alliance dignitaries in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;, where they discussed the possibility of weaponizing the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;. Rogers was in favor of doing so, noting that &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; was undoubtedly doing the same thing, but was ultimately overruled.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; was ordered to travel to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; on orders from King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The official mission was to escort Alliance champions to Stormheim and aid them in obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;. Unofficially though, after receiving intelligence of suspicious Horde activity, the Skyfire has been tracking Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet. The vengeful &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and Sky Admiral Rogers, who believed Sylvanas herself was a passenger on one of the ships, chose to attack the fleet. Unable to make contact with the rest of the Alliance fleet, the Skyfire proceeded with their assault. Though their forces managed to board the Forsaken's ships and kill their captains, when they boarded the royal flagship, the Alliance discovered that Sylvanas had already left the ship and that &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; was leading a Horde force to sabotage the Skyfire.\nBy the actions of Forsaken boarders, the Skyfire was sabotaged and crashed on Stormheim. The Skyfire was destroyed but its crew survived and rallied in the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire%20Triage%20Camp\"&gt;Skyfire Triage Camp&lt;/a&gt; while combating the Horde. Sky Admiral Rogers tasks Alliance adventurers to kill the surviving Forsaken who continue to trespass on the ruins of her ship. Eventually, &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; creates a distress signal to request Alliance reinforcements while the Skyfire survivors evacuate to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nSometime after the campaign in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; forcefully rebuked Rogers and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; for taking his assignment much further than he had ordered, and it was mentioned that Anduin had an \"uncomfortable\" relationship with her, although acknowledged that the Alliance had needed her \"hawkishness\" during their last conflict.\nWhen King Anduin summoned his councilors to advise him on plans for &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, Rogers suggested they weaponize the mineral against the Horde. Anduin however, reproached her and didn't want to use such power for violence.\nFollowing the death of King Anduin's manservant &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin would later summon his advisers to the map room to unveil his plan for a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and their human loved ones. Rogers was adamantly opposed to the idea and cited the Forsaken as responsible for the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin, however, believed that the Forsaken are not the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and some of them miss their living relatives. When Anduin asked Catherine how she would like to respond if her loved ones were members of the sympathetic &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt;, Rogers allowed herself a brief moment of sentimentality before hardening and reaffirming to herself and everyone that her loved ones are dead and she would loathe to see them as undead monsters. Genn Greymane also agreed with Sky Admiral Rogers and saw the Forsaken as monsters, and stated the Alliance shouldn't embrace what they've become.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nThe Skyfire has had a complete overhaul since our encounter with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;! We now carry a full complement of both fixed-wing and gyro aircraft as well as a battery of 18-inch smoothbore shore bombardment cannons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; won't be able to hide from her reach.

Once assigned to a mission, followers become unavailable for its duration and proceed unaccompanied. At the conclusion of a mission, players can learn the outcome by returning to the Class Hall, where a mission report will be waiting. If successful, the report encloses a small reward that generally scales with mission duration and difficulty.\nDetails.\nOne of the main uses of followers is to send them on missions. Missions are special undertakings which the player can send groups of followers to fulfill, ranging from 2-minute quests to day-long raids featuring a full party of three followers. Successful missions can reward resources for developing the Class Hall, as well as actual player loot usable by the character. In addition, missions serve to earn followers experience, slowly increasing their level and improving their abilities.\nEach mission has its own name, follower level (similar to player instances), specific duration, group size requirement, and other characteristics. Players can view available missions through the interface and choose which followers to send on a mission. Missions are specific to the Class Hall feature, and are not related to any playable content.\nMission types.\nPlayers can choose to send their followers on ? different types of missions:\nCounters.\nTo increase the likelihood of mission success, the player can select followers who are able to counter the abilities of the mission's target enemies. By default, followers can counter the specified threats. When hired or upgraded in quality, followers may gain additional counters."}

The bases of operations of the class orders are called &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;order hall&lt;/a&gt;s.

However, most of the Class Order banners and symbols (with the notable exceptions of the Valajar banner for the Alliance, and the Silver Hand and Valajar banners for the Horde) remain visible after the end of the Fourth War in both Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; and Orgrimmar's &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;, implying they still exist, in some likely diminished form, and retain working relationships with both factions.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; is mentioned to have remained together as of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, during which Anduin Wrynn requested their aid and assistance to tend to kaldorei refugees entering Stormwind, although &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; eventually leaves their Temple to settle in Kul Tiras, then travels to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to join the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;.

As of May 2014 the feature is still early in its inception phase, and is not expected to be implemented until after \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDesign.\nThe class accessories feature will allow players to collect a variety of accessories, which can be optionally added to their character's appearance. A range of accessories of each type will be available, with players able to choose which to display.\nClass accessories are intended to provide an additional level of cosmetic character customization, which can be used alongside &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt; to create a \"nearly endless\" number of possible combinations. Accessories appear to be intended to be easily changed, allowing players to alter their appearance to suit new pieces of gear and experiment with new looks.\nAccessories are planned either to upgrade with the character's level, or to become available in more advanced forms as rewards for leveling. For example, a hunter may start with a simple leather ammo pouch; reaching level 60 may see that pouch expanded in size and gaining additional pockets and bullet-straps; and reaching level 100 may see it gaining golden clasps and detailed ornamentation.\nAccessories will be appropriate to each class, such as bubbling vials of poison and belts of throwing stars for rogues, and will feature appropriate options for different specializations. The feature will see the cosmetic return of many types of gear removed from the game with \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\"'s removal of the &lt;a href=\"relic\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt; slot, such as shaman &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt;s, druid &lt;a href=\"idol\"&gt;idol&lt;/a&gt;s and paladin &lt;a href=\"libram\"&gt;libram&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as hunter &lt;a href=\"quiver\"&gt;quiver&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ammo%20pouch\"&gt;ammo pouch&lt;/a&gt;es. However, these will be appearing as purely cosmetic accessories, and will not have any effect on gameplay or combat.\nAccessories will be available in Horde and Alliance colour schemes, and will likely also feature texture detail variations, or the addition of faction insignias.\nAccessories may be rewarded in a variety of ways, including gaining in level and defeating raid bosses. The developers plan for players to have easy access to a range of options, but with a number of rarer accessories available only through completing more challenging tasks.\nHistory.\nHaving &lt;a href=\"relic\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt;-slot items such as librams displayed visually on characters was considered by the developers prior to \"Mists of Pandaria\". However, the sheer volume of additional work required to produce unique visual appearances for each individual piece of gear meant this was never implemented. With the removal of the relic-slot items from the game in \"Mists of Pandaria\", it became a viable idea to reintroduce these items as purely cosmetic features without the connection to an actual piece of gear, drastically reducing the volume of design work needed to implement them as visual components.\nExternal links.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/14176224/artcraft-concept-class-accessories-5-20-2014\"&gt;Artcraft\u2014Concept: Class Accessories&lt;/a&gt; (2014-05-20)"}

Though the armor of most Steam Warriors takes on a generally humanoid form, a suit's functions are as individualized as its pilot. The only activity most Steam Warriors enjoy more than using their armor in combat is tinkering with it between battles, improving old functions and adding new ones.\nSome were born to steam, gifted with the measures of mechanics and systems, and possessed with an unquenchable thirst for invention. Among those inventors are individuals who push their creations to the limits of technology, testing them in battle, and relying on them for their survival.

All lore from the RPG is approved by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; before it goes into print and some lore is co-developed by the two teams (MMORPG and PnP RPG). Therefore, it is possible that the World of Warcraft developers might draw inspiration from the PnP RPG for future developments, as they appear to have done with &lt;a href=\"The%20Nightmare\"&gt;The Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the RPG the Runemaster would probably be a class for tauren or dwarves if included, with night elves, orcs, or trolls being possible as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Prospector\"&gt;Prospector&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese individuals travel to every corner of the world.

Basic healing would also be a trait, since they usually travel solo or in small groups and must take care of themselves when far from civilization.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother &lt;a href=\"melee%20weapon\"&gt;melee weapon&lt;/a&gt; class.\n&lt;a href=\"Assassin\"&gt;Assassin&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Ninja\"&gt;Ninja&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Spy\"&gt;Spy&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Infiltrator\"&gt;Infiltrator&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssassins specialise in disposing of their victims quickly and efficiently, and are unique in that they can kill an enemy of their own level in a single blow (only once per 5 minutes, wouldn't want to make it too easy!). They can also use sniper rifles, which allow them to do heavy damage from a great distance.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bandit\"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Brigand\"&gt;Brigand&lt;/a&gt;.\nBandits are stalking rogues, masters in advantaged combat. This could be a additional specialization for Rogue, specialized in Combat spells and stunning and debuff spells.\nPossible Bonus: A stunning ranged/thrown weapon spell, a fear/surprising/incapacitating spell, some debuffs...\nAn irregular soldier who has permission to carry weapons, but may also practice highway robbery and plunder. They are usually the malefactor, and resort to violence when it benefits them. Willing to work for anyone, when not employed they are basically outlaws.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Barbarian\"&gt;Barbarian&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Berserker\"&gt;Berserker&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Primal%20%28occupation%29\"&gt;Primal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis could be a new class for some of the more barbaric races (most of whom are within the Horde).\nMost warriors currently in Warcraft wear extremely heavy armor, yet there are other fighters who wear far less (orcish &lt;a href=\"Grunt\"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt;s for example). It could be similar to Fury warriors, specially for Horde players.\n Primal are those warriors who revel in their bestial rage and give into it completely. As they slowly take on an increasingly beast-like appearance, they also gain powerful and violent abilities.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Fighter\"&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;.\nFighters are masters of melee dps, being agile and strong. They are specialized in combat spells, dealing damage to a single enemy or all nearby enemies with powerful spells. It could be a Rogue specialization. They can wear mail armor.\nPossible spells:\nSee &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother &lt;a href=\"ranged%20weapon\"&gt;ranged weapon&lt;/a&gt; class.\nThese could be additional specializations for Hunter.\n&lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Dark%20ranger\"&gt;Dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Mountaineer\"&gt;Mountaineer&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Scout\"&gt;Scout&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt; class has appeared in numerous Warcraft games, especially in the ranks of &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s could wear leather or mail armor and have a longer range (through talents too).\nPossible spells:\n\"All numbers with an * are talent-improved.\"\nIt could have 3 talents branches:\n&lt;a href=\"Wilderness%20stalker\"&gt;Wilderness stalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nA wilderness stalker could be a hybrid melee/ranged class that specializes in Thrown Weapons like the Trolls in Warcraft 2 &amp; 3. Wearing chainmail, it could be similar to the Hunter, but with a greater focus on melee abilities.\nAbilities could include:\nCould be a second line damage sponge to relive tanks of minions during raids.\n&lt;a href=\"Witch%20Hunter\"&gt;Witch Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nA versatile warrior/archer class dedicated to destroying spellcasters. Wears MAIL.\nInspired by:\n- spell breakers (wc3), witch doctors (wc3)\n- Shadow Hunter (wow)\n- Runemasters and witchcraft.\nRaces:\nevery race can be it!\nClass type is:\n- normal/non-hero - begins at level 1.\nAllowed weapons: one handed and two handed weapons of all type and ranged weapons of all type.

You can occasionally stun it, interrupt its casting, order it to stop moving or turn.\n&lt;a href=\"Caster\"&gt;Caster&lt;/a&gt; class ideas.\n&lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;Druid of the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; (or of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Fang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Flame&lt;/a&gt; or ).\nThis class was added in &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Factions\"&gt;Dark Factions&lt;/a&gt; WoWRPG book for the pen-and-paper RPG. This has some ties to Emerald Dream (which was said to be featured in an expansion). They are basically druids corrupted by the Nightmare during their dreamwalks or people who are intentionally helping the Nightmare. &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;Druid of the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; use dark and mad magic of the Emerald Nightmare to fight their enemies. These druids work against nature, destroying plants and animals.\nPerhaps &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;Druid of the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; could be redeemed to fight fire with fire, to follow the \"redeemed corrupted hero\" cliche which Blizzard seems to favor as the Death Knight class shows us; or, quite possibly, &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;Druid of the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; might remain uncorrupted like the &lt;a href=\"uncorrupted%20warlock\"&gt;uncorrupted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey would have alternative shapeshifting froms\nSee &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Acolyte\"&gt;Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;Necromancer&lt;/a&gt; (also see &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Acolyte\"&gt;Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;) was originally planned as a class for World of Warcraft, but did not make the cut. Blizzard wanted all classes to be different, and the design was simply too close to that of the warlock. This could be a warlock specialization.\nThe Warlock is a summoner while the Necromancer would raise dead. Just like the Hunter trains pets and the Warlock summons pets, the Necromancer would get a Raised Minion. The Minion would be the Necromancer's main pet and as you find different dead creatures you would be able to raise them as a minion just like a hunter taming their pet, without the trouble. As the Necromancer levels up, he will be able to raise different undead although like the hunter, there will obviously be some things you cannot raise. The Minion will have a paper doll equipment status.\n&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter\"&gt;Shadow Hunter&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Hexer\"&gt;Hexer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt; troll unit was featured in Warcraft III, and some parts of it were wrapped up into the WoW Shaman class.\nA Shadow Hunter was a horde hero unit in Warcraft III. For World of Warcraft it could have Rogue-like combat attacks with Shaman healing and Warlock curses. It could be a Shaman specialization.\nSpells could include:\nDiablo 3: The Witch Doctor is also featured in Diablo III. The Diablo version has a chain swarm ability and diseases. This version is similar to a Death Knight, but is a caster rather than melee.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sorceror\"&gt;Sorceror&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Wizard\"&gt;Wizard&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Battlemage\"&gt;Battlemage&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Warmage\"&gt;Warmage&lt;/a&gt;.\nA blend of the mage and warlock class (and could appear as a specialization for either), possibly featuring non-demonic 'familiars' or heavier armor (especially with the Battlemage).\nSee &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker\"&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spellbreaker\"&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/a&gt; was a Warcraft III blood elven anti-magic unit, which the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon City Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s resemble. It could end up being a specialization for an existing class such as &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;. Would be a strong support (CC/Debuff/Utility) class.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;?\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Walker\"&gt;Spirit Walker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Walker\"&gt;Spirit Walker&lt;/a&gt; Tauren unit was featured in Warcraft III, and some parts of it were wrapped up into the WoW Shaman class. It could end up being a Shaman specialization.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Summoner\"&gt;Summoner&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Conjurer\"&gt;Conjurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummoners (are potentially priests who have given up their role as healers and sought more holy and shadow powers) pursued their training into harnessing the powers of creatures of lore under command. Summoners with the help of the creatures will be able to heal, tank, dps depending on which creature he chooses to summon. The Summoner talent tree is separated into 3 branches: Astreal, which increases healing strength, Divine, which will allow the summoner to control their pet in such a way to be able to tank, and the Templar tree, which increases your spells and your pet's dps strength. The summoner will be able to keep up to four creatures with him/her at all times. Summoners capture creatures by entering portals around the world which bring them to temples where they can capture the temple's creature.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;.\nClasses based on &lt;a href=\"hero%20unit\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20heroes\"&gt;units&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Beastmaster\"&gt;Beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe possible &lt;a href=\"Beastmaster\"&gt;Beastmaster&lt;/a&gt; class could be manifested from features in &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;The Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; in the shape of &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;. Since Beastmasters are Hunters, based in Beasts Mastery abilities, they are unlikely to be a future class.\nPossible Bonus: Multiple pets, more spells for pets (and a bigger pet bar), etc.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Blademaster\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Gladiator\"&gt;Gladiator&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Blademaster\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s were an agile, \"samurai\"-like Orc hero from &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;. They were skilled orcish swordsmen who came from the original &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Clan\"&gt;Burning Blade Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of this class were rolled into the warrior and rogue classes. \nIt could be a warrior specialization.\nPossible bonuses: Mirror Image - The Hero makes false duplicates of himself to fool the enemy. One-on-one fighting spells for tanking/DPSing powerful bosses in PvE...\nSee &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Far%20seer\"&gt;Far seer&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Pyremaster\"&gt;Pyremaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer\"&gt;Far Seer&lt;/a&gt; was an orc Shaman hero unit from Warcraft III. It could end up being a separate Shaman specialization.\nPossible bonus: Spirit Wolf Pet\nSee &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt; was a dwarven hero unit from Warcraft III. As a Hero Class, this could come from any of the Dwarves' original classes as they are all based on melee combat.\nPossible bonuses: The transformation into an &lt;a href=\"avatar\"&gt;avatar&lt;/a&gt;, and becoming immune to most magic.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; was a Night Elf hero unit in The Frozen Throne. It could be a Rogue specialization.\nPossible bonuses:\n&lt;a href=\"Mount\"&gt;Mount&lt;/a&gt;ed class (&lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Raider\"&gt;Raider&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Mounted%20warrior\"&gt;Mounted warrior&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe Knight is a class based on the &lt;a href=\"Raider\"&gt;Raider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;s of previous Warcraft games. Unlike the similarly aligned Paladin, a Knight would fight on a mount and specialize in polearms. It would probably be a melee tank, possibly with a few buffing skills.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Windrider\"&gt;Windrider&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Windwarrior\"&gt;Windwarrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Falstad\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;.\nClasses only established in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;RPG books&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonsworn\"&gt;Dragonsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor centuries, the great dragonflights have noted the potential of younger races. In a few select cases, they choose a creature of another race to be one of a select few with the privilege of directly serving a dragon or an entire group of dragons. Such devotees dedicate their lives to the protection and service of their dragonflights, and reap the benefits of the great knowledge and power that their draconic masters share. Rumors say that the first dragonsworn were the forefathers of the dragonspawn race.\n&lt;a href=\"Exemplar\"&gt;Exemplar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Exemplar is a very malleable class inspired by real world standard bearers. It could use totem-like \"battle standards\" and \"warhorns\" (left-hand items) for buffs, spells, crowd control, etc. It could also possibly use both melee and ranged weaponry. It contains some similarities to shaman/warrior/hunter classes and the aforementioned bard class.\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Champion\"&gt;Spirit Champion&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Champion\"&gt;Spirit Champion&lt;/a&gt; is a mighty warrior who embraces the spirits to assist him in his battles. He strengthens his spiritual connection until he can feel the spirits flowing within his body and thoughts, strengthening his arms and quickening his mind. Whispered fragments impart insight into battle as ancestors speak of ways to overcome all foes. The spirit champion ceases to fight for his own reasons; he battles to honor the spirits and to further their wishes. Often these wishes coincide with his own, but occasionally the spirit champion embarks on a path for reasons that are unclear to him. He does so faithfully, trusting in the spirits to point him in the right direction.\n&lt;a href=\"Techslayer\"&gt;Techslayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nTechslayers are often misunderstood. They do not hate science, only science used for evil purposes. Techslayers are adept at the use of technology, but they use their abilities to build, nurture, and protect - and, of course, stamp out destructive tech wherever they find it.\nOne of the Techslayer's primary motivations is to eliminate the chaos created by rampant, uncontrolled science.\nTechslayers often come from backgrounds that take them close to nature. Druids and shaman, for example, sometimes take up the techslayer's path.\nCounterpart of Steam Warrior.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Templar\"&gt;Templar&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Argent Dawn templar\" is a prestige class in &lt;a href=\"More%20Magic%20and%20Mayhem\"&gt;More Magic and Mayhem&lt;/a&gt; RPG sourcebook. This could be a Paladin specialization.\nSee &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;.\nbooks.\nMystic theurge.\nBlurring the line between divine and arcane, mystic theurges draw power from divine sources and musty tomes alike. While most spellcasters choose one path to magical power, mystic theurges walk two roads at once, simultaneously mastering spells common to clerics and wizards.\nThe Mystic would be a class similar to the Mage, Shaman and Warlock classes; being a combination of a spell caster and healer with some melee and special abilities that allow chain spells, chain healing, and chain curses. It would also have mystic runes (with effects like damage and healing over time) with special effects. For example, if a Mystic dies they could trade a mystic rune for a resurrection (obviously restricted to higher levels). This class would most likely be for the night elf, blood elf, draenei and troll races. \nAlternatively, it could be a specialization for an exiting class.\n\"Note: Mystic Theurge (a.k.a. mystic) is a class specifically said not to be relevant to the Warcraft world. This may make it less likely to be used as a class idea by Blizzard.\"\nSee &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are usually obtained through long questlines.\nHistory.\nSince \"Classic\", only &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s had class mounts, and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s possessed a flight form, with a slow version unlocked at level 20 and a faster version at level 40. \"Wrath of the Lich King\" added the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; which came with both a ground mount at level 55 and a flying class mount at level 60. In \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", the original quests to gain the paladin and warlock mounts, and the druid's faster flight form, were removed. They are now automatically learned by players of the appropriate level like any other class ability.\nUntil \"Cataclysm\", all &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; paladin races used a blue horse, and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; paladin races used a red horse. Alliance flight form used a purple &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; crow, while Horde flight form was brown. With the expansion, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; paladins were given their own mounts instead of using the human horse, and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; druids were given a unique flight form instead of using the night elven one. \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" added the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; which came with its own class mount, and also gave each class a unique mount in patch &lt;a href=\"7.2.0\"&gt;7.2.0&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" gave &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dark%20iron%20dwarves\"&gt;dark iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; their own paladin mount as well."}

There are three primary roles: &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt; (DPS). These may be further divided into sub-roles, such as main tank and off-tank. Groups may also choose to assign support roles, such as being responsible for &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;. Balance of class roles is critical to attaining an effective composition in &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s.\nChoice of the role is largely determined by &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;, with each specialization designed to perform a specific role. While it is possible for characters to perform roles other than those intended for their spec, the result is generally ineffective and/or inefficient, and often cannot be sustained for long.\nPrimary roles.\nThere are three primary roles in almost every &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt;, and \"World of Warcraft\" is no exception.\nThe role of a tank in the group is to take damage for the group, protecting the others from being attacked. Tanks usually have high health, high armor, and often high &lt;a href=\"Avoidance\"&gt;Avoidance&lt;/a&gt;. In PvE, a tank's job is to keep the monster's &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; or attention on them, preventing them from attacking others in the group, who are often less armored and less well-suited to taking damage. Tanks are often the leaders of the group, the first ones into a fight and the last ones out. Good tanks can make a very hard &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; seem easy. Small groups will have a single tank, while larger groups may have several, often switching targets mid-fight. Tanks are less common in PvP, but can be extremely effective as flag carriers and defenders. Despite the lack of use for their taunting abilities, tanking specs are often still effective in PvP, trading sheer healing and damage output for resilience and staying power.\nThe role of a healer in the group is to heal others when they are hurt or take damage, thus keeping party members alive in order to tank or kill the enemies. The role often requires quick reaction time and steady nerves. Healers must anticipate incoming damage and balance the protection of their allies with their finite supply of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;. Healers are often credited (rightly or wrongly) for the success or failure of a group. In PvE, healers are mostly focused on the tank(s), but must do their best to keep all members of the group alive. Healers are arguably the most critical and responsible members of a group, capable of compensating for others' errors and often expected to pull absent-minded allies out of the fire.\nThe role of DPS is to kill the monsters. This may sound simplistic, but it takes skill and know-how to dish out powerful damage without overwhelming the group's tank and causing the monsters to attack you. While the tanks and healers focus on keeping the party alive, it is the DPS that must attend to the vital task of actually defeating the group's enemies. The DPS must also deal damage quickly enough to defeat their target before the healers' mana expires, the group is overwhelmed by additional mobs, or the enemy &lt;a href=\"enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrages&lt;/a&gt; and wipes the party. The most populous role and also the least responsible, DPS are often given additional tasks such as &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ing and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor a more detailed overview, see &lt;a href=\"Choosing%20a%20class%23Class%20roles\"&gt;Choosing a class role&lt;/a&gt;.\nSub-roles.\nSub-roles refer to the breakdown of each of the primary roles. For example, DPS is composed of melee, ranged physical, and ranged caster. The following is a breakdown of all the sub-roles within WoW and the corresponding classes which fill those roles.\n&lt;a href=\"Tank\"&gt;Tank&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;\nSupport roles.\nSupportive roles include all the other roles needed to create an effective party. These are not always required roles, but they do make groups faster, make fighting easier, and often more fun. There are many supportive roles but this list will cover some of the most important or common.\nClasses.\nDifferent classes have access to different roles. Some, such as the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, can be any of the three roles (tank, healer, or DPS); others, like the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, can only be DPS."}
