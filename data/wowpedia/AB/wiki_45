Beneath the everlasting night, which gave Duskwood its current name, the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic unleashed by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; upon his death has transformed what was once a beautiful part of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; into a land covered in gnarled trees, along with the black fog hanging over the woods.\nDuskwood is inhabited by a defiant people who still cling to their holdings in the face of overwhelming adversity. On all sides lurk dangerous creatures, from hideous undead to ferocious &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and overgrown spiders. Ogres moving in have brought up even more problems. To fight against all these threats, the militia of Duskwood, known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;, patrolled the main thoroughfare and protected &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, wary of anything moving through the shadows.\nThe most prominent geographical feature of the region is an ancient and long-dead volcano crater, which teems with life and features one of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s with a portal leading into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The woods also feature several abandoned farmsteads, as well as the prominent &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, which holds the graves of numerous people who have known tragic fates.\nHistory.\nFelling of Andrassil.\n4,500 years before the Dark Portal, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral&lt;/a&gt; and his followers secretly cut six enchanted branches from the boughs of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. With the branches in hand, they traveled the world to locations where &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; blooms had sprung to life, including a remote region of the Eastern Kingdoms that would later be known as Duskwood. The branch quickly took root, and became a new tree all its own, acting as a conduit and channeling the powers of the Emerald Dream into the waking world, strengthening the nearby wildlife and scouring the saronite deposits.\nBefore the First War.\nCenturies ago, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate human nations flourished, among them the smallest and most isolated of the kingdoms was &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, it found prosperity through the farmsteads that dotted the surrounding fertile region, and as its population grew, small towns sprang up in the nearby regions, notably in Brightwood. Also known as \"Southern Elwynn Forest\", the region was the location of two sizable towns called &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the First War.\nEventually, during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Warchief Blackhand ordered raiding parties to cut deep into Stormwind's lands, as he wanted to drive the human populace to panic. Entire villages in Westfall fell to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s control, their inhabitants either killed or forced to flee. Later, the region was cursed when &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; died, &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy being unleashed by his death, turning the surrounding land into a dangerous, thorny blight. The area would later become known as Duskwood.\nLong ago, &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; was populated with a group of &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s that lived peacefully among the woods. However, when the curse fell over Duskwood - turning the once peaceful woodland into a realm of terror - the spiders began to mutate and grow to monstrous proportions. The lurking &lt;a href=\"venom%20spider\"&gt;venom spider&lt;/a&gt;s began hunting their hapless prey in all of the shadowed corners of the land. Possessing both deadly acidic &lt;a href=\"venom\"&gt;venom&lt;/a&gt; and powerful webbing, these cruel &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s stalked any foolish wanderers who stray too far into the haunted woods.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nYears ago, humans introduced the &lt;a href=\"Rat%20Snake\"&gt;rat snakes&lt;/a&gt; into Duskwood to cull the local rat population.\nThe reason Duskwood now teems with the undead is because of the vile necromancer &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt;.\nA night elf by the name of &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; came to the woods carrying the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Hunted by &lt;a href=\"Varkas\"&gt;Varkas&lt;/a&gt;, Velinde was killed and the Scythe of Elune was lost in &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;. The powerful weapon was later found by members of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; excavating the mine, including a skittish man named &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt;. Jitters picked up the weapon, triggering its effect of summoning. The mine was immediately filled with &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, who then proceeded to rip the men apart, while &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; escaped with the weapon.\nIn his escape, Jitters lost the weapon in the woods and hid in the barn of the &lt;a href=\"Yorgen%20Farmstead\"&gt;Yorgen Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;, but the appearance of the scythe attracted the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, who slaughtered &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt;'s family in front of Jitters' eyes. Now the people of Duskwood have to fight against the undead but also the worgen, under the threat from the Dark riders in search of the scythe.\nPre-Cataclysm.\nMere days before the Fall of Gilneas, the Scythe of Elune was liberated from Duskwood. \nIt was rediscovered by the worgen around Manor Mistmantle and Roland's Doom, who served the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to clear his name, Mardigan sought out the cult on his own, questioning the Night Watch before seeking the worgen in the woods. He was followed soon after by &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ambrose\"&gt;Ambrose&lt;/a&gt;, who killed the local worgen leader &lt;a href=\"Gervase\"&gt;Gervase&lt;/a&gt;, saved Mardigan, and claimed the Scythe of Elune.\nThe scythe was given to the night elves, and was taken to &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn&lt;/a&gt; days later.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Duskwood saw its share of turmoil.\nA handful of Gilneans arrived in Duskwood. In Darkshire, &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Tobias Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; sought the whereabouts of his brother, Stalvan, taking up temporary residence in the town until discovering his brother's fate at Manor Mistmantle. In Raven Hill, Oliver Harris and his team made camp among the ruins and performed alchemical testing on captured Nightbane worgen, saving Sven Yorgen from the mindless state. In &lt;a href=\"Addle%27s%20Stead\"&gt;Addle's Stead&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Night%20Runner\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; have since vanished, and several &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Spirit\"&gt;forlorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wraith\"&gt;wraiths&lt;/a&gt; appear in their place. In the Raven Hill Cemetary, &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt; has returned and now holds dominion over the undead from underground.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, several artifacts passed through Duskwood.\nSeeking the downfall of Stormwind, the Night Watch and the leadership of Darkshire joined the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Hand\"&gt;Veiled Hand&lt;/a&gt;. While other members of the cult stayed in Raven Hill, Darkshire's former guardians sacrificed many of the townspeople to the Burning Legion, plotting to summon demons inside Stormwind Keep. These plans were thwarted by the Uncrowned, who sent &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to investigate.\nMeaning to pass the Scythe of Elune to the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;balance druid&lt;/a&gt; adventurer, Belysra Starbreeze and Valorn transported it from Darnassus to the Twilight Grove in Duskwood. Its presence was felt not only by the Nightbane worgen, but the Dark Riders as well, who killed Valorn and stole away the scythe. They were followed by the feral Nightbane, followed in turn by the balance druid adventurer and Revil Kost, who then found and recovered the Scythe from the Dark Riders.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Duskwood saw more activity in Raven Hill and the Twilight Grove.\n&lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra Stormclaw&lt;/a&gt; joined Oliver Harris and the other residents of Raven Hill in studying the worgen curse. Nightbane worgen were captured and used for testing. During this time, the residents were plagued by a particularly ferocious member of the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane pack&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Bloodeyes\"&gt;Bloodeyes&lt;/a&gt;. In Manor Mistmantle, a rare bloom called &lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Grace%20%28item%29\"&gt;Elune's Grace&lt;/a&gt; appeared around the manor, and a pack of &lt;a href=\"Mistfang%20Howler\"&gt;Mistfang wolves&lt;/a&gt; had taken up residence.\nSome time after, &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt; wished to become a worgen to better understand her people. When her &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; refused to bite her, Tess Greymane and the Gilnean adventurer traveled to Duskwood to meet Vassandra Stormclaw and find an alternative. There, while Tess was busy with her own tasks for the druid, the adventurer captured Bloodeyes, collected fangs from Mistfang wolves, and collected Elune's Grace. In the Twilight Grove, Vassandra used these items to summon Goldrinn through the dream portal, who then provided Tess a vision, in which she relived the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;fall of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; as a worgen.\nTerror by Torchlight.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20%28Terror%20by%20Torchlight%29\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; attempted to overwhelm Duskwood and Darkshire with an army of undead by corrupting the &lt;a href=\"%3ATorch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;:Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt;, placed by the watcher &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Ladimore\"&gt;Sarah Ladimore&lt;/a&gt; in front of &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Rowe\"&gt;Morbent Fel's home&lt;/a&gt; to dispelling dark enchantments in the region and keeping the undead docile in the &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;cemetery&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Darkshire is still active and free from the Veiled Hand, the advance of the undead was slowed down by the efforts of the watchers, now led by Sara Ladimore, until &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; defeated the necromancer and recovered the purified holy torch, saving Duskwood from the army of undead. The Spymaster announced to Ladimore that he would send Stormwind guards as reinforcements after the necromancer hinted that the threat was not over.\nShadowlands.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, Duskwood came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. To fight against the undead, troops of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; were mobilized in order to protect the region and its inhabitants.\nGeography.\nThere are no dungeons of any kind and no battlegrounds in this area.\nThe Redridge Range lies on the eastern border of this zone, as these mountains stretch from the zone of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the zone of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D5\"&gt;Topographic map of Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nDuskwood is home to several humans of note. In Darkshire, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; sends willing adventurers to battle back the evil denizens of the dark woods. At the northwestern corner of the forest, &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt; directs budding heroes to uncover a magical weapon with which to weaken the evil &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt; located in his dark house on Forlorn Rowe. And at Raven Hill, a frightened man nicknamed &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; hides from his dark past.\nDig sites.\nDuskwood has two &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s:\nTreasure of Duskwood.\nDuskwood is rather unique with regard to its &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;treasure chests&lt;/a&gt;. In most zones on Azeroth, treasure chests spawn next to or inside buildings or ruins, often in the middle of a camp of hostile mobs and virtually always with at least one mob guarding it. In Duskwood, especially north of the main road that cuts across the zone, treasure chests will spawn randomly in the forest next to trees and often without any hostile mobs near them. Chests also spawn at ruined buildings in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt; and at the remains of a small house near &lt;a href=\"Addle%27s%20Stead\"&gt;Addle's Stead&lt;/a&gt;, generally with only a single hostile beast wandering nearby and it is fairly easy to loot the chests without drawing aggro. For an Alliance character in a level range of mid-to-high 20s, treasure hunting in Duskwood can be a fun and profitable adventure.\nIn \"Cataclysm\".\nDuskwood was a level 18 - 30 zone prior to \"Cataclysm\", but returned for levels 20 - 25.

Technically part of the Alliance and under Stormwind's protection, its distance from the mighty fortress and its close proximity to more malevolent forces in the south and east make it a realm of horror. Due to events central to the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, Duskwood is a cursed, dying land. Beneath the eternal blanket of darkness which gave Duskwood its current name, the Scythe's effects have transformed what was once a beautiful part of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; into a land covered in gnarled trees and inhabited by the hideous undead and extradimensional Worgen, brought along with the black fog hanging over the woods. Ogres moving in from Deadwind Pass have brought up even more problems.\nLong betrayed and abandoned by Stormwind, Duskwood is inhabited by a defiant people who still cling to their holdings in the face of overwhelming adversity. On all sides lurk dangerous creatures, from skeletal warriors and &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s to ferocious &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and some of the most powerful members of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. The militia of Duskwood, known as the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;, patrol the main thoroughfare and protect &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, wary of anything moving through the shadows.\nThe most prominent geographical feature of Duskwood is an ancient and long-dead volcano crater. The crater teems with life, and features one of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Tree\"&gt;Great Tree&lt;/a&gt;s with a portal leading into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. The sleeping &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s' influence can be seen on the surrounding land, which is cloaked in a twilight quite different from the rest of Duskwood. The woods also feature several abandoned farmsteads, as well as the prominent &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;, which holds the graves of the numerous people who have been killed by wild beasts and undead since the darkness fell. \nHistory.\nDuskwood was not always the way it appears now. Located in the southern reaches of the Kingdom of Stormwind, the southern part of Elwynn Forest was the location of two sizable towns, now called &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;, before the area was overcome by shadow.\nA night elf by the name of &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; came to the woods carrying the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Unknown events occurred and the Scythe found its way to the mine now known as &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly happened to her after that is unclear, but it is likely she was killed by something that did not approve of her actions. The powerful weapon was later found by a man who was part of a team of men who had entered the mine looking for the source of its darkness. &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; picked up the weapon, triggering its effect of summoning. The mine was immediately filled with &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, who then proceeded to rip the men apart. Jitters escaped with the weapon, but was hunted by the worgen across the woods, which were steadily darkening with the scythe's released curse. \nIn an attempt to rid himself of their chase, Jitters disposed of the weapon nearby at &lt;a href=\"the%20Yorgen%20Farmstead\"&gt;the Yorgen Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;, whereupon he encountered the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Riders\"&gt;Black Riders&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The riders slaughtered &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt;'s family in front of &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt;' eyes. The frightened man then escaped to &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The darkness lingers in Duskwood, although it is unclear whether the Black Riders claimed the Scythe of Elune and took it with them back to Karazhan. Now the people huddle in former &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;, renamed &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, battling the undead and wolf men who inhabit the murky woods.\nGeography.\nThere are no dungeons of any kind and no battlegrounds in this area.

In Darkshire, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; sends willing adventurers to battle back the evil denizens of the dark woods. At the northwestern corner of the forest, &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt; directs budding heroes to uncover a magical weapon with which to weaken the evil &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt; located in his dark house on Forlorn Rowe. And at Raven Hill, a frightened man nicknamed &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; hides from his dark past.\nTreasure of Duskwood.\nDuskwood is rather unique with regard to its &lt;a href=\"chest\"&gt;treasure chests&lt;/a&gt;. In most zones on Azeroth, treasure chests spawn next to or inside buildings or ruins, often in the middle of a camp of hostile mobs and virtually always with at least one mob guarding it. In Duskwood, especially north of the main road that cuts across the zone, treasure chests will spawn randomly in the forest next to trees and often without any hostile mobs near them. Chests also spawn at ruined buildings in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt; and at the remains of a small house near &lt;a href=\"Addle%27s%20Stead\"&gt;Addle's Stead&lt;/a&gt;, generally with only a single hostile beast wandering nearby and it is fairly easy to loot the chests without drawing aggro. For an Alliance character in a level range of mid-to-high 20s, treasure hunting in Duskwood can be a fun and profitable adventure.\nLore.\nBeasts with green scales inhabit this jungle, making it hard to spot them. The tileset is called \"Ashenvale\"."}

Although there is little activity in the area, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have recently expanded their influence in the region. The Alliance city-state of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; was located on a &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;small island&lt;/a&gt; east off shore but was eventually destroyed by a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; ordered by the then-Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde major stronghold in the area is &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt;, the new home of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nDustwallow Marsh had long been home only to wild beasts, but all this changed in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; led her people here to settle down after the battle with &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Founding the city-state of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina's people rapidly extended into the swamp, building fortified &lt;a href=\"scout%20tower\"&gt;scout tower&lt;/a&gt;s at important points along the road to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe area was home to the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; who raided orc members. &lt;a href=\"Bloodbeak%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Bloodbeak the Berserker&lt;/a&gt; destroyed an orc village here.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; relocated his tribe to the marsh. His base served as a base of operations for &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; recruited the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; that lived here into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; when he killed their tyrannical leader &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt;. Dustwallow Marsh saw a great skirmish between the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; led by Admiral Proudmoore, eventually leading to Daelin's death and the permanent breakup of the tentative peace between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nPerhaps it is because of extreme terrain conditions that neither the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has succeeded in establishing an extensive presence in the area. Though it is shown that several orc families live here. Located on the rocky tip of the peninsula on the eastern shore, the citadel of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; is the home of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and a great bastion of the Alliance. The gleaming walls of this bastion, however, often serve to contain the Alliance, and its presence does not extend far beyond them, despite a number of scattered checkpoints and towers that dot the road leading to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Theramore's military has recently been dwindling, partly due to the ever-increasing number of desertions, though why so many people have chosen to forsake their place with the Theramore garrison remains a mystery.\nDespite bordering on Horde-controlled territory, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish presence in Dustwallow Marsh is equally marginal and is largely confined to &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest. Founded by the Stonemaul ogres and ruled by the iron fist of their leader, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mok%27Morokk\"&gt;Overlord Mok'Morokk&lt;/a&gt;, Brackenwall Village is the only vestige of the Horde in the area. As the Stonemaul ogres do not generally seem to take much interest in the outside world, much of the area between the bastion of Theramore Isle and the Horde settlement remains wild and untamed, with even the road leading to the Barrens rapidly falling into disrepair. \nThough neither faction controls a significant portion of Dustwallow Marsh, covert skirmishes between the Alliance and Horde became common, in spite of the official truce that was maintained in the region. There have been reports of Brackenwall Village taking military action against the covert Theramore infiltrators, who have been spotted to the east of the village. Other sources indicate that a number of Horde spies have been murdered or simply disappeared while attempting to infiltrate Theramore. Clandestine activities on both sides continue to this day and are more likely to escalate into a full-fledged covert conflict than cease completely.\nIn the south of the marsh, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has established a presence. Consequently, these regions of the swamp have come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmurk\"&gt;Dragonmurk&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmbog\"&gt;Wyrmbog&lt;/a&gt;. Until recently, the Stonemaul ogres lived in &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Ruins\"&gt;Stonemaul Village&lt;/a&gt; in this region in relative peace. The &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; assumed leadership of their tribe some time ago and forged an alliance between the Stonemaul and the Horde, although later it seems he stepped down as a leader. Not long after, the Black Dragonspawn attacked the village in a terrible rout and the surviving Stonemaul ogres were forced to retreat to Brackenwall but the ogres have sworn revenge on the usurpers. It is said that this wilderness is also home to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, a great black dragon and the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, and even some adventurers ventured into her lair and lived to tell the tale.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe goblins of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; created the town of &lt;a href=\"Mudsprocket\"&gt;Mudsprocket&lt;/a&gt; in the southwest of Dustwallow Marsh. At the same time, the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; expanded their influence in the region by settling in the northern reaches founding &lt;a href=\"Blackhoof%20Village\"&gt;Blackhoof Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nDustwallow Marsh was almost entirely untouched by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;. The only changes of note were a new road from Theramore directly to the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and a new mountain pass from &lt;a href=\"Mudsprocket\"&gt;Mudsprocket&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe relative quiet didn't last long though. After &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s fall, Theramore was attacked and &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; by a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; detonated under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, then-&lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde.\nOnce Garrosh Hellscream was defeated and captured in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; stated that he wanted to set up a garrison close to Theramore.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Ruins of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; saw some activity in the form of scouting missions as well as being a place of meetings.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde army loyal to &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; made a camp at the site of a watch tower. There, leaders of the Horde gathered and met with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they marched at Durotar.\nGeography.\nDustwallow Marsh is a vast and ancient swamp in &lt;a href=\"Central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Central Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; that is home to many old and wonderful beasts. Navigation is often extremely difficult and many adventurers have lost their way in this great jungle, where trees obscure the sunlight and &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s lie in wait, hunting those brave enough to venture close to their lairs.\nA hot, fetid swampland, Dustwallow Marsh is fed by underground springs that keep it eternally wet and muddy. Mosquitoes buzz in the air. Trees dip fronds into the waters. The climate is home to a variety of predators, including crocolisks and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Black dragons dwell in the southern end of the swamp in such profusion that the area garners the name \"Wyrmbog\". Dustwallow Marsh abuts the ocean on its east side, and the mixing of the waters makes a wide swath brackish. Off the coast there are some islands like &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; or a rocky island on which was perched the Alliance stronghold-city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; until it was destroyed by Garrosh Hellscream.\nNear the low hills that form the western edge of the Marsh separating it from the Barrens, the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s have opened their &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt; to the races of the Horde. Brackenwall serves as an essential foothold for the Horde in the marshlands.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D9\"&gt;Topographic map of Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nDustwallow Marsh is home to several characters of note. At Brackenwall Village, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mok%27Morokk\"&gt;Overlord Mok'Morokk&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in the battle against the black dragonflight.

Players can ask &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; near the bridge to switch phases, restoring Theramore and allowing questing.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"\", Dustwallow Marsh was the main map of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hatreds%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;Old Hatreds&lt;/a&gt; mission of the &lt;a href=\"Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; campaign. It is there that the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; trolls resettled after the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; navy. Besides the Darkspear village, it featured some orcish and troll outposts, such as &lt;a href=\"Mathogg\"&gt;Mathogg&lt;/a&gt;'s village. The zone had a human &lt;a href=\"Coastal%20Base\"&gt;Coastal Base&lt;/a&gt; nearby, close to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle%23In%20Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tidefury%20Cove%23In%20Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Tidefury Cove&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mulgore%23In%20Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; could also be accessed through a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; ride, the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; ogres had a &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; south, and there was a &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Outland%20Arena\"&gt;Outland Arena&lt;/a&gt;.\nDustwallow Marsh then had some wildlife which didn't appear later in \"World of Warcraft\":\nIt also had the following dungeons: &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Ancients%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tomb of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magistrates%20Temple\"&gt;Magistrates Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Den of the Lost&lt;/a&gt;, and some uninstanced monster areas such as a &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; fort, an &lt;a href=\"hydromancer\"&gt;hydromancer&lt;/a&gt;'s island, a Kul Tiran outpost led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Thornby\"&gt;Captain Thornby&lt;/a&gt;, a kobold &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt; and a bronze dragon's lair.\nThe unnamed &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Village\"&gt;Stonemaul village&lt;/a&gt; was its own sub-map. The tribe's &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s lived in the upper part of the settlement and maintained their own &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Shop\"&gt;Magic Shop&lt;/a&gt;. The village was also home to a grand ogre &lt;a href=\"arena\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; and a Gauntlet valley filled with powerful monsters, including a large &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; community led by a giant &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20Chieftain\"&gt;Razormane Chieftain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20stalker\"&gt;jungle stalker&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sasquatch\"&gt;sasquatch&lt;/a&gt; living together, as well as giant &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is to be noted that, while the loading screen identified the main map of Old Hatreds as Dustwallow Marsh, the zeppelin coming back here from Mulgore identified the area as the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; while the zeppelin going to the Stonemaul village designated this new area as simply \"Dustwallow\".\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nDustwallow Marsh was once a high plain filled with herd animals that thrived on the tall grasses. Then came the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and the plain was smashed down into a sundered valley. The water table bled up into the ruined landscape, creating the great marsh that exists today.\nGeography.\nDustwallow is a temperate to hot watery swamp. Dustwallow Marsh is located southeast of the Barrens and north of Thousand Needles. The swamp curls to the east, forming a bay around the island of Theramore. Dustwallow is a flood plain fed by underground springs and surrounded by the dry savannas of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. The marsh is eternally wet, muddy, and hot, unfit for proper settlements and a haven for creatures that crave the wetness and humidity. Narrow banks of slippery mud separate endless stagnant pools and algae-choked channels, making Dustwallow a traveler\u2019s nightmare. The roads that cross the fen are muddy and treacherous, and the surrounding swamp is even more dangerous to traverse. Those who mistake the thick, wandering bogs of the marsh for solid land may fall through, only to have the floating plants close above and trap them in the brackish water. Dustwallow teems with predators that lurk just beneath the surface of every pool and skulk behind every bush. In the east, the turbid water of the marsh mixes with salt water from the sea. The rocky form of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; lies just beyond in the bay. \nThe marsh is the best way to approach Theramore by land, as jagged rocks outside the bay make sailing directly from the goblin city of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; difficult. The marsh\u2019s southern expanse grows rockier as it approaches &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. The pools are larger and far deeper, with half-submerged rocky outcrops. Many of these rock clusters have openings that lead into cave systems. The caves are often surprisingly dry and serve as lairs for a variety of beasts. Some conjecture exists whether the caves are interconnected with the underground river that keeps the swamp submerged or if they might even extend out to the sea.\nInhabitants.\nThe hundreds of shallow pools that comprise the marsh hold creatures ranging from massive plant eating kodo beasts to ambushing packs of raptors to territorial water-loving murlocs. The saltwater swamp of east Dustwallow is a popular breeding area for the murloc packs. Indeed, the waters teem with aquatic creatures of all sorts. Humans and murlocs drag nets down the channels to harvest gigantic mudfish, but also pull in everything from &lt;a href=\"alligator\"&gt;alligator&lt;/a&gt;s to eels. Poisonous snakes hang from the trees, and some of the larger specimens are known to drag the unwary up into the branches. Of course, these dangers are nothing compared to those of Dustwallow\u2019s southern region. The rocky outcroppings common to this area are ideal lairs for black dragons, and those creatures are so common in the area that it has earned the name \"Wyrmbog\".\nSpeculation.\nIn \"\", the distinctions between Dustwallow Marsh, the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; are blurry. Even though the level &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hatreds%20%28WC3%20Orc%29\"&gt;Old Hatreds&lt;/a&gt; is said to take place in Dustwallow, it includes a land path to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; (although Rexxar travels to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s camp on a zeppelin from Orgrimmar to the Barrens at first). Regional borders and the locations of settlements were evidently changed around with the release of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". As such, many of Dustwallow's locations such as the Darkspear camp and its denizens may have been &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned to be somewhere else. Alternatively, the camp may have been abandoned and or destroyed.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Navigation is often extremely difficult and many adventurers have lost their way in this great jungle, where trees obscure the sunlight and &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"crocolisk\"&gt;crocolisk&lt;/a&gt;s lie in wait, hunting those brave enough to venture close to their lairs.\nA hot, fetid swampland, Dustwallow Marsh is fed by underground springs that keep it eternally wet and muddy. Mosquitoes buzz in the air. Trees dip fronds into the waters. The climate is home to a variety of predators, including crocolisks and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Black dragons dwell in the southern end of the swamp in such profusion that the area garners the name \"Wyrmbog\". Dustwallow Marsh abuts the ocean on its east side, and the mixing of the waters makes a wide swath brackish. Off the coast is a rocky island, on which is perched the Alliance stronghold-city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nNear the low hills that form the western edge of the Marsh separating it from the Barrens, the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; tribe have opened their &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt; to the races of the Horde. Brackenwall serves as an essential foothold for the Horde in the marshlands.\nHistory.\nDustwallow Marsh was once a high plain filled with herd animals that thrived on the tall grasses. Then came the great &lt;a href=\"Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and the plain was smashed down into a sundered valley. The water table bled up into the ruined landscape, creating the great marsh that exists today.\nDustwallow Marsh had long been home only to wild beasts, but all this changed in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when led her people here to settle down after the battle with at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Founding the city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina's humans rapidly extended into the swamp, building fortified guard towers at important points along the road to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt;, having settled in the region after brought a regiment of them to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with his fleet, were called to war upon the humans by their newly established leader , in response to an attack by . Dustwallow Marsh saw a great skirmish between the opposing forces, leading to the death of Admiral Proudmoore and the permanent breakup of the tentative peace between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps it is because of extreme terrain conditions that neither the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has succeeded in establishing an extensive presence in the area. Located on the rocky tip of the peninsula on the eastern shore, the citadel of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; is the home of and a great bastion of the Alliance. The gleaming walls of this bastion, however, often serve to contain the Alliance, and its presence does not extend far beyond them, despite a number of scattered checkpoints and towers that dot the road leading to &lt;a href=\"The%20Barrens\"&gt;The Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Theramore Isle's military has recently been dwindling, partly due to the ever-increasing number of desertions, although why so many people have chosen to forsake their place with the Theramore garrison remains a mystery.\nDespite bordering on Horde-controlled territory, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; presence in Dustwallow Marsh is equally marginal and is largely confined to &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest. Founded by the Stonemaul ogres and ruled by the iron fist of their leader, , Brackenwall Village is the only vestige of the Horde in the area. As the Stonemaul ogres do not generally seem to take much interest in the outside world, much of the area between the bastion of Theramore Isle and the Horde settlement remains wild and untamed, with even the road leading to the Barrens rapidly falling into disrepair. \nThough neither faction controls a significant portion of Dustwallow Marsh, covert skirmishes between the Alliance and Horde have become common, in spite of the official truce that is maintained in the region. There have been reports of Brackenwall Village taking military action against the covert Theramore infiltrators, who have been spotted to the east of the village. Other sources indicate that a number of Horde spies have been murdered or simply disappeared while attempting to infiltrate Theramore. Clandestine activities on both sides continue to this day and are more likely to escalate into a full-fledged covert conflict than cease completely. \nIn the south of the marsh, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; has established a presence. Consequently, these regions of the swamp have come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmurk\"&gt;Dragonmurk&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmbog\"&gt;Wyrmbog&lt;/a&gt;. Until recently, the Stonemaul ogres lived in Stonemaul Village in this region in relative peace. The &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; assumed leadership of their tribe some time ago and forged an alliance between the Stonemaul and the Horde. The Black Dragonspawn attacked the village in a terrible rout and the surviving Stonemaul ogres were forced to retreat to Brackenwall. They have sworn revenge on the usurpers. It is said that this wilderness is also home to , a great dragon and the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, although few adventurers have ever ventured into her lair and lived to tell the tale.\nGeography.\nDustwallow is a temperate to hot watery swamp.

When he returns after helping &lt;a href=\"Stephanie%20Turner\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"John%20Turner\"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt;, Duthorian gives them a &lt;a href=\"Symbol%20of%20Life\"&gt;Symbol of Life&lt;/a&gt; to see if they are powerful enough to focus one of the Light's greatest gifts, then sends them to save his friend &lt;a href=\"Gazin%20Tenorm\"&gt;Gazin Tenorm&lt;/a&gt; recently attacked by some &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Heroes%27%20Vigil\"&gt;Heroes' Vigil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the paladin adventurer returned after confirming Gazin's condition and saving the life of &lt;a href=\"Henze%20Faulk\"&gt;Henze Faulk&lt;/a&gt;, while allowing the dwarves to recover the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Script\"&gt;Defias Script&lt;/a&gt; and prove to the King that he Defias have infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Elwynn\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt;, Duthorian congratulated them on passing his test, becoming worthy of being ready for one of the paladin's greatest honors: &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;the power of resurrection&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuthorian is also in charge of passing the test of valor for promising new paladins, announcing that it should not be taken lightly because it could cost them their lives. Once certain that the paladin adventurer was ready, he sent them to &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Stilwell\"&gt;Daphne Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to protect her against the Defias.\nWhen the paladin adventurer returned, assuring Daphne was safe, Duthorian rewarded them with the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Bastion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and taught them the ability &lt;a href=\"Sense%20Undead\"&gt;Sense Undead&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, he sent them to meet her husband &lt;a href=\"Jordan%20Stilwell\"&gt;Jordan Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to let him know that his wife is safe, before being rewarded by the blacksmith who created a worthy weapon for them, the &lt;a href=\"Verigan%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Verigan's Fist&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, Duthorian is the one who rewards the paladin adventurer for their dedication to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20Light\"&gt;Church of Light&lt;/a&gt; and Stormwind by teaching them the ability &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Warhorse\"&gt;Summon Warhorse&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Daithoran Rall moves to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a Knight of the Silver Hand for the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nYou will be tested many times by the darkness that surrounds our lands, &lt;name&gt;. But to ensure you are always prepared, we will often ask tasks of you so you are at the height of your own power.\nGo with the Light, and remain virtuous."}

The race is split into various different &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, with the three most predominant being led by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; hold the majority of the mountainous &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; region in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; make their homes within &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and around their former home of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; hold parts of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; from within their subterranean city of &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge&lt;/a&gt;, and are spread throughout the surrounding regions of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, including areas of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; and other parts of Khaz Modan. The &lt;a href=\"Frost%20dwarf\"&gt;Frost dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, make their home within the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, in their mountain hold of &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt;.\nDwarves are short and stout creatures. They are shorter than &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s but taller than &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, taking advantage of their size when possible and relying on their robustness and strength when not. The average dwarf is steady, observant and composed both during work and combat, yet able to rage with fierce zeal and persistence when the situation calls for it. While a dwarf prefers to plan forward to overcome challenges, many of them easily lose their temperament and self-restraint when exposed to conditions stirring their feelings and concerns.\nIn past ages, the dwarves rarely left the safety of their mountain fortresses, spending their time on refining metal and stone into powerful weapons and beautiful jewelry. However, when the call to battle sounded, they rose up to defend their friends and allies with unmatched courage and valor. King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; dwarves to becoming one of the most staunch members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin and evolution.\nThe dwarves derive from the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, a prototype race of humanoid creatures consisting of living stone. The earthen were created by the original &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s. These keepers were created by the titan &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; in order to provide the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; an army to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, which had swarmed the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and threatened to corrupt the nascent &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; within. After the great war that saw the titan-forged victorious, the titan-forged keepers &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; created two mighty machines, the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;; the former being what would be used to craft the next generation of titan-forged including the Earthen using a so-called \"&lt;a href=\"subterranean%20being%20matrix\"&gt;subterranean being matrix&lt;/a&gt;\". \nThe titan-forged's earliest designs for the Earthen were far too ambitious, however, leading to the creation of &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, savage creatures made of earth. Unable to bring themselves to destroy these misbegotten creations, &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; sealed them away within &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, a subterranean vault meant to act as a stasis chamber for the troggs. Despite this, many troggs still escaped anyway, some to &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, others to wander Azeroth. The second design yielded the craggy and kindhearted Earthen, who were far more acceptable to their needs. The titan-forged were tasked with specific roles in ordering and protecting Azeroth, with the Earthen tasked with crafting mountains and carving out the deep places of the world. \nAfter the betrayal of the keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and the tainting of the Forge of Wills with the Curse of Flesh, which was causing destabilization of new titan-forged to become soft and mortal creatures, the Earthen tunneled into the deep places throughout Azeroth and eventually encountered the troggs, battling them for supremacy within the depths of the planet. They were set upon the armies of &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt;, led by the giants &lt;a href=\"Ignis\"&gt;Ignis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt;, who assailed the earthen within their underground lairs and caught them entirely off guard and were wholesale slaughtered. Many survivors retreated to find the aid of Archaedas, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, and Ironaya, who had evaded Loken's wrath unlike the other keepers. Tyr led the bravest earthen into their cavernous homes and drove out the Winterskorn, pushing them back and preventing their dominion over the Storm Peaks. They would later battle with the keepers as the Winterskorn enslaved the &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s and shattered the Earthen's advances. Eventually, Tyr called upon his &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; allies, who crushed the Winterskorn and sent the vrykul into a timeless sleep. After this, Tyr took the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, and as many titan-forged as he could find, with him to the south to not only evade Loken's wrath but to use the discs to study Loken and find a way to fight against him. Of this group were most of the surviving earthen, friendly vrykul who had been afflicted with the Curse of Flesh, and a large deal of &lt;a href=\"Mechagnome\"&gt;Mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s. As they fled, the titan-forged were beset by &lt;a href=\"C%27thraxxi\"&gt;C'thraxxi&lt;/a&gt; sent by Loken to retrieve the discs and prevent the unraveling of his plans. Staying behind to fight them, Tyr was slain alongside one of his pursuers known as &lt;a href=\"Zakazj\"&gt;Zakazj&lt;/a&gt;, while the other, &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;, fled into the northern mountains. The vrykul stayed behind around Tyr's massive silver fist, renaming the land &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, and the remaining keepers Archaedas and Ironaya continued south with the discs, the earthen, and the mechagnomes. They eventually stopped at the easternmost vault of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Uldaman, expanding the facility and using it to house the discs. However, the Earthen had begun to show signs of the Curse as the vrykul had, and the bulk of their race requested to be put into slumber by Archaedas until a cure could be found. All the while the mechagnomes remained awake to watch over them alongside a small group of Earthen.\nNot all Earthen were within Uldaman, however, with some remaining by Ulduar, others were rallied by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; to resist against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. These earthen clans were led by &lt;a href=\"Dungard%20Ironcutter\"&gt;Dungard Ironcutter&lt;/a&gt;, who acted as spokesman for the earthen clans. When the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; imploded at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; 10,000 years ago, causing the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the still waking earthen were deeply affected, feeling the pain of the earth as if it were their own. They retreated to the places of their origin \u2014 the titan cities of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and hibernated. This left the Mechagnomes as the final caretakers of Uldaman, and over time, many began to leave or break down until there was a final mechagnome left. Knowing her time was short, she used the last of her energy to activate the hibernation chambers so as to spare the Earthen from being forgotten forever in the vaults, perishing once this was completed.\nWhen they awoke, many of them found that their powers over stone and earth had waned and that their rocky hide had softened to smooth skin. Emerging, these now flesh earthen made their way out of the titan city and eventually built &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, the surface of which they conquered from the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s. When the Earthen awoke, they called themselves dwarves, although the night elves had already used it as a derogatory term for earthen before the War of the Ancients. They held onto residual ties to their titan-forged heritage, naming their land &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Mountain of Khaz\", after the titan Khaz'goroth, and established their mighty nation that stretched beneath the mountains. There within Khaz Modan, they also made contact with the descendants of the mechagnomes, the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and formed a natural kinship with them; aiding them with the construction of their great city of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis transformation along with other factors have created several different kinds of dwarves. Sometimes the differences derive from different ways of living and philosophy, but often they manifest themselves in the amount of change a dwarf has evolved from the earthen. Some dwarves, like the ones living in Ironforge, has undergone a rather complete transformation (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt;, see \"The Explorer's League\" below), becoming fully fleshy creatures. Not all earthen experienced being affected by the Curse of Flesh, with some still consisting of soil and stone, such as the few remaining &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; earthen found in Uldaman and the earthen of Ulduar found in Northrend.\nWaterfalls of magma and bountiful supplies of metallic ores allowed the denizens of Ironforge to become masters of smithing and weaponry.\nFriendly contact with other races.\nWhile the dwarves in Northrend stayed rather inactive and never ventured far away from Ulduar, the dwarves emerging from Uldaman traveled across much of the world and interacted with many other races. They encountered the humans ca. 1,800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and at the same time the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; as the elves and humans were already allies. &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, strong supporters of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor Empire&lt;/a&gt;, had developed mighty armies that explored the mountainous southern lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this period that humans first met the ancient race of dwarves and traveled to their cavernous subterranean city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The humans and dwarves shared many secrets of metalsmithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling. Interaction between the dwarves and the humans increased, and the two races soon became allies. The humans also introduced the dwarves to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dwarves and gnomes often worked together on great works of engineering. They were impressed with the ingenuity and quickness of their smaller \"kin\" (for they had (correctly) assumed that the gnomes had a &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;similar origin&lt;/a&gt; as themselves). Since this union began, the gnomes and dwarves have often been treated as one faction instead of two.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nBy the time of the trade with the various human city-states to the north, the dwarves, led by High King &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, had three powerful factions brooding within the city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt; was the largest of the three factions, having controlled the military and mercantile classes (as well as claiming a distant blood tie to the Anvilmar family), the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; who controlled the foothills of the mountain with the most resilient of mountaineers, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"Thaurissan%20family\"&gt;Thaurissan family&lt;/a&gt;, who lived in the shadows of the mountain and held a strong penchant for political scheming as well as having cornered the gem market of the dwarves. When High King Modimus died, violence broke out into a civil war which resulted in the victorious Bronzebeard clan keeping Dun Morogh, the Wildhammers settling in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, and the Dark Irons settling in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and founding the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;kingdom of Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 named after their leader. Now king, &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; also granted the &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar%20family\"&gt;Anvilmar family&lt;/a&gt; a permanent seat on the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Senate of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, so as to avoid making enemies of the family he deposed.\nThe Dark Irons remained bitter about their loss for years, and eventually attacked both kingdoms all at once to prevent one from coming to the other's aid. This backfired, however, as Khardros and Madoran put their differences aside and united against the Dark Irons regardless. &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; led his army to Ironforge and was ultimately defeated. Thaurissan's wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, invaded Grim Batol and used her magic to break through the gates and lay siege to the Wildhammers. &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Grim Batol, slew the dark queen and was victorious. The clan of Ironforge then went on the offensive and marched onto the Dark Iron clan's capital. Alongside &lt;a href=\"The%20Seven\"&gt;The Seven&lt;/a&gt;, the sorcerer-thane allowed his hatred to overwhelm himself, accidentally summoning the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; of fire, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. The summoning destroyed Thaurissan, both the city and the man, and washed over the northern regions of Redridge, transforming them into the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom afar, the Wildhammers and Ironforge dwarves watched on in horror as Ragnaros destroyed the Dark Iron lands and turned back to their homes. Madoran and his dwarves rebuilt Ironforge in the years that followed. Madoran offered the Wildhammer dwarves a place in Ironforge as they had in years past, though Khardros was too prideful to accept. Unfortunately, Modgud's magic had made the Wildhammer homeland uninhabitable, so they left and migrated north and settled in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and founded the city of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, while others settled within the region of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Wildhammers became more bonded with nature and learned to ride the mighty &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s, the creatures becoming emblematic of Wildhammer culture. Following the two passing away, a monument was built to king Madoran and Khardros within the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Valley of Kings&lt;/a&gt; to watch over the Dark Iron lands; alongside the arches of the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; being created to symbolize that Wildhammers and Ironforge dwarves would never raise arms to one another again. Under enslavement of Ragnaros, the Dark Irons established a new capital within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;, brooding on their hatred for the rest of their kind.\nThe coming of the Horde and the Alliance.\nSome dwarves aided the humans during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; negotiated with the Dark Irons who gave the Old Horde the upper levels of their home. Khaz Modan was besieged by the rampaging &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; that was heading north. The proud dwarves of Ironforge made their stand alongside their gnomish cousins. Inch by inch, the Horde claimed Khaz Modan; though the dwarves and gnomes made it difficult as the Horde forced their way through the territory. Eventually, the twin-race host was forced to split as both races retreated to their respective capitals, with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the orcish Horde, committed his forces to what he saw the greater threat of the two, Ironforge. Unlike with the rest of Khaz Modan, the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;siege of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; was unsuccessful, with nearly every resident of the city taking up an axe to defend their home. By the end of the siege, ten orcs were slain for every dwarf felled, and Orgrim called off the attack to surround both Gnomeregan and Ironforge, instead of conquering them, leaving the Bleeding Hollow clan to this task. Khaz Modan was the prize, and its resources were soon being mined by the Blackrock clan to serve the Horde's needs.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the humans banded together under the banner of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt;. When the races such as the dwarves and gnomes arrived north in refugee droves, the Council was shocked. Moved by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, the Council united with the dwarves and gnomes to create the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After a time, the bloodline of the Arathi was called upon by the Alliance's supreme commander, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance as well. United against the Horde, the four races battled throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; as the Horde also claimed the mountain citadel of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, using it to imprison the Aspect &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. As the war raged on, the Horde eventually breached into the northern reaches atop &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragon\"&gt;their dragons&lt;/a&gt; and with their mighty &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ically infused armies. Formerly without question, the enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; ravaged the Alliance's forces until thunderous wings suddenly began to ravage the Horde's rear lines. Having drawn too close to the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer dwarves, led by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; rode atop their gryphons with their &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s, decimating the Horde. With their only battle ready dragons having been sent off to guide the orcish fleet north, the Orcs were incapable of defeating the dwarves' hit and run tactics, leading to Doomhammer assailing Aerie Peak itself in an effort to subjugate the Wildhammer. As this went on, Orgrim split his forces and headed north, realizing that the dwarves were only concerned with defending their home. The Alliance soon arrived, aiding the Wildhammers in defeating the orcs; the attack having changed the Wildhammer isolationist point of view, leading to them joining the Alliance as well. The Wildhammers informed the Alliance that the Horde had slipped to the north, evading their army, and Lothar continued to pursue them.\nThe gnomes and dwarves worked together often with their engineering feats. Their frequent collaborations resulted in the creation of some of the Alliance's most amazing devices and weapons. Thus, the union has served the Alliance well; supplying Alliance armies with heavy artillery &lt;a href=\"mortar\"&gt;mortar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;s, mechanical contraptions, &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s. One of the most important events that strengthened this friendship was the building of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, which both races contributed to the city's construction.\nAftermath.\nAs the war soured for the Horde and they lost more and more ground, they were eventually defeated and pushed out of Khaz Modan; forced to retreat all the way back to Blackrock Spire. The Bleeding Hollow was unable to continue dominion over the snow-capped hills of Khaz Modan, and for the first time since the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; had begun, the races of the Alliance were fully united. When the Horde was finally defeated and the Alliance sought to subjugate Draenor, the dwarves continued with this, notably, led by Kurdran Wildhammer who headed through the portal with the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the interim of the Second and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s, heroes of the Alliance aided by dragons freed &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves of Ironforge remained a steadfast ally of the crumbling Alliance of Lordaeron.\nDuring the Third War, dwarves from Ironforge and Aerie Peak aided the Alliance in their campaigns across Lordaeron, Northrend, and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; himself crafted the powerful &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen Gnomeregan was overtaken by troggs after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the gnome refugees moved to the dwarf capital of Ironforge in order to plan a counterattack.\nFollowing the Third War, the original Alliance has changed much since then, with the departure of some members like most of the high elves (now &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;) and the gaining of new members like the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; dwarves still stand as one of the core parts of the current &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Explorer's League.\nRecently, the dwarves unearthed a series of ruins that held the key to the secrets of their lost heritage. Driven to discover the truth about his people's fabled origins, King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; ordered that the dwarves shift their industry from mining and engineering to that of archaeology. Magni helped to create the famed &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge, a group utterly devoted to plumbing the secrets of the ancient world and delving out the truth of the dwarves' fabled existence.\nThe Explorer's League, or Explorer's Guild as it is also called, is a recent organization founded by dwarves seeking to uncover their past and relation to the titans. Searching for titan (and all other kinds as well, for that matter) artifacts and ruins, their dig sites, and camps can be found all over Azeroth - some are even stationed in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Information recovered is carefully analyzed and stored in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Explorers\"&gt;Hall of Explorers&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge. The shared duties of either being out on an adventure, digging in the ground for lost treasures, or sitting home in Ironforge while filing reports and schedules have given the Explorer's League an effective system with a rapid development. Information recovered increases all the time, and so does the League's members. \nThe Explorer's League was founded before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. A group of dwarves is found in &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;, excavating its ruins. Additionally, a new area of Ironforge was financed in order to house the League's work. As much of the information about the titans was lost during the earthen's slumber after the Great Sundering, the information has to be gathered all over again from relics and data the titans left behind.\nBecoming a member of the League is not an easy task. It requires the applicant (which nearly always is a dwarf) to possess supreme skills in everything from the recognition of mines and herbs to map-making and geography. The League's most profound member is &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, a dwarven explorer who has seen nearly all corners of the world, which has granted him quite the insight in the dwarves' past.\nWhile the dwarves' allies (such as the humans and the gnomes) do not share as much motivation for this project as the dwarves do, they still support and aid the organization. Not only does the League provide much information about distant areas and cultures, but several goldmines have also been found during the League's excavations. The humans have also found a greater interest in the League's activity as a result of encounters with the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend, which are the progenitors of humans. Apparently, humans seem to (although somewhat indirectly) derive from the titans as well.\nThe League's struggle to gain knowledge of the titans has not only resulted in a better understanding of the world, but it has also unlocked one of the dwarves' ancient abilities - &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;Stoneform&lt;/a&gt;. This ability lets the dwarves turn their skin into stone, becoming similar to the earthen for a short period of time. While this ability is already useful against effects such as poison, the dwarves believe that this is only the first step in reclaiming their earthen-powers.\nSituation before the Cataclysm.\nThe dwarves are spread over all of Azeroth and Outland, helping their friends with everything from slaying monsters to seeking for treasures. Their talent of forging metals and ore have had a large impact on their culture and style of living - their cities consists of enormous forges and seething &lt;a href=\"Foundry\"&gt;foundries&lt;/a&gt; accompanied by enchanted anvils and tools for handling molten ore, such as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt;. Runes and various shapes create intricate borders and ornaments adorning their constructs and architecture, possibly inspired by the runes passed down to them from the titans.\nDwarves are aligned with all kinds of organizations and associations. One may divide them into two groups; those who serve the Alliance one way or the other, and those who do not. \nThe majority of dwarves serve the Alliance. This includes the Ironforge, Wildhammer and Frostborn dwarves. The Ironforge ones are those most populous, found as everything from guards within Ironforge to soldiers on the frontlines against whatever the Alliance is fighting. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; are also often found as soldiers for the Alliance, but many of them spend their time at their home in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. The frostborn dwarves are the least active kind of dwarf within the Alliance, only found at their home, &lt;a href=\"Frosthold\"&gt;Frosthold&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; where they seem to be doing next to nothing. A large part of the Alliance's dwarves are also as mentioned dedicated to the Explorer's League, differing from many of the other dwarfs in the Alliance as the goals of the league (discover the secrets of the titans) and the Alliance (kill whatever threatens the nation of humans and their allies) are rather different. Still, they work together, suppressing their enemies and aiding their allies while revealing the secrets of the world. The Alliance has been deeply affected by their dwarf-members since the humans began it - known for firing flaming gunshots and cannonballs at the enemy during the war while drinking ale and beer in surplus amounts during peace, dwarves have affected the Alliance's style of warfare and culture.\nDwarves not allied with the Alliance includes the Dark Iron dwarves and various dwarves working for different organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co\"&gt;Venture Co&lt;/a&gt;, pirates, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Of these, only the dark irons resemble a \"true\" faction of dwarves. In the other cases, the dwarf could be swapped out with any random creature also aligned with the said faction, such as a &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, without any relevant change occurring. Their goals and desires differ from most other dwarves, making them freelancing individuals following whatever seemed more profitable.\nCataclysm.\nWhen freak natural disasters began rocking much of Azeroth just prior to the Cataclysm, the dwarven lands were not spared from the calamitous upheavals. A series of violent quakes tore through areas surrounding Ironforge, reducing settlements to rubble and taking the lives of many innocent dwarves in the process. To glean answers as to the troubling state of the world, King Magni selflessly underwent a mystic ritual to commune with the earth. The archaic ceremony, however, had an unexpected effect: Magni was transformed into diamond and became fused to the depths of Ironforge itself.\nIn the power vacuum that followed, his estranged daughter, Moira, who had married into the much despised Dark Iron clan, briefly claimed Ironforge's throne and effectively locked down the city. If not for the intervention of King Varian Wrynn of Stormwind and his son, Prince Anduin, her brash actions might have sparked another civil war. With Varian's guidance, control of Ironforge has since been divided equally among the Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron clans through the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Yet as bitterness and prejudice fester among the clans, the council's ability to govern as one remains uncertain.\nThe representatives of each dwarven clan in the council is:\nMists of Pandaria.\nNumbers of dwarves followed the Alliance and took part in their campaign against the Horde, attacking them in &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter discovering the Zandalari had turned their focus on &lt;a href=\"Blood%20in%20the%20Snow\"&gt;rallying the Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; tribe of Dun Morogh against Ironforge, Varian asked the Council to help repel the invaders. Both Muradin and Falstad declined, fearing if they left Ironforge to fight the trolls, the Dark Irons would take over the city. Only Moira Thaurissan offered aid, stating that the Dark Irons would prove their loyalty to the Council, Ironforge, and the Alliance in the defense of Ironforge. Together, they defeated their enemies and returned to Ironforge to announce Moira's victory to the Council. On their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment. Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Moira Thaurissan and a contingency of dwarven troops joined the Alliance on their march upon the city, where Garrosh was ultimately defeated.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; invaded Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; sent several Dark Iron dwarves to assist the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in combating the orcs. &lt;a href=\"Hansel%20Heavyhands\"&gt;Hansel Heavyhands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; aided in the hijacking of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Worldbreaker\"&gt;Iron Worldbreaker&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the Dark Portal.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron dwarves gathered to fight the , and established a hold called &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20Rise\"&gt;Bastion Rise&lt;/a&gt; in the savage jungle.\nLegion.\nAs part of the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. It was defended by the dwarves, their Alliance allies, as well as Horde champions. Similarly, the Wildhammer dwarves in the Twilight Highlands were also attacked and were overrun.\nVarious dwarves joined the &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; halls to battle the demons during the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn the aftermath on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; plunged his weapon in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; which drawn the attention of Magni, the Speaker of Azeroth to try and heal .\nOver time, the Dark Iron clan under Moira's rule officially joined the Alliance.\nBiology.\nDwarves are squat and powerfully built. Non-dwarves might have difficulty telling males and females apart from a distance. The women are of slightly lesser build and have slightly less gruff voices, but are known for fighting with as much (if not more) determination as the men. On average, women reach a height of 4'6\" while men generally stand around 4'8\" tall, regardless of which type of dwarf they are, with most being stout to varying degrees. Some males do reach just above five feet. Their stoutness belies great swiftness and dexterity, and they are able to move with a stealth that most other races assume impossible for such stocky beings.\nDespite their small stature, dwarves have incredibly dense and muscular bodies, with especially hard and muscular torsos. They pack a lot of fight in their compact bodies and are able to easily carry weights that would leave many &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; struggling. The average weight for a male dwarf is around \"thirteen stone\" (about 182 pounds) and presumably slightly less for females. As a result, they don't float well and have a tendency to sink like rocks if they fall into water. However, this hasn't stopped some brave dwarves from becoming sailors.\nThe males always have beards, typically a long wild beard sometimes with hair to match. Some females sport strong beards as well, which is considered a sign of beauty among members of the race. Known examples of bearded dwarf women include two members of &lt;a href=\"Rom\"&gt;Rom&lt;/a&gt;'s company during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, who looked the same as the men in the group but hinted at being sisters; one of &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s grandmothers; and &lt;a href=\"Gubber%20Blump\"&gt;Gubber Blump&lt;/a&gt;'s cousin &lt;a href=\"Graun%20Blump\"&gt;Graun&lt;/a&gt;. The comedian &lt;a href=\"Perry%20Gatner\"&gt;Perry Gatner&lt;/a&gt;'s routine includes a joke about dwarven women shaving. Dwarves often hide things in their beards.\nDwarves are highly adaptable. They thrive in the cold mountains but seem to be equally vigorous and active in the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; or the deserts of the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. Their constitution allows them to withstand the oppressive heat of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt; without breaking a sweat, even when in full armor. It's a little known fact but dwarves, especially Dark Irons, need a lot of rest, and they have a hard time sleeping without pillows.\nCulture.\nDwarves are a strong and hardy people steeped in tradition with a zest for combat, exploration, and many a fine ale. While the monarchs of the past are honored, so, too, are the explorers that continue searching for answers regarding the mysterious origins of their race. What the dwarven people lack in height, they make up for in heart and valor. All dwarves are known for being stubborn and admiring bravery. As discovered during the first contact between dwarves and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the two races share a common love for battle and storytelling. Dwarves are fighters by nature and will do battle even to their deaths, preferring it to living as slaves, which they consider to be honorless. Like &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, they can be far more patient than humans and are able to remain alert and ready to act even after hours of waiting. A common myth among other races is that dwarves are too hard-headed to learn from their mistakes. The &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt; had heard dwarves described as thick-headed, drunken loudmouths who do nothing but unearth things that should be left hidden and only turn their faces up to the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s when they have to, but these prejudices were quickly dispelled by her friendship with &lt;a href=\"Gavvin%20Stoutarm\"&gt;Gavvin Stoutarm&lt;/a&gt; and his team.\nDwarves sometimes call themselves \"the earth folk\" and (with the apparent exception of Wildhammers) prefer solid footing, to the point of sometimes choosing walking over teleportation. They are experts at navigating through tunnels, judging their rise or fall, and determining which is the right direction to head in by studying the striations in the rock as well the traces left by other beings. They also can instinctively ferret out the best places to hide in caves. They retain their &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; ancestors' natural affinity to stoneworking and mining and are by nature fascinated with shaping gems and stone. For most of their history, they were content with remaining in their home of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and mining the mountains for riches and precious minerals. Dwarves have a strong work ethic and are highly skilled craftsmen, especially metalworkers. While they produce many implements of war, they are adept at working with softer metals as well. When it comes to masonry and engineering, none are more skilled than they at delving into the bowels of the earth and shaping it to their purpose. Some believe that master dwarven blacksmiths have the ability to impart emotions into the weapons they create. According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, dwarves are attracted to mines.\nDwarves count their blood connections in many ways. The most prominent of these is the &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;, which they consider vital to their personal identities. The leader of a dwarven clan is its guardian. However, within and without the clan there are also other bindings. Of these, the ritual of &lt;a href=\"Gwyarbrawden\"&gt;Gwyarbrawden&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in which participants vow to go to any length to avenge each other's deaths\u2014is foremost among common warriors, but it is a part of dwarven society that very few outsiders know about.\nCuisine.\nDwarves love to eat and drink. Their meals always consists of filling, \"stick-to-your-ribs\" fare washed down with plenty of beer, but is not known for its succulent taste in either high elven or human realms. , consisting of oatmeal and &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; innards (specifically the sheep's lungs, liver and heart) and seasoned with &lt;a href=\"Mild%20Spices\"&gt;mild spices&lt;/a&gt;, is a common dwarven meal. Haggis and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; pale ale is a dwarven favorite, and has been the lunch of champions for over 1,000 years. &lt;a href=\"Spice%20Bread\"&gt;Spice bread&lt;/a&gt; is another longtime favorite in Ironforge. Dwarves are fond of &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt; meat. &lt;a href=\"Thelsamar\"&gt;Thelsamar&lt;/a&gt; is known for its &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Sausage\"&gt;blood sausages&lt;/a&gt;, made from &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; meat. The &lt;a href=\"Arctic%20Char\"&gt;arctic char&lt;/a&gt;, which only dwells in the cold waters of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, is the most popular type of fish in Ironforge. &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Water%20Crayfish%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Crayfish&lt;/a&gt; and are also known to be part of dwarven cuisine. During &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;'s diplomatic visit to Ironforge, they were served braised boar meat with hearty brown bread to sop the juices, vegetables roasted with honey, and a mountain of pastries as dessert. Unless there is a matter of immediate life or death, custom demands that one takes the time to digest especially hearty meals with a pipe, brandy, or more desserts.\nFaith.\nMany Ironforge dwarves worship the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, having been introduced to it by the humans. Their &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s (members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s (members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;) are mainly present in Ironforge's &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Mysteries\"&gt;Hall of Mysteries&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome dwarves worship the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The early dwarves who first emerged from &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; retained faint memories of their &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; heritage and worshipped &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; as their \"titan father\". When they arrived at &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, they crafted an altar for him in what would later become the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt;. Ever consumed with the research of their origins, the dwarves choose to celebrate the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Feast of Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt; as a recognition of &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Winter\"&gt;Greatfather Winter&lt;/a&gt;, whom they consider to be the personification of one of the titans. Much as they claim descent from the titans, they consider their snowy home of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; to be the prime example of Greatfather Winter's blessings. Some dwarves use \"Gods\" or \"By the gods\" as exclamations. The dwarf &lt;a href=\"Durgan%20One-God\"&gt;Durgan One-God&lt;/a&gt; is notable for having disavowed most of the titans and believing that &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; is the one true god who created everything. By Durgan's own admission, no one else shares this faith with him.\nThe Wildhammers practice &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. Whether they also have Light followers is unknown.\nDuring their long enslavement by &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Irons worshipped the Firelord as a &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;. A number of Dark Irons wield the Holy Light as priests and paladins.\nBronzebeard dwarves generally distrust &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s. According to &lt;a href=\"Gakin%20the%20Darkbinder\"&gt;Gakin the Darkbinder&lt;/a&gt;, not many dwarves choose the path of the warlock, even going so far as to call a dwarven warlock \"somewhat of an anomaly\".\n&lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;Funerary practices&lt;/a&gt;.\nBronzebeards prefer to bury their dead, returning them to the ground that so benefits their race. They consider it both an honor and a repayment. Some dwarves seal their deceased in tombs, but those with a concern about the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; might prefer cremation. Bronzebeards believe that when they die, they join the ghosts of their comrades in \"the great halls of the afterlife\".\nThe Wildhammers of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; honor their dead heroes in &lt;a href=\"Kirthaven\"&gt;Kirthaven&lt;/a&gt; before burying them with their &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s atop &lt;a href=\"Thunderstrike%20Mountain\"&gt;Thunderstrike Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. There they are believed to spend eternity at one with the sky. The Wildhammers also believe that their dead ride into the hereafter to join \"the halls of [their] ancestors\" and that their spirits \"fight proud through eternity\". Wildhammers are known for honoring their dead with epic mourning songs. When speaking of a dead person, they sometimes slap a fist over their heart as a sign of respect.\nRelations.\nEver since their first meeting dwarves have developed a strong friendly relationship with the gnomes, with the two races recognizing a kinship between each other, to the point that many dwarves call the gnomes their cousins. The two races frequently exchange with and help the other, with gnomes having taught science and engineering to dwarves while dwarves taught them metallurgy and stoneworking in return, and helped them lay the foundations of Gnomeregan.\nDuring the Second War dwarves and gnomes worked together to fight the Old Horde's invasion off until each race was forced to retreat to its respective capital, and after the Third War king Magni Bronzebeard welcomed the gnomes refugees into Ironforge after the loss of Gnomeregan to the Troggs and Sicco Thermaplugg's treachery.\nDwarves are also strong allies with humans, with the two races having ties to go back to Arathor Empire, and the bells of Capital City and Stormwind City's respective cathedrals having been forged and given by the dwarves of Ironforge as a token of friendship to the kingdoms of Lordaeron and Stormwind. This bond has been strengthened after the Alliance of Lordaeron saved the dwarves during the Second War, by liberating them of the Old Horde's siege, which prompted them to pledge their allegiance to the Alliance and to offer military and technological support as well as supplying weaponry and armors to their human allies. Even after Quel'Thalas, Gilneas, and Stromgarde's departures, Magni Bronzebeard supported the Alliance, stating that the dwarves owed a debt that they could never repay to it.\nGeneology.\nDwarves' appearances differ depending on the type of dwarf and where they are from. Dwarves from the Eastern Kingdoms derive from the Earthen, the stone-wrought titan-forged who shaped the deep places of Azeroth in ancient times.\nUnits.\nThe dwarven playable units or classes.\nIn the RPG.\nA modification created from the earthen were referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Series%20Two\"&gt;Series Two&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe dwarves had followed the humans to Kalimdor as soldiers against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and in the aftermath of this war the dwarves discovered they might have been created by powerful beings to shape the earth. Ruins in Kalimdor suggested that the dwarves' past may have been connected to the titans, and teams of prospectors, excavators and archaeologists were quickly assembled and dispatched to all corners of the world in order to investigate.\nSpeculation.\nIt's assumed that dwarves have better eyesight in the dark than most races, due to living in the dark mountains ever since their awakening from the titan ruins."}

Obsessed with the workings of the Titans, the dwarves retrieved their creators' mystical tablets from the fabled city of Ulduar. Activating one such tablet, King Magni Bronzebeard fell prey to a terrible curse that fused his statue-like form into the diamond heart of Ironforge itself. To compound this tragedy, Magni's estranged daughter, Moira, arrived claiming her father's throne for herself and for her infant Dark Iron son. To avert civil war, the dwarves created the Council of Three Hammers, an uneasy coalition that would share power amonst the three clans. Now, with political upheaval arising in the kingdom and the Great Cataclysm ravaging the surrounding lands, the future of Ironforge falls to brave dwarves like you.\"\nHistory.\nThe stoic dwarves of Ironforge spent countless generations mining treasures from deep within the earth. Secure in their impregnable stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves rarely ventured beyond the wintry peaks of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, when the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and set out to conquer the human, elven, and dwarven lands, the dwarves offered to join the Grand &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The resilient and ingenious dwarves proved to be the backbone of the Alliance forces and helped usher in victory after victory. \nRecently the dwarves unearthed a series of ruins that held the key to the secrets of their lost heritage. Driven to discover the truth about his people\u2019s fabled origins, King Magni Bronzebeard ordered that the dwarves shift their industry from mining and engineering to that of archaeology. Magni helped to create the famed &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge, a group utterly devoted to plumbing the secrets of the ancient world and delving out the truth of the dwarves\u2019 fabled existence. An integral part of the Grand Alliance, the rugged dwarven armies have been called away to battle the merciless &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in faraway lands. In these perilous times, the defense of the mountain kingdom falls to brave dwarves like you. The spirits of the dwarven kings watch over you, and the very mountains are your strength. The future of your people is in your hands.\nArchaeology and exploration.\nDue to recent discoveries that uncovered fragments of their ancient origins (for example, the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;), the dwarves have undergone a remarkable transformation. The discovery convinced the dwarves that the mighty &lt;a href=\"titans\"&gt;titans&lt;/a&gt; created them from stone when the world was young. They feel that their destiny is now to search the world for more signs and proof of their enchanted heritage and to rediscover the Titans' hidden legacies.\nTo this end, the dwarves have sent out archaeological teams to all ends of the world in the hopes of discovering new insights into their shrouded past. These journeys have led to dwarven excavation sites all over the known world, some of which serve as outposts and some of which serve as potential hunting grounds for the enemies of the dwarven race.\nThe dwarves were stout allies of the humans during the Second War, joining the Alliance of Lordaeron after their homeland of Khaz Modan was invaded. Holed deep in their mountainside city-fortress of Ironforge, the dwarves have managed to weather both the Horde invasion and the plague. Still, they are long-lived, slow and careful folk, and children are a rare blessing to them. The dwarves of Ironforge number a mere 60,000.\nStill, their tendency to explore is impressive. If about two thirds of the surviving humans now live in the capital city of Stormwind, less then a third of the dwarves are in Ironforge. In fact, there are more dwarves in the dwarven section of Stormwind than Ironforge itself. Now Ironforge is home to the Gnomish population as well, after they fled from their devastated city of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter.\nThe dwarves start in &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;, an area of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; closed off by mountains.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Because both the base damage and the additional damage is multiplied, the advantage of slow, hard-hitting weapons are even greater.\nHowever, it still isn't usable in Berserker Stance, and it is still only possible for a warrior to have one Rend on a target active. Because of this a warrior may only have the opportunity to deliver one or two rends on a target before the battle is over, and this means an investment in rend needs to take into account how much it is used compared to, for instance, &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Strike\"&gt;Heroic Strike&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Strike\"&gt;Heroic Strike&lt;/a&gt; is worse than Rend from a purely rage-to-damage viewpoint, it is among the only burst damage and high threat attacks available at low levels. A low level warrior going the way of the Arms may choose to invest in improved Heroic Strike early and re-invest in Rend later when Heroic Strike is used less often."}

The same applies for PvP encounters, for example preventing a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;ing after a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, it is the best way for a protection warrior to pull a spellcaster back to the main party, since by silencing a spellcaster you force him to switch to melee mode.\nAdditionally, Improved Shield Bash is one of the most effective threat generators for a protection warrior. The threat caused superceeds that of &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while the rage cost is even lower than &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Improved Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;.

Bruce Banner, the Hulk, was \"David Bruce Banner\" in his TV series and Batman is Bruce Wayne thus making it an amalgamation of their names.\n&lt;a href=\"%22Dirty%22%20Larry\"&gt;\"Dirty\" Larry&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"%22Dirty%22%20Larry\"&gt;\"Dirty\" Larry&lt;/a&gt; is a Shattrath City NPC, a reference to Dirty Harry.\n&lt;a href=\"Gankly%20Rottenfist\"&gt;Gankly Rottenfist&lt;/a&gt;.\nA undead rogue NPC in Nagrand near the Nesingwary Safari that will \"gank\" a passing gnome questgiver whom you subsequently have to rescue.\nHis name, of course, is a reference to the popular term \"gank\" when a rogue (or anyone else, for that matter) attacks you by surprise.\n&lt;a href=\"R-3D0\"&gt;R-3D0&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Toshley Station sentinel robot that lies near the station. This is a reference to the \"Star Wars\" characters C3P0 and R2D2\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the Tempest Keep instances, Arcatraz may be a reference to the real life prison &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcatraz\"&gt;Alcatraz&lt;/a&gt;. For the last event of the instance, the group must fight the \"most dangerous\" creatures of Azeroth. In real life, Alcatraz was a prison for the most dangerous criminals. In addition, the questline to obtain the key to Arcatraz is titled 'How to Break Into the Arcatraz'. In real life, many people tried to break out of Alcatraz, with the general consensus being that no one was successful.\n&lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area which in itself is named after &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groom_Lake\"&gt;Area 51&lt;/a&gt;, the American military base which serves as a top secret U.S. Air Force testing facility.\nUpon entering Area 52, you are hit with a ray of light which gives a buff: \"\"The beam of light you did not see did not erase your memories.\" This is a \"Men in Black\" reference. The goblins in tuxedos standing to the sides of the gates also refer to this movie.\nThe NPCs in Gold tops and black pants are probably a nod to \"Star Trek: The Next Generation\". The Gold top (or shoulders in DS9/Voyager) denotes Engineering.\nArea 52 is also another name for the Cheyenne Mountain Complex in \"Stargate: SG-1\"\".\nSnakes on a plane!\nIn Nagrand, at Nesingwary's expedition camp, there are 2 snakes on top of the crashed airplane.\n&lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the Druids near Cenarion Thicket has gossip telling us that 'there are FOUR LIGHTS!', clearly a reference to Jean-Luc Picard in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode \"Chain of Command\" in which Picard is forced to say there are five lights while there are in fact four. Upon his rescue he turns to his captor once more and yells 'There are FOUR LIGHTS!'\n&lt;a href=\"Toshley%27s%20Station\"&gt;Toshley's Station&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Blade's Edge Mountains, the Gnome outpost &lt;a href=\"Toshley%27s%20Station\"&gt;Toshley's Station&lt;/a&gt; is a reference to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Tosche_Station\"&gt;Tosche Station&lt;/a&gt; in \"Star Wars\" where Luke Skywalker was planning to pick up some power converters. One of the quests available also consists of picking up power converters. Other \"Star Wars\" references also seen. The activity around the station is also a reference to the movie \"Starship Troopers\". The constant bug invasions, the gnomes being called Roughriders, and one of the gnomes occasionally quoting lines from the movie.\n&lt;a href=\"World%27s%20End%20Tavern\"&gt;World's End Tavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Shattrath, there's the World's End Tavern which may be a reference to the novel \"The Restaurant at the End of the Universe\" by Douglas Adams.\nThe tavern could also be referencing the \"World's End Inn\" from \"The Sandman\" comic series written by Neil Gaiman."}

The quest involves the gathering of arrows fired by nearby skeletal archer NPCs called \"Sky Darkeners\", referencing the rumors of the Persian archers being able to darken the sky with their arrows. Also in the attack against Light's Hope Chapel, there is a reference to 300 where the defenders of the sacred place are just 300 that stand against the Scourge army of 10,000.\nAC/DC.\nThe dwarven mortar team in Dun Morogh say \"I'm T.N.T.! I'm dynamite!\" which comes from the AC/DC song \"T.N.T.\" from the \"High Voltage\" album.\nThe rogue talent \"Dirty Deeds' is a reference to the song \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" from the \"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\" album.\nAce Ventura: Pet Detective.\n&lt;a href=\"Finkle%27s%20Skinner\"&gt;Finkle's Skinner&lt;/a&gt; is listed as property of &lt;a href=\"Pip%20Quickwit\"&gt;Finkle Einhorn&lt;/a&gt;, alluding the revelation in \"Ace Ventura\"- \"Finkle is Einhorn!

See this? This... is my boomstick! The 12-gauge double-barreled Remington.\"\nThere are 2 characters named &lt;a href=\"Klaatu\"&gt;Klaatu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barada\"&gt;Barada&lt;/a&gt;, but no \"Nikto\", probably due to the fact that the word is never said properly by Ash.\nApocalypse Now.\n&lt;a href=\"Colonel%20Kurzen\"&gt;Colonel Kurzen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; is based on the character Colonel Kurtz in the popular Vietnam movie \"Apocalypse Now\".\nAustin Powers.\nThere is a &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"critter\"&gt;critter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; instance named &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Bigglesworth\"&gt;Mr. Bigglesworth&lt;/a&gt;. If you kill it, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; (himself) will yell \"No!!! A curse upon you, interlopers! The armies of the Lich King will hunt you down. You will not escape your fate...\" apparently he really liked that cat. This is a reference to Dr. Evil's cat of the same name from the \"Austin Powers\" series of movies. The \"curse\" is more than likely a reference to Dr. Evil's line \"And when Mr. Bigglesworth is upset...people DIE!\"\nBambi (Disney).\nBambi, his mother, Thumper, and Flower can be seen running around the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Though, as the norm, &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt; has renamed them to &lt;a href=\"Bambina\"&gt;Bambina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mother%20of%20Bambina\"&gt;Mother of Bambina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thudder\"&gt;Thudder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Flora\"&gt;Flora&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattlestar Galactica.\nNext to the bank in Area 52, there is a goblin engineer named Xyrol. This is a reference to Galen Tyrol, the chief of the deck on \"Battlestar Galactica\".\nKara Thricestar &lt;Air Traffic Controller&gt; at the Fizzcrank Airstrip in Borean Tundra is a reference to Kara Thrace (a.k.a. Starbuck).\nBlue Oyster Cult.\nThere is a quest in Netherstorm(Outland) to return a cow bell to a cow named &lt;a href=\"Bessy\"&gt;Bessy&lt;/a&gt; and then following an escort quest back to its owner. The quest name is &lt;a href=\"Needs%20More%20Cowbell\"&gt;Needs More Cowbell&lt;/a&gt; (starts from &lt;a href=\"Thadell\"&gt;Thadell&lt;/a&gt;), which refers to a scene from \"Saturday Night Live\" starring Christopher Walken repeatedly asking for \"more cowbell.\"\nCaptain America.\nThe Paladin Talent &lt;a href=\"Avenger%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Avenger's Shield&lt;/a&gt; is a reference to Captain America (who is a member of the superhero group known as The Avengers), and his ability to ricochet his shield off of multiple targets and return to him.\nChasing Amy.\nIn Un'Goro Crater, there is a reference to Kevin Smith's movie Chasing Amy. A quest is given titled \"Chasing A-Me 01\".\nThis may also be a reference to the cyborg gorilla Amy in the 1995 film \"Congo\" because you need a mechanical part, a &lt;a href=\"Mithril%20Casing\"&gt;Mithril Casing&lt;/a&gt; to get her moving and finish the quest.\nClose Encounters of the Third Kind.\n&lt;a href=\"Innkeeper%20Remi%20Dodoso\"&gt;Innkeeper Remi Dodoso&lt;/a&gt;'s name in &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt; spells out the notes 'Re' 'Mi' 'Do' 'Do' 'So' in the scale. This is a reference to the musical theme used in the movie \"\" to communicate with the aliens which have landed on Earth. \nConan the Barbarian.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, up the mountain and behind the cave that is the back door to &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, there is a crypt. Inside it can be found the skeleton of a king on a throne, with one hand resting on the hilt of a sword. This is just like the crypt where Conan seeks refuge and finds a sword at the beginning of his adventures in the 1982 film \"Conan the Barbarian.\" It is also similar to the pose of the older Conan at the end of the film, just before the credits.\nThe Dark Crystal.\nThe Skettis NPC race located in Outland bear a striking resemblance in name, appearance and sound to the Skeksis from this 1982 Jim Henson film. Furthermore, the first boss in &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;Sethekk Halls&lt;/a&gt; will sometimes say \"Hmmmmmm...It's time to make my move!\", which is a direct quote from the scheming Chamberlain Skeksis from the film.\nDirty Jobs.\n&lt;a href=\"%22Dirty%22%20Michael%20Crowe\"&gt;\"Dirty\" Michael Crowe&lt;/a&gt; is a reference to the host of the TV show \"Dirty Jobs\", Mike Rowe.\nDisney's Aladdin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Magnificent%20Flying%20Carpet\"&gt;Magnificent Flying Carpet&lt;/a&gt;'s buff description is \"Don't you dare close your eyes\" which is clearly a reference to the movie's song \"A whole new world\" where one of the lines is \"Don't you dare close your eyes\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Frosty%20Flying%20Carpet\"&gt;Frosty Flying Carpet&lt;/a&gt;'s buff description is \"A whole new point of view\" which is another line from \"A Whole New World\".\nDragonlance.\nFound in the Old Town of Stormwind, the &lt;a href=\"Pig%20and%20Whistle%20Tavern\"&gt;Pig and Whistle Tavern&lt;/a&gt; is a reference to the inn where the Heroes of the Lance stayed in Port Balifor.\nDr. Strangelove, or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb.\nThe Horde quest in Ashenvale \"Between a Rock and a Thistlefur\" has a reference to Dr. Strangelove where \"&lt;name&gt;, we must not allow... an expansion path gap!\" is a parody of the line in the movie \"We cannot let there be a mineshaft gap!\"\nElton John.\nIn Area 52, the Experimental Pilot and an Engineering Crewmember have a discussion which contains several references to Elton John's song 'Rocket Man'. For example, the pilot says, \"This isn't the kind of place to raise your kids, it's cold and there'd be no one to raise them.\"\nExcalibur - Sword in the Stone.\nExcalibur is the mythical sword of King Arthur, sometimes attributed with magical powers or associated with the rightful sovereignty of Great Britain. Sometimes Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone (the proof of Arthur's lineage) are said to be the same weapon, but in most versions they are considered separate. The sword was associated with the Arthurian legend very early; in Welsh, the sword was called Caledfwlch.\nThe sword in the stone can be found in Nagrand on Zangar Ridge beside the road.\nFinal Fantasy VII.\nOn the northern end of Sunstrider Isle in Eversong Woods, you can find two blood elf children named Jane and Nova. This is a reference to Jenova in \"Final Fantasy VII\", who is also known as Sephiroth's \"Mother\".\nIn Dalaran, there is a flower vendor named Aerith Primrose. Her name and appearance are a reference to Aerith Gainsborough, one of the main characters from Final Fantasy VII.\nIt has also been said that the &lt;a href=\"Hawkstriders\"&gt;Hawkstriders&lt;/a&gt; that are the racial mount for Blood Elves are directly inspired by Chocobos, which have been in almost every Final Fantasy game.\nFinding Forester.\nIn Dire Maul, when you speak to Guard Fengus (after killing King Gordrok), he says \"You're Da Man Now, Dog!\" This is a quote from the movie \"Finding Forester\", in which Sean Connery says the same line. It could also be a reference to the internet site &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.ytmnd.com\"&gt;YTMND&lt;/a&gt;\nFirefly.\nIn Zangarmarsh the Alliance Master Engineer Trainer is named K. Lee Smallfry: a reference to Kaywinnit Lee \"Kaylee\" Frye, the ship's mechanic from the TV show Firefly. One of her quotes is: \"Have you seen the swamp gas? Isn't it just shiny?\" \"Shiny\" being one of the slang words in the show for \"cool\". K. Lee is also the turn-in NPC for the Strange Engine Part, which has the flavor text: \"It reads 'Capissen 38' on the bottom.\" In Firefly Kaylee comments \"And don't fly in anything with a Capissen 38 engine; they fall RIGHT out of the sky.\"\nAlso in Zangarmarsh one of the drops from the Bogflare Needlers is a Captured Firefly. The flavor text: \"Still flying...\" has been removed from the item, possibly because the items are no longer retained in bags because of the new pet system.\nForrest Gump.\nIn Stormwind, there is a flower shop named Fragrant Flowers just east of the Trade District, on the canal between it and Old Town. The man who runs it is named Bernard Gump. Just beneath his name is the title ; Thus, his full title is \"Florist Gump\", a pun on the name Forrest Gump.\nIn Auberdine (in Darkshore), there is a fisherman by the name of Gubber Blump. This is a play on Bubba Gump Shrimp.\nGone in 60 Seconds.\nThe quest in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; called \"Shizz Work\" has you digging through &lt;a href=\"felboar\"&gt;felboar&lt;/a&gt; excrement for a lost set of keys, very much like a scene from \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0187078/\"&gt;Gone in 60 Seconds&lt;/a&gt;\" (the remake with Nicholas Cage) where some of the car thieves are taking a large dog for a walk to get him to \"release\" some previously devoured Mercedes keys!\nGrand Theft Auto.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Theft%20Palomino\"&gt;Grand Theft Palomino&lt;/a&gt; is one of the Death Knight quests in the starting area. It refers to , another video game.\nHe-Man and the Masters of the Universe.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;, there is a reference to the old He-Man cartoon. The Alliance &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Battlemaster\"&gt;Battlemaster&lt;/a&gt; is named &lt;a href=\"Adam%20Eternum\"&gt;Adam Eternum&lt;/a&gt;, and stands with his sidekick, &lt;a href=\"Oric%20Coe\"&gt;Oric Coe&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a reference to Orko \u2014 and his pet, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Cat\"&gt;Battle Cat&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso in Lower City is a reference to He-Man's arch nemesis Skeletor, and is the Horde Arathi Basin Battlemaster who is named &lt;a href=\"Keldor%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Keldor the Lost&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you were to look at He-Man's pet tiger, Cringer, who becomes Battle Cat, there is a remarkable resemblance to the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Cat\"&gt;Corrupted Cat&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; in both markings and coloration. This was probably a reference that is vastly overlooked.\nAdditionally, the ore mined in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"Adamantite\"&gt;ADAMantite&lt;/a&gt; which sometimes has rare &lt;a href=\"Eternium\"&gt;ETERNIUM&lt;/a&gt; ore in it.\nHighlander.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Fray%20Island\"&gt;Fray Island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"the%20Barrens\"&gt;the Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, there is an NPC named &lt;a href=\"Klannoc%20Macleod\"&gt;Klannoc Macleod&lt;/a&gt; with the title &lt;The Islander&gt; an obvious play on Connor Mac Leod, the Highlander. He looks very similar to the TV character Duncan MacLeod (a clansman of Connor's), with long black hair, a katana, and the type of clothes Duncan would often wear.\nJeopardy.\nDealer Sadaqat &lt;Potent Potables&gt; found at &lt;a href=\"Stormspire\"&gt;Stormspire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. This is from the TV quiz show, Jeopardy.

The &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Jordan\"&gt;Staff of Jordan&lt;/a&gt; is a reference to the Stone of Jordan, a highly regarded ring from \"Diablo II\". There is a phrase in the loading tip screen that says \"There is no cow level\", another obvious reference.\nAction Jackson.\nIn the Stormspire of Netherstorm, there is a NPC known as Action Jaxon.

She's had 5 items named after her: , , , and . There is also a shop in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; (that you can't enter) that used to belong to a person named Angelista, as you can read her name on the shield hanging atop the former entrance.\nBlue Suede Shoes.\nThe drop from &lt;a href=\"Kaz%27rogal\"&gt;Kaz'rogal&lt;/a&gt; in Hyjal, and are a reference to a song by Carl Perkins (famously covered by Elvis Presley). The yellow flavor text on the item says says \"Keep Off\", and the song says \"don't step on my blue suede shoes\".\nBoomstick.\nThe , , and are all probably references to the line in \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.imdb.com/title/tt0106308/\"&gt;Army of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\": \"\"Now listen up, you primitive screwheads. See this? This... is my boomstick! The 12-gauge double-barreled Remington\". The may also be a reference to this.\nBooterang.\nThe is a reference to the 'Rifleman's Creed', a part of basic United States Marine Corps doctrine. The flavor text written in yellow is: \"This is your booterang. There are many like it but this one is yours.\"\". The first line of 'My Rifle' is \"This is my rifle. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My rifle is my best friend. It is my life...\"\nBroken Barn Door.\nThe shield &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Barn%20Door\"&gt;Broken Barn Door&lt;/a&gt; and its flavor text, \"It was open. How embarrassing,\" is likely a reference to the saying \"Your barn door is open.\" The phrase is used to tell a person the zipper on their pants is down. A broken zipper may repeatedly fall down or be impossible to zip up.\nCharlotte's Ivy and Lola's Eve (The Twin Stars).\nThe necklace could be seen as a reference to the book/movie \"Charlotte's Web\". Together and are seen as a (slightly odd) reference to the book 'Lolita' by Vladimir Nabokov. In the book, the main protagonist becomes obsessed with a young girl called Dolores (variously referred to in the novel as Dolores, Dolly, Lolita, Lola, Lo, L). The girl's mother is called Charlotte.\nCrimson Steer Energy Drink.\n is a reward from a quest in Zangarmarsh, &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20the%20Daggerfen\"&gt;Secrets of the Daggerfen&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Us%20or%20Them\"&gt;Us or Them&lt;/a&gt; for Horde. It is an obvious reference to \"Red Bull Energy Drink\"\nDawn Treaders.\n are a possible reference to the C. S. Lewis novel \"\"Voyage of the Dawn Treader\".\nDoctor in the House.\nThe book , required to learn 375 first aid skill, can be seen as a reference to \"House M.D.\", the famous TV series with Hugh Laurie. It is also likely that this is simply a reference to the phrase \"Is there a doctor in the house?\" used commonly in (vintage) film. \"Doctor in the House\"\" was a British television comedy series in the 1970s.\nEmpty Barrel &amp; Hefty Barrel.\nYou can sometimes receive an as loot from the thunderers and stompers in the northeast of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro\"&gt;Un'Goro&lt;/a&gt;, which is a reference to Donkey Kong. This could also be a reference to \"A barrel of monkeys.\". This has been continued in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; with s dropping from Hardknuckle apes in &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;.\nFight Club.\nThere is a rare mace called , Presumably in reference to the Chuck Palahniuk book of the same name. Presumably, one does not talk about it.\nFirefly.\nSeveral items are references the \"\" TV series, such as , , , and, of course, the .\nFlintlocke's Piloting Pants.\n are a reference to the WoW comic \"Flintlocke\".\nJom Gabbar.\n is a \"Dune\" reference from the book of Frank Herbert, a Sci-Fi novel. It references to the \"Gom Jabbar\", which is a poisonous needle used by the Sisterhood to test the \"humanity\" of their students. It drops from the sandworm Ouro in &lt;a href=\"TAQ\"&gt;TAQ&lt;/a&gt;\nLifelike Mechanical Toad.\nThe is a reference to Philip K. Dick\u2019s \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\". The novel is the basis for the movie \"Blade Runner\", but the toad is a reference to the novel, not the movie. In the novel, a lone android toad is discovered in a barren wasteland. And in WoW, you can learn how to make one.\nLinken's Sword and Boomerang.\nThe gnome, Linken, offers two rewards at the end of his rather long quest-line:\nMalown's Slam.\n, a hammer which drops off &lt;a href=\"Postmaster%20Malown\"&gt;Postmaster Malown&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, is a reference to former NBA star Karl \"The Mailman\" Malone.\nNigh-Invulnerability Belt.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nigh-Invulnerability%20Belt\"&gt;Nigh-Invulnerability Belt&lt;/a&gt;'s name is a reference to the comic/cartoon/television character The Tick, who describes himself as \"nigh-invulnerable\".\nRazor's Edge.\n. Most likely a reference to the AC/DC album of the same name.\nRed Riding Hood's Cloak.\n is a reference to the famous fairytale \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood\"&gt;Little Red Riding Hood&lt;/a&gt;\". In the tale a wolf (often identified as the Big Bad Wolf) wants to eat the girl. Appropriately enough, this item drops from the &lt;a href=\"Big%20Bad%20Wolf\"&gt;Big Bad Wolf&lt;/a&gt; Opera Event in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuby Slippers.\n reference Dorothy's ruby slippers from the movie, \"The Wizard of Oz\", which also had a hearthstone-like use: Dorothy was instructed to click her heels three times and say, \"There's no place like home.\"\nRum Tum Tuber Surprise.\n is a reference to, , one of the cats in ' and the musical '.\nSeaforium Charge.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Seaforium%20Charge\"&gt;Seaforium Charge&lt;/a&gt; is a type of item made by &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;engineers&lt;/a&gt; that blows open locks. It is a reference to the C-4 plastic explosive.\nStung.\n is a reward choice from the Anok'suten Horde quest, in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. It is a reference to Sting, the glowing sword used by Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. The spider lord Anok'suten is a hint at Shelob, the spider queen wounded by Sting.\nSulfuras.\nThe legendary weapon is seen as the ultimate sign of mastery of Molten Core (MC). Due to this hammer's connection to MC, it could be seen as a reference to MC Hammer.\nTenacious Defender.\n is an item from Hellfire Ramparts whose name clearly references the name of the band Tenacious D. The quote found on the item's flavor text is a reference to the song \"Wonderboy\".\nThe 1 Ring.\n is clearly a reference to \"The One Ring\" from the \"\" books. \"The One Ring\" was discovered at the bottom of a river by (later Gollum) and his cousin, Deagol, while fishing. is a random low-level fishing drop. This ring also has its own joke: It's the \"1\" Ring, and it grants the wearer several +1 enhancements to their stats. The One Ring was the most powerful magical ring in Middle Earth, but The 1 Ring (while being pretty good for its level) is one of the lowest-powered rings in \"World of Warcraft\".\nIt also appears that the popular pet site, Neopets, followed up on Blizzard's joke, and an item called \"The Two Ring\" is catchable from a fishing game. When moused-over, the tooltip states: \"A slight upgrade.\" In patch 2.4, however, Blizzard actually implemented as a reward from fishing daily quests.\nThe Arcanist's Cookbook.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage's&lt;/a&gt; book for the is named . This is a reference to \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Anarchist_Cookbook\"&gt;The Anarchist Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;\", the 1970 book that contained instructions on how to make bombs, among other topics.\nThe Don.\nThere are a number of \"Don\" items in WoW. , , etc. \nThe Emperor's New Cape.\nThe final boss of Blackrock Depths, Emperor Dagran Thaurissan, drops . The name of the cape is a reference to a story by Hans Christian Andersen that tells of a vain and greedy emperor who is told that his new clothes can only be seen by the noble and worthy. Being vain and rather dense, he pretends that he can see the clothes. In a parade, a small child points out that the emperor is stark naked. In the end, the emperor realizes that clothes that are only visible to the worthy are, in fact, no clothes at all. The cape is also invisible. The cape may also be a reference to the cartoon, \"The Emperor's New Groove\".\nThe Light And How To Swing It.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Paladins\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; book for the is named . A 1994 album by lounge singer &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jones_%28singer%29\"&gt;Tom Jones&lt;/a&gt; is titled \"The Lead And How To Swing It\". This title was probably inspired by the 1965 Richard Lester film, \"The Knack...and How to Get It\".\nTusken Helm.\n is a mail helm that drops from Overlord Ramtusk in &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;. It is apparently a reference to an item of the same name in the MMORPG, \"Star Wars Galaxies\". The SWG version drops from (you guessed it) Tusken Raiders. It may also be a play on words, considering Razorfen Kraul is full of quilboars, who have tusks.\nUnstoppable Force &amp; Immovable Object.\nThe mace and the shield are references to the pseudo-physics/philosophical question: \"What would happen if an unstoppable force met an immovable object?\" In \"The Burning Crusade\", there is a gray mace from random drop, . Whether or not \"The Movable Object\" will appear remains to be seen.\nWirt's Third Leg.\n was a running inside reference between Blizzard games. Wirt's Leg was first found in \"Diablo II\". &lt;a href=\"Wirt%27s%20Other%20Leg\"&gt;Wirt's Other Leg&lt;/a&gt; was found in \"Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne\". The fact that it is his \"third\" leg is becaus in diablo Wirt had lost a leg somehow, and had a wooden leg(see on the Diablo wiki). The term \"third leg\" is also likely a form of sexual innuendo.\nZandalarian Hero Charm/Medallion.\nThere is a pair of trinkets called the and the , which is perhaps a reference to the \"Star Wars\" species Mandalorian, which are renowned as strong and fierce warriors and mercenaries with an immense capacity for self-healing. It just so happens that the charm trinket boosts your healing spells for a limited time, whilst the medallion trinket boosts your melee and ranged damage.\nStaff of Prehistoria.\nThe Staff of Prehistoria is used in Uldaman to unlock the boss &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt;. To obtain the staff two items are needed, and . When read backwards together these read LOST VIKING, a older Blizzard game. "}

After an introductory invasion triggered by questing, further invasions become available after killing enough of a certain type of enemy across . During the event, large amounts of enemies will enter the garrison and attack guards and structures. The invasion has several phases spanning about 10-15 minutes total. Success is based on a Victory Point (VP) system based on killing invaders and completing other objectives. Reaching certain VP thresholds grants up to four tiers of rewards, each of which can be earned once per week.\nTriggering an invasion.\nKilling enough members of one of the following groups on will trigger an invasion at the garrison:\nKills made inside &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s do not contribute to triggering an invasion, nor do kills of the Iron Horde in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. Kills made while that type of invasion is already available do not carry over, but as soon as an invasion is completed, the kill count is reset and that invasion type can be triggered again. There is no known limit on the number of invasions that can be triggered and completed per day or per week.\nA common way to trigger invasions is to complete &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Support\"&gt;Garrison Support&lt;/a&gt; daily quests which require defeating enemies and completing other objectives in specific areas of Draenor. It is possible but unconfirmed that completing these quests gives a bonus to the hidden \"threshold\" for triggering an invasion. Scouting Missive items can be purchased using &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Resources\"&gt;Garrison Resources&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to such a quest when it's not currently offered by the &lt;a href=\"War%20Planning%20Map\"&gt;War Planning Map&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nDepending on the score achieved during invasions, rewards range from bronze to platinum:\nAfter completing an invasion, reward bags of the tier achieved \"and all tiers below\" will be placed in the character's inventory, if the character has not already earned that bag for the week. For instance, a character who has previously achieved a Bronze invasion earlier in the week could earn the Silver and Gold rewards the same week by reaching Gold tier in a later invasion. The number of invasions that can be completed in an effort to earn all 4 rewards in a week is only limited by players' ability to trigger them.\nRegardless of score, one of the following boss items \"may\" also be obtained as a reward for completing an invasion:\nAchievements.\nIndividual invasion types:\nAchievements for a single invasion:\nAchievements earned across multiple invasions:"}

{"id": "423138", "revid": "30741107", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=423138", "title": "Garrison followers", "text": "The following is a list of &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;s possible in the commander's &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral followers are characters the heroes have met throughout Warcraft's history, while some were created as references to real people in the Warcraft community. The followers' interface only shows followers the player can recruit on through meeting, quests, or achievements, however, hundreds of followers exist and can be recruited randomly through the tavern every week.\nQuality, experience and item level.\nFollowers are hired anywhere from level 90 to 100 and come in three quality levels: , , and . Experience is gained by running missions, and a set amount of XP is required to gain levels, as seen in the table to the right. Follower quality affects the number and quantity of active abilities and passive traits followers have. Uncommon followers have one ability and one trait, rare followers have one ability and two traits, and epic followers have two abilities and three traits.\nWhen hired, followers have a slim chance of being upgraded from their nominal quality (much like quest rewards), but even if they don't proc the bonus, they can still gain quality points once they reach level 100. It takes 60,000 XP to upgrade from uncommon to rare quality, and 120,000 XP to upgrade from rare to epic quality.\nAt level 100, the follower UI shows the average equipped item level of followers, which starts at 600 and can be increased up to the cap of 655 (in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.1\"&gt;Patch 6.1&lt;/a&gt;: 670). Followers can have their armor sets and weapons upgraded with special follower-only tokens, which can be as specific mission rewards, found in salvage at the &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Yard\"&gt;Salvage Yard&lt;/a&gt;, or from work orders at the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Bunker\"&gt;Dwarven Bunker&lt;/a&gt; (for Alliance) or &lt;a href=\"War%20Mill%20%28garrison%29\"&gt;War Mill&lt;/a&gt; (for Horde). Having those two buildings constructed is the best way to quickly increase follower item levels. See &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Enhancement%20Token\"&gt;Armor Enhancement Token&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Enhancement%20Token\"&gt;Weapon Enhancement Token&lt;/a&gt; for a full list of follower upgrade items. In Patch 6.1, salvage crates will no longer drop follower armor and weapons (615/630/645), but will still drop armor and weapon upgrade tokens (+3/6/9).\nIn order to gain full experience and be effective, followers should be sent on missions that are designed for their level (or item level) or lower, as their abilities and traits will lose effectiveness and they will gain substantially less experience if they are sent on missions above their level. Once two level 100 followers reach item level thresholds (specifically: 615, 630, 645, and 660), higher item-level follower missions are unlocked. These work just like higher follower level missions, in that followers need to have the required item level to be fully effective. The table below breaks down the requirements:\nAbilities and traits.\nAbilities.\nAbilities are restricted by class. Each ability counters one of 9 possible threats. Followers can use each ability once per mission (for example, a follower with Recklessness and Taunt could counter one Timed Battle threat and one Wild Aggression threat on the same mission, but if a mission had two separate Timed Battle threats, countering both of them would require two separate followers with appropriate counters).\nTraits.\nTraits provide various benefits, such as increased mission success chance in certain circumstances or increased mission rewards.\nSome followers have special traits that must be recruited for certain jobs, such as the &lt;a href=\"Bodyguard\"&gt;Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt; trait which allows a follower to accompany heroes throughout Draenor. &lt;a href=\"Phylarch%20the%20Evergreen\"&gt;Phylarch the Evergreen&lt;/a&gt; is an example of a follower that is unique in having the only Evergreen trait, which allows him to work in the lumber mill.\nIncreased success chance traits.\nDuplicate traits from multiple followers stack with each other.\na: Trait is granted by a book (&lt;a href=\"Guide%20to%20Arakkoa%20Relations\"&gt;Guide to Arakkoa Relations&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grease%20Monkey%20Guide\"&gt;Grease Monkey Guide&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Buddy%20Handbook\"&gt;Ogre Buddy Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winning%20with%20Wildlings\"&gt;Winning with Wildlings&lt;/a&gt;)\nb: Trait is exclusive to a single follower (&lt;a href=\"Blook\"&gt;Blook&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Harrison%20Jones\"&gt;Harrison Jones&lt;/a&gt;, , &lt;a href=\"Pallas\"&gt;Pallas&lt;/a&gt;)\nProfession traits.\nSome followers are guaranteed traits that make them suitable for employment in specific garrison buildings (after the building is upgraded to level 2). Other followers can randomly acquire these traits (except for &lt;a href=\"Bodyguard\"&gt;Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;, Angler and Evergreen, which are special).\nFollower upgrades.\nArmor item-level.\nNormal upgrades.\nThe following items increase the armor level of a follower by a specific amount, up to 675.\nPre-set levels.\nThe following items increase the armor level of a follower to the armor level listed.\nWeapon item-level.\nNormal upgrades.\nThe following items increase the weapon level of a follower by a specific amount, up to 675.\nPre-set levels.\nThe following items increase the weapon level of a follower to the armor level listed.\nFollower Weapons.\nFollowers recruited from Headhunter's Harvest will change weapons as their item level increases."}

Once assigned to a mission, followers become unavailable for its duration and proceed unaccompanied. At the conclusion of a mission, players can learn the outcome by returning to the garrison, where a mission report will be waiting. If successful, the report encloses a small reward that generally scales with mission duration and difficulty.\nFollowing the launch of \"\" some missions have had their rewards changed (i.e. gold to garrison resources) and bonus experience rewards were removed.\nDetails.\nOne of the main uses of followers is to send them on missions. Missions are special undertakings which the player can send groups of followers to fulfill, ranging from 30-minute quests to day-long raids featuring a full party of three followers. Successful missions can reward resources for developing the garrison and crafting reagents, as well as actual player loot usable by the character. In addition, missions serve to earn followers experience, slowly increasing their level and improving their abilities.\nEach mission has its own name, follower level (similar to player instances), specific duration, group size requirement, and other characteristics. Players can view available missions through the interface and choose which followers to send on a mission. Some missions are unlocked through having specific buildings. Missions are specific to the garrisons feature, and are not related to any playable content.\nMission types.\nPlayers can choose to send their followers on three different types of missions:\nBattle.\nBattle missions, marked with a pair of crossed swords, are the standard type of mission, and reward XP, gold, &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Resources\"&gt;Garrison Resources&lt;/a&gt;, and character equipment. Mission duration can run from 30 minutes to 8-10 hours for normal missions and up to 23 hours and 55 minutes for a few special rare missions.\nPatrol.\nPatrol missions, marked with a spyglass, are unlocked after building the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28garrison%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;. These missions offer higher-than-normal follower experience.\nTreasure Hunter.\nTreasure Hunter missions, marked with a money roll, are unlocked after building the level 3 &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Inn\"&gt;Lunarfall Inn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostwall%20Tavern\"&gt;Frostwall Tavern&lt;/a&gt;. These missions offer bonus gold.\nLevel 100 missions.\nLevel 100 missions are split into several categories, based on the average item level required for the mission.\nRare.\nRare missions can be any of the above types, but they are available less frequently. Completing rare missions awards &lt;a href=\"A%20Rare%20Mission\"&gt;A Rare Mission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Keeping%20It%20Rare\"&gt;Keeping It Rare&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoot.\nSuccessful missions will yield a variety of loot, including follower-specific gear, usable player gear and bonus follower experience. Player gear available will include some normal mode raid pieces and maybe a few heroic raid quality items towards the end of the raid tier. Mythic raiders will be fine without making use of their garrisons.\nCounters.\nTo increase the likelihood of mission success, the player can select followers who are able to counter the abilities of the mission's target enemies. By default, followers can counter the specified threats. When hired or upgraded in quality, followers may gain additional counters. Additionally, through the use of a &lt;a href=\"Follower%20Re-training%20Certificate\"&gt;Follower Re-training Certificate&lt;/a&gt;, all abilities and traits may be rerolled, in which case this table no longer applies.\nCounters by class.\nSome counters may be spec-restricted.

The orc warlock Ga'trul was present here but teleported to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Twinspire%20Keep\"&gt;Twinspire Keep&lt;/a&gt; after being cornered by Alliance troops.\nAs the surviving sailors of the two ships were swimming towards land, &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt; ordered her men to fire upon them, resulting in a slaughter. The doubt among the Alliance soldiers as well as the general violence brought forth the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly overwhelmed the outpost. The Alliance retreated back to \"the Skyfire\" as well as to &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; settlement in the vicinity with a negative disposition towards the Horde, after the kidnapping of their children and the ransacking of their orchards."}

Throughout the history of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, few mortals have achieved greater notoriety than him.\nGarrosh grew up on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in the shadow of his father, the great &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;. Grom was the first &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; leader to drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, subjugating the orcs to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's&lt;/a&gt; will. Before this event, Garrosh was among several orcs who had become ill with the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt;. They had been quarantined far away in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to escape the demonic corruption. The younger Hellscream was ashamed of his father for many years until he met &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; and learned of Grom's heroic redemption. Garrosh has since embraced his potential as a strong leader, most notably in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where he directed the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Horde advance&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and won the hearts of his people. Uncompromising and fiercely proud, Garrosh intended to restore the orcs' glory by any means necessary.\nAs the renewed &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; developed, Garrosh's thirst for power corrupted him to the point that he did not care about the means used to bring the orcish supremacy on Azeroth, with himself as the world's supreme ruler - going as far as to unleash the full power of the &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;dead Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; by resurrecting it using the Pools of Power, effectively destroying half of the sacred &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately, he became the &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;final antagonist&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\"'s Alliance-Horde war arc. He was ultimately defeated and depowered and then captured by the coalition below Orgrimmar. He was to be tried in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; as a war criminal, but managed to escape to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;an alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; through the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt;, and Garrosh's own &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; aided by the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. There, he was able to confront and witness his transformation into one of the first green orcs, corrupted by the influence of the fel powers, and slowly change the course of events leading to the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", Garrosh set things in motion. Thanks to his connections with the &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt; who supplied him during the Siege of Orgrimmar, he supplied the orcish clans of Draenor with all the technology they required to build their war machines, and he influenced to unite all orcish clans under one banner and reject the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh also managed to give an idea to create a gateway between the alternate timeline and the main one in order to return to exact his vengeance on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, in a form of the Iron Horde's within &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, using the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; as the portal's power source and then sent the Iron Horde in order to conquer the world, as well as entrusted &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; to arm the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20star\"&gt;Iron star&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in order to annihilate &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. He could later be found as the warlord of the in where he was eventually defeated and killed by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. Following his death, Garrosh's soul was confined to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; for his sins. However, he remained unrepentant for his actions to the last and ultimately chose to destroy himself rather than submit.\nGarrosh was one of the main characters in ', ', and '. He later becomes more antagonistic, serving as the main antagonist of ' and the supporting antagonist in \"\".\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nGarrosh was the son of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Golka\"&gt;Golka&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt;, born on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, young Garrosh was sent to live in &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; after he contracted the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt;. While the orcs of Garadar proudly took the name Mag'har, \"uncorrupted\" in orcish tongue, Garrosh was tormented by tales of his father. He feared that he, too, would lead the Mag'har down a dark path.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;human invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Draenor, many &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; - the uncorrupted orcs who settled in &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;, a stronghold in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; - were ill due to the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh was among them.\n&lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; visited them at &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt; in search of warriors to aid him. Garrosh asked him about &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;, and wanted to fight with him, but Kargath ignored him at first, calling the Mag'har weaklings and not orcs any more, and they could do the Horde a favor by dying. Later on Garrosh asked &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt; about his father, but the answer caused him to enter a deep depression.\nChieftain of the Mag'har.\nGarrosh eventually rose to become an important chief among the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;. He was aided by &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, son of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; clan's former chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; heroes first met Garrosh, he was sullen, pessimistic, even depressed. He was worried about the health of his clan's matriarch, &lt;a href=\"Greatmother%20Geyah\"&gt;Greatmother Geyah&lt;/a&gt;, who was ill. Garrosh knew that when she died, he would be expected to lead the Mag'har, and that troubled him as well. Garrosh believed himself fated to repeat his father's mistakes.\nGarrosh admitted that he was ashamed of his father. The last news Garrosh had of his father was that Grom had drunk &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood, and everything that transpired after this event was unknown to Garrosh for a long time. Indeed, Garrosh did not learn of his father's heroic death until &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Nagrand and re-enacted the events for Garrosh's benefit. Learning that his father had eventually overcome his weakness for power \u2013 Grom gave his life so that the orcs would be free of demonic influence \u2013 Garrosh appeared to gain power and confidence, believing he is no longer fated to fail himself and his people.\nThrall saw much potential in Garrosh. While he was brash and quick to anger, Thrall thought that his knowledge of orcish culture and fierce pride could serve the Horde well. He convinced him to leave Garadar and become one of his advisors.\nHeart of War - past.\nGarrosh recalled the events of his first visit to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Being the first Mag'har to set foot on Orgrimmar, many observed him with curiosity and some with awe. He encountered an old soldier from the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; who remembered serving with his father. The retired soldier told him that he was proud to see a portion of their orcish legacy remain and would gladly serve under him if he could. He told Garrosh that he would make his people proud.\nYet not all were happy to see Grom's legacy and heir. An orc woman named &lt;a href=\"Krenna\"&gt;Krenna&lt;/a&gt; wasn't impressed with his lineage, as she saw Grom as the one who instilled the blood curse on her people in the first place. Nor was she impressed with Garrosh for that matter. From Krenna, Garrosh learned the harsh realities the orcs had to contend with. It is very difficult to wrest a living in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Durotar is a desert, making farming impossible. Though the markets overflow, they rely heavily on imports from distant places. &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt; would be suitable for their people's needs yet Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; prohibited them from settling there and any of their lumber caravans sent there are regularly ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; continued to contest their sovereignty over the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and remnants of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; robbed &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; unchecked. Such incidents caused orcs like Krenna to become bitter and frustrated with their people's leadership.\nGarrosh was enraged by her contemptuous demeanor towards Thrall and Grom and threatened to assault her if she continued her treasonous attitude. Krenna's sister, &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt;, intervened to stop the fight before it started and urged Krenna to walk away. Krenna reluctantly stood down and walked away, leaving Gorgonna to apologize for her sister. Gorgonna explained to Garrosh that her sister didn't understand that her people lived in Durotar as a way to atone for the crimes their people committed during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh was also frustrated with her attitude and countered that their people did what they needed to do in order to survive and even if they did need to atone, why should the children of the orcs who had nothing to do with the war, had to suffer for the sins of their parents? Gorgonna showed him her green skin and explained that her people bore the mark and legacy of her people just the same and that she would atone in whatever way her warchief saw fit. Gorgonna told Garrosh that he would not understand as he was a Mag'har, and because of this he was free of such a burden.\nGarrosh was shocked that Thrall would ever be that unreasonable. He became irritated at Krenna's words and the more Garrosh reflected on them, the more he became increasingly frustrated and impatient. Garrosh became frustrated with Thrall's lack of action against the Alliance and the Scourge; frustrated with having to divide the orcs' resources and forces to deal with the problems of the other Horde races; frustrated to see the Scourge infect their food supplies with plague and rain death upon them while Thrall refused to unleash the full might of the Horde. Garrosh was determined to preserve Orgrimmar and restore the orcs' glory by any means necessary, even if he had to force Thrall's hand to do so.\nTheramore peace summit.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; brought with him Garrosh Hellscream back to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to be his advisor. Later on, the retired gladiator master &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; also became one of Thrall's advisors. Rehgar and Garrosh used to be in disagreement with each other: while Garrosh wanted to destroy the Alliance, who he considered the Horde's enemies, and take Azeroth for their own, Rehgar wanted to remain open to diplomacy with the Alliance and conserve their treaty of non-aggression with &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Thrall decided to go to a new meeting with the human King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;, he brought with him his two advisors, Rehgar and Garrosh, as well as some &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. Rehgar recommended that Thrall not bring Garrosh with them, but the Warchief thought it would be a good idea as it would help Garrosh to re-think his attitude toward the humans.\nGarrosh, alongside Thrall, traveled in a zeppelin to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, where Varian and Thrall had a peaceful discussion with an eye toward mutual gain; though Garrosh thought it better for the Horde to take what they needed by force rather than exchange their resources. Varian had to leave early as &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; were said to be under simultaneous distress by the Scourge. Upon exiting Theramore, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt; invaded the city. After catching a glimpse of &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt;, Varian thought that Thrall had sent her to assassinate him as the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; had done to &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh accused the Alliance of plotting the attack in an attempt to lure him and Thrall into a trap while Varian accused the Horde of attempted assassination; specifically Garrosh. Though tempers flared between Varian and Garrosh, Thrall and Garrosh left Theramore peacefully. Garrosh felt that Varian had insulted the orcs' honor and that by leaving peacefully the orcs were losing face at the summit.\nA Council for war.\nGarrosh was present in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; to discuss what to do about the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. After consulting Saurfang and the spirits, Thrall favored a more cautious approach to dealing with the Scourge: an advance scouting party to the frozen continent before committing troops, as well as meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to find out what the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were planning to do about the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh felt that dealing with the Alliance would put the Horde in danger and wanted to take the Horde's armies and conquer the humans and then march to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and crush the Scourge; advocating that the Horde should rule all of Azeroth. Thrall, irritated by Garrosh's recklessness and bold challenges to his authority, answered that the humans were not a threat and that he would not underestimate the Lich King by walking blindly into a Scourge trap. Thrall then provoked Garrosh to challenge him to a duel by saying that he would not make the same mistakes as his father, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Frustrated with his leader's apparent lack of action and the insults to his father, Garrosh challenged Thrall to a duel in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; to settle the matter.\nThe two orcs fought for some time until it seemed Garrosh had gained the upper hand. He began to taunt Thrall, but the battle was interrupted by a &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Herald of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; threatening &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; with destruction. Hearing this, Thrall used &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; on Garrosh and both left the ring, with Thrall telling the younger Hellscream that they would settle their dispute later. The city was attacked by countless &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s and a few &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThrall and Garrosh led the forces of the Horde in repelling the Scourge attack, with the help of Saurfang, Sylvanas, Rehgar, the city defenders, and some &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. After the Scourge assault force had been dealt with, Garrosh asked to be sent to Northrend again. This time, Thrall agreed and ordered Saurfang to begin preparations for war.\nWar in Northrend.\nBefore they built up &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Garrosh's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, named after him since he led the fleet of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Orc%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; that landed on &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;'s western coast. They used it as their main port after they decided to build their fortress inland. Garrosh Hellscream was then named Overlord of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, the main army of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, and established his command post at Warsong Hold.\nUnlike his appearance in Nagrand, where he had been downtrodden and apathetic, Garrosh was much more hotblooded and reckless in his role as Horde commander in Northrend. His chief advisor, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; - who drank from the same chalice that corrupted &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; - warned against Garrosh's savage tactics, fearing a resurgence of the bloodlust that had dominated the Horde prior to the death of Mannoroth. The two often spared over tactical decisions, particularly in regards to supply lines between the Hold and the Forsaken forces in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. Even if he disagreed with Saurfang, Garrosh appeared to have at least a grudging respect for the old warrior. Saurfang warned Garrosh that if he went too far against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and led their people down a \"dark path\", Saurfang himself would kill Garrosh. Garrosh did not challenge Varok, but snidely questioned how he had managed to survive so long without falling victim to his guilt and sense of morality.\nDespite Saurfang's warning, Garrosh appointed commanders and they conducted the war in such a manner as to focus strongly on battling the Alliance. In particular, &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%20Krenna\"&gt;Conqueror Krenna&lt;/a&gt;, the commander at &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Hold\"&gt;Conquest Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, bucked completely the war with the Scourge in favor of making war with the Alliance. Like Garrosh, she was hotblooded to the point of recklessness in pursuing the Alliance, so much so that she had to be deposed by her sister &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt;, an underling at Conquest Hold. The commander of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; above Icecrown was also concerned with defeating the Alliance in Icecrown, and even \"within\" &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde faced off against the Alliance, as the &lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt; and Orgrim's Hammer did battle as well.\nGarrosh was a firm believer of \"honorable\" combat; as evidence of his deprecation of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Front\"&gt;Broken Front&lt;/a&gt;. Though he endorsed conflict with the Alliance as much as possible, he would only permit it if it was done in a manner that fairly tests the martial prowess of the Horde. Using underhanded tactics such as poison and mind control was considered \"cowardly\" by his standards.\nSecrets of Ulduar.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Garrosh were summoned urgently to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to speak with the leader &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving before the human King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had departed, Garrosh and the king proceeded to skirmish in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, but Rhonin halted the fight with a magical shield before harm came to either. Rhonin suggested that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; work together against the new threat of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, but Garrosh and Varian were partisan to the idea and Wrynn was teleported. Garrosh expressed the opinion that a \"true\" Warchief would never partner himself with cowards.\nHeart of War.\nAfter the events at Dalaran, Garrosh and Thrall traveled back to Warsong Hold. On the way, Garrosh contemplated the past events where Thrall first brought Garrosh to Orgrimmar (as seen above). After defending Warsong Hold from an attack from the Scourge, Thrall witnessed a report given from Icecrown about the Horde forces flanking the Alliance during their assault. Thrall watched as Garrosh dealt with the situation, telling the general from Icecrown that the Horde would fight with honor or not fight at all. Thrall, watching Garrosh, felt proud of him for his decision.\nCrusaders' Coliseum.\nGarrosh, alongside Thrall, was later in attendance at the new &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; in Icecrown, surrounded by various champions and representatives of the Horde. During the tournament, Garrosh requested that Tirion uses warriors of the Horde to challenge the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament in order to show the strength of the Horde. He would cheer on Horde players following their victories.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nGarrosh can be found at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. He provides the &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Warsong\"&gt;Hellscream's Warsong&lt;/a&gt; buff for Horde raiding parties. If an adventurer spoke to him and told him he is not needed, the instance will have to be reset in order to gain the buff again.\nElemental Unrest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh defended the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Valley of Strength&lt;/a&gt; from invading elementals. He also assisted Horde players in the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Crown Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ambassador%20Flamelash\"&gt;Grand Ambassador Flamelash&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering.\n&lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; to meet with Garrosh and &lt;a href=\"Varok\"&gt;Varok&lt;/a&gt;, and though impressed with the hold's fortifications, couldn't help but compare it to the architecture seen during the previous wars. With the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; as good as over, Garrosh was recalled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to experience a hero's celebration, in honor of the Horde's victories under his leadership. While on their way to a ship, Garrosh and Cairne were attacked by Kvaldir, but Garrosh revealed hidden weapons which were used against the Kvaldir. While on the route, Garrosh waylayed an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; carrier wrecked at sea. He disposed of most of its crew, reasoning that it is in Horde waters, though a distressed Cairne urged him to relent. Garrosh then gave the survivors supplies and rations, informing them that they had witnessed both the Horde's might and the Horde's mercy. Garrosh and his crew were satisfied with the outcome, though Cairne showed signs of concern.\nBack in Orgrimmar, Garrosh and the Northrend veterans were given a warm welcome by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and Garrosh encouraged all veterans of the expedition to participate. A celebration was held in their honor, and Thrall later bestowed &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, the axe of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; upon Garrosh. Garrosh displayed a natural affinity for the mighty weapon, like his father before him. The land of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; was naturally harsh, and recent signs of &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; distress and disasters had further weakened the orcs' land. Now without reliable supply routes, and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; refusing to allow trade with the Horde following the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; fiasco, the citizens of Orgrimmar were on the brink of experiencing a famine. Thrall, Cairne, and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; resolved to negotiate peacefully with the night elves, as Hamuul held a high position within the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; comprised of both &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and night elves. Garrosh became outraged at such a notion. Viewing the Wrathgate as a tragedy to both factions, Garrosh concluded that the night elves boasted no right to stand in the way of their survival - and that the orcs should simply take what they need to survive by force. His suggestion was rebuked by Cairne, and after a heated exchange, Garrosh excused himself. Though the Northrend victory was a cause of great celebration in the Horde, a rough road seemed to await it, and Thrall called upon a meeting.\nGarrosh, observing the skull of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and lost in thought, was approached by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;. He immediately expressed a mild disdain for the Grimtotem matriarch, noting that hers is the only tauren tribe who had not sworn loyalty to the Horde. Magatha simply offered him words of support, ensuring him that the Grimtotem would join the Horde when needed - and that Garrosh himself would be exactly what the orcs need, precisely when they need it. Garrosh was appreciative of that sentiment at least, and the two retired.\nThe elemental upheaval began to increase in potency, and Orgrimmar itself was caught aflame by rampant fire elementals. No longer able to properly converse with the maddened beings, Thrall decided that action must be taken to discover the cause of this chaos, and began preparations for a journey to &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. This was not an act he could undertake as the Warchief \u2014 and Thrall was forced to consider a temporary replacement. Thrall's immediate thought was Cairne, though the elderly tauren was not an orc - in times such as this, unrest would likely follow if such a decision was made. Thrall lamented the death of &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, who would have made an ideal Warchief, and this line of thought brought him to another conclusion; another orc who could keep the Horde together during his absence: Garrosh.\nGarrosh was summoned to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and Thrall officially named him the acting Warchief. Taken aback, Garrosh hastily mentioned that his place was on the battlefield; that he knew much of war and tactics, but little of politics. Thrall ensured him that he would not be alone in this task and that Cairne, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; would be on hand to advise him. Garrosh accepted this charge.\nNow as the highest authority figure within the Horde, Garrosh began to repair the damage wrought on by the elemental uprising \u2014 beginning with the remodeling of Orgrimmar. What was once little more than a village of huts, had become an aggressive bastion of a capital, reinforced by the metals used in Warsong Hold. Garrosh reasoned that no fire would be able to spread again with this, and he and Cairne appeared to finally see eye-to-eye.\nEvents were set in motion outside of Garrosh's control - the peaceful meeting between the tauren and the night elves was sabotaged by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clan, posing as agents of the Horde, who brutally murdered the entire gathering and unknowingly left Hamuul as its only survivor. Hamuul, likening the agents' attitude to that of Garrosh's, informed Cairne of what had occurred.\nCairne berated Garrosh over the events that had transpired, just as Garrosh finished being ritually tattooed. Among them was the very same distinctive jaw tattoo that his father had, by an orc tattooist that had been apprenticed to, and had assisted, the orc that had tattooed Grom. Cairne accused Garrosh of orchestrating the unprovoked attack on the druids, though Garrosh informed him that had he been behind it, he would have announced it to the world. After another fierce exchange, their time as allies essentially broke down, and Cairne concluded that Garrosh was not fit to lead the glorious Horde after all - and that for the sake of the Horde, Garrosh must have been dethroned. Cairne challenged him to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; for the title of Warchief, though Garrosh upped the stakes, forcing it to be a battle to the death in an attempt to deter his opponent. Cairne gladly accepted and informed Garrosh of the rules befitting a proper Mak'gora \u2014 the dress-code and of the shaman's blessing allowed on their weapon of choice.\nGarrosh's earlier encounter with Magatha seemed to have borne fruit, and the Grimtotem matriarch offered to bless Gorehowl.\nGarrosh and Cairne began the battle in the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Arena\"&gt;Orgrimmar Arena&lt;/a&gt;, their fighting styles initially canceling each other out fairly well. As Cairne began to land serious blows upon Garrosh, Garrosh was backed into a corner. Garrosh attempted a desperate strike, slicing Cairne's chest and shattering his &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Runespear\"&gt;runespear&lt;/a&gt;. Though a formidable blow, it did not seem to appear fatal - until Cairne inexplicitly collapsed from it. Though surprised, Garrosh quickly took advantage of the situation, and with one final glance at Cairne, dealt him the killing blow.\nUnbeknownst to Garrosh, Magatha had used him as an instrument in her betrayal of Cairne. Lacing Gorehowl with poison, she had ensured that even minor blows would be fatal to the High Chieftain. Elated, Magatha began the next step of her plan: the hostile takeover of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and the death of Cairne's son and successor, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarrosh found himself dealing with mixed emotions. Though still not entirely sure of why Cairne had accused him of such a crime, he was satisfied with the knowledge that it had apparently been a fair fight. Eitrigg quickly dispelled this notion, and upon observation, the two discovered traces of the same poison that had sealed Cairne's fate. Enraged and distraught, now knowing that he had unwittingly robbed Cairne of a fair fight, and that Magatha had robbed him of his own honor, Garrosh let his rage take him.\nMagatha, now in control of Thunder Bluff, requested aid from her new Warchief. Garrosh replied via letter, wishing her a violent demise, and ensuring her that no aid would be given - her life was now in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Having believed she had found a useful tool in Garrosh, Magatha was infuriated by his response.\nWithout aid, Magatha and the Grimtotem still loyal to her were defeated by &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and his followers. Garrosh and Baine met in the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, and Garrosh attempted to mend his bridges with the equally betrayed new chieftain. Expecting the same challenge from Baine that Cairne had given him, Garrosh was surprised when Baine refused such a notion. Outing Magatha as the true traitor, Baine offered Garrosh the loyalty of the tauren people. Impressed, Garrosh gladly accepted.\nEdge of Night.\nIn the fields of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh Hellscream rallied an army of Horde forces \u2014 the bulk being of said army being &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 for an attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. Intent on conquering the nation for a port, Hellscream was prepared to launch an invasion when two things occurred preventing him. The first was having to deal with &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Lydon\"&gt;Apothecary Lydon&lt;/a&gt;'s suggestion and later plea to use the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken plague&lt;/a&gt;, which was denied and the second being the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. While Sylvanas was able to convince Garrosh to let her run the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, he privately remarked to himself that the eyes of Hellscream were on Sylvanas closer than ever.\nAs Our Fathers Before Us.\nWhile Garrosh and &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; had been able to put their lingering animosity behind them for the good of the Horde, new conflicts began to arise around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. With the industrious &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s making use of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde's military needs, the backlash of this had resulted in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s water supply becoming tainted and unfit to drink. Frustrated, Garrosh made the journey to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and spoke with both Baine and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; about using shipments of water from &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to rectify this problem. Though both Baine and the Archdruid were apprehensive to bow down to this demand, after some mutual haranguing Baine agreed to it. Garrosh reiterated that as Warchief of the Horde, it fell to him to keep its people safe, and left.\nThe shipments appeased Garrosh, and before long the people of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; had fresh water to drink. Garrosh's attitude towards his tauren allies resulted in a number of them feeling alienated; some even going as far as to consider leaving the Horde over their chieftain's apparent passivity and Garrosh's increasing demands of the tauren people. As Baine struggled with this, he also learned of &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; raiding parties harassing the water supplies and killing the tauren people. Garrosh quickly discovered this, and once again made a trip to Thunder Bluff to confront Baine over it. While Baine was adamant that a peaceful solution to the situation was possible, Garrosh was outraged. He pointed out to Baine that the quilboar were attacking Horde lands and killing Horde citizens, and that he would not stand for either. Garrosh ensured him that realistic action would be taken to remove the quilboar threat once and for all.\nGarrosh, together with a small regiment of 15 &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, stormed the quilboar tunnels and cut down phalanxes of the beasts. As victory appeared near, the quilboar launched a massive-scale ambush and overwhelmed the Kor'kron regiment in the hundreds. Garrosh was backed into a corner, and while he was able to take down many more quilboar, the tide turned against him and was disarmed of &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;. As things looked bleak, Baine, Hamuul and several of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; arrived to relieve the battle. After the High Chieftain assisted in dislodging Gorehowl from the tunnel wall, Garrosh and Baine fought off the quilboar and made their escape, arriving safely at the surface of the tunnels. While Garrosh was too infuriated for words, Baine informed him that the quilboar had been lacking a water source too, and Hamuul created a river for them on the grounds that no more attacks were made against the tauren. The quilboar slunk away, and the Horde forces left triumphant.\nBaine ensured Garrosh that if the tauren people required aid again, they would inform him of it, and with that, he turned his back on the Warchief and led his people back to Thunder Bluff. Having ignored good advice, severely underestimating his enemy, getting 15 elite warriors killed for nothing, and knowing that he has completely and thoroughly embarrassed himself in general, Garrosh traveled back to Orgrimmar via &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; without a word. Despite their misgivings, Baine later reaffirmed his loyalty to the Horde that his father helped to shape.\nAshenvale offensive.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh personally led his troops into the neighboring borders of Ashenvale. While his &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Clan\"&gt;Warsong Clan&lt;/a&gt; had made considerable progress over the course of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, it was a far cry from the ambitions that Warchief Hellscream desired to achieve. Garrosh planned to create a massive city in the heart of the forest, one with the potential to rival &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in size and power. With rich minerals riped for the taking, and all of the tools needed to see his people grow, Garrosh surged viciously through the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; ranks and cut a swathe of destruction straight to the &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Outpost\"&gt;Silverwing Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Having brought down a number of tamed &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; captives from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; that he domesticated by holding their young hostage, Garrosh planned to see his dreams of expansion realized.\nHis attack on the Outpost resulted in a decisive Horde victory. Garrosh reflected on how the forest that gave &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; such harsh resistance was falling, piece by piece, and wondered what the mighty Grom would have made of this triumph. He concluded that not even Thrall could deny his prowess at this point, and would hail him as the champion of the orcish race and the entire Horde.\nGarrosh's plan was twofold - he had gained knowledge of a meeting between the leaders of the Alliance and striked at this point in order to lure out &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. As he had expected, the priestess arrived on the scene to relieve the waning sentinels, though the Horde unleashed the magnataur upon the Alliance's ranks. In the ensuing chaos, Tyrande was struck down and wounded by orc archers. Confident in a victory, Garrosh also took the fray.\nThe battle was interrupted by the arrival of worgen reinforcements led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, who proceeded to fight back several magnataur. On several occasions, Garrosh and Varian clashed and did battle; with both leaders matching each other's attack, blow by blow, and killing all who interfered with their duel. Though evenly matched at first, Varian eventually gained an advantage. Varian had been fighting with an in-explicit focus and unyielding vigor. While Garrosh tired, Varian was still full of stamina, which allowed Varian to press on his attack. Garrosh was fought back at this point, and Varian succeeded in wounding him and disarming Gorehowl. A dying magnataur separated the two combatants, and Garrosh composed himself. He prepared to rush at Varian once more, though is held back by several &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;; urging Garrosh to retreat. Garrosh grudgingly complied, though not before swearing to kill Varian himself.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the Cataclysm, Garrosh began to take a far more ferocious stance in his war with the Alliance - leading his forces in a rampage through &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; in order to secure the much sought after supplies his people need. His actions have caused the orcish people to avoid the famine that threatened &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; prior to his ascension. He believed that if the blood of the selfish Alliance was required to give his people the essentials they need to exist, then so be it. Hellscream's ascension has been applauded by most orcs, who felt that his brash warrior instincts and unwillingness to negotiate for needed resources were more in tune with the true orc way.\nGarrosh evicted the majority of non-orc races from central Orgrimmar, as he believed only the orcs possessed the strength to truly defend the city. Shortly after the Shattering, he created a new army \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to deal with the Horde's &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; incursion problems. Garrosh has paid little heed to opinions originating outside of his race and was not one for diplomacy\u2014with the Alliance or even among the members of the Horde. Already distrustful of the other branches of the Horde, Garrosh has learned that the various leaders of these factions were more powerful than he had originally estimated. Garrosh came into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; Chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;; Garrosh's relationship with him breaking down in a similar manner to that of Cairne - culminating with Vol'jin threatening to kill him for his thirst for war. The fallout between Vol'jin and Garrosh has subsequently led to the mass exodus of the Darkspear trolls from Orgrimmar. Led by a dissatisfied Vol'jin, this rift between the orcs and trolls has spread the Horde's once-concentrated military mighty thin.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; agents to meet with Garrosh and join the Horde. Garrosh was shown an emblem, and noted that he knew the meaning of this all too well. The events of the aforementioned \"&lt;a href=\"As%20Our%20Fathers%20Before%20Us\"&gt;As Our Fathers Before Us&lt;/a&gt;\" appeared to take place at this point.\nGarrosh's thin tolerance for the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; was tested further after he ordered them to invade &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, as the Horde needed a port in the Eastern Kingdoms. Though Gilneas was initially conquered, the Gilneans were able to counterattack and push the Forsaken forces out of the city. Growing irritated, Garrosh sent his own forces to support the Forsaken, and a stalemate was reached. Garrosh later met with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and was present during her demonstration of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;'s great necromantic abilities. Though the Forsaken were appeased enough by this solution to their plight as a people, Garrosh was disgusted. He dispensed &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; to \"guard\" Lady Sylvanas, and after an insulting exchange with her, left.\nGarrosh has also explicitly banned the use of the Forsaken &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;, though weaker versions were considered acceptable. Most of the Forsaken seemed to pay little heed to this, and the more powerful strains have been used multiple times since.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, a demon named &lt;a href=\"Durak%20%28demon%29\"&gt;Durak&lt;/a&gt; attempted to renew the orcs' dependence on fel-power. Garrosh demanded his head for this transgression. Garrosh also recruited the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear\"&gt;Shatterspear&lt;/a&gt; tribe into the Horde in order to mount an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt;'s assault in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Krom'gar's &lt;a href=\"General%20Grebo\"&gt;corrupt general&lt;/a&gt; arranged the murder of several neutral druids studying in the &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Krom'gar used a massive bomb to completely eradicate the Grove, though Garrosh himself confronted him for these actions. Quoting words he had heard from &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;\"a wise old war hero\"&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh grabbed Krom'gar by the neck, and hurled him off the ledge of &lt;a href=\"Cliffwalker%20Post\"&gt;Cliffwalker Post&lt;/a&gt;, causing him to plummet to his death. He was humbled by &lt;a href=\"High%20Chieftain%20Cliffwalker\"&gt;High Chieftain Cliffwalker&lt;/a&gt;'s talk of \"mercy\", and thanked him for this lesson.\nGarrosh later sent &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Bloodhilt\"&gt;Warlord Bloodhilt&lt;/a&gt; to salvage the situation in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarrosh personally spearheaded the assault into the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, organizing an impressive air fleet to obliterate the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult and claim the land for the Horde. After giving an inspiring speech to this effect, Garrosh was informed of an Alliance fleet nestled below- and ordered his air support to destroy them. This backfired when - due to treachery from within - the Horde fleet was ambushed, undefended, by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his twilight drakes. Although Garrosh was personally able to fend one such drake off, his ship itself suffered massive damage and fell into the ocean below. The remainder of the fleet suffered a similar fate, crashing down into the sea. Garrosh himself was considered missing in action.\nWithout Garrosh's direct leadership, the Horde turned to the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to strike up an alliance. After failed negotiations with their master, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Overlord Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde forces joined a Dragonmaw rebellion led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, successfully dethroning Mor'ghor and his &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Garrosh, who had survived the crash, arrived at &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Port\"&gt;Dragonmaw Port&lt;/a&gt; and officially inducted Zaela and the Dragonmaw into the Horde.\nWith the assault on the Highlands going well, Garrosh turned his attention inwards- and learned that the earlier ambush was a result of treachery at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Sauranok%20the%20Mystic\"&gt;Sauranok the Mystic&lt;/a&gt;, who had thrown his lot in with the Twilight's Hammer. Garrosh quickly disposed of the treacherous Sauranok with the player's assistance.\nJaina Proudmoore: Tides of War.\nGarrosh has granted amnesty to any members of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; willing to swear him their allegiance. One such orc, a formidable warrior named &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, has become Garrosh's own bodyguard. Malkorok went about quieting dissent through intimidation, abduction and outright murder, and gained Garrosh's tacit approval to do so. Garrosh has also successfully blockaded Kalimdor, giving the Horde a succinct advantage at sea. Perhaps most notably, Garrosh's newfound military might has allowed him to keep a far tighter leash on his more critical allies, such as the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, whose people and land are most at risk of Garrosh's wrath should &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; make any moves against him. As such, the western Horde essentially found itself held hostage for its good behavior.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; over and the threat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; subsided, Garrosh has reinvigorated his plans for conquest. Garrosh aimed to forcibly expel the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; from Kalimdor, and claim the continent for the good of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He expressed this desire in a meeting with the other Horde leaders (&lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, along with Malkorok and &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, the only advisor remaining from Thrall's reign), much to the chagrin of the former three. Garrosh intended to scour &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; from the continent, and stunt the Alliance's military presence. With that done, he then aimed to take the night elves' land.\nSylvanas took an issue with this, reasoning that the Alliance would strike at the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; in vengeance for Theramore, though Garrosh assured her that any Alliance retaliation would be dealt with. Of his fellow leaders, Lor'themar was the only one who opted not to question Garrosh's goals or motives, Gallywix caring only so far as profit was concerned. Coupled with the regent lord's lack of sympathy towards Sylvanas, Garrosh developed something of a respect for Theron. Nonetheless, Garrosh ordered all of the leaders watched, and Theron in particular after a loaded discussion with him about loyalty.\nGarrosh retained his desire for acknowledgment, believing his conquest of Theramore would earn him the respect of Baine and Vol'jin, who in turn would be rewarded for coming around. Garrosh's plans for the isle went beyond what is common knowledge: Garrosh's agents gained knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, and Garrosh ordered the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; escorted protecting it to be slain, the Iris itself delivered to the warchief. Garrosh also ordered the creation of another &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, the formidable &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; invention created by the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; years before in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe warchief spearheaded the attack on &lt;a href=\"Northwatch\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt;, using it as a stepping stone to Theramore (and an excuse for the gathered Horde warriors to have a glorious battle). He was accompanied by Malkorok, Vol'jin, and Baine, along with Gallywix. Garrosh took note of the trade prince's eagerness, though was irritated that Sylvanas and Lor'themar were not present. In Sylvanas's stead, &lt;a href=\"Frandis%20Farley\"&gt;Captain Frandris Farley&lt;/a&gt; and a Forsaken regiment arrived to represent her interests, while the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kelantir%20Bloodblade\"&gt;Kelantir Bloodblade&lt;/a&gt; and two ships of blood elven warriors were sent on behalf of Lor'themar Theron and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. With each race of the Horde accounted for, Garrosh made quick work of Northwatch and marched on to Theramore.\nGarrosh's allies continued to express concern for the direction their Horde is heading in. While Garrosh refused to see anyone, reflecting on his looming victory, Baine called a small council to address the unsaid concerns brimming in the more moderate Horde's ranks. Garrosh interjected this gathering, having been tipped off to the meeting's location, and angrily lashed out at his allies for daring to question him. Garrosh assured Baine and &lt;a href=\"Hamuul\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; that he was not Thrall, and wrote Thrall off as a weak \"pacifist,\" blaming his predecessor for the Horde's problems. He also backhanded Kelantir as she attempted to interject, though quickly composed himself, and told them that they were lucky their warchief was willing to overlook this deceit.\nLater, Baine and Vol'jin tried to convince Garrosh to move the army, only to be stunned by Garrosh's order - to have Horde ships pulled back.\nGarrosh dispensed Malkorok to the front lines, who promptly led the Horde forces in skirmishes around Theramore Isle. Garrosh's spy, a &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; mage named &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; (ostensibly neutral), turned on Theramore's defenders and assisted the Horde in breaking into the city. With &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;the help of Horde soldiers&lt;/a&gt;, Thalen was able to escape his predicament after being captured, and the true scope of Garrosh's plan was revealed.\nGarrosh ordered a full retreat, having pushed the Alliance into the center of Theramore. The mana bomb, augmented by the power of the stolen Focusing Iris, was dropped directly over Theramore. The entire isle was utterly annihilated, with such brutal force that not even an insect survived. The casualties of this swift move were colossal \u2014 many of the Alliance's best and brightest generals were killed by the bomb, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; herself only narrowly escaping it.\nHaving achieved a total victory, Garrosh was utterly elated. He spoke of the foolishness of his enemies \u2014 that he had stolen the Iris from under the noses of the Kirin Tor themselves, and that moment nothing of Theramore stood to oppose his conquest. Many of his soldiers were similarly thrilled at this victory, though others were repulsed: Baine, horrified, fled into the swamp to get away from the carnage as Malkorok laughed in his face. Baine also thought back on the irony that Garrosh has just committed a far worse crime of dishonor than what he had executed &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt; over.\nThis victory would not be without its consequences. Jaina, having survived the attack, was warped by the traumatic experience and twisted by the residual energies of the mana bomb, swearing to destroy Garrosh. Her quest for vengeance took her to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; itself, where she prepared to slaughter its population in a similar manner to the fate her own nation suffered, though ultimately stayed her hand. Instead, she attacked Garrosh's fleet, engaged with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s own.\nGarrosh engaged Varian once more, taking their duel count up to three. This time Garrosh held his ground against Varian far better than their spar in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, albeit once more the battle was cut short. The Alliance retreated from &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and took back Northwatch for good measure.\nHaving narrowly avoided a catastrophe in Orgrimmar, and with Northwatch retaken, Garrosh ordered his coastal blockade of Kalimdor to fall back. Baine was pleased with this decision, viewing it as Garrosh giving up his conquest. To his horror, Garrosh stated that his plan has changed: instead of expelling the Alliance from Kalimdor, Garrosh now aimed to wage a war of total genocide. After being informed that he would lose Baine's support should another Theramore happen, Garrosh merely smirks at the tauren while remarking that such information is \"duly noted.\"\nGarrosh's brutal reign has had several lingering effects on both his allies and enemies: Vol'jin, though geographically most at risk of Garrosh's wrath, has privately given up all hope for him, and fell back to the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; to plan his next move; Baine, horrified at Garrosh's drive for genocide, has similarly fled back to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, while Jaina Proudmoore (now the Kirin Tor's new leader after Garrosh indirectly killed &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;) \u2014 although in a far better state of mind \u2014 has resolved to see Garrosh removed from power.\nMeanwhile, Varian himself gained knowledge of the burgeoning discontentment in Garrosh's ranks and planned to have these \"Horde rebels\" take power from Garrosh in the long run.\nGarrosh made a dark proclamation: every man, woman, and child was to assist in the war effort against the Alliance, and any found shirking their duties would face the wrath of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDue to the destruction of Theramore, the Alliance has become motivated to the war effort instead of crushed as Garrosh originally intended. While being informed about the various navy battles by the newly promoted &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;, the Warchief was shocked to learn that during a naval battle in the south, Alliance forces were run aground. Upon learning about this &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;new uncharted land&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh became enraged that the Alliance got there first and quickly ordered the General to gather his best men to secure the new land for the Horde.\nSome time afterwards, Garrosh greeted new &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; who have sworn allegiance to the Horde along with &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;. He instructed them of what he expects of them and tested their martial prowess by unleashing his captured beasts on them in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandfall.\nRoughly two months after the initial foray into &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh himself arrived with the bulk of the Horde fleet, and quickly went about removing the local &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; presence along the shore of &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; had yet another clash of opinions about his warmongering at the newly-constructed &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in Garrosh, long-tested by the Darkspear chieftain's criticism, ordering his rival's outright murder (under the guise of Vol'jin being sent on a &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;mission&lt;/a&gt; with the Kor'kron). Vol'jin survived the attempt on his life, and it was revealed that Garrosh had put the Darkspear Isles under martial law. Members of his own Horde joined forces with former Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to liberate the isle and take down Garrosh's men. As a deterrent, Thrall himself took up the leadership of the isles in Vol'jin's absence.\nHorde heroes were instructed to report Vol'jin's death to Garrosh, and remained close to the warchief \u2013 biding their time and finding other like-minded members of the Horde to save their coalition before Garrosh's rule destroys it.\nGarrosh then traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;, where he was present with &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt; and the regent lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. He learned from Malkorok about the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; race and took a special interest in the iron-fisted rule of the mogu and their technology (remarking to Malkorok that he had much to learn from them), being particularly attracted by their ability to create new warriors and fuel emotions to their height in order to drastically increase battle prowess. Garrosh had sent an expedition led by &lt;a href=\"Fanlyr%20Silverthorn\"&gt;Fanlyr Silverthorn&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Rise\"&gt;Ancestral Rise&lt;/a&gt; and wanted to see results. He was pleased when Fanlyr revealed to him information about the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, Garrosh traveled to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Camp%20Bataar\"&gt;Fire Camp Bataar&lt;/a&gt;, which he turned into a horde camp, and was investigating any mentions about the bell with &lt;a href=\"Delia%20Sunseeker\"&gt;Delia Sunseeker&lt;/a&gt;. It was there that &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Connelly\"&gt;Agent Connelly&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance adventurer spied on him and learned about the Divine Bell too.\nTheron and his regiment were later sent to Mogujia but they were overpowered by the Mogu. Garrosh clashed with Theron too after neglecting to mention a strong &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; presence that resulted in several blood elven casualties. Garrosh then observed Theron and his elves at the mogu ruins in Kun-Lai. The blood elves were planning to capture a mogu leader, &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Kien\"&gt;Shan Kien&lt;/a&gt;. Theron sent a horde hero along with a farstrider and a blood knight to defeat the Mogu Warlord. Garrosh arrived during the battle and threw Gorehowl at the Mogu leader, almost killing him. Garrosh then demanded information about the Divine Bell but Shan Kien only mocked at him. When Garrosh was preparing for a final blow, Fanlyr stopped him telling him that the mogu was the only key to the Divine Bell and that the blood elves would make him speak. Garrosh agreed and left telling him that should Fanlyr disrespected him once more, his head would be placed atop of a pike in Orgrimmar.\nShan Kien was captured and brought to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%27ar%20Advance\"&gt;Garrosh'ar Advance&lt;/a&gt;. Back in the Shrine of Two Moons, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, too, arrived on Pandaria, and worked to undo (or clean up after) the chaos Garrosh left behind during his stay, including (but not limited to) curing &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted soldiers at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh discussed the sha power with Lor'themar and Baine, and insisted that the Horde would control the power. Theron then departed to Silvermoon with a sha artifact to examine it. Garrosh then sent a Horde adventurer to Silvermoon to get information. Like Vol'jin before him, Lor'themar became increasingly wary of Garrosh's rule; and after multiple instances of his people's welfare being disregarded by the warchief (including Garrosh's demand to look into the mogu artifact resulting in a sha being released in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;), Lor'themar considers pulling Quel'Thalas out of Garrosh's Horde, and reconsidering &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;old Alliances&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarrosh traveled with Baine to Garrosh'ar Advance where he interrogated Shan Kien in order to find out the location of Divine Bell. Baine found a more peaceful way to extract the information, which proved successful. Shan Kien then revealed the location of a tomb, where the Bell was located. Unbeknownst to the Horde, the Alliance was spying on the interaction and also learned the location. Garrosh sent &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the Bell only to find that the kaldorei entered the tomb shortly before the Horde arrived and took the bell to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh then sent Fanlyr and some Horde champions to locate the bell in Darnassus, and successfully claim it. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; played a part in the theft, and purged them from the city of Dalaran. Many fleeing blood elves (including &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;) were rescued by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;; and, in the aftermath of the conflict, the Sunreavers came to hold Garrosh just as responsible for their removal from Dalaran as Jaina herself. This act put a stop to the prospect of Lor'themar joining the Alliance: by organizing a heist in Darnassus after learning of Lor'themar's talks with Varian (and focusing blame on the blood elves for it), Garrosh was able to sabotage the notion of the sin'dorei leaving the Horde.\nLater on, Garrosh amassed Horde forces at &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Emperor's Reach&lt;/a&gt; with the Divine Bell in tow. Garrosh spoke about the Horde's grand destiny, and how he would use the Divine Bell to erase weakness from his orcs and create a stronger Horde. Garrosh then rang the Divine Bell, which turned his &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; into sha. After they were dispatched by the adventurer, Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; intervened and tried to deter Garrosh from using the Divine Bell. Anduin's pleas fell on deaf ears, and Garrosh used the Divine Bell to infest his champion &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt; with the power of the sha, who the adventurer then had to fight. Though Garrosh encouraged his troops to master sha energy, in the end, none of his champions were able to do so. In the aftermath of the battle, Anduin used the &lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20Mallet\"&gt;Harmonic Mallet&lt;/a&gt; to turn the Divine Bell's chaos into pure harmony. This temporarily stunned Garrosh before he struck at the bell and destroyed it; causing its rubble to fall on Prince Anduin. The impact of the bell has caused Anduin's bones to shatter. Believing Anduin dead, Garrosh let the Alliance champion live to relay the fate of Anduin to King Varian; thereby illustrating the price for his continued defiance. Garrosh then flew off, maniacally laughing at the thought of the Alliance's, and particularly King Varian's, suffering. Though the Divine Bell was destroyed, Garrosh was still determined to master sha energy.\nThe Thunder King.\nGarrosh was preoccupied at &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, and paid no mind to the events of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; led a &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;-heavy coalition against the returned &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; to claim his weaponry as leverage against Garrosh in the event of an uprising.\nEscalation.\nFed up with Garrosh's warmongering, large portions of the Horde rose up against him. Garrosh branded the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; as traitors to the Horde, forcibly taking over their holdings while oppressing and executing their members. The already precarious racial division of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; took another hit, as the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt; was then dominated by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, and various non-orc members of the city are rounded up, chiefly among them the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis turn of events put a dent in Lor'themar and Vol'jin's collaborative plot to overthrow Garrosh, as with his people in direct danger (while Theron was finishing up on the Isle of Thunder and across the sea), the Darkspear chieftain was forced to declare the open rebellion and return to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, this first push against Garrosh culminated in the rebels claiming the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; all the way up to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; also threw their support behind the rebellion, and fought their way ever-closer to Orgrimmar.\nSimultaneously, Garrosh also faced the threat of an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invasion. agents were sent to gain intel on Garrosh's movements and pave the way for the arrival of the Alliance's main force, and also learn of the rebellion taking place. In order to subvert the Horde further, the Alliance lends aid to the rebellion.\nGarrosh had not given up on his desire to wield Pandarian artifacts, and sent a goblin excavation force to unearth the dark powers resting under the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, shipping them back to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and storing them in &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. Horde agents speculated that Garrosh was preparing for yet another invasion, though the target was unclear. Garrosh had also called in the aid of &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; to put down the rebellion, and had conscripted &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; to supplement his Kor'kron force.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAfter the goblin excavation team in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms discovered the sealed &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;heart of a deceased Old God&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh traveled to observe his secured bounty. Realizing the heart was dormant, Garrosh fought his way through the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; to submerge the heart in the vale's pools. He was confronted by the Shado Pan's lord, &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to end Garrosh's rampage across the continent, but was defeated when the warchief choked him with dismantled rails and impaled him upon Gorehowl. Garrosh told his defeated opponent that the other races of the world will no doubt attempt to stop him, and that moreover, he is counting on it: no matter what the world throws at him, Garrosh was confident that his newly-unearthed power would be able to prevail, and that all those against him would find themselves impaled upon Orgrimmar's spires.\nGarrosh hurled the dormant heart into the pools, causing a chaotic surge of &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; energy which corrupted the surrounding area. Garrosh retreated to his underground fortress, leaving behind even his father's weapon in favor of a new, Old God-forged visage of it - &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atoh%2C%20Desecrated%20Image%20of%20Gorehowl\"&gt;Xal'atoh&lt;/a&gt;. After moving the heart to Orgrimmar, Garrosh became crazier and more xenophobic, though he was not controlled or corrupted by the Old Gods.\nGarrosh moved the heart into his own personal sanctum within the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, a large underground complex located deep within the &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; below Orgrimmar. With the entire city under martial law, Garrosh issues commands from within the compound and plans to conquer the entire world for his &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; using his newfound powers. He has also allowed the &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20the%20Klaxxi\"&gt;Paragons of the Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; within his compound, who act as guardians of the Heart. Garrosh also gifted some of its power to &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance and Horde (under the name 'The Darkspear Rebellion') formed a coalition to stop the crazed dictator, along with adventurers freshly arrived from containing the destruction Garrosh had laid upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. The group laid siege to the city and successfully made their way into the Underhold and fought past all Garrosh's traps and lieutenants to find Thrall confronting Garrosh and pleading him to cease his genocidal war.\nGarrosh refused to co-operate, calling Thrall weak and sadistically stating he'll take pleasure in destroying everything the Horde and Alliance had created. He even briefly tortured his old mentor physically, as his Dark Shaman had tortured the elements for miles around, thus causing them to strike out at Thrall when he attempted to call upon them. Thrall overcame this and faced Garrosh in melee combat, only to be easily beaten. Garrosh then turned his attention to the adventurers and engaged them in battle with the support of the True Horde, the iron stars, and the power of Y'Shaarj itself.\nThe battle took place not just in the Underhold, but also in Y'Shaarj's twisted pocket dimension, shaped to resemble places where immense Sha outbreaks had occurred on Pandaria. The adventurers held out, however, and in a last-ditch effort Garrosh became an avatar of the Old God by absorbing all the Heart's remaining power. But it still wasn't enough, and the evil Warchief, at last, collapsed from his wounds, the power of Y'Shaarj dissipating from his exhausted body, after which the Alliance, Horde and Pandaren leaders arrive to take him into custody and decide his fate.\nPossible futures.\nIn one of the most devastating possible outcomes \u2014 as shown by the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Garrosh lays waste to Stormwind City, leaving the entire harbor in ruins and corrupted by Y'Shaarj's power. He also impales the corpses of all &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;rebel Horde leaders&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Wrynn\"&gt;Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; family, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; to adorn a ruined stairway leading to the city proper and to serve as a dire warning for anyone that would oppose his new order. The same vision is encountered during the &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; fight against Garrosh.\nAnother vision shows him to be defeated lying on the ground surrounded by all the leaders of Horde and Alliance. The final vision of Garrosh shows him to be caged up in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; where Anduin Wrynn visited him, possibly referring to a scene from the \"&lt;a href=\"War%20Crimes\"&gt;War Crimes&lt;/a&gt;\" novel.\nDefeat and capture.\nAfter the Alliance/Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s defeated Garrosh and the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh was knocked to the ground and incapacitated. Thrall, leaning over Garrosh's body, told him of how disappointed he was in him, and prepared to deliver him a final blow: a death sentence carried out by the Doomhammer, but was stopped by &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who declared that Garrosh's punishment was not for him alone to decide. Thrall was also reluctant to allow the Alliance to decide Garrosh's fate. &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; suggested that Garrosh instead be taken to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; to stand trial for his heinous crimes against the peoples of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, to which Varian and Thrall agreed. Garrosh was then taken by Taran Zhu and the Shado-Pan out of the room.\nAfter the fall of Garrosh, the Warsong clan was shattered by what Garrosh had become.\nWar Crimes.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;his defeat&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh was transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; where a trial would be conducted for his fate. Caged below the temple, Garrosh dreamed about his &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; and his home, &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh wondered whether, if his father were still alive, he would be proud of his son.\nWhen everyone had arrived, Garrosh was brought forth before &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;the jury&lt;/a&gt; and the many witnesses. There he was told of the crimes he was being accused of. He merely clapped and made a mockery of the trial, comparing it to the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; and causing a great commotion. Once things were settled down, he was appointed a defender from the Horde who was &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. Baine tried his best to defend Garrosh but he did nothing to help his case. Baine suggested he open up to someone unless he had a death wish. Garrosh decided he would only speak to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. While cautious at first, Anduin accepted.\nMany times Garrosh and Anduin spoke, discussing many things. Anduin repeatedly tried to get Garrosh to repent and admit what he had done was wrong. Garrosh, however, would always turn things on the young boy and make him question things he held dearly. On the eve of the trial's verdict, Garrosh was extremely agitated. He did all he could to infuriate Anduin. Eventually, this worked, and Anduin nearly attacked him. Instead, he reached out and smacked the food from Garrosh's hands. Garrosh grabbed his arm and twisted it but Anduin told him the food was poisoned and he had saved his life, which made Garrosh release his arm. Before Anduin left the room, he asked the guards to remove the shackles from around the orc's legs so he could once again walk like a true warrior.\nBefore the verdict was given, Garrosh was given a chance to speak. He said &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and Baine both gave great arguments. He even spoke to Anduin and said how he believed people could change. Just as Garrosh was about to admit his regrets, he stunned the room by shouting he regrets nothing and would do it all over again. &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, who had been tinkering with the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; during all of this, created a portal that allowed him and Garrosh to escape to an &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; that was set 35 years in the past. Upon surfacing, they happened to be in .\nHellscream.\nGarrosh and Kairoz eventually made their way to , the lands of the . The plan was to locate the alternate counterpart of Garrosh's father, , and rally the orc clans into a &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;different kind of Horde&lt;/a&gt;. But Kairoz did not intend to stop there; he intended to use the shards of the &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; to find his way into many other worlds, and find other Hordes to send back to Azeroth, believing that this would give him &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite power&lt;/a&gt;. However, after learning that the shard would be able to take him back to Azeroth of his present time, Garrosh took the shard and stabbed Kairoz to death with it, declaring that orcs would never be used as pawns again.\nTraveling to a nearby Warsong encampment, Garrosh came forward as a stranger with no clan but claimed his heart was Warsong. Speaking boldly, he declared that he had come to prevent the Warsongs from becoming slaves, and declared that Grom would have led them willingly to such a fate. As a result of this insult, Garrosh was subjected to a \"&lt;a href=\"Mak%27Rogahn\"&gt;Mak'Rogahn&lt;/a&gt;\", a \"duel of will\", to prove his honor by fighting against four members of the Warsong clan who were supposed to be on guard duty and had failed to spot him. Garrosh defeated his opponents, with the spectators commenting that the stranger fought like Hellscream. Following Grom into his tent, Garrosh spoke vaguely about the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Curse\"&gt;fate that awaited the orcish people&lt;/a&gt;, that would enslave their race to &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;unseen masters&lt;/a&gt; by offering them a &lt;a href=\"blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;\"gift\"&lt;/a&gt;, and that Grom would be the first to take it because he could not tolerate another taking it first. Revealing the shard from the Vision of Time, Garrosh described the kinds of weapons he had used as Warchief of the Horde on Azeroth, including &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt;s. He called on Grom to rally the other orcish clans against &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;their true enemy&lt;/a&gt;, and suggested taking the shard to the &lt;a href=\"Stones%20of%20Prophecy\"&gt;Stones of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; to show the Warsong leader the truth of his words. Grom cautiously agreed, threatening to take Garrosh's head if he was lying; Garrosh replied that if he could not convince Grom of his sincerity, his life meant nothing.\nGarrosh watched as Grom took the shard into the presence of the elemental spirits who showed him, the elements, and the shaman who watched over the stones the truth of Garrosh's words: Gul'dan's bargain with &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, the drinking of the demons' blood (showing that Grom had indeed been the first to do so), the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, their defeat at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and the withdrawal from demon magics that left the orcish people broken. However, Garrosh intentionally hid the truth of Grom's redemption at &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Canyon\"&gt;Demon Fall Canyon&lt;/a&gt; by killing the elder shaman who had seen ahead and interrupting the vision before Grom could see it. When Grom emerged from the vision, he pledged that he would not allow his people to be slaves, and sent runners to the other clans to tell them of what he had learned. Grom called on Garrosh to stand at his side and fight with the Warsong, for there was a long road ahead; Garrosh proudly declared that he would fight to the death.\nGul'dan and the Stranger.\n sent a message to the orcs promising them untold power. In reply, sent Garrosh, disguised as a messenger, to Gul'dan wishing to know more about the cruel orc's intent. Gul'dan replied that he had seen a vision, and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;a Legion&lt;/a&gt; wanted the orcs as their vanguard. Much to Gul'dan's surprise, Garrosh knew serving this Legion meant drinking the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and enslaving the orcs to the demons. Angered at Garrosh's accusations of slavery, and proclaiming himself to be a god, Gul'dan had his guards remove the messenger from the premises. In response, Garrosh slew the guards. Gul'dan told Garrosh that in three days the orcs would drink from Mannoroth's blood on a mountaintop and from there march to victory. Garrosh lowered his hood, revealing his identity, and told Gul'dan that in three days Grommash will stand on the mountain as well and lead the orcs to embrace their &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;\"true\" fate&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn the fateful day when the orcs were poised to drink the &lt;a href=\"blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and become slaves to the Legion, Garrosh accompanied his father to confront Gul'dan and give the warlock the Warsong clan's answer to his offer of power. However in this universe, Grom rejected Gul'dan's encouragement to drink the blood, and Garrosh coordinated an ambush on the warlock and &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; himself using the orcs' new technology. Garrosh's Iron Star was launched at Mannoroth, distracting him for long enough to allow Grom to execute the demon. Garrosh pushed his father out the way of Mannoroth's dying explosion, saving Grom from the fate that felled him in the prime timeline. Pulling a stunned Gul'dan to his feet, Garrosh then drew a fel-bloodied &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; from the demon's corpse and tossed it to his father, who proclaimed their victory and independence \u2013 as conquerors, never slaves - to the gathered masses. This pivotal moment was all that Garrosh's interference in the timeline had led to, and thus the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; came to be.\nGarrosh gave schematics for machinery and rose to prominence as one of the Warlords of the Iron Horde, and the leader of the while his father holds the position of Warchief over all clans. He also enlisted &lt;a href=\"Pauli%20Rocketspark\"&gt;Pauli Rocketspark&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt; to build necessary technology for the Iron Horde's infrastructure within &lt;a href=\"Grimrail%20Depot\"&gt;Grimrail Depot&lt;/a&gt; and issued orders for the capture of . He had also been present when Grommash \"convinced\" and his Shadowmoon clan to join the Iron Horde. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; too saw his vision in Nagrand's mountains. When a &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;citadel&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of Tanaan began constructing, he suggested the name Hellfire.\nHe was personally responsible for the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of Azeroth. He ordered Zaela to claim &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as the forward base of the invading force, where a doomsday weapon capable of making &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; erupt and subsequently destroy large swaths of the continent - including &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; - is to be built.\nThe draenei under Yrel blamed him for the fall of and they knew him as \"the son of Hellscream\". Garrosh was located in &lt;a href=\"Grommashar\"&gt;Grommashar&lt;/a&gt; when the Horde and Alliance attacked the settlement. He began fighting with the adventurers, Durotan and Yrel, only to be stopped by Thrall who issued a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe pair clash at the Stones of Prophecy\u2014the site where Garrosh had first learned of his father's redemption. As the pair traded blows, Garrosh argues that everything he did was for the Horde; Thrall replies that Garrosh \"\"failed\" the Horde.\" In a fury, Garrosh attacks Thrall with his bare hands, yelling that Thrall made him Warchief. \"You left me to pick up your pieces! You failed ME!\" Having the upper hand, Garrosh remarks that Thrall \"never had the strength of a true warrior.\" Thrall counters that his strength is not as a warrior, but as a shaman, before calling upon the elements to lash out against Garrosh. Tightly bound by the elements, Garrosh roars that Thrall made him what he is; Thrall responds that Garrosh chose his own destiny. A single bolt of lightning ends Garrosh's life.\nLegacy.\nDespite his death, the effects of his actions would carry on for some time into the future. His meddling in the affairs of the alternate Draenor set off a chain of unbroken events that eventually led the Burning Legion back to Azeroth in their greatest invasion of the world yet. This war ultimately ended with the Legion's final defeat, but at the cost of Azeroth's own well-being.\nThe effects of his attack on Theramore and his quest for the Divine Bell left Jaina Proudmoore with deep mental scars that led to her leaving the Kirin Tor and continuing to blame the Horde as a whole for Garrosh's actions. These scars would manifest as echoes when Jaina was pulled into &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt;, the Blighted Lands.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Echo of Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; is faced within the &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; of Orgrimmar by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s seeking to attune a shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; to .\nShadowlands.\nAfter Garrosh's death, his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; was confined to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; to atone for his crimes. Due to his large amount of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; and refusal to repent, the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; used him as one of their reliable \"workhorses\" from which they could continue extracting the vital energy even as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; began suffering from the anima drought. The orc's soul was eventually thrown into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Soulrender%20Dormazain\"&gt;Soulrender Dormazain&lt;/a&gt; continued extracting his anima to fuel the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; armies. Garrosh proved resistant to Dormazain's usual torture methods, but the soulrender looked forward to spending millennia finding his weakness, estimating that Garrosh's rage was so exquisite that it could empower the Mawsworm's soul forges for eons. Garrosh, however, vowed that he would be sure to show Dormazain \"true rage\" should he ever be released from his bonds.\nThe heroes of Azeroth eventually arrived and confronted Dormazain, although Garrosh assumed that the heroes had come to watch him suffer. He vowed that they would never see him break even as Dormazain continued torturing him to unleash waves of anima against his enemies. When the soulrender was defeated, Garrosh broke free from his chains. Just as he had done during his trial in Pandaria, he declared that he would proudly make all of the choices in his life again and, when Dormazain insisted that Garrosh would submit, yelled that he would submit to no one\u2014not Dormazain, not &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, and not \"that coward Thrall\". He then picked up his torturer's blade and, with a final cry of \"For the Horde\", leapt at Dormazain and struck him, creating an explosion of anima that obliterated them both and left nothing behind of the former warchief's soul but a pile of ash.\nThrall later confided in the soul of his mother &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; that he still felt responsibility for Garrosh's actions, but she told him that Hellscream had chosen his own path. Thrall insisted that it was he who had set Garrosh \"on\" that path, but Draka disagreed, saying that all Thrall had done was offer him a choice. Either way, Garrosh's path had now ended, while Thrall's continued forward.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; replaced Garrosh in for the following quests:\nTactics.\nThe battle with Garrosh was arguably the most difficult of all the faction leaders, a major factor being his strategic position. At face value, the several entrances to Orgrimmar can seem appealing to a would-be raid, though Grommash Hold itself has been moved to the most populated area of Orgrimmar- leaving Garrosh flanked by a large amount of Horde players at almost all times. Garrosh's lack of elite guards is compensated by the &lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Herald\"&gt;Warchief's Herald&lt;/a&gt; that pulls with him, and the small amount of space allocated for the fight- leaving most of the raid susceptible to &lt;a href=\"AOE\"&gt;AOE&lt;/a&gt; and easy &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; from Horde players, most deadly being chain &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;s on healers or tanks. It is also important to note that vanishing or stealthing into the room is almost impossible as the pair of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Delegation%20Deathguard\"&gt;Forsaken Delegation Deathguard&lt;/a&gt;s in the Hold can see through stealth effects.\nGarrosh has a number of powerful abilities in his arsenal. In addition to a melee &lt;a href=\"cleave\"&gt;cleave&lt;/a&gt;, he possesses a &lt;a href=\"bladestorm\"&gt;bladestorm&lt;/a&gt;-like ability which slows his movement speed by 50%, dealing roughly 15000 damage to everyone in the vicinity every second, for six seconds total. Garrosh also uses berserker charge, dealing roughly 17k damage and knocking back the target by 15 yards. He also makes use of a &lt;a href=\"shockwave\"&gt;shockwave&lt;/a&gt; ability with an impressive range, dealing around 17k damage to all enemies to his front and stunning them for 5 seconds.\nThe fight with Garrosh is highly unpredictable due to the immediate outside interference. The near-constant threat of a large Horde defense force can make or break the attempt, and a wipe can be incredibly difficult to recover from.\nThe best way to deal with Garrosh is to strike at a time where Orgrimmar's player traffic will be lowest, and downing him as fast as possible within Grommash hold. Pulling him outside is ill-advised, as the Horde will become even more aware of their Warchief's predicament, and a massive wave of constant guard spawns in addition to this can prove disastrous. If the raid is successful, a quick escape is vital \u2014 like &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh is only on a 5-10 minute respawn timer.\nPlayers must also be careful of Horde players kiting &lt;a href=\"Gamon\"&gt;Gamon&lt;/a&gt; into the area now that he is a level 85 elite. Gamon will randomly charge players and use his battleshout to increase Garrosh's attack power.\nTime is a factor with most city leaders, and Garrosh is perhaps the most notable example as to why.\nPersonality.\nMuch like his father, Garrosh is a warrior-born. Though Garrosh was once highly ashamed of his heritage, a new fighting spirit was awakened within him following Thrall's revelations about who Grom truly was. His hot-headed nature came to the test during the war in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where Garrosh was quick to dismiss the more practical concerns during war in favor of a glorious battle, believing the fighting spirit of the Horde alone was enough to bring down the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. He has employed ruthless but effective tactics on the battlefield, as noted by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Thrall, who preferred to keep discreet tabs on his more dubious allies (such as those speculated to have ties with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;), Garrosh has no qualms about speaking his mind \u2014 making no effort to hide his low opinion on the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. \nGarrosh strongly believes in the value of honor, and in a fair fight. This had led him to show a distaste for the tactics of both the Forsaken and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and threatened the life of &lt;a href=\"Korm%20Blackscar\"&gt;Korm Blackscar&lt;/a&gt; after the events of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Front\"&gt;Broken Front&lt;/a&gt;. He personally executed &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt; for the murder of innocents and seems to have gleamed a number of Saurfang's creeds. Though he seems to have subsequently lost them.\nGarrosh is well-known for his fierce hatred of the Alliance. This appears to stem from his belief that the orcish people deserve a better quality of life than &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; can offer and views the Alliance as his primary obstacle in making this happen. To this end, he has expressed the desire for war with the Horde's rival faction multiple times, and was of the opinion that the Horde should simply take what it needs \u2014 both before and after his ascension to &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. His failures to easily attain whatever he wants for the Horde, the Alliance's tenacity in the war, and the doubt and disrespect the rest of the Horde show him, slowly push him towards insanity with his aggression extending to the Dragonflights and culminating in a plan of complete genocide of anything non-orc.\nHis disregard for a more diplomatic approach is applauded by many of the orcs, who view his uncompromising attitude in regards to securing his people a future to be inspiring. Garrosh himself is becoming aware of the tested bonds between him and his fellow leaders of the Horde, though he doesn't care, and indeed his solution to them is simply to make them enemies as well.\nChristie Golden on Garrosh.\nIn anticipation of the &lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20War\"&gt;Tides of War&lt;/a&gt; novel's release, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.joystiq.com\"&gt;WoW Insider&lt;/a&gt; had the opportunity to interview the author behind the novel, &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt;:\nGarrosh's personality in game and out has done a lot of shifting back and forth. We see him get a lot darker in Tides. How did you go about developing his character?\n\"\"I think Garrosh has, at his core, a weak personality. He was very hostile about his father and ashamed of his father, and it took Thrall to say, \"Hey, look, you know your dad did some pretty amazing things despite everything.\" He had to get that validation externally. He also had to prove himself in battle externally. And now he is surrounding himself with some very bad and dangerous advisors, externally.\"\n\"Because I think that at the core, he doesn't really know. He wants to do well. He wants to preserve the orcs and their pride and their history. But I think he is actually a rather malleable person whose opinions can change. He doesn't have a strong core.\"\n\"I think the main difference -- Jaina has a very strong core. And when adversity and disaster and personal torment rip her down to nothing but that core, that core is still intact. It's hurt, but it's intact. And Garrosh doesn't really have a strong core. So what he believes kind of changes depending on what the situation is and who's talking. And I think that does not a good strong leader make.\"\"\nAppearance.\nIn his first appearance in the Burning Crusade, Garrosh used a generic Mag'har model with scars across his cheeks, a calm expression, and a topknot likely intended to reference his father's long hair. Grom's model was also depicted like this in the vision shown by Thrall due to model limitations. His trading card game model was an exact illustration of his in game model. In Garrosh's next appearance in the comic \"&lt;a href=\"Threat%21\"&gt;Threat!&lt;/a&gt;\", Garrosh was shown with a huge body and small head as all orcs were depicted in that issue. In \"Cataclysm\", Garrosh's model was changed to a hulking yellow-eyed orc with a smaller sized head (likely in reference to the comic), his jaw was tattooed, and his head was now fully shaved.\nUltimately, Garrosh's appearance (bulky with a shaved head) had become practically the inverse of Grom's (lean with long hair).\nGarrosh's use of the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; left scars on his skin in the form of dark tracings resembling webby fingers.\nGarrosh's armor.\nMannoroth's skull has been moved to Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar's Valley of Strength. There, the skull can be seen as part of Garrosh's throne. Part of the tusks were cut off and fashioned into Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Tusks%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;new shoulder armor&lt;/a&gt;. The skull on Garrosh's left shoulderpad originated from a huge predator slain by the orc himself.\nQuotes.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nScourge Invasion.\nMy arms grow restless, anxiously waiting to drive my axes into the skull of the Lich King.

This is the last major battle in \"\".\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Garrosh, son of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, first learned of his father's heroism when Thrall encountered the young orc in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The seeds of pride were planted. Garrosh spearheaded Horde victories in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and, as Warchief, consolidated Horde power amidst the chaos of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. But his visions of orc supremacy by any means have brought the armies of the world crashing down upon Orgrimmar . . . a final reckoning that Garrosh himself awaits with brutal relish.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Even though you fight him in his throne room beneath the city of Orgrimmar, far away from the verdant shores of Pandaria, Garrosh is still the ultimate villain of the Pandaria expansion, and we felt that it was important to forge a strong connection to the Pandaria story arc within the encounter itself. As Garrosh wields the power of Y\u2019Shaarj\u2014origin of all the sha\u2014players must battle through some of the most memorable locations where the sha manifested in Pandaria. At the end, when his back is up against a wall and he is cornered in his own lair, Garrosh ends up facing the same sort of choice that once doomed his father.\"\nOverview.\nGarrosh calls in Kor'kron soldiers, while Siege Engineers try to activate Iron Stars that crush players and orcs in their path. When Garrosh reaches 10% health, he draws upon the Heart to heal himself. Garrosh periodically pulls all players into the Realm of Y'Shaarj, where they must interrupt his efforts to draw power from the Heart. When reaching 10% health a second time, Garrosh fully drains the heart, empowering all his abilities until his defeat.\nAbilities.\nStage One: The True Horde.\nGarrosh, wielding his new weapon with his True Horde and siege machines at his disposal will destroy any intruders. The True Horde join the battle more frequently as the fight progresses. This phase will continue until Garrosh reaches 10% health remaining.\nIntermission: Realm of Y'Shaarj.\nPeriodically the call of Y'shaarj will transport Garrosh and the players into the Realm of Y'shaarj for 60 sec. Garrosh will Absorb Energy from the Heart of Y'shaarj until players have defeated all Minions of Y'shaarj inside the realm and interrupt Garrosh.\nStage Two: Corruption of Y'shaarj.\nAfter absorbing the Power of Y'shaarj, Garrosh will heal to full health as Y'shaarj bestows Garrosh with new powers.\nStage Three: MY WORLD.\nAt 10% health Garrosh will absorb the remaining power of Y'shaarj, gaining full energy, empowering all of his abilities.\nStage Four: MY DESTINY (Mythic Only).\nOn Mythic mode, at 0% health Garrosh will pull himself and the party into a ruined version of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and heal to 60% HP.\nStrategy.\nThis final boss of \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" is a lengthy, three phase &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt; with many &lt;a href=\"add%20fight\"&gt;adds&lt;/a&gt;. In the first phase, the raid will handle waves of Kor'kron soldiers and massive, deadly Iron Star constructs. At 10% health, Garrosh will heal to full and begin absorbing corruption from the Heart of Y'shaarj; players will alternate between journeys to a dream realm to defeat sha minions and slow his corruption, and dealing with his increasing damaging, mind control, and sha-spawning abilities in the real world. Once brought low again, Garrosh will unleash the full power of his abilities in a final burn phase. Heroic mode adds an additional phase after that.\nStage One: The True Horde.\nThe tank who is on Garrosh should stand on the metal plate on the \"top\" of the giant Horde crest in the middle of the room, with Garrosh between the tank and the throne. The other tank should stack the adds on Garrosh so they will be hit by AoE attacks, cleaves, legendary cloak procs, etc. No &lt;a href=\"tank%20swap\"&gt;tank swap&lt;/a&gt;s are required in this phase. The melee should stack on Garrosh and attack him. The raid leader should place raid markers flanking each side of the main entrance opposite the throne, one on the left, one on the right, within range of each other and Garrosh - all the ranged players should stack together on one of these markers.\nWhen the adds appear, damage them to roughly 50% health, so that the Iron Stars will finish them off. Farseer Wolf Riders are high priority targets, as they will attempt to heal Garrosh and the adds. Keep them interrupted and burn them down if an Iron Star is not handy to kill them.\nWhenever the Iron Stars start charging up, an assigned ranged damage dealer should run to the left and kill the Siege Engineer to prevent the star on the raid's side of the room from activating. This player must return to the raid as quickly as possible, so ideally a class with high mobility is selected for this task, and &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Gateway\"&gt;Demonic Gateway&lt;/a&gt; should be used if a warlock is present. The other Iron Star will roll across the throne side of the room and deal massive damage to anything that it runs over. When it starts rolling, players should use &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt;s, such as a warrior's &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Roar\"&gt;Dragon Roar&lt;/a&gt; or elemental shaman's &lt;a href=\"Thunderstorm\"&gt;Thunderstorm&lt;/a&gt;, to push the adds into the Iron Star's path - while making sure to get out of its path themselves.\nGarrosh will periodically throw a Desecrated Weapon at one of the ranged players, creating a large void zone. Whenever this happens, the ranged group should move to their other marker, and destroy the Desecrated Weapon to remove the void zone. It is very important that melee players stay within melee range of Garrosh, otherwise he may throw a Desecrated Weapon at the melee player, which would disrupt the raid's positioning.\nOnce Garrosh reaches 10% health, he will regain all his health and speak some dialogue before beginning the intermission. Take advantage of this time to take out any adds, especially any Farseer Wolf Riders, since any adds remaining will still be present after the intermission ends.\nMany raids may find that their fights last long enough that a &lt;a href=\"bloodlust%20effect\"&gt;bloodlust effect&lt;/a&gt; can be used at the start of this phase, or when the first wave of adds arrives, and be usable again in phase 3. This depends on the raid's damage output - a raid that will reach phase 3 in under 10 minutes will want to save it for later.\nIntermission: Realm of Y'shaarj.\nIntermissions occur periodically during phase 2; the first one marks the transition out of phase 1. Each time, the raid is sent to a random one of three \"dream\" locations, filled with &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. Each location is organized in a roughly linear or forked layout, with Garrosh at the end of each. Raids should kill all mobs as quickly as possible to halt his corruption energy gain, aiming to limit it to 24 per intermission, since he gains new powers every 25. Players should also run through the yellow orbs that appear when adds die to gain damage reduction for the rest of the intermission, though not at the expense of quick progress.\nThe raid's groups should be assigned \"left\" or \"right\" beforehand, since two of the locations require splitting the raid:\nOnce all the adds are down, Garrosh will become attackable and begin chain casting Annihilate. All players must avoid this purple cone &lt;a href=\"one-shot\"&gt;one-shot&lt;/a&gt;, while healers handle the heavy AoE component of the attack and everyone else assaults Garrosh. Each intermission lasts 60 seconds total, so the sooner adds are killed, the more time is available to damage the boss.\nStage Two: Corruption of Y'shaarj.\nGarrosh will no longer summon the Kor'kron adds or Iron Stars that he summoned in phase 1. If there are any left, finish them off. Instead, he will start to use abilities he gained from Y'shaarj. Periodically, Garrosh will trigger another intermission, which heals him for 10% health each time and allows him to gain more corruption. Intermissions do not provide escape from overwhelming situations in the throne room; all conditions and enemies are still present upon return from each one.\nTanks must begin swapping in this phase to allow their Gripping Despair stacking DoTs to drop off. When Garrosh uses Whirling Corruption, all healers and DPS, melee included, should stack at maximum range from the boss to reduce incoming damage and maximize AoE healing.\nGarrosh will continue to throw Desecrated Weapons. The raid may choose to kill these just as in phase 1, at the cost of damage that could be on the boss and other threats. Alternatively, because the danger of Iron Stars no longer restricts the raid's movement, the raid may simply move out of the void zone each time and let the Weapon remain, at the cost of slowly diminishing safe space in the room. In this case, ranged players should try to remain in positions where a new zone restricts movement as little as possible, such as next to walls, adjacent to the last zone's location. Weapons dropped in problematic locations can still be destroyed if necessary.\nMost importantly, after Garrosh uses Touch of Y'Shaarj, all damage dealers must immediately identify &lt;a href=\"mind%20control\"&gt;mind control&lt;/a&gt;led players and burn them down to break the spell. During this time the victims will attempt to cast Touch of Y'Shaarj on new targets, and therefore must be interrupted or crowd controlled to prevent the condition from spreading exponentially. The usual mind control rules of avoiding large &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s or delayed damage effects apply, to avoid killing allies after they are free.\nEvery 25 energy Garrosh gains during intermissions, an ability become empowered, adding additional mechanics. Ideally, the first intermission will yield no empowered abilities and each subsequent one will grant him only one, allowing more time to focus on the boss without as many distractions and hazards. The expectation is to reach phase 3 before 100 corruption.\nAfter 25 corruption, Whirling Corruption will still require distance from the boss and close proximity to healers, but players will need to dodge purple swirls indicating missile strikes, which may make it difficult to remain stacked. Afterward, the resulting adds must be separated and killed individually to avoid healing and empowering adjacent ones. Tanks should remain on Garrosh, allowing damage dealers to pull adds away from each other without &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; problems.\nPast 50 corruption, mind controlled players become immune to &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, including stuns, but not interrupts. Players must make sure to have interrupts coordinated to prevent any victims from completing a cast of Touch of Y'Shaarj - a good idea even before empowerment, but now essential. At 75 energy, it will no longer be possible to completely kill Desecrated Weapons, so the raid will need to shift to the mobile strategy described above if it is not already in effect.\n100 energy should not be reached much earlier than phase 3. At that point, healers must be sure to top off any tank whose Gripping Despair stacks are about to fall off, in preparation for the extra damage from Explosive Despair. Tanks may want to have defensive cooldowns ready as the Explosive Despair damage increases with each subsequent tank swap. This mechanic acts as a soft enrage timer, since either the DoT or the Explosive Despair will eventually one-shot the tanks.\nPhase 2 ends when Garrosh reaches 10% health.\nStage Three: MY WORLD.\nGarrosh will say some more dialogue and heal 20% of his health. While he is speaking, the raid should use a &lt;a href=\"bloodlust%20effect\"&gt;bloodlust effect&lt;/a&gt;, potions, and offensive cooldowns to burn Garrosh as hard as possible. After he finishes his speech, his corruption will jump to maximum, and all his abilities will become empowered.\nThe abilities are the same as if Garrosh had reached 100 corruption energy during phase 2, so the same strategies apply. Only the tanking is likely to be affected by the transition, with the arrival of Explosive Despair. Depending on tanking and healing, in this phase it's also an option for one or both tanks to pick up Minion of Y'Shaarj adds without killing them, taking more damage but allowing damage dealers to focus on the boss. Tanks will want to decide ahead of time how they want to handle the adds and swap mechanics in this phase.\nThis phase will continue until Garrosh reaches 0% health resulting in victory or, in mythic mode, phase 4.\nStage Four: MY DESTINY.\nOn mythic mode, when stage 3 ends, Garrosh will do some RP before teleporting the raid to the Vision of Ruined Stormwind, at which point he will heal to 60% health. Be advised that the fight does not stop during the RP, and any lingering mechanics from stage 3 (Adds, MC's, etc.) will still need to be dealt with until the teleport happens.\nGarrosh will cast Malice, which the raid will have to make sure is properly soaked. Garrosh will also call a bombardment from a nearby Horde fleet, forcing players to watch for AoEs to ensure they are not hit. During this Bombardment, Garrosh will check for any clumped players and summon an Iron Star upon seeing any. There must be one clumped group to summon an Iron Star, which is used to interrupt Garrosh's cast of Manifest Rage. If Garrosh is allowed to finish casting Manifest Rage, several Manifestations of Rage adds will appear and soon wipe the party.\nThis phase will continue until Garrosh is defeated.\nQuotes.\n\"Thrall calls the elements to his side, but is surrounded by a dark void.\"\n\"Thrall casts thunderstorm to get out of the void.\"\n\"Thrall charges at Garrosh, and gets cleaved into the front of the room after his attacks are repeatedly parried. Thrall falls to the floor injured as Garrosh laughs at him.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The event evolved through different phases and included the gathering of war supplies by both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players, epic and hardcore quest chains for the elite guilds, and ultimately a ten-hour long war at the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. The first server to finish the event was on January 23, 2006.\nAs of February 6, 2009 (&lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8a\"&gt;patch 3.0.8a&lt;/a&gt;), the Ahn'Qiraj gates will automatically be open on all new future realms. The related quests were removed in \"\".\n\"An insectoid menace awaits in Silithus in the ancient, brooding city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; that represents a danger to both Horde and Alliance and their place in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, no forces can preemptively deal with the threat unless they can breach the enchanted Scarab Wall and open the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj closed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe world event quest.\nOpening the gates was a process that required the cooperation of hundreds of players from all races and factions, involving monsters and quests from all corners of the world map.\nThe Gates of Ahn'Qiraj were sealed by powerful magic, and to open them, an elite guild had to brave a number of trials to reconstruct a long-lost artifact: the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. This scepter could open the walls, but behind them a mighty Qiraji army waited. To repel it, the combined military might of both the Alliance and Horde had to be ready outside the wall, and to be ready a great number of supplies had to be gathered \u2014 food, bandages, metals and herbs. Once all was ready, the player who held the Scepter could open the gates, and the Ahn'Qiraj War began.\nRestoring the scepter questline.\nRestoring &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; involved a &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands%20quest%20chain\"&gt;long series of quests&lt;/a&gt; that required the efforts of a well-coordinated raiding guild, supported by other top guilds within a faction. Because of the reputation requirements of a certain farming quest (see step three below), one player from each side was typically designated as that faction's scepter-bearer.\nIn addition to the scepter, the questline gave epic awards including the legendary mount &lt;a href=\"Black%20Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystal\"&gt;Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal&lt;/a&gt;. Parts of the questline could still be completed after the gates were open, however the mount could only be received during the 10-hour war event.\nHere's a list of the quests that gave rewards:\nCompleted scepter.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bang%20a%20Gong%21\"&gt;Bang a Gong!&lt;/a&gt; quest (and therefore, the legendary mount) was only available during the main war event which occurred upon the initial ringing of the gong and last 10 hours thereafter. This mount is usable both inside and outside of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, whereas other Resonating Crystals are only usable inside the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj. Once the war event was completed, the legendary mount can no longer be obtained by any means.\n&lt;a href=\"Treasure%20of%20the%20Timeless%20One\"&gt;Treasure of the Timeless One&lt;/a&gt; could not be completed until after the war event has finished, at which time an NPC will spawn next to the gong that offered the completion of the questline.\nGathering war supplies.\nWhile the elite guilds completed their mission, the entire server had to work together to gather war supplies for the combined army of the two nations. This stage of the gate opening could easily last several (real-time) months due to the number of supplies that had to be gathered:\n\"In parentheses is the number of signets awarded on \"repeats\" of the quest. The first time a given quest was turned in by a given player, that player would always be awarded 10 signets.\"\nBoth factions need to gather:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; needs to gather in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Ward\"&gt;Military Ward&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; needs to gather in The &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;:\nEach item had its own NPC for turn-in. On the Alliance side, all turn-ins were in the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Ward\"&gt;Military Ward&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, while the Horde turn-ins were in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Spirits\"&gt;Valley of Spirits&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Each turn-in required a full stack of the item (10 or 20, depending on the item), and awarded 10 Commendation Signets and a box of the first time you hand in one stack. For the second hand-in of the same item, the amount of signets was dependent on the level of the item - high-level items still gave 10 signets each time, mid-level items gave 7 signets, and 5 signets from the third hand-in on. Low-level items only gave 1 signet starting with the third turn-in. \nBoxes of Ahn'Qiraj War Effort Supplies contained various items appropriate to the turn-in level (eg. a lvl 23 green for silk bandages, a lvl 40 green for thick leather) and several types of &lt;a href=\"scroll\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt;s. The Commendation Signets could be turned in for more supply boxes or for reputation with one of the five major factions. The five commendation officers, one for each race in the &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;, was located in the same area as well as one in each capital city.\nFinally, there was an NPC patrolling the area ( for the Alliance, for the Horde) that accepted Commendation Signets in return for a larger batch of supplies. He could also update the player on the progress being made in all of the turn-ins. An NPC for the opposite faction ( in Ironforge, in Orgrimmar) that could tell you about progress on that side. The progress was also tracked on an offical website created for the event.\nOpening the gates.\nOnce all the necessary war supplies had been gathered, the combined forces of the Alliance and the Horde began transporting NPCs, equipment, and supplies to &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Five days passed while the supplies were sent by &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; (this couldn't actually be seen occurring); as the days passed, the stockpiles of supplies that had been accumulating slowly diminish until everything was in place, at which point the holder of the Scepter could ring the mighty gong to cause the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; to open. This caused a ten-hour-long continent-wide event to begin, preceded by a global message to everyone on the server:\nThe most immediate effect, of course, was that the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj opened and powerful monsters and bosses began pouring out. &lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt; appeared, along with a number of very large Anubisath and Qiraji epic monsters that the combined player and NPC armies had to defeat. Once this was done, raiding guilds could proceed into the 20- and 40-man instances at their leisure. In addition, anyone with a complete Scepter of the Shifting Sands who rang the gong again during this event received a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Qiraji%20Resonating%20Crystal\"&gt;Black Qiraji Resonating Crystal&lt;/a&gt; that is used to summon a cross-faction, fast legendary mount.\nWhile the fray at the Gates was underway, large floating obelisks called &lt;a href=\"Resonating%20Crystal%20Formation\"&gt;Resonating Crystal Formation&lt;/a&gt;s reportedly appeared in &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barrens%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkshore%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. These obelisks would alternately mind-control player-characters in their vicinity and spawn various Anubisath Warbringers and &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter nine hours, the forces of the Alliance and Horde meet at the southern exit of Cenarion Hold, where High Overlord Saurfang rallies them to battle against the Qiraji at the Scarab Wall.\nSaurfang then leads the combined armies to the Scarab Wall, where waves of &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Anubisath%20Warbringer\"&gt;Colossal Anubisath Warbringer&lt;/a&gt;s begin attacking. After an hour of battle, the crystals and their spawn disappeared, bringing the Ahn'Qiraj War to an end.\nFrom this point forward, the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj will remain open.\nTime-limited opening quests.\nThere were 3 time-limited delivery quests available in &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; during the 10-hour opening event that became available following the death of a Colossus mob at each of the 3 hives in Silithus. Each of these quests, and the related quest giver, vanished at the end of the opening event.

All mobs spawned during the event were respawned as well. The supplies did \"not\" need to be gathered, and if the quest chain was done previously one would need to simply turn it in and re-open the gates, giving them the mount and &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Lord\"&gt;Scarab Lord&lt;/a&gt; title.\nPermanent \"closure\" of the event.\nOn February 6, 2009, sometime after &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8a\"&gt;patch 3.0.8a&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bornakk\"&gt;Bornakk&lt;/a&gt; posted on the forums that the Ahn'Qiraj gates will automatically be open on all new future realms. He would also later clarify in the thread that there are no plans to have an alternative method to obtain the Black Qiraji Battle Tank.\nOn February 11, 2009, a day after &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.9\"&gt;patch 3.0.9&lt;/a&gt;, was the world's first realm to be opened in this way.\nThe final step of closure came with the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;. The commendation officers in all major cities were removed.\nHowever, in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, the resource collectors and quests were unexpectedly brought back. Though it was simply a glitch and has been fixed, it shows the programming for the AQ War Effort still existed.\nThe underlying programming was finally been removed by the expansion. All servers now have the gates open, and &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; was retuned into a 10-player raid.\nQuests.\nThe following is a list of quests associated with the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj world event. Once the gates have been opened on your server these quests will no longer be available."}

Sitting high above its surroundings, the gates have long served as the traditional entryway to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, the home of &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;. As such, it remains sacred among the region's &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, and represents one of the most prominent locations in Stormheim.\nOrnate as they are imposing, the gates themselves consist of a multi-tiered plateau on the outside, along with a number of inner hallways. The latter grant access to both the Halls of Valor, as well as Odyn's &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Trial of Valor&lt;/a&gt;. The only other means of reaching the halls of Odyn are with the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; would be assaulted by a force of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s accompanied by their &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt; allies. Leading the traitorous &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; was the self-proclaimed &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt;. Intent on securing the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; for the Legion, Skovald would eventually mount a direct assault on the Gates of Valor in order to reach the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls&lt;/a&gt; within. A defense was led by the &lt;a href=\"Thorignir\"&gt;Thorignir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"storm%20drake\"&gt;storm drake&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; himself, and one of his chosen &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. After occupying much of the plateau, the demons' advance was gradually halted, and their portals destroyed to prevent reinforcement.\nUltimately, Skovald himself was confronted at the very top of the Gates. Defeated and almost slain, he would charge forward alone into the Halls of Valor in search of the Aegis, closely pursued by his adversaries. After a final battle in the Halls, the God-King was finally slain and the Aegis of Aggramar secured, thus crushing the demonic assault.\nDuring the war, the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; were tracking the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt; at the Gates of Valor. With the help of the adventurers, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; retrieved &lt;a href=\"Chipped%20Titan%20Disc%20Fragment\"&gt;Chipped Titan Disc Fragment&lt;/a&gt; from the area.\nAt one point, the &lt;a href=\"Felskorn\"&gt;Felskorn&lt;/a&gt; have assembled at the gates of the Hall of Valor, including a massive &lt;a href=\"Mo%27arg%20brute\"&gt;brute&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Cleaver%20Northamel\"&gt;Cleaver Northamel&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; sent their troops to kill them and collect the blood of the demon.\nAs the war continued in other parts of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Burning Legion would eventually once more turn its attention to Stormheim. During this &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Stormheim\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt;, the Gates of Valor were targeted by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Commander%20Alexius\"&gt;Lord Commander Alexius&lt;/a&gt; following a successful feint at &lt;a href=\"Shield%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Shield's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. Alexius's &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Command%20Ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; heavily bombarded the gates, as mortal champions fought on to board the vessel and desperately drive back the attack. The death of Alexius in the subsequent battle marked the failure of the overall assault, and Odyn himself delivered the final blow by plunging his spear into the command ship, destroying it."}

The Champion of the Banshee Queen immediately traveled to meet with Sylvanas as she was discussing the creation of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons with &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;Gallywix's Pleasure Palace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe invitation asked Sylvanas for a one day, 12-hour cease-fire, from dawn until dusk, in the Arathi Highlands so that family and friends torn apart by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; rampage during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; could once again meet. She initially rejected the idea because of her own experiences trying to reconnect with her living sisters, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, and how all it did was stir up ghosts best left at peace, and proceeded to crumple the missive. However, Nathanos convinced her it was an opportunity to \"gift\" this event to her people so that when she wanted to conquer &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, her people would be more admissible to the idea, either because they would hate the living even more or, he theorized, they would see it as an opportunity to bring the loved ones they thought they'd never see again into the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas agreed that Nathanos made a good argument, uncrumpled the missive, and accepted the invitation. She, however, stated that only the members of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; would attend the meeting. Sylvanas also saw this as an opportunity to befriend King Anduin and then eventually use that to take &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas then returned to the Undercity to lay specifics of the meeting - each member of the Desolate Council was to provide five names of people in Stormwind. The Banshee Queen, Blightcaller, and 200 &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s were to be stationed at &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, while 200 &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;'s walls. 25 Forsaken &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and 25 &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; priests mounted on flying mounts were to be patrolling the meeting field located halfway from both structures. At its center were to be Archbishop Faol and his assistant, a disguised &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, leading the meeting. In case of a sudden retreat, a horn was to be sounded and the respective faction &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; was to be lifted, saying the participants to return to the Thoradin's Wall and Stromgarde Keep immediately. In terms of exchanging gifts, each item was to be examined and placed on a table. The items would then be collected, checked and later distributed. Touching their counterparts was also allowed. The topic for discussion was their previous shared life. The Forsaken's existence with Sylvanas in the Undercity and humans' current life in Stormwind was not to be discussed and the two priests were to make sure of it. The rules did not include spies so Anduin used and Sylvanas the &lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt; to observe and report the opposite faction's actions.\nThe event initially had no particular label to it, other than being referred to as \"a gathering,\" but as Anduin and Calia were organizing the invitations for the human participants, they found themselves calling it \"the Gathering.\"\nJust prior to the start of the meeting, Warchief Sylvanas and King Anduin met in the middle of the field. He wanted her to confirm that she would harm no Alliance member, which she complied she wouldn't. While unintended on his part and to her shock at his courage to do so, he also bluntly asked whether she had betrayed &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Once she stated that Varian's fate was sealed no matter what she did due to the Legion's numbers, he indicated his satisfaction and in turn, promised no harm to any Horde member.\nThe event.\nThe participants left Thoradin's Wall and Stromgarde and walked towards the spot of the meeting. As they arrived, they placed their gifts on tables and waited. Faol gave them last a chance to leave and five humans did so. Alonsus then called the names of the participants and they reunited. Some, however, left upon being called. Calia, joyful, thanked the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; for this moment. She then joined &lt;a href=\"Elsie%20Benton\"&gt;Elsie Benton&lt;/a&gt;, the Desolate Council's Prime Governor, and prompted her to wave to the young Stormwind king standing on the walls of Stromgarde Keep. Upon witnessing this, Anduin understood this was &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt;'s wife, waved back and even bowed. As Sylvanas witnessed this, she almost sounded the horn to retreat but stopped herself.\nAs the day went, &lt;a href=\"Parqual%20Fintallas\"&gt;Parqual Fintallas&lt;/a&gt; recognized Calia Menethil beneath her hooded cloak and saw it as a reason and opportunity to defect into the Alliance. He asked Calia for a blessing and whispered to her, saying, \"We need you now. It's time. You'll see. Be ready.\" Shortly after, Parqual, his daughter &lt;a href=\"Philia%20Fintallas\"&gt;Philia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Felstone\"&gt;Felstone&lt;/a&gt; family began to casually walk towards Stromgarde Keep, where the Alliance were stationed. As Calia saw this unfold she realized what was happening, and deciding that she had to take responsibility as heir to the throne to lead the people of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, revealed her true identity and took it upon herself to try to convince the other Forsaken on the field to join the Alliance, first speaking with Elsie.\nSylvanas caught wind of the defection as it unfolded before her as she stood, watching, on Thoradin's Wall, and called back the Forsaken on the field. Shortly thereafter, one of her priests came to her having identified the unhooded Calia, on the field. Sylvanas let loose her dark rangers on bats and ordered them to kill all Forsaken present in the field, including those running back towards Thoradin's Wall. In response, Calia became determined to shield them with the Light from Sylvanas as best she could, even if it cost her life.\nSylvanas proceeded to mount her own bat and shot Calia in the heart through the back before Anduin could reach her.\nConsequences.\nFor the Horde.\nThe Desolate Council members who were rejected by their living relatives and returned to Sylvanas before the Gathering began were spared the slaughter. Sylvanas remarked that they were now truly desolate and that she trusted them. After word of the slaughter reached the Undercity, the Forsaken demanded answers from Sylvanas. In turn, she had &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Lansing\"&gt;Annie Lansing&lt;/a&gt; reveal how her own mother had callously rejected her at the Gathering, that Anduin had allowed Calia Menethil to be present on the field as a priestess, and how Calia had encouraged the fallen members of the Desolate Council to defect to the Alliance. When someone in the crowd revealed that she had killed those attempting to return to the Forsaken, Sylvanas remarked that she wouldn't put the rest of the Forsaken at risk due to being uncertain of their loyalty, how the Forsaken must be protected above all costs, and that she would ensure any sacrifice to protect them. By reforming her actions as a defense of the Forsaken as a people, Sylvanas was able to sway the majority of the Forsaken to her cause.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; felt Sylvanas' decision to kill the defectors as appropriate since they were traitors to the Horde. He did feel that she shouldn't have executed those returning because of what she \"thought\" they would do.\nFor the Alliance.\nGuided by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin and &lt;a href=\"Faol\"&gt;Faol&lt;/a&gt; were able to use the light to return Calia to life as an undead. Upon her resurrection Anduin questioned her actions on the field, wondering if she had deceived him to be allowed to attend. However, Calia was able to reassure the young king that she merely followed her heart and had genuinely wanted to help Parqual and the others, but had not truly understood how her actions could have sparked a war. With his heart made clear, Anduin personally led the Alliance in returning to the Arathi Highlands and buried the deceased at an &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;unnamed graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, in a private conversation between Genn and Anduin, the young king revealed that Sylvanas' actions at the Gathering had convinced him that she was truly lost. Genn on the other hand, no longer believed that all sapient undead were evil or one and the same after having observed the participants' interactions on the field, stating that the Desolate Council unknowingly put a target on their backs by simply existing and that Sylvanas would have done something to them sooner or later.\nSometime later Anduin would decide that the appropriate response against Sylvanas for her actions at the Gathering would be to order to sneak many of their spies within &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. However this decision would end up backfiring against the Alliance as while the sheer numbers and sightings of the Alliance spies forced the guards of Orgrimmar into a state of paranoia, Sylvanas and Saurfang were able to use their presence to their advantage by tricking the Alliance into believing that the Horde intended to conquer &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Believing the information to be genuine, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; sent the Sentinels to prevent this from occurring and with the bulk of the night elf military away the Horde focused on their true target - the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;conquest&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nScarlet Opportunity.\nPropaganda by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; claims that the massacre never actually occurred and that Anduin and Sylvanas staged the event in order to drum up sympathy for the Forsaken and to lure out, murder, and raise Calia."}

But when natural enemies like &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; converge, there's sure to be bloodshed. And in the shadows, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; plans on making matters worse for the Horde!\nPlot.\nThrall, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt;, and some of the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; bodyguards disembark from their newly-arrived &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to stand in front of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina tells the assembled parties that it is time to lay down their weapons and enter Theramore Keep.\nMeanwhile, in the clouds high above the island, &lt;a href=\"Stasia%20Fallshadow\"&gt;Stasia&lt;/a&gt; scolds Garona for not attacking Varian and Anduin while they were in the open. Garona throws back that the attendants of the summit were supposed to be unarmed but are still carrying their weapons, and either way the cloaked figures are impossible to tell apart due to the storm summoned by Stasia's &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the ground, Varian and Thrall are busy staring dramatically at each other until Anduin steps between them and throws his bow on the ground, encouraging the two leaders to do the same with &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by the \"young diplomat\", Thrall asks Anduin to lead the way to the keep. Jaina accompanies them and mentions that the weapons will be carried by trusted guards to be stored in an armory. Valeera remains behind for a moment with her old master Rehgar and quietly tells him that fate is laughing at them. While walking with Anduin, Valeera explains to him that Rehgar used to own her and Varian when they were gladiators. Meanwhile, Rehgar tells Thrall that while he knew Lo'Gosh had been well trained, he never expected him to turn out to be Stormwind's lost king. Thrall muses that he and Varian have similar backgrounds in that they are both gladiators who escaped their servitude to play larger roles in shaping &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s future.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt; he calls \"&lt;a href=\"Snubnose\"&gt;Snubnose&lt;/a&gt;\" are flying through the storm and approaching &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s eastern coast. Med'an is unable to shift the storm and correctly suspects that it's not natural. Since the weather makes it impossible to see where they're heading, he decides to fly low and skim the waves. &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; would've warned him not to do so, but Med'an decides he shouldn't care what Meryl says since the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; lied to him about his mother. A few moments later, however, a huge tentacle erupts from the water to grab hold of Med'an and Snubnose. Med'an quickly severs the tendril with his axe and summons lightning to drive the creature back into the depths before continuing on his journey.\nInside Theramore Keep, Jaina, Varian, Anduin, Valeera, Thrall, Garrosh, and Rehgar now sit assembled around a table. Jaina explains to Thrall how Varian was kidnapped and ensorcelled before the previous summit. Rehgar recounts how, after Lo'Gosh and &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt; escaped, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; realized that his heart was with them rather than the profit he could have made from their service. He then knew that he had had his fill of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt; and instead offered his services to Thrall. Valeera points out that Rehgar let Lo'Gosh and Broll escape but sold her to &lt;a href=\"Helka%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Helka Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;. Rehgar reminds the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; that she and Broll fought constantly, that Helka offered a fortune for her, and that she would have received a leadership role in Helka's team. Rehgar then asks where Broll is, and Varian explains that he has left for urgent business in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall recounts his own story of escaping from slavery in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Valeera reminisces about how Varian defeated &lt;a href=\"Sparkeye\"&gt;Sparkeye&lt;/a&gt;'s gladiator team followed by &lt;a href=\"Hyku%20Steeledge\"&gt;Hyku Steeledge&lt;/a&gt;, and Rehgar recounts how Lo'Gosh even then showed signs of being a king by refusing to fight for others' entertainment but willingly fighting to protect his companions.\nJaina, Thrall, and Varian begin to discuss how to ease the tensions between the orcs and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. Thrall explains that the orcs lack certain resources in their new home and are in constant conflict with the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; over the harvesting of timber. Varian and Thrall conclude that Alliance merchants might gladly trade their timber to the orcs, and in exchange the Horde can offer &lt;a href=\"copper\"&gt;copper&lt;/a&gt; from deposits near &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and exotic animal hides from the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh questions why the orcs should need to make concessions when they can simply take what they want by force, but Anduin points out that he could gain much greater profit with a few words than by wasting his resources and warriors in battle.\nMed'an reaches &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and comes upon Garona and her &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; captors gathered on an island. He lands Snubnose on the neighboring island and begins swimming towards his mother when the cultists are suddenly attacked by huge &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. One of the beasts begins flying toward Med'an but is killed by a &lt;a href=\"threshadon\"&gt;threshadon&lt;/a&gt; that rises from the water, causing Med'an to realize he should get back on land. Meanwhile, Garona finishes dispatching the rest of the serpents and resumes bickering with Stasia. Med'an questions the exact details of Garona's captivity and wonders why he should even have bothered to try and prove himself to her or maker her feel sorry for abandoning him.\nThe following morning in Theramore, Varian informs Thrall that he may have to end their summit early after receiving word of simultaneous &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacks on &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall states that he has already begun sending a few ships to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, but it would be best for the Alliance and Horde to have some level of cooperation before facing the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, their common enemy. Rehgar points out to Valeera that Garrosh is obviously not happy with how Varian and Thrall are getting along.\nIn Dustwallow, Med'an wakes up after having inadvertently fallen asleep and overhears more arguing between Garona and Stasia. Stasia tells Garona that they'll attack Theramore as a unit, but the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 apparently starting to shake off her \"programming\" \u2014 insists on working alone and leaves on her &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the cultists to follow her on their &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s. Med'an is horrified at Stasia's mention that Garona will die after completing her orders, and decides that this time he'll lend his aid to his mother.\nBefore long, Garona and the cultists swoop down on Theramore to attack the gathered leaders. Even unarmed, the summit attendants quickly respond and begin to fight back, picking up weapons dropped or thrown by their assailants. As planned, the Alliance races among the cultists attack the Horde targets and vice versa, and Garrosh declares the attack to be the result of \"human treachery\", dismissing the Horde races as being hirelings sent by Varian to kill their own kind. On her wyvern up in the sky, Garona is unable to understand why she is doing what she's doing. Varian spots the half-orc and immediately accuses Thrall of hiring &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;'s murderer, proclaiming that \"it's clear that treachery remains the orcs' main tool of diplomacy\"."}

He periodically summons &lt;a href=\"Ravenous%20Creeper\"&gt;Ravenous Creeper&lt;/a&gt;s that will hurl poison onto the ground area, eventually causing you to run out of room to fight with if you don't kill plants. They can be one-shot with a &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; as they spawn.\nThe other add is &lt;a href=\"Zephyr%20of%20Rejuvenation\"&gt;Zephyr of Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;, which will proceed to siphon health from the player. While not an immediate threat, it would be wise to keep their numbers in check.\nA mechanic to be mindful of is Anshal's Healing Swell, which places a stacking curse debuff on the player that increases their health by a percentage. Upon reaching 10 stacks, however, it unleashes an energy wave that will heal your foes. Use &lt;a href=\"Cleanse%20Spirit\"&gt;Cleanse Spirit&lt;/a&gt; as needed if your DPS is not good.\nFor Nezir, avoiding AoE is the main focus. Stay behind Nezir when you see him beginning to cast Freezing Gale, a channeled frontal AoE that also rotates around the area. When he is channeling Tempest of Frost, do not stand in the frozen areas.\nRohash mostly fights as Nezir does, with his Stinging Vortex creating circles of AoE damage. The major difference here is Sandstorm, a channeled spell that attempts to push the player off the platform. Use &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt; to prevent that from happening.\nFinal Stage: The Skylord Returns.\nStand on a nearby whorl of wind to look on as Thunderaan speaks with the subdued &lt;a href=\"djinni\"&gt;djinni&lt;/a&gt; on the main platform."}

This is in conflict with the lore from the novels so his subsequent fate after Llane's death in unknown.\nSpeculation.\nSince official \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt; says the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were victorious in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown what happened to the Defender or whether or not he survived the events of the First War. It is possible he was slain during a devastating &lt;a href=\"The%20Center%20of%20the%20Human%20Lands\"&gt;surprise attack&lt;/a&gt; by the orcs on one of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; encampments or during the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;second siege&lt;/a&gt; and fall of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. \nIt is also likely that his background and role in game are combined with that of Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, much like his counterpart in the Orc campaign, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Lothar was personally responsible for some of the events in the Human campaign, most notably the killing of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. It was also Lothar who took leadership of the kingdom after Llane's death. However, in &lt;a href=\"The%20Dead%20Mines%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;one campaign&lt;/a&gt; the Defender of the Crown was ordered to rescue Sir Lothar from the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that they can also be two different people.\nThe second manual mentions that once Lothar was rescued, he went to fight the orcs. It's thus possible that the Defender led the human army until the the rescue of Lothar and then he may have joined with Lothar's army or die at some point near the end of the war."}

{"id": "14617", "revid": "42038977", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14617", "title": "Defense", "text": "Defense was an &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; that helped prevent physical damage by reducing the chance to be hit or critically hit. It also increased &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; defense was removed from the game as part of Blizzard's effort to \"simplify statistics\" for \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\". Tanking classes can now become immune to critical hits from &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s by shifting into &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance\"&gt;Defensive Stance&lt;/a&gt; (Protection warrior), &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Presence\"&gt;Blood Presence&lt;/a&gt; (Blood death knight), &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; (Guardian druid), or by using &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Fury\"&gt;Righteous Fury&lt;/a&gt; (Protection paladin).\nHistory.\nOverview.\nDefense is a &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; that helps prevent physical damage by reducing the chance to be hit or critically hit. Additionally, it also increases &lt;a href=\"block\"&gt;block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;. Mobs receive 0.1% per point of defense. Mobs get an additional benefit from defense of Glancing Blows versus players.\nEach point of +Defense skill adds 0.04% to the player's chance to be &lt;a href=\"Miss\"&gt;Miss&lt;/a&gt;ed, to &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt;, and to &lt;a href=\"Parry\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt;, before &lt;a href=\"Melee%20diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt; are taken into account, and adds 0.04% to the player's chance to &lt;a href=\"Block\"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; with no diminishing returns. This means +25 Defense will grant you an extra 1% Miss, Parry, Dodge, and Block. The formula is constant across all classes. It further decreases the chance of receiving &lt;a href=\"critical\"&gt;critical hits&lt;/a&gt; from any level attacker by 0.04% per point that the target's Defense skill exceeds the attacker's Weapon Skill. Please note that a decrease in your chance to be hit (like the tooltip says) actually increases your chance to be missed. However, all of these chances are based on an opponent of equal level. The rating difference between the attacker's &lt;a href=\"weapon%20skill\"&gt;weapon skill&lt;/a&gt; and the defender's defense factors into the true chance for miss, parry, dodge, block, crushing blow, glancing blow, and critical hit.\nNote that while your tooltip chances to be dodged and parried will take diminishing returns into account, your tooltip decreased chance to be hit (shown while hovering over your Defense on your character sheet) will not. At 540 Defense, your actual chance to be missed by a level 80 mob is 9.288%.\nNote that defense continues to be a valuable stat past its \"cap,\" unlike hit rating or expertise, because it still increases chances to dodge, block, parry and be missed. Reaching the &lt;a href=\"cap\"&gt;soft cap&lt;/a&gt; of 540 defense skill (not rating) is considered mandatory for &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ing more difficult content, as a single critical hit from a boss can prove fatal.\nCritical Hits.\nSee below for a more detailed discussion of Defense.\nCritical Hits are strikes by mobs against the player that deal twice the normal damage. The player's Defense and &lt;a href=\"Resilience\"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt; are both attributes that reduce the chance of an enemy critically striking. The chance to be critically hit is based on the difference between the attacker's weapon skill and the player's defense skill and resilience %.\nA mob has a weapon skill that is calculated by 5 x Level, and a player has a base defense that is 5 x Level. A player does not have any base resilience. Therefore a level 80 mob has 5x80=400 Weapon Skill. A level 80 player has a base defense of 5x80=400 Defense and no resilience.\nWhen an equal level mob is attacking a player, the mob has a 5% chance to critically strike the player. For every level beyond the player, there is an additional 0.2% chance for the mob to critically strike the player. Therefore a level 83 mob (a raid boss) attacking a level 80 player has a 5% + (3 x 0.2%) = 5.6% chance to critically strike the player. A player in the role of a tank for a raid boss must lower his or her chance of being critically struck by 5.6% to avoid the possibility of taking 2x the damage from a single hit. This is where gear bonuses that augment resilience and defense are important.\nEach point of defense beyond the player's base reduces the chance to be critically struck by 0.04%. Therefore, to become immune to critical hits dealt from a mob 3 levels higher, a player must have 5.6% / (0.04% per defense) = 140 additional points in their defense skill to avoid a critical strike. Therefore a level 80 player with a base defense of 400 must have 400 + 140 = 540 Defense to become immune to critical hits through defense alone.\nBecause a single critical hit from a raid boss can easily remove most, if not all, of its target's HP, becoming crit immune is far more important for tanks than anything else until they are immune; even HP granted from high amounts of Stamina is not enough to mitigate a critical hit.\nHowever, resilience may also be used to lower the chance of being critically struck. There is no base resilience for players. Therefore a level 80 player with no additional defense points, will simply need 5.6% resilience to become immune to critical hits dealt by a raid boss.\nNote that given a choice between PvP gear and actual tanking gear, the latter is far better because it provides additional use for tanks such as dodge and parry rating.\nFor a level 70 player, gear that provides +39.4 resilience rating will yield a 1% resilience. And gear that provides 2.36 defense rating will increase the defense skill by 1. For a level 80 player, gear that provides +82.0 resilience rating will yield a 1% resilience. And gear that provides 4.92 defense rating will increase the defense skill by 1. See below for the formula used to derive defense skill from defense rating. See &lt;a href=\"Resilience\"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt; for a discussion on the formula to calculate % resilience obtained from resilience rating.\n&lt;a href=\"Feral\"&gt;Feral&lt;/a&gt; druids have &lt;a href=\"Survival%20of%20the%20Fittest%20%28druid%20talent%29\"&gt;Survival of the Fittest (druid talent)&lt;/a&gt;, which reduces the inbound crit rate by 6%, making them naturally immune to melee critical hits in PvE.\nCrushing blows.\n&lt;a href=\"Crushing%20blow\"&gt;Crushing blow&lt;/a&gt;s can happen if a mob attacks a player at least 4 levels lower. Because \"boss\" level mobs are considered to be level 83 they cannot deliver a crushing blow to any level 80 character whose defense skill is fully trained up to his level * 5.\nPrior to patch 3.0 crushing blows affected players of at least 3 levels lower than the attacking mob so max-level characters (typically the main tank) could receive a crushing blow from a boss. Because of this change the rest of this section is mostly of historical interest.\nOnly the player's \"base\" defense skill (capped at 5 times the player's level, e.g. 350 for a level 70 player) is taken into account to determine the base chance for a Crushing Blow, and therefore Defense Rating on gear does \"not\" directly decrease the chance for a Crushing Blow.\nCrushing Blows can be made less likely or entirely avoided by increasing avoidance stats such as Dodge or Parry or the player's Block Rating, as well as using certain skills, to the point where the player's combined Miss, Dodge, Parry, and Block chances against that specific attacker exceed 85%. This is due to how the WoW combat roll system works, cf. &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Table\"&gt;Attack Table&lt;/a&gt;. In this regard, Defense Rating on gear \"does\" help against Crushing Blows.\nRefer to the Wiki sections &lt;a href=\"Crushing%20blow\"&gt;Crushing blow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uncrushability\"&gt;Uncrushability&lt;/a&gt; for an in-depth explanation of this mechanic.\nDazed.\nIf a mob hits a target from behind, and the target takes damage from the hit that isn't &lt;a href=\"Absorb\"&gt;Absorb&lt;/a&gt;ed, there is a chance the player will be &lt;a href=\"Dazed\"&gt;Dazed&lt;/a&gt;. The base chance for a level 30+ target to be dazed when hit from behind, if the mob's weapon skill is equal to the target's defense skill, is 20%. This chance can get as low as 0% if the target's defense is high enough, or as high as 40% if the target's defense is low enough. If the target is below level 30, it's base chance to be dazed is less; a level 10 target with fully trained defense skill only has a 7% chance to be dazed when attacked from behind by a level 10 mob.\nNote that your defense skill is NOT level-capped for purposes of determining your chance to be dazed. It is possible to become undazeable while wearing tank plate gear.\nPatch 3.3 made level 1-5 characters immune to being dazed and level 6-10 characters less likely to be dazed.\nChanges in patch 2.0.\nAs of WoW 2.0, additional defensive skill does not help avoid crushing blows.\nInstead of directly affecting Defense skill, items after patch 2.0 grant a bonus to Defense Rating (DR). Skill bonuses are then calculated as follows:\nFor a level 60 : 1.5 DR = 1 defense skill &lt;br&gt;\nFor a level 70 : 2.36 DR = 1 defense skill &lt;br&gt;\nFor a level 80 : 4.92 DR = 1 defense skill &lt;br&gt;\nIt is important to note that for the sake of all indirect effects of Defense Skill (dodge, block, parry, etc), the game only considers Skill as an integer. That is, there is absolutely no difference between 10 Rating (+4.23 Skill) and 11 Rating (+4.65 Skill), because they both yield only 4 integer points of Skill. However, there is a difference between 11 Rating (+4.65 Skill) and 12 Rating (+5.07 Skill); specifically, the difference is exactly 0.04% dodge, block, parry, etc.\nAt L70 you need 14.75 of defense rating to get 0.25% increases to each of miss/dodge/parry and block for a total increase in avoidance of 1%. At L60 this is 9.375. Both may suffer small inaccuracies due to the above mentioned integer rounding."}
