It is also impossible to kick players from the party using the \"vote to kick\" feature or to find replacements using the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; after defeating him.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Rajh oversees the energies that have both sparked life and snuffed it out in an untold number of his kin. Considered the mightiest of his fellow constructs, Rajh holds the power to unleash the fury of a thousand suns upon Azeroth.\"\nRajh is one of the guardians of the Halls of Origination, given the moniker by his titanic creators. Like the other constructs within the halls, Rajh was created to protect the powerful device capable of resetting all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Each of the keepers has a sphere of influence. &lt;a href=\"Isiset\"&gt;Isiset&lt;/a&gt; presides over magic; Rahj, the sun; &lt;a href=\"Setesh\"&gt;Setesh&lt;/a&gt;, chaos; and &lt;a href=\"Ammunae\"&gt;Ammunae&lt;/a&gt;, life.\nIn the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Commander%20Kamses\"&gt;High Commander Kamses&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that Rajh and the other keepers were dead. After &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from its prison, and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted version of Rajh could be briefly seen in the Old God's vision of the Halls.\nStrategy.\nRajh's fight is centered around interrupting his abilities as much as possible to greatly reduce his damage output as well as prolong his phase one. It is best to assign players with interrupts to watch for one of his two interruptable abilities prior to engaging Rajh. If your group is extremely limited on interrupts it is best to interrupt his Sun Orb as it is more difficult to avoid then Inferno Leap and easier to interrupt as well.\nRajh's Solar Winds and Sun Strike abilities cannot be interrupted. Solar Winds costs no energy and will summon a fire tornado and is often used within a few seconds of the initial pull, players need only keep their distance from it to avoid damage. Sun Strike will deal a somewhat large amount of damage to the entire party over time and will need to be healed through as it cannot be dispelled. If you are having trouble healing through Sun Strike abilities such as Power Word: Barrier and Divine Guardian can help greatly at reducing the damage taken by the party.\nWhen Rajh's energy drops below 25 it is the most ideal time to use Bloodlust (or other equivalent) as it will last through Rajh's entire recharge phase for maximum DPS potential. During his recharge phase all players will deal 100% additional damage and Rajh will deal AOE damage to the entire group. It is best for players to stack near their healer to ease healing stress especially if you are being healed by a Paladin or Shaman. Once Rajh finishes recharging his phase one will start over, the cycle repeating until he is defeated.\nHeroic Mode.\nThe primary change in Heroic Mode is to Rajh's Solar Winds (the flame tornado), it will now leave patches of fire on the ground that last until the fight ends. The tornado will move randomly around the room but will sometimes move directly towards a player, for this reason it is best to try and pull Rajh to the side of his room in order to try and keep fire away from the center where Rajh will stand during his recharge phase. All normal mode mechanics still apply.\nIf you are attempting to do the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20of%20a...\"&gt;Sun of a...&lt;/a&gt; achievement it is vital to prolong Rajh's phase one as long as possible and then use all DPS cooldowns at your party's disposal while he recharges. This is made much easier if a Bloodlust/Heroism buff is available. Even if Rajh reaches 100 energy his recharge is not considered 'complete' until Blessing of the Sun is removed from the party.\nIn Hearthstone.\nRajh appears as that can be encountered in the adventure in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring \"Hearthstone\"'s initial alpha, Rajh's artwork from the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;TCG&lt;/a&gt; was used for the minion.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He gave his fellow scamps shelter, and in return, they did whatever he asked, which usually meant running scams in the city or stealing from the coffers in the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; temple. Early on, Rajin took notice of the skills of Zenbaro, who was shortly running personal errands for Rajin. If someone needed \"talking to\", Zenbaro was the one to do it, but there was not much actual talking involved.\nBefore long, Zenbaro earned Rajin's trust and respect, as much as anyone could, but Zenbaro was more interested in Rajin's beautiful daughter &lt;a href=\"Kaiani\"&gt;Kaiani&lt;/a&gt;. Kaiani asked Zenbaro to leave the city with her, and from that day on he secretly kept part of all the coins he stole for himself rather than giving them all to Rajin. After a year, he had saved up enough for the two of them to run away, but on the night of their escape, Zenbaro was apprehended by armed guards at the place where he and Kaiani had agreed to meet. He realized that Rajin had murdered his daughter, but Zenbaro was the one who would take the blame, leading to Zenbaro's subsequent exile to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;."}

Garrosh then ordered Rak'gor to go with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; rookery in the &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Dagger in the Dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt;. He was followed by two &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Kor'kron Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s. It is revealed in the end that he is actually an assassin, rather than a scout leader, and was dispatched by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to Vol'jin's dissension permanently, if he proves himself a traitor by disagreeing. Throughout the ambush, he questions the adventurers' loyalties, but with the aid of Vol'jin's totems, the heroes were able to defeat the duplicitous orc.\nStrategy.\nBloodrazor is a relatively easy foe to deal with, though he combines a few common mechanics for an interesting battle. Bloodrazor's two bodyguards can be easily dealt with by one of the party members while the others focus on him. Vol'jin has placed five of his totems around the arena, which will heal anyone standing in them. These will make Bloodrazor's damage negligible until he drops one of his mustard gas bombs. When this occurs, it will nullify the healing from the totems and damage them heavily over time, forcing anyone inside to move to a different totem. One nasty trick Bloodrazor has is one where he will combine his Shadowstep, Cheap Shot, and Gas Bomb, instantly stunning the target in the middle of a cloud of deadly poison. In this case, it is imperative that the victim escape the cloud when their stun ends and make their way to a totem or receive healing from a group mate.\nAchievement.\n&lt;a href=\"You%20Mean%20That%20Wasn%27t%20a%20Void%20Zone%3F\"&gt;You Mean That Wasn't a Void Zone?&lt;/a&gt;\nQuotes.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;Dagger in the Dark&lt;/a&gt; for scene dialogue.\"\nTrivia.\nRak'gor is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Fred%20Tatasciore\"&gt;Fred Tatasciore&lt;/a&gt;."}

The demons' primary goal for the attack was the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, who threatened to decipher the recently-arrived &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;.

As the battle progressed, however, the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;his champion&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in securing gains against the attackers. \nEventually, Velen himself ventured forth to the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Seat of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; in order to confront High General Rakeesh personally, and save O'ros. As he did so, the elite &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Chosen\"&gt;Light's Chosen&lt;/a&gt; went about purging the final remnants of Rakeeshi and other demons from the Exodar. In a final confrontation with Rakeesh\u2014who was revealed to have been Velen's long-lost son\u2014the eredar general was slain, though so too was the naaru O'ros. \nThe losses suffered during the battle, including the loss of their leader, marked a blow to the Rakeeshi's strength. \nBroken Shore.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, the Rakeeshi remained active in the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Later, she is promoted to General Rakera and fights against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nRakera was originally a commander in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; but was exiled to Vol'dun after she came close to proving that &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, was a traitor to the crown. She was part of a group consisting of a dozen other outcasts. One night, the exiles were attacked by assassins sent by Jakra'zet to search for Rakera. Though Rakera fought off the attackers and saved the life of her fellow exile &lt;a href=\"Jorak\"&gt;Jorak&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Grozztok%20the%20Blackheart\"&gt;Grozztok the Blackheart&lt;/a&gt;, the survivors scattered into the desert. With no other options, Rakera decided to follow the advice of a rambling madman from her group who had talked of a temple in the south that welcomed exiles.\nAlthough Rakera told her subordinate &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Kaja\"&gt;Bladeguard Kaja&lt;/a&gt; not to come after her, Kaja soon ventures into Vol'dun in search of her commander alongside her fellow bladeguards &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Jorana\"&gt;Jorana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bladeguard%20Tarkaj\"&gt;Tarkaj&lt;/a&gt; as well as an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Kaja, the adventurer, and the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; eventually follow the lead provided by Rakera's &lt;a href=\"Rakera%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; and head to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Akunda\"&gt;Temple of Akunda&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, they also pick up Jorak, the troll whom Rakera had saved, as well as Rakera's shield. Once at the temple, they discover that Rakera has lost all of her memories and become one of the followers of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt; under the name Akunda the Forlorn. After the adventurer defeats &lt;a href=\"Akunda%20the%20Exalted\"&gt;Akunda the Exalted&lt;/a&gt; and frees the loa, Rakera's memories are restored and she informs Kaja and the adventurer that Jakra'zet's forces in Vol'dun are scouring the desert in search of a powerful weapon capable of destroying Zuldazar.\nThe group continues to the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with &lt;a href=\"Julwaba\"&gt;Julwaba&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend of Rakera who willingly traveled to Vol'dun to gain knowledge of the past and whom Rakera hopes will have knowledge of the weapon. Despite an attack from Jakra'zet's assassins along the way, the group make it to Zul'Ahjin and encounter the vulpera &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Julwaba and her friend &lt;a href=\"Serrik\"&gt;Serrik&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; who is dying from &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpashi&lt;/a&gt; venom. After Kiro and the adventurer save Serrik with antivenom, the champion travels into Zul'Ahjin and discovers a &lt;a href=\"Sulthis%27%20Stone\"&gt;special stone&lt;/a&gt;. At Serrik's urging, the adventurer, Rakera, and Kaja accompany him to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the stone to &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;. Vorrik explains to the hero, Rakera, and Kaja the history of how &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt; and how the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20%28sethrak%29\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; Vorrik, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt; created three keystones to keep Mythrax entombed within &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Rakera realizes that Mythrax must be the weapon that Jakra'zet is searching for.\nShortly after, Vorrik and the adventurer leave to confront the &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; emperor Korthek directly. Vorrik asks Rakera and Kaja to protect his and Sulthis' keystones while he is away, and they promise to protect Vorrik's people like their own. Vorrik, the hero, and their vulpera allies ultimately manage to defeat Korthek, but meanwhile, Jakra'zet and his troops attack the Sanctuary of the Devoted and steal the keystones. Kaja and Rakera pursue the general into the crypts below Atul'Aman but they both end up being ensnared by tentacles in the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Crypt\"&gt;Fetid Crypt&lt;/a&gt; below the pyramid. Vorrik and the adventurer eventually catch up with and free the two Zandalari. The group then confronts Jakra'zet deeper in the crypt. After a battle, the general is mortally wounded, and Rakera tells Kaja to give him a clean death. However, before the bladeguard has a chance to kill Jakra'zet, he instead leaps into the nearby pit, killing himself and providing the final blood sacrifice needed to resurrect Mythrax. The group barely escapes Atul'Aman with their lives. After making it back to the Sanctuary of the Devoted, Rakera states that she will inform &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the events that have transpired in Vol'dun and the new threat the Zandalari now face, and urges the adventurer to do the same with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, Mythrax, and their armies attacked &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, Rakera urgently asked Meerah to transport her, Kaja, Akunda, and &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt; to the city. During the battle, Rakera commanded a small force of the royal guard as they held off invading sethrak at the &lt;a href=\"Zocalo\"&gt;Zocalo&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, she accompanied Talanji through the streets before assisting the Zandalari force in holding off Mythrax while the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; went to confront Zul.\nTides of Vengeance.\nWhen word reached about the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invading Nazmir and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt;, Rakera and a cadre of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Warrior\"&gt;Zandalari Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s were found training on the bridge on &lt;a href=\"Kingsmouth%20River\"&gt;Kingsmouth River&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. The Speaker of the Horde asked her to mobilize her troops to fight against the invaders.\nRakera was present in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; when the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;invaded it&lt;/a&gt;. She fought against &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Vanguard\"&gt;Dark Iron Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Zocalo\"&gt;Zocalo&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension to queen, Rakera joined the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, replacing Jakra'zet as the General of the Zandalari army.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\n&lt;General Rakera is deep in conversation with Bladeguard Kaja.&gt;"}

A talented &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; who was able to surpass others in practicing the art of the &lt;a href=\"pack%20form\"&gt;pack form&lt;/a&gt;, he came to find a group known as the Druids of the Pack and became their leader. His attempts at mastering the Pack Form led to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the worgen and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;. Although he still retained his consciousness and intelligence, unlike &lt;a href=\"worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gilnean worgen&lt;/a&gt;, he showed no sign of being able to revert back to his night elf form (but from what is shown of his attitude, it was unlikely that he would have wanted to anyway). Millennia later, he formed the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, a sinister organization that sought the Scythe of Elune.\nBiography.\nWar of the Satyr.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Ralaar fought alongside his best friend &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; and other night elves against the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;. Due to heavy losses to their number, Ralaar argued with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; over the use of the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;, which he felt would give them the strength to end the war.\nHowever, the argument turned into hate when &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt;, having promised to Malfurion to never use the Pack Form again after losing control and killing some &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, was murdered by &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, unable to defend himself without the Pack Form. Belysra, Arvell's lover, was devastated by his death.\nDruids of the Scythe.\nAt some point, the Druids of the Pack fell to the feral rage of the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;. Ralaar was the only druid who still retained his sanity when he used the Pack Form, and after besting the pack in combat, Ralaar offered to show them a way to keep their sanity whilst in the pack form. He has thus established himself as the leader of the druids and has taken on the name of Alpha Prime. With the help of the embittered Belysra, the two constructed the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. With its power, the druids hoped to master the pack form.\nYet instead of mastering the Pack Form, the Druids of the Scythe were transformed into the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. The worgen were mad and considered their transformation the \"purest\" embodiment of nature. When the worgen battled the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, they tore through friend and foe alike and spread their curse to other night elves. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, seeing no other choice in containing the worgen threat, used the Scythe of Elune to banish the worgen to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, where they would rest for all eternity.\nWolf Cult.\nTen thousand years later, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; summoned the \"wolf-men\" from the Emerald Dream to Azeroth, Alpha Prime being among them, to fight the approaching &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. In Gilneas he recruited Arugal and used him to spread the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; to the humans of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually he started a &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, whose code he wrote down in the &lt;a href=\"Purity%20of%20Essence\"&gt;Purity of Essence&lt;/a&gt;, in Gilneas that was meant to spread the curse and made his followers murder innocent people as an initiation rite (these murders were known as the &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Slasher\"&gt;Starlight Slasher&lt;/a&gt; murders). The cult's goals were to locate the Scythe of Elune.\nWhen the worgen curse afflicted Gilneas, Alpha Prime purposely afflicted &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; with the worgen curse to stop him from discovering about the Starlight Slasher murders and the planned worgen attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, as well as his true intentions.\nIt was later revealed that Alpha Prime had infiltrated Gilneas using tunnels hidden underneath the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. His purpose was to get the Scythe of Elune, which he planned to use to free the rest of the worgen banished in the Emerald Dream. With the Scythe of Elune bolstering his army's ranks, he planned to later attack &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and exact revenge on &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. To these ends, he allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and used the worgen attack on Gilneas City to weaken the nation's defenses for the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Forsaken invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Wolf Cult attacked Gilneas City, Alpha Prime was confronted by Belysra in the midst of the chaos, after &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Court\"&gt;Greymane Court&lt;/a&gt; had fallen but before the &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Square\"&gt;Merchant Square&lt;/a&gt; did. He revealed to Belysra his intents for revenge on Malfurion, claiming that Malfurion preached a code of ethics that were conveniently forgotten when they stopped suiting his purpose, and that duplicity &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;runs in the family&lt;/a&gt;. Belysra countered that Malfurion had confided in her that he agonized over the decision he had to make all those years ago, as well as guilt for Arvell. Perhaps most importantly, she revealed to Ralaar that Malfurion had also used the pack form before, and gone into a frenzy himself until &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; briefly locked him under Daral'nir. This statement, however, caused Alpha Prime to declare Malfurion not only a fool but also the ultimate hypocrite. The battle between the two of them lasted until about the time of &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;'s final stand in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Quarter\"&gt;Cathedral Quarter&lt;/a&gt;, at which point Belysra was saved when Halford attacked Alpha Prime, and Belysra used the light of Elune to send him into one of the city's canals, giving them time to escape.\nThough the Forsaken discovered the whereabouts of the scythe, unbeknown to Alpha Prime, their machinations were foiled by the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen player&lt;/a&gt; when the scythe was retaken and returned to &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Belysra\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt;. Believing that the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt;s and priestess Belysra's night elves no longer wielded the scythe, Alpha Prime led the Wolf Cult to attack Belysra's forces at &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt;. To his surprise, Belysra unveiled the Scythe of Elune and tried to use the scythe to banish Alpha Prime's worgen back to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Before Belysra could complete the spell, she was shot in the arm by a Forsaken &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;. With Belysra dropping the scythe, Alpha Prime then had his Forsaken allies surround Belysra and her Gilnean allies. Alpha Prime took the scythe and was about to finish Belysra with it, but he was ripped to shreds by a &lt;a href=\"spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolf&lt;/a&gt; who turned out to be the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt;."}

Wild rams roam &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;, many areas of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nDistinguished by their shaggy coats and massive horns, Barak Tor'ol mountain rams are simple yet proud animals whose fearlessness is matched only by that of their dwarven masters. While these good-natured animals lack ferocity, they compensate with uncommon durability and strength. The thickness of their fur helps them withstand the biting winds of Khaz Modan and the sharp claws of the mountain beasts that populate the region. The dwarves value them for their fearlessness charging into battle. Their thick bony skulls and massive horns make them the ideal mounts for charging through groups of armored enemies.\nMale rams will often smash their thick skulls against each other for hours to impress a female. In that way, they're very similar to dwarves. The &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Ram\"&gt;Ironforge Ram&lt;/a&gt; breed was the first species of ram to be domesticated by the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; when they arrived in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, according to the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Fact%20Checker\"&gt;Wildhammer Fact Checker&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ram\"&gt;Black Ram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Ram\"&gt;Frost Ram&lt;/a&gt; breeds haven't been seen in ages, though &lt;a href=\"Veron%20Amberstill\"&gt;Veron Amberstill&lt;/a&gt; insists they're strong enough to survive.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt;'s mount trainers have a tradition of etching their names onto the left horn of every battle ram they raise.\n&lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; is known for its ram mounts. Brewers retired the &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt; from active advertising service after complaints that the beasts were \"too temperamental\" to control in major cities. Dwarves attribute the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Swift Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt; breed's even temperament to rigorous training, but other races argue that a daily diet of strong ale has something to do with it.\nDuring thunderstorms, rams will hide behind anything larger than themselves.\nAs a mount.\nRams are sold by &lt;a href=\"Veron%20Amberstill\"&gt;Veron Amberstill&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Amberstill%20Ranch\"&gt;Amberstill Ranch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Derrick%20Brindlebeard\"&gt;Derrick Brindlebeard&lt;/a&gt; the Ironforge Quartermaster in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; also sells two unique rams.\nAs a hunter pet.\nRams are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"gruffhorn\"&gt;gruffhorn&lt;/a&gt; family.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen confronted by such an intimidating set of massive horns, it\u2019s hard to remember that this animal is just a male &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt;. Wild, but not necessarily aggressive, it wanders through the snowy hills, likely in search of food. Battle rams are the sturdy rams raised by the dwarves as mounts, especially in the Alterac Mountains. They serve in essentially the same role that warhorses do for humans; but the dwarves tend to both train and equip their mounts better, and the rams are considerably more resilient overall. Recently, the dwarves have begun training their strongest allies (usually humans) in how to properly raise and ride a battle ram, knowing that such a skill would benefit any member of the Alliance.\nA wild battle ram avoids combat. If pressed, it charges its attacker, using its horns and hooves to subdue its target as quickly as possible. Battle rams are fiercely loyal and fight to protect their riders. A charging battle ram deals double damage on a gore attack with its horns.\nTrivia.\nDespite their docile appearance, the Battle Rams of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Pass\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; are among the hardiest and fearless mounts in existence."}

They recruit people by offering them &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; powers. The Primalists have been known to reshape the land, whether by lava or by ice, like at the &lt;a href=\"Flashfrost%20Enclave\"&gt;Flashfrost Enclave&lt;/a&gt;. They also steal &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt; eggs in order to infuse them with elemental energies and turn them to their side. They have also been known to transform &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s by giving them bodies of hardened stone.\nBesides their hatred for the titans and their dragon loyalists, they also oppose the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, thinking they deserve death for using &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; who rejoined the Primalists did it because they felt displaced by the return of the dragons. To help with their war, they summoned various &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;s through elemental gateways.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Future\"&gt;Primalist Future&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; is an example of what they strive to achieve; a primal world of ice, earthquakes and fire.\nHistory.\nAncient past.\nWhile the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s uplifted the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, a group of ancient &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s refused their gift, believing that dragonkind should remain unchanged by &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; magic and should instead choose to return to their roots and embrace their inherent elemental energies. Despite all the work that the Aspects and their dragonflights had accomplished since their creation, these \"Primalist\" proto-dragons joined together and demanded that &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; be exiled from the dragons' new home. When the Aspects refused, it sowed the seeds of rebellion for the Primalists. The Primalists' leaders became known as the Primal Incarnates, infused with the power of the elements.\n&lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; was concerned about the festering schism between Primalists and dragons, but Alexstrasza dismissed his concerns, hoping to resolve the tensions through communication. Fearing conflict was coming, Neltharion created the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; and prepared for war.\nNeltharion didn't have enough time to perfect his creation. About 20,000 years ago Raszageth, the Storm-Eater, struck first at dragonkind by attacking the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt; broken, Neltharion lost control of the dracthyr, and resorted to submitting to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time, using his newfound powers to banish Raszageth to the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;. He then discarded the dracthyr and stashed them away in their creches where they were put in stasis indefinitely.\nA cataclysmic conflict ensued between Primalists and dragonflights known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Scaleborn\"&gt;War of the Scaleborn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; were ever loyal to the Incarnate's ideals, but Iridikron truly embraced the war. At the end, he struck terrible bargains to keep their cause alive. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes the other incarnates never knew the true depths of his depravity. Despite the Primalists' alliance with the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; to end the dragons' reign, the remaining Primal Incarnates were ultimately defeated, but Alexstrasza, having failed to restore peace between the two groups, still couldn't bear to kill them given they had once been as close as clutch-mates, and decided to imprison them instead, within the titanic &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nA few years after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Primalists led by &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; invaded the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; and successfully released &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; from her prison of &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt;. She unleashed worldwide storms as a symbol of the Incarnates' return, and the Primalists attacked the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, but were ultimately pushed out of the regions. The Primalists then focused all their attention upon the Dragon Isles.\nThey took the eggs of dragons and proto-dragons in order to infuse them with elemental energies. One such attempt was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Sendrax\"&gt;Sendrax&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The discovery prompted the pair to rescue the &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Dragon%20Egg.\"&gt;Infused Dragon Egg&lt;/a&gt;, and though Sendrax lost her life in the process, adventurers were able to bring the egg to Alexstrasza in an attempt to save the whelp inside from the Primalists machinations. Alexstrasza subsequently declared that the situation was dire, and that the eggs' only hope of salvation was within the Life Pools.\nSometime later Raszageth led the Primalists on an attack on the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Life%20Pools\"&gt;Ruby Life Pools&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of infusing their own powers within. As Raszageth clashes with Alexstrasza in the skies, Primalists forces led by &lt;a href=\"Kyrakka%20and%20Erkhart%20Stormvein\"&gt;Kyrakka and Erkhart Stormvein&lt;/a&gt; invaded the pool themselves, but were ultimately defeated, whereas Raszageth made the decision to leave on her own after wounding the Dragon-Queen.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;, Primalists forces led by &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Garden\"&gt;Emerald Garden&lt;/a&gt; and fought against the &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragon\"&gt;Green dragon&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to reach the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons repelled them repeatedly, and the Primalists knew they needed the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;'s aid to win. Koroleth easily recruited &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;, the mightiest of the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt; clans, and aided them in the subsequent civil war among the centaur of the land. During the war, the Primalists and Nokhud forces were able to capture &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; and were able to use her, along with the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, but were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Solethus\"&gt;Solethus&lt;/a&gt;' sacrifice. Convinced of their victory, Koroleth led a new assault on the Emerald Garden, however her forces were defeated, and she was slain. Meanwhile, the Primalists who were aiding Balakar face a similar defeat, with Balakar himself falling in battle. With their leaders defeated, the remaining Primalists scattered. \nIn the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, Raszageth led the Primalists' efforts to destroy &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s connected to it, which would destroy the Span. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to aid &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; reclaim the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Oathstone\"&gt;Azure Oathstone&lt;/a&gt;, were quick to come under attack by the Primalists for their use of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic of the titans. The Primalists were also able to sway &lt;a href=\"Stoneheart\"&gt;Stoneheart&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Rustpine%20tribe\"&gt;Rustpine tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolgs&lt;/a&gt; to their side, and had claimed &lt;a href=\"Imbue\"&gt;Imbue&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Tuskarr\"&gt;Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately Kalecgos, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers were able to defeat the Primalists assaulting Vakthros, and the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; helped drive the Storm-Eater off. However the Primalists hold upon their allies and stolen territory remained.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, the Primalists had infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to sway the citizens against the Aspects. The Primalists had also launched an assault and claimed &lt;a href=\"South%20Hold%20Gate\"&gt;South Hold Gate&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Eranog\"&gt;Eranog&lt;/a&gt; who had betrayed the Aspects and joined their side. Sometime later, the Primalists through the trickery and deception of &lt;a href=\"Rymek\"&gt;Rymek&lt;/a&gt; were able to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; portal upon the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, successfully claiming the area and preventing the defenders from being able to breach the ice barrier around them. However, the timely arrival of the returned &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the barrier and allowed the green dragonflight to launch a counterattack. Rymek was soon afterwards slain and the Primalists forces in the area were subsequently destroyed by the powers within the &lt;a href=\"Lunardane\"&gt;Lunardane&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, who had ascended as the new Dreamer.\nIn time, Raszageth led the Primalists in breaching the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to free the other Primal Incarnates. Though Raszageth and a number of Primalists were killed, they were successful in their mission, with the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime later, Primalists forces and their Nokhud allies attacked the &lt;a href=\"Windtotem\"&gt;Windtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to the Ohn'ahran Plains, under the belief that they were druids who had come to the aid of the green dragonflight.\nAs the dracthyr and their allies returned to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, the Primalists could be found centered within the &lt;a href=\"Stormsunder%20Crater\"&gt;Stormsunder Crater&lt;/a&gt;. They also made forays into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt; and aided Fyrakk as he &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk%20Assaults\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; the Ohn'ahran Plains and the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;."}

Primary abilities were exclusive not only to your class but also to your specialization, and tended to be powerful abilities key to that specialization, offering offensive, defensive or healing capabilities, or in some cases the chance to summon a permanent companion. Primary abilities were the only class abilities limited to a specific spec, aside from &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;ed abilities found on the higher tiers of the pre-&lt;a href=\"5.0.4\"&gt;5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; talent trees.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; the nature of specializations and abilities was changed, with numerous class abilities being restricted to only certain specializations. Although almost all of the previous primary abilities are still available, they are no longer designated as such in-game, and are now among many abilities exclusive to a given spec. Additionally, some of the below primary abilities have been made available to all characters of that class regardless of specialization, such as &lt;a href=\"Shadowstep\"&gt;Shadowstep&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, the term \"primary ability\" is no longer in use.\nFor a full list of class and specialization abilities, see the abilities page for the desired class, eg &lt;a href=\"Warrior%20abilities\"&gt;Warrior abilities&lt;/a&gt;."}

The fight is a relatively simple &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt; compared to the rest of the fights in the Throne of Thunder. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Deep within the bowels of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s island citadel, &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"flesh-shaper\"&gt;flesh-shaper&lt;/a&gt;s formed the &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; out of a magical substance of unknown origin. When the citadel was abandoned, some experiments languished in the dark pools for far too long...\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"The fact that the mogu created the saurok (among other creatures native to Pandaria) is something that may not have been obvious to players who were exploring the continent and learning about its inhabitants. This encounter provided us with a chance to \"show, not tell\" this piece of Pandaria's history. The actual mechanics of the fight evolved from discussion and brainstorming around the themes of evolution and mutation; a few of us had also recently watched the movie Prometheus, and the vaults of black goo in that movie helped inspire the overall vibe of Primordius\u2019 lair.\"\nStrategy.\nPrimordius is a single-phase encounter that requires 2 tanks with mechanics that randomly begin and end due to Primordius evolving different abilities. Tanks should kite Primordius around the arena, being careful to keep him faced away from the raid due to his powerful Primordial Strike cone attack. Kiting him prevents the slow moving Volatile Pools (purple) from reaching him. If they do, the pools heal Primordius for 10% of his max HP. Tanks should alternate to keep stacks of Malformed Blood from getting too high. \nThe fight has a hard enrage timer of eight minutes. The key to beating the enrage timer is the DPS managing the Living Fluid buffs and debuffs. Primordius is shielded by Mutated Abomination which reduces all damage by 35% for the duration of the fight, meaning members must be fully evolved to deal full damage. During the battle, Living Fluids will spawn from the pools at the edges of the arena and attempt to move a walk-speed towards Primordius. They cannot be slowed or stunned. When killed, they will drop one of two colored fluids: small and red, or large and purple. The red pools will provide whoever steps in them with a beneficial mutation, while the purple pools will damage players and give a detrimental mutation. Once the players receive 5 beneficial mutations, they will receive Fully Evolved, turning into a &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt; and dealing full damage to Primordius. However, DPS must be mindful that once fully evolved, any mutagenic pools they step in will give them a detrimental mutation, so avoid them and attack Primordius. Once most of the DPS are Fully Evolved, cooldowns like &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; should be used. Dispelling players is not advisable since it removes both positive AND negative mutations. Overall, DPS should go through 3 cycles of Fully Mutated to kill the boss and beat the enrage. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The most tactical and long-thinking of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;, he is a master strategist who is nearly unbeatable on the field of battle and is notorious for always thinking far ahead of everyone else. The Primus embodies the five traits of the ideal &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; soldier, virtues he also instilled into the five houses: ambition, might, insight, guile, and relentlessness. In addition to his military might, he is also known as a legendary weaponsmith and the best armor crafter in the Shadowlands. He is the creator of Maldraxxi &lt;a href=\"rune%20magic\"&gt;rune magic&lt;/a&gt;, which serves to manipulate necromantic energy, and its more powerful counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;, which he made for the purpose of imprisoning his traitorous brother, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. All necrolords receive a portion of the Primus' power in order to carry out their duty of defending the Shadowlands.\nAt some point, the Primus left his sanctum to investigate the schemes of the captive Zovaal. The Jailer defeated the Primus, took his memories from him, and confined him to the tower of &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt; as a prisoner called the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;. In this form, the Primus was forced to create countless armaments for the Jailer\u2014including &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, which were later used by the succession of &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The necrolords were unaware of their leader's fate, and in his absence, Maldraxxus fell into chaos: two of the houses were nearly destroyed, and the leaders of the remaining three ruthlessly fought to claim the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; and the position of commanding the realm's armies.\nBefore his disappearance, the Primus left behind cryptic messages and prophecies concerning the coming of one who would embody the might of Maldraxxus and save the realm from itself, prophecies that were fulfilled by mortal &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s. During the four &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; to waylay the Jailer's efforts in the city of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, these same heroes recovered the Primus' &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;, which he had concealed before his journey to the Maw. When brought to Torghast, the sigil restored the Primus' memories and freed him from his existence as the Runecarver, allowing him to lend his tactical genius to the covenants as they fought to prevent the Jailer from achieving his goals. The Primus ultimately ensured his brother's defeat by reforging the shards of the Helm of Domination into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, which granted the Maw Walkers the resistance they needed to counter the Jailer's Domination magic and save the Shadowlands.\nBiography.\nRuler of Maldraxxus.\nLike his fellow &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt;, the Primus was forged by the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; in their realm of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20of%20War\"&gt;Prototype of War&lt;/a&gt; is an incomplete prototype of him. The First Ones entrusted the Primus with the duty of defending the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; from outside influences. They granted him the power of shaping the very flesh and bone of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; into the ideal training ground for the &lt;a href=\"necrolord\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt;s, the army that would be responsible for protecting the realms of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt;. The Primus understood that victory would not be achieved through physical might alone and divided his necrolords into five houses embodying what he saw as the five traits of the ideal champion of Death. He devised a system of eternal war games and conflict between the houses that would weed out weakness and allow the army of the necrolords to continually improve\u2014all while impressing on them the vital rule that their internal rivalry must never overshadow their duty to defend the Shadowlands. One such war game was the &lt;a href=\"Contest%20of%20Conquest\"&gt;Contest of Conquest&lt;/a&gt;, which he founded as a way of showcasing the might of Maldraxxus.\nThe Primus himself used his time to hone his tactical and strategic skills beyond mortal constraints. It is said that he once sought out an unknown ally who could show him the infinite &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeways&lt;/a&gt; and allow him to observe the same battle over and over again to see how slight differences in strategy and troop deployment could change the outcome of a conflict. After eons of such study, the Primus can instantly assess any situation and devise the likeliest path to victory. To further bolster the Maldraxxi, the Primus created a unique language of runes which individually represent a specific word tied to the foundations of Maldraxxus and the power of the five houses. Eons later, this same language would come to be used in the world of the living by &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to empower their &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"%3Aruneforging\"&gt;:runeforging&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Primus was the victor of countless hard-won battles. In one battle in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Trench\"&gt;Iron Trench&lt;/a&gt;, he destroyed a group of ambitious necrolords who thought to usurp him. In another battle, he destroyed a group of invaders so utterly that it left fires that still burn to this day in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Thicket\"&gt;Burning Thicket&lt;/a&gt;. His tactics and weapons were infallible against his every foe; in fact, according to one account, the only losses the Primus suffered were intentional, as he felt that there was more to be learned from defeat than from endless victories. He repeatedly allowed a &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; historian to accompany him to battles, and she wrote down her own (unfavorable) perspective on the Maldraxxi. The Primus had several apprentices, but the only one now remaining is &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;. At his stronghold, the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, he maintained a network of portals that linked the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;necropoli&lt;/a&gt; of each of the five houses. He was personally involved in the design of at least one necropolis, &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;, which he shaped with his bare hands. In order to protect the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Sepulcher of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, a tower storing the writings of the greatest military minds among the necrolords, the Primus placed several guardians in the area around the structure and filled the Sepulcher itself with various traps.\nIn the ancient past, the Primus detected treachery from his brother &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, who defied the will of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and tried to forcibly lay claim to the &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s possessed by the other Eternal Ones in the belief that they were keys to forbidden knowledge locked within the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The Primus led his siblings to victory, and they proceeded to punish Zovaal by stripping him of his sigil and his &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;new Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to judge souls in his place. They then bound him within the inescapable &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to make him its Jailer. In order to lock Zovaal away within his prison, the Primus created &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an entirely new system of magic and the most powerful runic language he'd ever made\u2014and used its runes to brand the sentence of the Eternal Ones onto his brother's flesh. The Primus hoped that the ages spent in the Maw would cause Zovaal to change his ways and repent for his sins, but they instead only caused him to grow more malevolent. Ages later, the Primus would come to regret the invention of Domination, reflecting that his anger at Zovaal had informed the creation of the magic and that, in his hubris, he had not foreseen how much damage it would cause to both the Shadowlands and the mortal realm.\nDisappearance and imprisonment.\nAges later, the Primus noticed that the Jailer's influence was seeping outside of the Maw. Suspecting that Zovaal had worked with ancient allies during his original betrayal, the Primus left Maldraxxus to investigate the matter, leaving the margraves and barons of the realm to their own devices. However, due to his tactical genius, he had foreseen a time when the Shadowlands would face grave peril and could only be saved by someone from outside the realm. For this reason, he left behind a trail of messages and boons in Maldraxxus to help mortal outsiders set things right. He placed a &lt;a href=\"Standing%20Rock\"&gt;standing stone&lt;/a&gt; at the center of a lava pool in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; as a challenge of endurance and fortitude. In truth, this stone concealed an &lt;a href=\"Unfinished%20Blade\"&gt;unfinished blade&lt;/a&gt; with no hilt, forged by the Primus himself and enchanted with five runes representing the five ideal Maldraxxi traits. Once fully empowered, this &lt;a href=\"Blade%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Blade of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; would act as a key allowing a worthy champion to access the Seat of the Primus and discover its master's final message: a warning stating that the only hope for the Shadowlands was for all of the Eternal Ones to stand united once more, protect the Arbiter, and prevent Zovaal from reaching the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Primus knew that if his suspicions about Zovaal were correct, his own &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; would be at risk. He therefore traveled to the city of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; and entrusted the sigil to the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s there. He believed that even locking it away in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Vault of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; might not be enough to keep it safe, however, so he created an additional safeguard by binding it with the &lt;a href=\"magic%20of%20memory\"&gt;magic of memory&lt;/a&gt;, which he believed that not even Zovaal could untangle.\nThe Eternal One then traveled to the Maw, where his suspicions indeed proved true and the Jailer brought about his defeat. In a reversal of how his brother had once imprisoned him, the Jailer stripped the Primus of his memories and turned him into a broken prisoner called the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;, who was subsequently trapped in chains and Domination runes in &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;an oubliette&lt;/a&gt; deep within &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Zovaal extracted countless designs from the Runecarver's mind to forge into weapons for his &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; armies, the grandest of which were the \"vessels of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;\": the &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, which he intended to use to claim \"the secret that the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; sought to hide\". The &lt;a href=\"Shards%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Shards of Domination&lt;/a&gt; used to augment the Jailer's armaments are remnants of the Runecarver's work.\nChains of Domination.\nMortal &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s eventually arrived in the Shadowlands, finished the Blade of the Primus, and uncovered the Eternal One's warning. In Torghast, Maw Walkers uncovered a key leading to the oubliette of the Runecarver, who by then had become largely forgotten. With some help from the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes allied with the Runecarver, helping recover some of his memories and allowing him to forge them into weapons and armor.\nAfter obtaining three of the five sigils required for his plan, the Jailer pulled Korthia into the Maw and sent his Mawsworn to attack the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Vault of Secrets&lt;/a&gt; in order to lay claim to the Primus' sigil as well. However, a group consisting of the attendant leader &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt;, the Primus' old apprentice &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;, and a Maw Walker retrieved the sigil before the Mawsworn had a chance to do so and brought it to &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;. Since Bolvar had watched through the Maw Walkers' eyes during their ventures into Torghast, the magic on the sigil reminded him of the Runecarver and he suggested that the prisoner was their best chance of untangling it.\nHeirmir and the Maw Walker traveled to Torghast and gave the sigil to the Runecarver. This caused its magic binds to disappear and the sigil itself to enter the Runecarver's body, instantly restoring all of his memories and causing a burst of energy that allowed him to destroy his shackles and regain his true form as the Primus. Heirmir was astonished that her master had been trapped in Torghast the whole time, while the Primus was furious that she and the hero had brought his sigil right to Zovaal's lair. Before they could argue further, the Jailer arrived with an army of Mawsworn. The Primus empowered the Maw Walker with the anima surging through the tower, and while they and Heirmir battled the lesser Mawsworn, the Primus and Zovaal fought by launching beams of energy at each other. As the battle progressed, the Jailer stunned Heirmir and the Maw Walker and summoned his vessel, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The Primus reminded his brother that his sigil would be lost forever if he was struck down, but he wasn't expecting Anduin to be carrying a &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt;. The Jailer and his champion launched a simultaneous attack to stun the Primus, allowing Anduin to use Kingsmourne to sever the sigil from the Primus' body and launch it into the Jailer's hand. Zovaal then teleported himself and his minions away, allowing the Primus and his allies to leave the tower alive.\nSince there were still heroes who needed the skills of the Runecarver, the Primus left an echo of his former state in the oubliette before traveling to Korthia with Heirmir and the hero to inform the covenants of his return. In a conference with Bolvar and Tal-Galan at Keeper's Respite, he declared that the mortals had to face the Jailer in his seat of power, the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. As a contingency, each of the covenants also had to \"remember its purpose\" and \"find its future\" in order to forge new sigils, so that they could pursue Zovaal in case the assault failed. The Eternal One told the Maw Walker that they could dwell on past mistakes when the current events were over, and gave them a &lt;a href=\"Memories%20of%20Sunless%20Skies\"&gt;token of gratitude&lt;/a&gt; for the help they'd given him while he was imprisoned.\nIn order to continue holding their position in Korthia, the covenants had to deal with the threat posed by two of the Jailer's minions in nearby &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and the Maldraxxi traitor &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt;. The Primus sent the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;Chosen&lt;/a&gt; baroness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; (who had led the necrolords in his absence) with a Maw Walker and the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; hero &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to carry out a surprise attack and \"cut the heads off these snakes\". The trio summoned the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt; and began a united covenant attack on Desmotaeron, with the Primus seemingly leading the assault from the necropolis while Draka, Thrall, and the Maw Walker confronted Helya and Vyraz in &lt;a href=\"Helgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Helgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Helya empowered Vyraz with her magic, but the Primus teleported in and gave Draka his own blessing to match. While their champions fought, the Eternal One and the sea witch threw magic and insults at each other. Vyraz was killed, and the Primus proceeded to banish Helya back to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle, the Primus stated that he would reforge his sigil and entrust it to Draka until he had need of it. He subsequently returned to his old Seat in Maldraxxus to reward Draka for her loyalty to the necrolords. He invited necrolord Maw Walkers to witness the ceremony in recognition of all that they, too, had done for the covenant. In the Seat, he named Draka the new margrave of the House of the Chosen, signifying a first step toward rebuilding Maldraxxus' armies after the betrayals they'd suffered.\nBack in Korthia, the covenant forces started facing problems with &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; infiltrators\u2014servants of &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; who had long been exiled from the Shadowlands. &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Vashj\"&gt;Baroness Vashj&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt; reported this threat to the Primus, who commented that he should've suspected that the nathrezim would return but also that he was pleased that the House of Eyes had not \"lost their sight\" in his absence. The Primus asked a Maw Walker to travel to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; and deliver a missive to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; informing him of the nathrezim's return and telling him that it was time to recruit &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the last of the still-neutral &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; and a major enemy of the nathrezim\u2014so that &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;her medallion&lt;/a&gt; could be used in the creation of a new venthyr sigil. He sent along a similar missive addressed directly to the Stonewright, curtly telling her that they needed her medallion and that the time for neutrality was over. The Primus sent Vashj to accompany the Maw Walker due to her experience with the nathrezim. After a few twists and turns, the mission resulted in the creation of a new sigil and the Stonewright pledging her forces to the cause against the Jailer.\nMaw Walkers later helped both the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; create new sigils by mending the relationship between the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; and her sister &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and creating a new path for the kyrian where the virtue of Loyalty was replaced with Devotion, respectively. They informed the Primus of both of these successes, and he in turn called on the covenants to deliver their sigils to Korthia.\nThe Maw Walkers and their allies attacked the Sanctum of Domination but failed to stop Zovaal: he enveloped &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in the Maw, claimed the final sigil from the Arbiter, and escaped through a portal to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; returned to Keeper's Respite to tell the Primus what happened. He stated that while the Jailer had won the battle, he would not win the war. Covenant representatives arrived to Korthia and handed over their reforged sigils, which the Primus could use to create a key to follow Zovaal to his destination. First, though, he had to find something to replace the Arbiter's sigil. He commended Maw Walkers for their efforts but said that it was now time for his own work to begin and left through a death gate, telling the heroes that he'd call on them when the key was ready.\nEternity's End.\nWhen the time came to pursue Zovaal, the Primus summoned a Maw Walker and several covenant representatives to the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; atop Oribos. He worked with &lt;a href=\"Tal-Inara\"&gt;Tal-Inara&lt;/a&gt; and some of the other &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s to recreate the Arbiter's sigil and used it along with the covenant sigils to open a new gateway to Zereth Mortis. Since the Primus and the other Eternal Ones were forbidden from returning to Zereth Mortis, the place of their creation, the Maw Walker would have to go alone and find a foothold so the covenants could follow them. &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; of the kyrian asked to accompany the Maw Walker, which the Primus allowed. As the two prepared to take off, a &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Infiltrator\"&gt;nathrezim infiltrator&lt;/a&gt; revealed herself and summoned &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces to attack the Crucible. The Primus lent his necrotic power to the Maw Walker so they could fight off the invaders, but in the end they and Pelagos only just managed to fly through the gate moments before the Mawsworn disabled it. After defeating the nathrezim and cleansing the Maw magic from the gateway, the Primus moved it to the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt;. He trusted that the Maw Walker would find an anchor on the other side to reactivate it, which is also what later happened.\nIn the Sepulcher of the First Ones, Maw Walkers and their allies helped free &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; from the Jailer's control, but before confronting Zovaal himself they needed to find a way to resist his &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic. The Primus kept his earlier statement about not going to Zereth Mortis in person but sent a projection to the &lt;a href=\"Geometric%20Cavern\"&gt;Geometric Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. He pointed out that Zereth Mortis' &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; seemed to be resistant to Domination and that using the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; could help them uncover the reason. He had a Maw Walker test the Helm's power first on a volunteering &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and then on Zereth Mortis' wildlife before they sought out the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Eru\"&gt;Elder Eru&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that the automa were granted resistance to Domination by the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, indecipherable phrases of which lay buried in the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The Primus knew this language wouldn't be enough, however, and prepared to gather something more while the Maw Walker, Darion, Bolvar Fordragon, and &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; headed to the Endless Sands to infuse the phrases into the intact half of the Helm. Shortly after, the Primus sent word telling the heroes to go to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; for a ritual to extract the memories of what had helped them resist Domination in the past and infuse those memories into the Helm shards. After this was done, the group brought the Helm pieces to the Primus back in the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt;, where he used the First One phrases and the memories to reforge the Helm into something greater, an instrument of free will that would bring about Zovaal's defeat: the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker used the Crown to make themselves and their allies resistant to Domination, after which the Primus took the Crown away for safekeeping until it was needed.\nAs hoped, the resistance granted by the Crown allowed the Maw Walkers to defeat Zovaal at last. Afterward, the Crown ended up with Bolvar, who in turn delivered it to &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, in Oribos. Through projections, the Primus and the other covenant leaders attended the trial of the Jailer's former ally &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in the Crucible.\nRegalia.\nThe Primus owns a set of powerful armor. It is said that when he disappeared, the armor pieces were scattered. Over the course of the &lt;a href=\"%3ANecrolords%20Campaign\"&gt;:Necrolords Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, necrolord adventurers gradually obtain the different pieces and place them on the statue of the Primus within his Seat.\nThe statue disappears during the Primus' return to the Seat in &lt;a href=\"Filling%20an%20Empty%20Throne\"&gt;Filling an Empty Throne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Roads%20We%20Walk\"&gt;The Roads We Walk&lt;/a&gt;, but it reappears after the quests.\nQuests.\nChains of Domination campaign.\nIntroductory portion:\nEnding portion:\nIntroductory portion:\nEnding portion:\nZereth Mortis campaign.\nLater:\nLater still:"}

When he learned of Mechagon's plans of mechanizing all organic life, Erazmin formed the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, later aided by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, to stop his father's mad scheme.

Accompanied by a retinue of two other mechagnomes, Prince Erazmin, and a companion of the prince, they found Kervo and brought him into &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon City&lt;/a&gt;. Erazmin hung back a bit out of earshot with his friend, who told the prince that they could make use of the outsider.\nAfter being shown around the city and having had King Mechagon's goals explained to him, Kervo was escorted back to his chambers by a mechagnome. Erazmin approached the pair and offered to escort their guest himself. Once out of earshot of the other gnomes, Erazmin told Kervo that he had to leave the city immediately that night. He explained that the king was using Kervo and his apparent pain and weakness to drum up support among his subjects for a device he planned to use to forcibly revert the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; among all organic life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, which Kervo had to warn his people back home about. While Kervo tried to protest that he hadn't yet found what he came for, Erazmin stated that the warning was more important. He instructed Kervo to gather his things and be ready for when the prince came to get him out of the city.\nHowever, when Erazmin and his companion went to Kervo's chamber shortly after, they found it to be empty: Erazmin realized that the \"crazy old fool\" had gone to tell the king about his son's treachery, meaning Erazmin and his allies had to flee the city immediately before the &lt;a href=\"Arcforged\"&gt;Arcforged&lt;/a&gt; came for them.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter fleeing the city, Erazmin and his allies established themselves in &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt\"&gt;Rustbolt&lt;/a&gt; and declared themselves the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime afterwards &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; respectively led the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;. Accepting their aid, the Prince's requested for Tinkmaster Overspark and Gazlowe to put aside their differences and fight together, while he led adventurers in a rescue mission in the &lt;a href=\"Junkwatt%20Depot\"&gt;Junkwatt Depot&lt;/a&gt;. As he fought with the adventurers, he revealed that his father had secretly mechanized the bodies of those who resisted him, a process that left nothing left of the original gnomes, and warned that if King Mechagon wasn't stopped that everyone would share their fate. Amidst the fighting, Erazmin discovered a broken drill rig and ordered for its restoration, which released &lt;a href=\"Pascal-K1N6\"&gt;Pascal-K1N6&lt;/a&gt; upon its completion.\nWith the rescue complete, Erazmin declared that King Mechagon wouldn't stop sending his armies at the Resistance as long as he did not fear them. To that end, he ordered for one his father's projectors to be hacked in order to proudly shine the banner of the Rustbolt Resistance that would be big enough for the whole island to see. With this accomplished, Erazmin directed his new allies to return to Rustbolt, where he gave them a tour of the city and formally invited them to the resistance.\nKnowing that the &lt;a href=\"Mechoriginator\"&gt;Mechoriginator&lt;/a&gt; would reverse the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; and obliterate anything not descended from the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Erazmin declared that they had to stop his father before it was too late. Following his father's death, Erazmin declared that his father truly died the day he abandoned his body and soul for full mechanization. Remarking on the burden of leadership, Erazmin revealed that he planned to lead his people with wisdom, ingenuity, and humility.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance adventurer arranged for the &lt;a href=\"Mekkatorque%27s%20Escape%20Pod\"&gt;sealed pod&lt;/a&gt; containing the wounded &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; to be sent to Mechagon, Erazmin and his people offered their aid, honored to help the High Tinker. To restore the High Tinker's mental function, Erazmin had the Alliance hero go around Rustbolt, asking his people what they thought made a good leader, and asking their kin from Gnomeregan why they followed Mekkatorque. Upon returning to consciousness, Mekkatorque joined with Erazmin, Kelsey, and the Alliance adventurer to return to Mechagon City and remove the last of Mechagon's loyalists. With Mechagon, at last, free, Erazmin expressed his belief to Mekkatorque that for all of Mechagon City's wonders, it represented the schism between his father and the rest of gnomanity. For all their upgrades, the people of Mechagon were still gnomes at heart. Thus, Erazmin asked that Mechagon be reunited with Gnomeregan, with Mekkatorque as the new king of all gnomes. Mekkatorque accepted, on the condition that Erazmin stand at his side as counselor and friend. Without hesitation, Erazmin agreed.\nHe later attended the summit hosted by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to declare the armistice of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. He stood next to Gelbin throughout the announcement and clapped for Anduin's declaration that the armistice was signed. Unlike most of the leaders, he, Gelbin, and &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt;, remained behind in the embassy and engaged in a conversation following &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s rejection of the armistice.\nAlternate timeline.\nIn one possible future, King Mechagon successfully activates the &lt;a href=\"Mechoriginator\"&gt;Mechoriginator&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of removing the Curse of Flesh, however, Battle Captain &lt;a href=\"Izira%20Gearsworn\"&gt;Izira Gearsworn&lt;/a&gt; suspected that due to flawed and corrupted research, it simply burns away all flesh on Azeroth, killing the majority of all living things. Only those who were sufficiently mechanized survived. King Mechagon, working with &lt;a href=\"Bondo%20Bigblock\"&gt;Bondo Bigblock&lt;/a&gt;, soon after assaulted Rustbolt in the chaos with Bondo's &lt;a href=\"clockwork%20giant\"&gt;clockwork giant&lt;/a&gt;s and mechanical spiders. The mechagnomes fought back until their gears gave out, but many of them are killed. Izira, their strongest fighter, was incapacitated when her legs broke, leaving her unable to prevent Prince Erazmin from being taken prisoner. Mechagon proceeded to fully mechanize Prince Erazmin, transforming him into &lt;a href=\"The%20Rusty%20Prince\"&gt;The Rusty Prince&lt;/a&gt; and bending him fully beneath his will, who can then be fought as a rare encounter by players.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nJunkwatt Depot.\nThe kidnapped Resistance fighters are being held in this fortress by my father's mechanized forces.\nDon't show mercy. They won't.\nDo not delay. Every second lost is a mechagnome lost.\nRustbolt.\nMany rumors of my father's plans have leaked to the surface, but data is scarce.\nAs we await confirmation, prepare yourself and your people.\nThe Rustbolt Resistance will need you by our side when the time comes.\nYou are already a master of technology, in a way.\nYou study magic, I study mechanics. They both follow important principles that aren\u2019t so different from each other. I\u2019ve often said that the underlying ideas and ideals of the\u2014\nOh, apologies, you asked me a specific question. Let me answer your question with a very simple idea:\nThere are more than just ARCANE missiles.\nI see that you\u2019re willing to go to any lengths to acquire the power you crave. You must be careful where that urge leads you. I\u2019ve seen it lead to pain and misery in my father.\nBut, in the realm of self-modification, your unwavering will is a boon. Others resist the benefits of mechanization out of fear or misunderstanding. You will not.\nI will not feign to know what powerful upgrades you are already considering. I\u2019m certain you already have some in mind.\nInstead, I will caution you against going too far. Do not lose yourself in the machine. Take it slow.\nGreater men and women than you have fallen prey to it\u2019s lure.\nYou\u2019ve earned those calluses on your hands and feet, and I would deprive you of them through full limb replacement.\nStay subtle. What if you embedded steel plates under your palms and retractable katars in your knees?\nYou\u2019d look the same, but would be at least 19% more dangerous.\nI\u2019m surprised to hear that you are open to such ideas. I\u2019ve always said that nature often needs to be pushed along, but I would have wagered that you\u2019d disagree.\nThat said, I\u2019m unsure how permanent modifications would interface reliably with your malleable biological components. Unless you\u2019re willing to take large risks, I would recommend starting with ingestible modifiers.\nIf those succeed, move onto small, superficial attachments that can be removed without risk if your body reacts poorly.\n&lt;Prince Erazmin appears lost in thought&gt;\nThis is a truly puzzling postulate.\nOur researchers have had tremendous breakthroughs in enhancing the connection between a hunter and their pet via embedded communication and empathy relay modules.\nI must warn you, however. There are many unsavory side effects that many hunters choose not to speak of.\nSometimes, even our closest companions are better left outside our heads.\nI understand your kind do not require sleep on a biological level.\nHowever, sleep offers secondary benefits to cognitive functions and memory consolidation in others, so I assume it would for you as well.\nIf you insist on avoiding it, I recommend experimenting with swappable sensory deprivation modules that may assist in short-term mediation and stress-reduction experiences. \nOr, if you refuse to consider such activities entirely, at least mod your eyeballs to give you flawless nighttime vision for those nocturnal hours.\nYou desperately require an embedded flashlight.\n&lt;Prince Erazmin waits far too long for you to laugh.&gt;\nMessage received. The joke landed better with the last &lt;class&gt;.\nYou' have many formal techniques, but I'd like to see some boosts to your creativity. What if you embedded prisms into every limb of your body to aid in the manipulation of the Light in new and unforeseen ways?\nActually, does your Light work in the same way as natural light? Are the naaru okay with unconventional manipulations of it? Does the Light come from inside of you, or is it channeled through you from another, invisible source?\nTo be honest, the whole Light thing has never made much sense to me, personally...\nYou're quiet, certainly. But you are not my-new-feet-are-made-of-material-that-absorbs-all-sound-even-ones-that-my-feet-produce quiet.\nMaybe you're less worried about hiding, though? You could also embed extra daggers wherever your hands can reach on your body, for easy access during combat.\nDon't poison them before you embed them, though. &lt;a href=\"Takron\"&gt;Takron&lt;/a&gt;, you fool...\nEvery shaman I've ever met has a favorite element... even if they won't admit it.\nYou require more lightning? Stuff your arms with a variety of metal gadgets to make them perfect, efficient conduits of that electricity!\nMore interested in lava? Perhaps try internal forges that'll keep you fueled up and ready to unleash molten rock at anything that moves.\nWater is easy. Most people are made of the compound. We've created pumps that tap right into that personal reservoir when you need it most!\nI see a singular purpose in your muscles: to fight, to kill, to stand triumphant in battle.\nWe can improve those muscles to make them better at such things, or replace them entirely.\nSome warriors I've spoken with were unwilling to give up the pain and bloodrush that comes with feeling every blow recieved in battle. I hope you will consider my counsel to the contrary.\nYou should replace your limbs with mechanical versions that are superior in every way. Any emotional responses you lose while in battle can be simulated with artificial stimulants.\nOf course. I'm the one who designed it, before my exile from Mechagon. Though I was able to keep it out of my father's possession, it is inoperable without a Perfection Enhancing Gearbox to regulate its output.\nBut even if we had one... I'm afraid the Mecha-Perfection Turbo is far too dangerous for anyone to use. It would take a truly impressive &lt;a href=\"Hertz%20Locker\"&gt;feat of strength&lt;/a&gt; to convince me that an individual is sufficiently equipped to handle the risk.\nPost-Operation: Mechagon - The Mechoriginator.\nI remember the wisdom and courage that my father showed when I was a child. In those early days, he led our people well. He saw a brighter future, and helped guide us to it.\nThat is the version of my father that I will carry with me as I lead our people forward.\nTheir trust will not be easily earned. And it should not be.\nI will earn it, and then I will keep it."}

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Farondis was one the few Highborne rulers who dared defy &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the destruction of his city Nar'thalas and most of Azsuna at her hands. Ten thousand years later, when the Legion invaded his lands yet again, Queen Azshara herself appeared before Farondis, offering to break her curse should he pledge his people's allegiance to her, but once again, Farondis rejected her, finally impressing and winning back the long-denied favor and support of his people.\nBackground.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s pact with the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; went mostly uncontested by her subjects. One of the few that dared to defy her was Prince Farondis.\nAs one of the queen's trusted advisors, Farondis was in regular contact with the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, but his palace in Azsuna was several leagues away from the elven capital. As such, he was able to witness Sargeras' influence on the Highborne court without falling sway to the demons' temptation.\nFarondis' plan was bold, but simple - destroy the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in Zin-Azshari. Doing so would close the portal to Sargeras' realm and stem the tide of evil before it even started. In order to accomplish this task, he would use the power of an artifact stored deep within &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Nar'thalas Academy&lt;/a&gt;: The &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnfortunately, the queen's influence in Farondis' palace was already deep-seated. &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Vandros\"&gt;Vandros&lt;/a&gt;, a young noble in Farondis' court who later settled in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, caught word of Farondis' plans to defy the Queen, and reported the insurrection to Queen Azshara herself.\nAzshara wasted no time in punishing Farondis and his people. In a frightening display of arcane power, she destroyed the Tidestone of Golganneth, and in doing so, released a wave of dark energy over all of Azsuna and its inhabitants.\nSince that day, the ten thousand night elves of Azsuna have been unable to experience the release of death, despite their repeated efforts to release themselves. Their spirits wander the land indefinitely, all because of their prince's allegiances.\nLegion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, Farondis aids adventurers in finding the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt; by bringing them to &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Nar'thalas Academy&lt;/a&gt;. He is greeted with heavy animosity by his people, and is unable to enter the academy due to his guilt.\nFarondis eventually overcomes his fears and approaches the academy, where he sees &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Athissa\"&gt;Tidemistress Athissa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Parjesh\"&gt;Warlord Parjesh&lt;/a&gt; kidnapping the adventurer. He considers going after them to recover the Tidestone, but opts to rescue his champion from the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; slavers. Upon reaching the mouth of the cave where the adventurer is imprisoned, he is greeted by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Changing into an image of her former self when he doesn't recognize her, Azshara taunts him over how he failed his people. However, she offers to release his people from their curse if Farondis swears fealty to her.\nFarondis seems to briefly consider her offer, before then quickly turning his wrath upon the queen, vowing that his people, and that of Azsuna, will never bow to her and those she allied with, and viciously attacking her with a series of &lt;a href=\"Meteor\"&gt;Meteor&lt;/a&gt; attacks. Azshara simply laughs and disappears, claiming that her &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;wrath&lt;/a&gt; is coming. He then proceeds to eliminate the naga within the cave, rescuing the adventurer. He then assists them in finding Athissa at a portal going to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Eye of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; so that they can retrieve the Tidestone.\nDuring the battle against Athissa, his people return to his side, claiming that they saw him stand up to Azshara, and that any leader who would do such a thing is worth following. Even if doing that before got them all killed.\nHe seeks to free his people from undeath using a potion modified from the cocktail that caused &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Garuhod\"&gt;Magister Garuhod&lt;/a&gt; to explode into a wisp.\nFarondis leads the defense of Azsuna during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nPost-The Head of the Snake.\nOur work is nearly done.\nI must thank you for including me in your adventure, &lt;name&gt;. I may have assisted you in finding the Tidestone itself, but I feel you have done so much more for me and my people."}

Later, his brother, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Prince Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, instructed fledgling &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s to seek Keleseth out at the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Remembrance\"&gt;Crypt of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;.

He then ordered the death knight to use torture tools to extract information about the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\" from members of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, he directed the death knight to report to &lt;a href=\"Orbaz%20Bloodbane\"&gt;Orbaz Bloodbane&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Tavern\"&gt;Scarlet Tavern&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a vision in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, Keleseth was seen resurrecting &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; alongside Valanar, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Theraldis\"&gt;Theraldis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Atherann\"&gt;Atherann&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; deployed Keleseth to &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of harnessing the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;'s potential for destruction. Upon arriving, the ambassador found a people who were more than eager to assist the Scourge, and the keep proved to be an excellent staging point for terrorizing the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. Keleseth acted as the Lich King's eyes and ears in the Howling Fjord, and his primary residence was Utgarde, where he assisted &lt;a href=\"Ingvar%20the%20Plunderer\"&gt;Ingvar the Plunderer&lt;/a&gt; in organizing raids on the surrounding territory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s victory over the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"North%20Fleet\"&gt;North Fleet&lt;/a&gt; in the Howling Fjord, Keleseth appeared at &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Landing\"&gt;Vengeance Landing&lt;/a&gt; with four &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; to taunt &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Anselm\"&gt;High Executor Anselm&lt;/a&gt; and invite the Forsaken to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Anselm ordered his archers to fire at Keleseth, but the blood prince teleported behind the vrykul so that the arrows killed them instead of him. He then used his magic to drain the souls of Anselm's troops before vanishing. Anselm proceeded to send &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Keleseth inside &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. During the assault on Utgarde, Keleseth was slain by the invading heroes.\nKeleseth, along with his brother Valanar and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Taldaram\"&gt;Prince Taldaram&lt;/a&gt; from , were later raised into undeath yet again by the Lich King to form the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Council\"&gt;Blood Prince Council&lt;/a&gt;. Their duty was to avenge themselves on the heroes that slew them and to protect &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;, the blood-queen of the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt;.

Upon arriving, the ambassador found a people who were more than eager to assist the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The keep has proved to be an excellent staging point for terrorizing the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, and Keleseth has no intention of losing it to insolent trespassers.\"\nStrategy.\nIt is important to mind the random Frost Tomb applied to players, these can be burnt down and should be if your party is low on healing. A Frost Tomb does approximately 8000 damage which leaves most level 70\u2019s either dead or very close to it. In addition to Frost Tombs, the prince will summon 5 skeletons which can be crowd controlled, make sure they are grouped up when they die because they will be resurrected periodically throughout the fight and it\u2019s easier to control them if they\u2019re in a group.\nIf the entire group stands directly in front of the tank then the skeletons and ice blocks will stay in the same place - this means the tank can maintain aggro on skeletons with their AOE move and both the tank and melee can easily take down ice blocks without having to move.\nPaladin Tanks are arguably the best suited tank for this, as they can bubble out of the Frost Tomb and use specific UD killing moves like Holy wrath to easily pick up the skeleton adds. This boss is relatively easy, however should not be underestimated. Challenging shout/roar is useful when the adds spawn.\nAchievement.\nAssociated with the &lt;a href=\"On%20The%20Rocks\"&gt;On The Rocks&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nPrince Keleseth drops either a &lt;a href=\"Bouquet%20of%20Red%20Roses\"&gt;Bouquet of Red Roses&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Bouquet%20of%20Ebon%20Roses\"&gt;Bouquet of Ebon Roses&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; celebration.

{"id": "50212", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=50212", "title": "Prince Malchezaar", "text": "Prince Malchezaar was a prince of the &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He took control of the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; where he can be fought as a raid boss, at the very top of the tower. Access to his room, the &lt;a href=\"Netherspace\"&gt;Netherspace&lt;/a&gt;, is granted after the &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;Chess Event&lt;/a&gt; encounter.\nWarlocks wearing &lt;a href=\"Deathrattle%20Regalia\"&gt;Deathrattle Regalia&lt;/a&gt; had a chance to summon Malchezaar \"from the void\" in \"Warlords of Draenor\", prior to the deactivation of old tier set bonuses, who then assisted them in battle. Presently, a demonology &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Portal\"&gt;Nether Portal&lt;/a&gt; talent has a chance for Malchezaar to appear as one of the additional demons that have a chance of appearing.\nBackground.\nIt is unknown when Malchezaar arrived at &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; or what his goal there was. He apparently arrived while some agents of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Eye\"&gt;Violet Eye&lt;/a&gt; were still alive inside the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;, notably &lt;a href=\"Keanna%27s%20Log\"&gt;Keanna&lt;/a&gt;. It was likely shortly before Karazhan was sealed, as the Violet Eye were aware of Keanna's death. He was seemingly a collector of rare weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Justice\"&gt;Light's Justice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;. \nMalchezaar is a \"memory\" in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Argent Confessor Paletress&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Champion\"&gt;Trial of the Champion&lt;/a&gt; encounter of the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Malchezaar, and the legions he commands, fell to the summoning behest of warlocks who mastered the art of demonology.\nStrategy.\nPhase One.\nPhase One starts immediately when Malchezaar aggroes. The door to the balcony closes, and Malchezaar starts summoning infernals and casting Enfeeble and Shadow Nova. He casts Shadow Word: Pain on the tank.\nPhase Two.\nPhase Two starts when Prince Malchezaar is reduced to 60% health. He warps in axes, which substantially increases his melee damage. He stops casting Shadow Word: Pain and starts Parrying and Thrashing and casting Sunder Armor on the tank. Infernal summoning, Enfeeble, and Shadow Nova continue as in Phase One.\nThrash is the biggest threat during this phase and can deal more than 12,000 damage inside of a second. Healers should keep the tank as close to full health as possible and stagger movements during group shifts to ensure the tank does not go very long without a heal.\nPhase Three.\nPhase Three begins when Prince Malchezaar reaches 30% health. Melee damage on the tank returns to Phase One levels. He stops using Enfeeble, Thrash, Sunder Armor, and Parry. He continues casting Shadow Nova. He starts casting Shadow Word: Pain and Amplify Damage on random raid members. He throws his axes into the air where they fly around attacking raid members at random. He starts summoning infernals much more frequently.\nInfernal spotting.\nMalchezaar emotes either \"\"You face not Malchezaar alone, but the legions I command!\" or \"All realities, all dimensions are open to me!\"\" immediately before summoning an infernal. If you look to the sky beyond the balcony, you'll see a bright yellow meteor headed toward the raid. Its trajectory is a little tricky but somewhat predictable.\nOne responsible non-melee raider should act as a spotter. He receives a raid marker and has three jobs:\nThe other ranged raiders stick close to the spotter. It's possible to skip the raid marker and announce safe spots, but using the marker requires a lot less communication.\nAs for the infernals themselves: before landing, they fly in a straight line toward a point in the arena, but shift direction suddenly at the last second, usually down.\nNaturally, your spotter should be smart about choosing a safe spot. A wide open place is better than sandwiched between two infernals' AoE, and the area of the Prince's Shadow Nova is right out.\nDuring Phase Three, Malchezaar summons infernals at an increased rate, so watch those emotes.\nWipes.\nWipes on Prince Malchezaar are typically caused by one of four things:\nNote that better gear, especially on the damage-dealers, reduces the possibility of all of these problems.\nIn Hearthstone.\nPrince Malchezaar appears as the last boss of The Prologue and The Spire wings in the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.gamepedia.com/One_Night_in_Karazhan\"&gt;One Night in Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; adventure in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Defeating him in the last wing awards him as &lt;a href=\"https%3A//hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Prince_Malchezaar\"&gt;a legendary card&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Convinced that the Master is behind the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought, he rallied a formidable force to lead a rebellion to succeed Sire Denathrius and make the anima flow once more.\nIn contrast to his prideful father, Renathal is more humble and devoted to Revendreth's original mission. He also appears to enjoy taking chances on gambits that seemingly have very little chance to succeed. Despite his attacks on &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt; and his attempts to unite the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; against Denathrius all initially ending in failure, he refuses to let the Venthyr and the Shadowlands go out without a fight. He describes the war against &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; as something that will inevitably end in failure, but claims that there is excitement to be had in battling the inevitable.\nPrince Renathal personally refers to Denathrius as father. His blade &lt;a href=\"Vorpalia\"&gt;Vorpalia&lt;/a&gt; is sentient like &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt;. He has a pet &lt;a href=\"gargon\"&gt;gargon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Vrednic\"&gt;Vrednic&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Breakfist\"&gt;Breakfist&lt;/a&gt; was one of the last of Renathal's forces from his first rebellion left in &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;. His former home is &lt;a href=\"Darkwall%20Tower\"&gt;Darkwall Tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nPrince Renathal was the first venthyr crafted by the Denathrius's own hand in &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;. He was once a popular courtier within &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;\u2019 Court and &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Harvester&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dominion\"&gt;Dominion&lt;/a&gt; and oversaw the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;. He has, however, considered conspiring against Denathrius in the past before the Harvesters knew of his treachery. After Denathrius exiled the nathrezim, the prince was never informed of what became of them. However, in time he would learn that mortals had come to know them as dreadlords.\nAt some point between the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; arriving in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and arriving in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, word of their presence reached Renathal, as well as his sword &lt;a href=\"Vorpalia\"&gt;Vorpalia&lt;/a&gt;. Renathal recognized the Maw Walker as one of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s champions.\nBelieving that Denathrius was not acting in Revendreth's best interests, Renathal led a rebellion against him. Many Venthyr supported him, including two other members of the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;The Accuser&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt;), various nobles such as Duke &lt;a href=\"Theotar\"&gt;Theotar&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; forces formerly of the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion\"&gt;Stone Legion&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt;. However, Renathal had relied on the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;Medallion of Dominion&lt;/a&gt; to help him, and this caused Denathrius to know everything Renathal had planned. Renathal was captured and flung by Denathrius into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; along with The Curator, and most of his allies were banished into the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Maw Walker arrives in Revendreth, the area is in the midst of the rebellion that Renathal started against Denathrius. Both Denathrius and Renathal's forces had hoped for the Maw Walker to ally themself with them. Thanks to the interventions of &lt;a href=\"The%20Accuser\"&gt;The Accuser&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walker learns of the truth, defeating &lt;a href=\"The%20Fearstalker\"&gt;The Fearstalker&lt;/a&gt;, obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Dread\"&gt;Medallion of Dread&lt;/a&gt;, and rescuing Prince Renathal from the Maw.\nImmediately Prince Renathal orders the Castle sealed through the use of the mirrors that had previously barred entry into &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; to focus the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; onto the front gate of the Castle. He then proceeds to inform the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; that Denathrius has betrayed the Shadowlands. With his freedom and old and new allies, he attempts to confront Denathrius once again. While he fails to defeat Denathrius, it does force his hand, hemorrhaging the anima stores of &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Depths\"&gt;Sanguine Depths&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Menagerie%20of%20the%20Master\"&gt;Menagerie of the Master&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder his leadership, the Medallions begin to be gathered in Sinfall and a plan is formed. &lt;a href=\"The%20Countess\"&gt;The Countess&lt;/a&gt; gives the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Desire\"&gt;Medallion of Desire&lt;/a&gt; willingly, &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; retrieves the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Avarice\"&gt;Medallion of Avarice&lt;/a&gt; after regaining control of the &lt;a href=\"Catacombs%20Ward\"&gt;Catacombs Ward&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Medallion of Pride&lt;/a&gt; is regained from the &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Chamberlain\"&gt;Lord Chamberlain&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith four of the Medallions gathered he leads the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;asssault on Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt; with his forces, the Maw Walker, and others. Denathrius is defeated but &lt;a href=\"Remornia\"&gt;Remornia&lt;/a&gt;, in a final attempt to save her master, consumes Denathrius' essence into the blade and tries to escape to the Maw for him to be restored by &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. Renathal traps Remornia and takes the blade holding the Master to &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Z%27rali\"&gt;Z'rali&lt;/a&gt; has been granted authority as it is both closest to the Light and at a distance from any venthyr, and gives her the task of remediating Denathrius for eons, until he repents.\nA vessel to contain the power of all seven Medallions of the Harvesters is created: the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Harvesters\"&gt;Crown of the Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;. The Crown of the Harvesters is obtained with the help of &lt;a href=\"Forgelite\"&gt;Forgelite&lt;/a&gt; Prime &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt;, combining &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; ore and anima from both ascended kyrians of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Temple of Purity&lt;/a&gt; and Duke Theotar. The Crown is then purified at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Temple of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; of Denathrius's control and influence after he attempted to take over the Maw Walker due to the nature of the power of the Medallions empowering the Crown.\nTo consolidate his power over Revendreth, and with the help of his trusted contact Baroness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; discovers a conspiracy between the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Tithelord\"&gt;The Tithelord&lt;/a&gt;, the Tithelord is defeated and the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Envy\"&gt;Medallion of Envy&lt;/a&gt; taken, and it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; had been given his Medallion. Once again working with the Necrolords, the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;Medallion of Dominion&lt;/a&gt; is retrieved by &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. As he places the Medallion of Dominion in the centerpiece of Sinfall, Denathrius whispers to Renathal through the Medallion. The Accuser reminds Renathal of who Denathrius has become because of his lust for power. Renathal agrees and states that the Court of Harvesters will rule Revendreth in unity, sharing in power.\nChains of Domination.\nAfter receiving word from the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; had returned, Renathal was surprised as he had not dared image they would grow so bold again. He also viewed it as a shame that they had not learned in their exile and returned to them as enemies, instead of family. Agreeing that the Primus was right, Renathal led a routine to seek out the &lt;a href=\"the%20Stonewright\"&gt;the Stonewright&lt;/a&gt; as her grievances against the Unseen could fill a library and she held the last of the medallions that they needed. As the meeting between Renathal and Stonewright commenced, Renathal was stunned when the Stonewright revealed that &lt;a href=\"Chelra%20the%20Bladewall\"&gt;Chelra&lt;/a&gt; had been beheaded after Denathrius had casted him into the Maw, and thus revealed that the Chelra with them was in reality the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Nal%27ragas\"&gt;Nal'ragas&lt;/a&gt;. After being exposed Nal'ragas was able to seize the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;Medallion of Wrath&lt;/a&gt; and flee from the venthyr. As the Maw Walker, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; hunted down and kill Nal'ragas, he learned from the Stonewright how Chelra fell to the master when he was a prisoner of the Maw. After being informed of Nal'ragas' death, he reflected on how Chelra was his friend and protector through countless ages, how he didn't even know she had been slain, her identity stolen, and he ultimately declared it as another sin for Denathrius to atone for.\nUpon learning from the Maw Walker that the Medallion of Wrath had been given to &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, Renathal revealed that they could use the other medallions they had recovered to locate him. He then instructed the Maw Walker and their dreadlord hunting party to join him in returning to Sinfall. After returning to Sinfall he remarked that while the nathrezim were not crafted from souls, they were in many ways more his siblings than his fellow venthyr, and viewed it a shame on what they chose to become. As the Court of Harvesters prepared their detection rituals, Renathal directed the dreadlord hunting party with to route out Nal'ragas' cohorts, while the Stonewright had them reveal their secret communications. With the ritual preparations complete, Renathal warned that the nathrezim specialized in avoiding detection and called upon them to follow the path as soon as it was revealed and to follow it with speed.\nAs Mal'ganis and his cohorts were confronted by the Maw Walker and his allies, Renathal wearing the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Harvesters\"&gt;Crown of the Harvesters&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the scene. He offered the Mal'ganis the chance to cease the conflict, join them in saving Revendreth, and ending his exile. However the dreadlord retorted that the nathrezim were never in exile, how it was all part of the Master's plan, and that with them focused on him and the medallion to left the way open for &lt;a href=\"Kin%27tessa\"&gt;Kin'tessa&lt;/a&gt; to liberate Remornia. Though Denathrius had been liberated, Mal'Ganis was captured by the Court of Harvesters, and in the aftermath Renathal admitted that he couldn't have imaged the depth of their betrayal not only of Revendreth, but of the Shadowlands and all of reality. When asked about him wearing the Crown of the Harvesters, the Prince revealed that he had placed safeguards within the crown to ensure that one person couldn't wear the crown by themselves and how the other harvesters could reclaim their power. Renathal then remarked that the Court of Harvesters, must fortify what they have taken, secure their anima reserves, and rally the support of Revendreth to their cause. He also admitted that it would take time to formally induct new Harvesters of Envy and Dread, with Renathal admitting that if Kael'thas was farther along in his penance he would be considered. He lastly declared that the Shadowlands can never truly be whole until the Arbiter resumes sending souls to the afterlives.\nWith all the medallions in their possession, Renathal and the other Harvesters forged a new &lt;a href=\"Sigil\"&gt;Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, which the Stonewright later delivered the sigil to the Primus along with the unity and purpose of Revendreth.\nEternity's End.\nThrough projections, Renathal and the other covenant leaders attended the trial of the Jailer's former ally &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in Oribos' &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nWhile the venthyr of the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Asylum\"&gt;Shrouded Asylum&lt;/a&gt; are hostile to the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; and as venthyr of the Ember Ward they were originally under the jurisdiction of Prince Renathal, they are also hostile to the player and Renathal's forces. Given Renathal's home was &lt;a href=\"Darkwall%20Tower\"&gt;Darkwall Tower&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Ward\"&gt;Castle Ward&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible he betrayed or abandoned them in some capacity, perhaps when the Light invaded.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

His model is identical to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, though he wields a different weapon. The Sarsarun encounter is also unique in that it takes place in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20Terrace\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, a special subzone of Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj used only in this encounter.

It can be a good idea to pop a cooldown if the tank is low on health or at least shield etc. them before the stun hits. Due to the stun, this is usually when a cyclone can catch up to players.\nCyclones will pick up and suspend players briefly as it moves over where they were standing. While suspended, the player will slowly drop until the cyclone moves fully away, at which they are dropped at regular fall speed. \nIn a nutshell:"}

Prince Taldaram is one of these cunning and bloodthirsty vampiric beings. Always seeking to please the Lich King, he has entered the war-torn depths of Ahn'kahet in search of lost &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; relics that can empower the Scourge's murderous ranks.\"\nTo Summon.\nIn order to engage Prince Taldaram, his force shield must be deactivated. Before reaching his platform, there are two smaller platforms, each with four mobs and a crystal orb. To reach the platforms there is a spider-web bridge which can be difficult to spot if it's your first time in the instance. Kill the mobs and click the orbs. Once both have been clicked, the force shield around the platform nearby will disappear. The party should then go to the platform and engage the boss.\nHeroic.\nFlame Sphere - Now shoots three spheres in an arc covering about a third of the platform. Increased damage.\nVampiric Drain - Similar effect, but now also reduces healing on the affected (stunned) player by 100%. Immunity effects such as &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; are also ineffective. &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; works though. 'Shield' effects such as a Priest's do work.\nStrategy - Have the tank tank him at either extreme side (far or near) of his platform. This way, when he casts Flame Sphere, the entire group can stay together, and run towards the opposite extreme side of his platform. This allows you to only have to dodge two balls, as opposed to three. DPS the boss as quickly as possible when he starts Draining a player. If you bring him from side to side of his platform, then the Flame Spheres are quite easy to overcome, even in heroic.\nAlternative Strategy - As the orbs of fire he spawns move away from him in a triangle it is best to tank him with his back to the rest of the party. Exposing the rest of the party as little as possible to the 2 orbs that are spawned. The best location to do this is on the lower platform moving him from right side to left and back, while the healer stays in the middle.\nIn Hearthstone.\nTaldaram appears as in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Ranged DPS and healers should stand fairly close to the main tank, to avoid Spirit spawns between the tank/melee DPS and the rest of the raid. Try to slow DPS when Blood Mirror is up, and do not attempt, at any time, to use spells that dramatically increase DPS. (&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bestial%20Wrath\"&gt;Bestial Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) You will probably want a healer on the Blood Mirror player and another on the tank. Be aware of the Sanguine Spirits, as they do a lot of damage if you touch them. More spirits come as the fight progresses, so make sure the tank and everyone else keeps moving to stay away from them.\nAlternate location.\nIf your group is having troubles spreading out in the relatively confined hallway that you have to work with, consider mis-directing or kiting to Moroes' room so you have more room to work with, and more room to spread out. If Moroes' room starts getting crowded you could even still move him next door where theres still more room. This of course requires for all the mobs to be cleared between Mirkblood and Moroes, all the mobs in Moroes' room including Moroes himself, and if you plan on moving him again, all the mobs next door."}

He is initially , but turns upon the death of &lt;a href=\"Immol%27thar\"&gt;Immol'thar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"After the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, Prince Tortheldrin maintained control over the surviving &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; by imprisoning a demon in the ruins of Eldre'Thalas and letting his subjects siphon its strength. The exposure to demonic power twisted Tortheldrin's mind, and when the creature faltered, the prince ordered the deaths of many of his vassals so only he and his most fanatical followers would be left to enjoy the corrupt energy.\"\nBackground.\nPrince Tortheldrin was a loyal servant to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; and the leader of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; city &lt;a href=\"Eldre%27Thalas\"&gt;Eldre'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; known today as &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; many &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; slipped into lethargy. So it came to pass that Prince Tortheldrin ordered the building of pylons. These pylons should create a force field that could imprison the mighty &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Immol%27thar\"&gt;Immol'thar&lt;/a&gt;. To feed their hunger for magic the Shen'dralar learned quickly the skill of siphoning the demonic energies of Immol'thar. The energies were used to grant immortality to these Highborne elves. This happened around the time of the exile of Highborne led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, 7,300 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;.\n1,200 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the powers that imprisoned Immol'thar and controlled the pylons began to wane. So Prince Tortheldrin decided to kill some Highborne to maintain his source of unlimited power. At some point, he also killed &lt;a href=\"Illyanna%20Ravenoak\"&gt;Illyanna Ravenoak&lt;/a&gt;, her pet bear &lt;a href=\"Ferra\"&gt;Ferra&lt;/a&gt;, and the elf &lt;a href=\"Telmius%20Dreamseeker\"&gt;Telmius Dreamseeker&lt;/a&gt;. He used his demonic power to bind Illyanna's spirit to her body.\nThe only way of killing the prince is to destroy the guardians surrounding the pylons to lower the force field. When this is done, destroy Immol'thar. With the Prince's power greatly reduced, you may attack and end him.\nIn Year 25, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raided Dire Maul and banished its source of corruption, Immol'thar, back into the Twisting Nether. The prince personally rallied his followers and attacked the Horde, only to be killed by them.\nTwo years later, &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; now leads the Highborne Shen'dralar who have recently rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and started to train them as &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nQuotes.\n\"For 10,000 years I have ruled this kingdom. In that time, I have heard many fascinating tales from those that would walk the hallowed grounds of the House of Shen'dralar.\"\n\"As I am bound to this place, I often exchange stories with visitors. Do you have a story for me or perhaps you would like to hear a story?\"\nAh, yes. I had heard of Nefarian's demise, but it is indeed a treat to see his grisly end firsthand. Were I not stuck in these halls I might pay his lair a visit.\nPerhaps one day.\nAs for my end of our agreement, the tale of the Ashbringer is one of my favorites, of course.\n&lt;The Prince glances at your weapon and smiles.&gt;\nBut it would seem you are familiar with that particular tale.\nA &lt;a href=\"Timolain%20the%20Accursed\"&gt;human mage&lt;/a&gt; gave me a copy of that book many years ago. He kept trying to convince me to help him, going on about something to do with fighting fire with fire.\nI cannot leave this place, as you know, so that was the last I saw of the strange fellow. He went off to reunite with his allies, I presume.\nYou are not the first to inquire about this book, however, I wonder...\nShe was a dwarf If I am not mistaken - and I am not often mistaken.\nShe came here with a copy of that very book, just as you have today, but had no proof of the black drake's death, and so my lips remained sealed. She was quite eager to learn about the Ashbringer's whereabouts.\nPerhaps if you found her, she might be able to enlighten you further.\nHe was a Tauren If I am not mistaken - and I am not often mistaken.\nHe came here with a copy of that very book, just as you have today, but had no proof of the black drake's death, and so my lips remained sealed.

She's tougher than the local boars that roam the forest, but not by a significant amount. She will not be hostile unless you attack her, or you happen to be one of &lt;a href=\"Ma%20Stonefield\"&gt;Ma Stonefield&lt;/a&gt;'s veggies. She has a slightly smaller boar \"guard\" (&lt;a href=\"Porcine%20Entourage\"&gt;Porcine Entourage&lt;/a&gt;) which follows her around the farmyard and help her in combat.\nThe Legend.\nIn the dark depths of Elwynn Forest dwells a monstrous porcine beast that devours everything in her path. Known as Princess by the Brackwells, the family whom she rules with an iron fist \u2014 er, hoof \u2014 and has cowed into giving her free room and board (as well as lots and lots of food), she often leaves her home to terrorize the Eastern Kingdoms by gobbling up all the vegetables on other farms, which has nearly induced a continent-wide famine. Perhaps someday an intrepid hero will put a stop to her endless rampage, but until that time the people of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; will have to ration their crops carefully...or just eat cake.\nA local farmer's wife, clearly traumatized by Princess' attacks and having blocked the more grisly details from her memory, understated the situation thusly:\n\"The Brackwells have a prize-winning pig, Princess. The sow is HUGE, and she got that way from sneaking over here and eating my veggies! So before she comes to our fields...Princess must die! Bring me her collar as proof of the deed and I'll give you something for your time!\"\nThe mercenary to whom she made this request wisely fled screaming into &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; and has not been seen since. Meanwhile, Princess' stranglehold on Elwynn continues unabated.\nOne recurring subject of drunken debate at the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Pride%20Inn\"&gt;Lion's Pride Inn&lt;/a&gt; is who would win in a fight between Princess and the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Scholars agree that the outcome is impossible to predict, but have come to a consensus on one fact: the forces unleashed during a battle between two such awesomely powerful beings would undoubtedly destroy the known universe!"}

Influenced by the Old Gods, the princess transformed her home into a den of corruption and suffering. Some believe that her foul powers are tied to the spirit of her dead lover, &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;. If so, liberating the fallen keeper of the grove might be the only hope of cleansing Maraudon.\"\nStrategy.\nIt is definitely better to have two &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s for Princess Theradras herself. She fears and has a knockback which throws whoever has &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; roughly 20-30 yards. Also, she occasionally slams the ground which send out waves dealing about 150 damage (for each wave) and knocking everyone down for several seconds, so you must keep her away from casters or their spells will be &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ed during this &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; knockback. If you have a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, put &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt;s on your tanks. When she throws back one tank, everyone else stops what they are doing until the second tank establishes aggro. &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;s will not cut it as off-tanks, she hits too hard, and your healer will have to spam heals. If you do only have one available tank, a common strategy is to have them back up into the water towards the walls. When she knocks the MT back, they should be positioned to rebound off the wall and come right back to her.\nWith the recent changes to PvE fear mechanics (in that mobs no longer de-aggro feared targets) this fight can now easily be done with one tank. When she fears, she will stay on the tank, provided no one else pulls aggro whilst they are feared (ie. they resist and continue attacking). The fight favours ranged classes, but is essentially a tank and spank. Anyone that does not need to be in melee should be at max range.\nLoot.\nPrincess Theradras was the first of the instance progression final bosses to have a chance of dropping a non-world drop epic item.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, The &lt;a href=\"Deadman%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Deadman's Hand&lt;/a&gt; is now the first epic drop that is not a World Drop."}

{"id": "20795", "revid": "34880437", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=20795", "title": "Black Temple", "text": "The Black Temple is the fortress-citadel of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of Outland. It was once known as the Temple of Karabor, and has changed hands many times over multiple generations. The entrance to the Black Temple does not appear to be its main gates, but rather an instance portal set in a breach in the southern battlement, below the &lt;a href=\"ruins%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;ruins of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. It no longer has a required attunement.\nBackground.\nBefore the shattering of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Temple was once called the Temple of Karabor, a sacred site to the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; which served as the refuge of the Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; started its &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt;, they eventually discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was manipulating the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The draenei leaders knew they could no longer defend their holdings and ordered their forces to withdraw to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and Karabor. On its side, the Horde decided to conquer the Temple in order to shatter the draenei as a people, destroy everything that meant anything to them. During the ensuing battle against &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s assault, the draenei were helped by &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt;, and against all odds the outnumbered defenders were able to push the relentless orcs back.\nIn response Gul'dan and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; decided to ignore the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;'s warnings about the Dark Star, an ancient god of the Void that was actually the fallen &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt;. They conducted a ritual to call on the Dark Star in their war against the draenei and channeled it at Karabor. A pillar of &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energy ripped through the heavens and slammed down on Karabor, driving many draenei defenders to madness while many others died instantly. Velen called on his powers to keep the Void at bay and rally the survivors to Karabor's harbor, but the Dark Star had forever darkened Karabor, and it became known as the Black Temple and was taken by the orcs. After their defeat, the captured draenei &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of Karabor were marched out, told that they were to be taken to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; as prisoners of war. The warlock &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; murdered each and every last one of them in cold blood outside of the walls. While Hellfire Citadel was &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;'s capital, Karabor became the clandestine Shadow Council's seat of ruling.\nIt was at Karabor that &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; was first summoned to Draenor, and it was in the Temple's central courtyard's pool that the &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; shed its &lt;a href=\"Felblood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;unholy communion&lt;/a&gt; that would later happen at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the orc &lt;a href=\"J%27argg%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;J'argg Bloodfyre&lt;/a&gt; came here and obtained some of Mannoroth's blood.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, it was used as a &lt;a href=\"Fortress%20Shadowmoon\"&gt;fortress&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and his Shadowmoon clan forces. After the planet's destruction and its transformation into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Temple was taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. It was used as a prime staging ground for the Burning Legion's campaign on Draenor.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Illidan the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; fled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he ousted the Temple's ruler\u2014the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and claimed his throne as the lord of the blasted world. Following his defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan returned to the Black Temple. According to &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan was consumed by his defeat; he replayed the events in his mind repeatedly, envisioning himself as the victor instead. Illidan also lived in fear that he would be discovered by his enemies, such as Arthas or the lords of the Burning Legion. After the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; reopened, Illidan began to tighten his grip on Outland from within the profaned sanctum, where he awaited any and all who would challenge his rule.\nThe Black Temple was besieged once by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Auralion\"&gt;High General Auralion&lt;/a&gt;, but these draenei were destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Val%27zareq%20the%20Conqueror\"&gt;Val'zareq the Conqueror&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Sigil\"&gt;Crimson Sigil&lt;/a&gt; and their leader captured. Some times later, the Burning Legion unleashed the &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Doomwalker\"&gt;Doomwalker&lt;/a&gt; on the Temple.\nLater, another army combining the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; attacked again, this time helped by the Illidari rebel &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, former prisoner of the Betrayer.\n&lt;a href=\"Kanrethad%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Kanrethad Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the Black Temple, evading the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue Deathsworn&lt;/a&gt; under Akama who had reclaimed the temple after Illidan's death. Entering the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt;, Kanrethad recognized it as the power source that allowed Illidan to control demons without their being corrupted by the fel energies endemic to the Legion, and theorized that it had been originally intended as the power source to replace the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; aligned with him. Since Illidan's death, it grew in strength and power, waiting to be harnessed. The two warlocks prepared a &lt;a href=\"Empowered%20Soulcore\"&gt;crystal&lt;/a&gt; to absorb the arcane magics within the Shrine, leaving it to do its work when they heard Ashtongue patrols hunting them.\nLater &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who studied warlock magics soon came on their trail. Reclaiming the now-empowered crystal and taking it to the summit, the warlock witnessed the opening of a massive gateway, and from it stepped Kanrethad in a monstrous &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;demonic form&lt;/a&gt;, utterly corrupted by absorbing too much fel energy. Though Kanrethad's powers were formidable, the warlock persevered long enough for Jubeka to arrive and fulfill Kanrethad's earlier request to banish him.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Infiltrating%20the%20Black%20Temple\"&gt;the break-in&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; had his &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;i &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s erect a holy barrier to protect the temple from &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. The &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to secure Akama and his knowledge about the Legion, sent Illidari-loyal &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; to infiltrate it and gain any valuable information. &lt;a href=\"Matron%20Mother%20Malevolence\"&gt;Matron Mother Malevolence&lt;/a&gt; bypassed the holy barrier using the &lt;a href=\"%3AGrimoire%20of%20Arcane%20Ways\"&gt;:Grimoire of Arcane Ways&lt;/a&gt;, and the Illidari invaded the temple.\nGeography.\nThe 4 bosses after &lt;a href=\"Supremus\"&gt;Supremus&lt;/a&gt; can be fought a non-linear order, but all must be defeated in order to unlock &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt; and continue to the end.\nAttunement.\nThough the attunement is no longer required to gain entrance to the Temple, you can still complete it. Below is a short guide on how to.\nFirst you have to complete &lt;a href=\"Akama%27s%20Promise\"&gt;Akama's Promise&lt;/a&gt;. Then players adventuring in the Serpentshrine Cavern will have access to a quest from a Broken NPC named &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Olum\"&gt;Seer Olum&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Fathom-Lord%20Karathress\"&gt;Fathom-Lord Karathress&lt;/a&gt;'s room (the quest is entitled &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20Compromised\"&gt;The Secret Compromised&lt;/a&gt;). After delivering a message to Akama, he informs Illidan of Kael'thas' treachery in order to attempt to prove his loyalty (Illidan believes him, but is still suspicious). You will then need to slay &lt;a href=\"Al%27ar\"&gt;Al'ar&lt;/a&gt; in the Eye of Tempest Keep so that Akama can convince Illidan he is still loyal.\nThe next part of the attunement involves killing &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt;, a lich boss, which is also the first boss in the Battle of Mount Hyjal instance. After this you are sent to Xi'ri outside the gates of Black Temple. You must slay the demonic Illidari forces outside the Temple in order to provide a distraction for Akama and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; to slip into the Temple undetected. After that Xi'ri rewards you with the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Medallion of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoot.\nThe Black Temple is a level 70 raid instance in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, containing &lt;a href=\"tier%206\"&gt;tier 6&lt;/a&gt; drops and . \nOfficial preview.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/\"&gt;The Black Temple in Under Development&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe Black Temple.\nOriginally founded as a &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; temple, this plot has been conquered and despoiled many times throughout the history of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, removing any spiritual grace it may have once held. The Black Temple has been the stage of the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s blood curse, fortress for the then-mortal &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, and a prime staging ground for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign of destruction... Most recently, it has been claimed as home by Illidan, where he and his minions make their bid for power over the remnants of the shattered planet. Now, it is up to you to face the malefic forces of Illidan and his minions in hopes of freeing Outland from chaos and tyranny.\nBlack Temple is a 25-person raid dungeon located in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/2p1/\"&gt;Black Temple Preview in Under Development&lt;/a&gt;:\nLong ago on Draenor, the Temple of Karabor was the center of draenei worship. But the devout priests who prayed there are long dead, slaughtered by marauding, demoniacally corrupted orcs. In the massacre's aftermath the warlocks of the Shadow Council seized the structure and bestowed upon it a new name: the Black Temple.\nFor years the Shadow Council bloodied the Black Temple with foul demonic rituals, but after the Second War the dark spellcasters fell to the Alliance's devastating invasion of Draenor. The shaman Ner'zhul hastily opened several dimensional portals in order to stage a retreat, and the resulting magical backlash ripped the world apart. In what had become the fractured realm of Outland, Ner'zhul's portals were a strategic advantage that appealed to the demon general &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, who quickly seized the Black Temple as his seat of power.\nMagtheridon commanded many of the orcs remaining in Outland and bolstered his army with Legion forces streaming in through the portals. The pit lord's might remained unchallenged until &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Illidan the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; decided to claim the Black Temple for himself. Illidan and Magtheridon fought a desperate battle on the temple walls, but in the end the pit lord proved no match for the wielder of the Twin Blades of Azzinoth. Illidan battered Magtheridon to the point of death, but the thrill of victory was short-lived...\nThe skies of Outland darkened as &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; himself appeared before Illidan, furious at Illidan's failure to destroy the Lich King. The Betrayer was forced back to Azeroth for a disastrous attack on Icecrown Glacier. Bloodied by the death knight Arthas but not fully beaten, Illidan returned to Outland and established his throne within the Black Temple. And yet, despite Illidan's efforts to seal Ner'zhul's portals, Kil'jaeden's wrath will not be denied. Even now the merciless Doomwalker batters at the temple gates.\nIn the RPG.\nIllidan the Betrayer stands as the lord of Outland and rules his domain from a massive, black iron ziggurat. Ner'zhul was originally responsible for this hulking edifice, but now blood elves, naga and Illidan's few other allies roam its corridors. The naga live in underground sewers, and the upper levels teem with blood elves, traps, evil, and death. Rumors tell that beneath the citadel sprawls a great prison; trapped within are heroes from previous wars, languishing in unknown solitude.\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that Karabor was named after &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru that was ejected from the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\" in the chaos of its crash and came to be known as the Dark Star to the orcs of &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It later came to be led by his sons, &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;. The clan is named after its custom of each member knocking out one of their own teeth to symbolize their loyalty to the clan.\nHistory.\nThe Black Tooth Grin clan was founded by Blackhand shortly after he was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, 5 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, and consisted of soldiers handpicked by the warchief himself. Right after the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, scouts from the Black Tooth Grin and &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; clans were sent by Blackhand to survey the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of the portal. After Blackhand was deposed and killed by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, his sons &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; continued leading the Black Tooth Grin. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, their clan was charged with the protection and preservation of the Dark Portal, and so they left part of their forces behind in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; before marching north.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; abandoned the Horde by sailing to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans, Orgrim sent the Black Tooth Grin to hunt down the traitors, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; agents. Gul'dan's followers took control over a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20navy\"&gt;Horde fleet&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and sailed west, but the Black Tooth Grin were close behind and boarded the rest of the orcish vessels to follow in his wake. Not long after Gul'dan raised the Tomb of Sargeras from the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Tooth Grin approached the island. Gul'dan ordered &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the Twilight's Hammer to hold off the pursuers while he and the Stormreavers entered the tomb. Inside the tomb, Gul'dan was torn apart by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, but his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; was retrieved by the few Stormreavers who survived. Outside, Dal'rend and Maim's forces cut down many of the Twilight's Hammer and grievously wounded Cho'gall, forcing the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; and his few surviving followers to flee west into &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;uncharted waters&lt;/a&gt;. With vengeance served, the Black Tooth Grin orcs boarded their ships and sailed back east. As proof of their victory, they retrieved Gul'dan's skull from one of his followers.\nMeanwhile, the Horde forces in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; continued being pushed south into &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"dragon%20rider\"&gt;dragon rider&lt;/a&gt;s dispatched by &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; found the Black Tooth Grin's vessels and delivered word of the Horde's retreat to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Rend and Maim ordered the Black Tooth Grin to alter course and sail to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. That region was still under Horde control, and from there they could reach Blackrock Spire by land. However, near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde fleet was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s Alliance navy. Though the Horde had dragons, the Alliance fleet was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s. Rend and Maim's ship and a few other vessels survived intact, but most of the Horde fleet was sunk by Proudmoore's superior forces and the dragon riders scattered in all directions.\nWhen the surviving members of the Black Tooth Grin finally arrived at Blackrock Spire, the Horde had already been defeated. The clan gathered with other Horde survivors, mainly from the Blackrock clan, and waited until the Alliance pulled its forces out of the region. When the way was clear, the orcs snuck back into Blackrock Spire and took control of the stronghold. Dal'rend and Maim despised Orgrim for having killed their father and blamed him for the Horde's defeat. The brothers now planned to reforge the Horde as they saw fit and gradually reached out to other large groups of survivors. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and the Bleeding Hollow ignored them, but the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; pledged their support and offered to give some of their enslaved dragons to the forces at Blackrock if they were ever needed. In the aftermath of the Second War, many members of the Black Tooth Grin were captured by the Alliance put into &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe identity of the Black Tooth Grin appears to have since become synonymous with that of the Blackrock clan and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft II.\nChieftain: \"Rend and Maim, the sons of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;\"\nClan Colors: \"Black\"\nBackground: \"The Black Tooth Grin clan was originally part of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;, but splintered off before the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s passing into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. After their father was deposed from his position as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;War Chief&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, Rend and Maim decided to gain control over their own faction within the Horde without directly opposing the Doomhammer's ascension to power. The Black Tooth Grin, noted for its custom of each member knocking out one of his own teeth to symbolize his loyalty to the clan, is charged with the protection and preservation of the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Portal&lt;/a&gt;. The unity of The Black Tooth Grin may be sorely tested should the opportunity arise for Rend and Maim to reclaim their father's station and avenge his death.\"\nDomain: The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nAs their mission was to defend the Dark Portal, most of the Black Tooth Grin were slaughtered by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; survived the battle over the Dark Portal. They took control of the survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; and the Black Tooth Grin clans, and used them to form the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, establishing their base at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; made war against the Dark Horde for control of Blackrock Spire. Maim was killed in battle, and Rend made an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; so that he could drive back the dwarves. Rend now leads the various clans of the Dark Horde as their &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;."}

A single &lt;a href=\"Lotharian%20Lotus\"&gt;Lotharian Lotus&lt;/a&gt; grows at the base of the statue.\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that Lothar's statue has been left untouched by the Blackrock as it would not be worth the time or resources to destroy, and quite possibly it would only bring down the ire of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; upon them. It is also possible they left the statue untouched out of respect for the skills of the former Supreme Commander."}

{"id": "22632", "revid": "40350614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22632", "title": "Black dragon", "text": "Black dragons are &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s with black scales who were given powers over the earth. Most black dragons can breathe magma, though some instead breathe fire or sometimes hot ash. Some powerful, corrupt black dragons can breathe &lt;a href=\"shadowflame\"&gt;shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;. Led by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; Neltharion, later known as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragons were charged by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s with protecting the earth. The ambitious Neltharion was chosen by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s to be their ultimate tool of destruction and their corruption eventually spread to the entire dragonflight. Following the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragons and their minions became one of the most prominent reoccurring threats to the mortal races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlack dragons have gone through many iterations of service to the Old Gods, with their race having believed to have been wholly corrupted away from their once noble purpose. In spite of this, several black dragons remained loyal to the original cause of their kindred. Among them, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, a black whelp purified of the Old Gods' corruption, saw to the death of nearly every other black dragon, including his father, and claimed his wishes to protect Azeroth. On the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the uncorrupted dragon &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; has long lived among the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; under the guise of an eccentric &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt; named \"Ebonhorn\". Meanwhile, in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the former Prime lieutenant of Deathwing, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, shepherded the growth of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt;; a clutch of black dragons that have been somehow purified from their Old God corruption by Sabellian's efforts.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered, the Obsidian Brood returned to Azeroth and helped the &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt; to regain control of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;. After their victory, Wrathion and Sabellian competed to determine who should be the new Aspect of the black dragonflight. However, after they discovered &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt; and the reality of Neltharion's dark legacy, it was Ebyssian who was chosen by his brothers as the new leader of their dragonflight.\nLife cycle and appearance.\nBlack dragons, as with all other dragons, go through various life stages before they are fully grown. These stages are divided into &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;drakes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;. Whelps are the children of their kind, while drakes are adolescents and young adults. The oldest of their kind become dragons, though they appear to still grow in some capacity as far older dragons are usually larger than their younger kindred. Traditional dragons look largely the same, akin to an immense lizard with four legs and wings sprouting along their spine. In their youthful stages, whelps seem to exclusively travel by way of flight, with older dragons flying or walking depending on their whims.\nAdult black dragons usage of magma appears to also affect some of them. While this may be a symptom of Old God corruption, as it was for their aspect, Deathwing, a number of adult black dragons show signs of glowing magma within; such as &lt;a href=\"Atramedes\"&gt;Atramedes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral of these dragons also take unorthodox forms to those traditionally found; such as the &lt;a href=\"wylderdrake\"&gt;wylderdrake&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"velocidrake\"&gt;velocidrake&lt;/a&gt;. As these are specified as drakes, it is unknown what their 'dragon' forms or whelp forms would look like; though they are presumably just smaller and larger variations of these appearances. With the advent of &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s being discovered; some &lt;a href=\"slitherdrake\"&gt;slitherdrake&lt;/a&gt;s have also been found baring black scales.\nBlack dragonkin are sometimes referred to as obsidian or onyx. The scales of the black dragonflight almost always retain their heat.\nHistory.\nCharge of the Dragonflights.\nSatisfied that the small world had been ordered and that their work was done, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s prepared to leave Azeroth. But before they departed, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Yet there were five flights that held dominion over their brethren. It was these five flights that the Titans chose to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Titan shaper and forger of the world, bestowed some of his vast power upon the mighty black wyrm, Neltharion. The great-hearted Neltharion, known afterwards as the Earth-Warder, was given dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world. He embodied the strength of the world and served as &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest supporter.\nIn truth, in Azeroth's ancient past, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of his kind. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion faced Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;. After killing Galakrond, Neltharion and the others were approached by the other Keepers, and Tyr suggested empowering the proto-dragons to make them defenders of Azeroth, as they proved they were able to stand for the planet. Only &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; disagreed, and forbid the other Keepers to proceed with that idea, but they decided to go against him. They reached out to the Pantheon and each of the titans blessed the proto-dragons with a portion of their vast power, channeled through the Keepers. They became majestic beings called &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and among them, Neltharion became the Aspect of Earth while his black dragonflight was charged with the task of watching over Azeroth, lest any force should threaten its perfect tranquility. One of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that the titans created them from Galakrond, to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nAncient times.\nTwenty thousand years ago, concerned at the rift between the Dragon Aspects and &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion knew a war was coming. The &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; were slow, and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; fragile, but Neltharion saw potential in the mortal races that had begun to emerge across the world. He created the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; as \"ideal soldiers,\" combing the essence of dragons with the traits of mortal races, and used a gauntlet artifact of &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt; magic to keep them under his control. However, &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Primalist\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; rebellion, attacked Neltharion and his dracthyr army at the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; and during the fighting destroyed the relic. Seeing no other way to stop the Primalists, this was the moment that Neltharion gave in to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s that had long haunted him, and used their power to seal Raszageth away. Without the titan relic, Neltharion deemed the dracthyr a risk. He contacted Malygos, explained everything that had happened and that the dracthyr needed to be contained. The Aspect of Magic accepted and put them into stasis with his magic.\nGradually, Neltharion silently chafed at what he felt was a burden that had been inflicted on him; though he could command the entire weight of Azeroth itself, that same weight constantly pressed on his body every waking moment, the load making him feel suffocated to the point that he felt his very spirit unraveling. Neltharion believed that he must bear this burden alone, but ultimately found it to be too much, and began to resent the charge placed upon him. The belief that the titans viewed Azeroth as an experiment only fueled his bitterness. Then came the madness that destroyed Neltharion's mind, changing him and his kind forever. The whispering convinced him that he could have power beyond his imagination, and the voices made Neltharion even paranoid of his own flight, as he began to yearn for a world dominated by the black dragonflight; a world in which the other dragonflights ceased to exist. The Old Gods later convinced Neltharion to create the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this time, the other flights didn't realize that the black dragonflight fell to the whisperings of the Old Gods. The other Aspects attributed Neltharion's oddness to his displeasure with the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the Highborne opened a portal for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth, marking the start of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Black Aspect suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. The other Aspects had nothing but the utmost respect for wise Neltharion, and they gave much of their own essence toward the creation of this object, called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion and his flight, however, had secretly refrained from imparting any of their own power.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The blacks joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion retreated, leaving the blue dragonflight broken in his wake.\nOne particular brood of Ysera's was closely allied with the night elves of the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, who were ruled by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera kindly allowed the night elves to ride her children into battle and they were known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riders%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, Ysera's benevolence raised the ire of Deathwing and he launched an attack against &lt;a href=\"Wyrmscar%20Island\"&gt;Wyrmscar Island&lt;/a&gt; where the dragonriders slept. The blacks, including &lt;a href=\"Razormaw\"&gt;Razormaw&lt;/a&gt;, a lieutenant of Deathwing, mercilessly slaughtered the Kaldorei. The greens rose up to protect their allies but were unsuccessful. Not one was spared, though many blacks, including Razormaw, also perished in the battle. The skeletons and spirits of the murdered greens still litter the small island. Razormaw's hatred for the greens was so great that his restless spirit remained soaring high overhead, forever haunting the island.\nThe black dragonflight's actions left their former allies wounded and shocked, and the noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion, but Azeroth was sundered.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing\u2019s betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, most of all the blacks. Some dragons call this time period the Dragon Wars, though others including mortals may know it by other names. Even though it was everyone against the black flight, easily outnumbering them, it was incredibly emotionally hard for the dragons because they had to fight their friends and loved ones, people they had known and grown up with. The black dragonflight was hunted down and nearly annihilated, all but slain because of Deathwing's mad plots. Deathwing's remaining consorts were slain, by his own recklessness, in the first few days of the war, leaving him with limited options to repopulate his flight. They would never again be seen in the same numbers as before. The age of dragons had passed.\nTo ensure Deathwing would never hold power over dragonkind again, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon the Demon Soul, so that no dragon, including Deathwing, could wield it, and hid the foul disc deep beneath the earth. While Deathwing settled into a deep slumber, as he needed time to recover from his wounds and to regain his strength, the other dragonflights would hunt his corrupted black dragonflight to the brink of extinction.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; to purify one of Deathwing's eggs, which hatched into an uncorrupted black whelp named &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproximately five hundred years prior to the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, former prime consort of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to bring down the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; with a curse that left all the wizards in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; unable to use their magic. Her scheme was foiled in part by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, consort to &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and when Sintharia was defeated, most believed her to be dead when her own magic had been turned on her.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; Deathwing saw his opportunity to decimate Alexstrasza and her flight. Deathwing was unable to wield the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; himself, but it could be placed in the hands of a being that would use it against his enemies. Deathwing sent visions of the artifact to the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; the Whacked, who claimed the disc for the Horde. The device was given to his lieutenant, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, whose magic the disk eagerly reciprocated, and was used to enslave Alexstrasza and most of her flight, turning them into the Horde's hounds of war.\nBeyond The Dark Portal.\nDuring the orc's second intrusion into Azeroth, the black dragonflight briefly joined the Horde. Seeking magical artifacts, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; had sent a party under &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; to bring the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; back into the fold and acquire their red dragons. &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; refused and Teron left defeated, but they were soon approached by Deathwing. Deathwing presented the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; with an offer. He and his children would lend their aid to the Horde, in return for safe passage of his flight and eggs to Draenor. Gorefiend accepted and the black aspect summoned his flight to him. Before departing Deathwing spoke with &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to remain on Azeroth and take command of the orcs left within the spire. The remaining members of the black dragonflight, led by Deathwing and his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, allowed the orcs to ride upon them in order to retrieve the needed artifacts.\nOnce in possession of the artifacts, Ner'zhul pulled the Horde back to Draenor. The black dragons, taking special care of the eggs, crossed through the Dark Portal. Deathwing spoke with Ner'zhul, bidding his farewell and taking the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. A few dragons stayed with the Horde at &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, but the bulk of the flight settled within the valleys of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, where they could tend to the delicate eggs. Their presence there was not welcome by &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, father of the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and ruler of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Gruul and his subjects, assisted by members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; sent to recover the skull, attacked drake and egg alike. Deathwing was outraged by the destruction of his precious eggs and fought back, only to be driven off by a strategic spell from &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. Sabellian managed to escape as well. The remaining black dragons, now leaderless, quickly fell to the fury of Gruul's children and were crushed and impaled upon the spires of Frostfire Ridge.\nNot long after, Ner'zhul's portals began to tear Draenor apart, and soon the planet was going through its death throes. Deathwing quickly escaped back to Azeroth, abandoning his remaining progeny on the doomed world. Then the cataclysm came and Draenor was shattered, only what would become known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; remained. Many of the black dragon eggs were exposed to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the dragons that emerged were no longer truly members of the black flight. These ethereal dragons would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;netherwing dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nThe blacks were nearly extinct and their master, Deathwing, was believed to have been brought down during an organized strike by the most powerful members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, his body falling into the sea. But this was nothing more than a ruse.\nSecretly he had assumed the guise of Lord &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; and sought a way to rebuild his flight. He devised a plan to steal the eggs of his greatest foe, Alexstrasza, slave of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt;. Not wanting to possibly damage the eggs by directly assaulting Grim Batol, he sought a way to bring the eggs out into the open. He fooled Nekros into believing the Alliance planned an invasion, and the warlock ordered to have Alexstrasza and her eggs moved to Dun Algaz where he believed the bulk of the Dragonmaw Clan was stationed. When Deathwing appeared Nekros sent &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; to face him, but the old red did not last long against the dark aspect. Deathwing began stealing Alexstrasza's eggs only to be stalled by the sudden arrival of the other Aspects, who proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;the Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aspects gave chase and Deathwing was gravely wounded but not killed. The Black Aspect went into hiding in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of earth inside the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20plane\"&gt;elemental plane&lt;/a&gt;, and no creature, not even members of his flight knew his location. The black dragonflight went into a state of civil war following Deathwing's disappearance, fighting over who would rule the flight.\nThird War.\nLike the other dragonflights, the black dragonflight did not play any significant role in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, then prince of Lordaeron, did however assist a group of &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; dragon hunters track down and slay the black drake &lt;a href=\"Searinox\"&gt;Searinox&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; also encountered a small group of black whelps and drakes hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt;, and was quick to dispatch the vile spawn of Deathwing.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLong ago, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; drove the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres from their &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Ruins\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmurk\"&gt;Dragonmurk&lt;/a&gt;, a dismal swamp located within &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. She did so in order to procure a place to raise her numerous children, who would then leave to infest the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmbog\"&gt;Wyrmbog&lt;/a&gt;. She and her children became known for terrorizing any travelers who strayed too close to her home. After &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s departure, Onyxia and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; rose to lead their brethren and recouped their failing numbers. Together, with the orchestrations of their human personas, they worked toward replenishing the black dragonflight.\nUnder the guise of &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Nefarius\"&gt;Victor Nefarius&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian claimed &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as his aerie, subverted the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; and ensnared the black dragons not already under his control. Black dragonkin under his command were sent in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and as far south as the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Nefarian has been experimenting with the blood of all of the various dragonflights to create a &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; of unstoppable warriors, and his soldiers kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; of other flights, such as the &lt;a href=\"blue%20whelp\"&gt;blue whelp&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt;, to be used in their experiments. In this task he has succeeded his father, and aided by his sister, he planned to use them to rally the black dragonflight to his command.\nWhile Nefarian remained at Blackrock Spire to create twisted abominations that would carry out his will, Onyxia preferred subtle manipulation to further their goals. For several years, Onyxia masqueraded as one of the highest nobles in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, preventing the people there from sending much-needed aid to the areas near the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, where her brother has great power and influence. Her final goal was to become the ruler of Stormwind, through manipulation and evil schemes. Her plot was foiled by Marshal &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and she was unmasked in the halls of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Having fled to her &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;, the recently returned &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; led an army to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to slay Onyxia. After the battle, the king decapitated Onyxia and sent her head to be hung from the ramparts of Stormwind while &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; summoned roots from the ground to seal her lair's entrance and to kill her unhatched progeny.\nMeanwhile, Horde champions fought against Nefarian's twisted creations in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, before confronting Nefarian in his lair, ultimately defeating him. The champions then took &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Nefarian\"&gt;his head&lt;/a&gt; as proof of their victory and returned to Orgrimmar.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe black dragons that accompanied Deathwing to Draenor remained behind when the planet was torn apart, and could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; where they continued their battles against the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; that have waged since the Second War. Many of the black dragons there met their end at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt; and his sons, and could be seen impaled on the rocky spires at &lt;a href=\"Dragons%27%20End\"&gt;Dragons' End&lt;/a&gt;. Under Sabellian, the black dragons of Outland, the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt;, were free of the Old Gods' corruption. During the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Sabellian schemed to confront the gronn who have hunted his kind for years. At the same time, his servant &lt;a href=\"Samia%20Inkling\"&gt;Samia Inkling&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to capture whelps from the &lt;a href=\"wyrmcult\"&gt;wyrmcult&lt;/a&gt;, a group of mortals who worship the black dragons, and to deliver them to Sabellian.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing's consort &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; visited the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to seek the eggs of their &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, which were mutated black dragons, to further Deathwing's experiments in creating the ultimate dragonflight. In exchange, she pledged the black flight to serve as the Dragonmaw's mounts.\nIn the years following &lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Sabellian and his black dragons bent the Blade's Edge Mountains to their will.\nSecond Battle of Grim Batol.\nThe cursed fortress had not seen the last of the black dragonflight. More than a decade after Deathwing's defeat, his prime consort &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, now called Sinestra, took the mountain for herself, driving off the remnants of the red dragonflight. Sinestra, assisted by the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and a large brood of black dragonkin led by the drakonid &lt;a href=\"Rask\"&gt;Rask&lt;/a&gt;, set up a lair to continue the experiments started by her son Nefarian to create a new powerful dragonflight. Sinestra planned to use the shards of the Demon Soul in conjuncture with &lt;a href=\"Balacgos%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Balacgos's Bane&lt;/a&gt; to combine the essence of the captured nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; with the stolen eggs of various flights.\nWhen Korialstrasz sensed something deep within the mountain, he returned to Grim Batol and found the black consort in the midst of creating the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, among them, the newest and powerful twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. Korialstrasz and his allies rushed to stop Sinestra while dwarven resistance fighters battled her brood, managing to kill the drakonid &lt;a href=\"Rask\"&gt;Rask&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice, and the anger felt by Dargonax towards his \"mother\", Sinestra and her creation were defeated. The mountain was once again abandoned, unaware to anyone that Deathwing lurked still deeper within.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragon ambassador &lt;a href=\"Nalice\"&gt;Nalice&lt;/a&gt; was present at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance of the dragonflights created to oppose &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s crusade against magic users during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; started to siege the various &lt;a href=\"dragonshrine\"&gt;dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s to raise &lt;a href=\"undead%20dragon\"&gt;undead dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, Nalice sent adventurers to meet &lt;a href=\"Serinar\"&gt;Serinar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, in order to fight off the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuing his consort's experiments, Deathwing entrusted a batch of twilight eggs to the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Sartharion\"&gt;Sartharion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; beneath Wyrmrest Temple, aided by the twilight drakes &lt;a href=\"Shadron\"&gt;Shadron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenebron\"&gt;Tenebron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vesperon\"&gt;Vesperon&lt;/a&gt;. Following the sacking of the Obsidian Sanctum by the adventurers on the orders of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful war party of the black dragonflight, led by the fearsome &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt;, have launched an assault upon the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. By destroying the sanctum, the black dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of their &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;master\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;reemergence&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and to ultimately shatter the Wyrmrest Accord.\nIn the wake of Deathwing's reemergence and his &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, Nalice has mysteriously disappeared from Wyrmrest Temple, and with her, the allegiance of the black dragonflight to the Wyrmrest Accord.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight joined Deathwing in his plan to cause the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; - the liberation of the Old Gods and the end of all life on the planet. Across Azeroth, allied with the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, they caused chaos and confronted the other dragonflights and their mortal allies. After his return, Deathwing began to invade the various regions of Azeroth, raining fire upon the earth and killing any who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in his path.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight continued to work alongside the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, where an army of black dragonspawn led by the drake &lt;a href=\"Minyoth\"&gt;Minyoth&lt;/a&gt; and the drakonid &lt;a href=\"Tugnar%20Goremaw\"&gt;Tugnar Goremaw&lt;/a&gt; settled around &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Rock\"&gt;Dreadmaul Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; veteran &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt; and the reformed Blackrock orc &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt; destroyed them before they could began their invasion. In the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt; took control of the Blackrock orcs in the region, in order to march upon &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, but he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company\"&gt;Bravo Company&lt;/a&gt; before he could achieve his plan. In the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, numerous black whelps led by the drake &lt;a href=\"Pyrricion\"&gt;Pyrricion&lt;/a&gt; fought against the &lt;a href=\"dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs who seek to capture them, they were assisted by dragonspawn.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian and his attempts to create a new breed of dragon were thought defeated following his death. But the Twilight's Hammer reanimated Nefarian with &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magic, and Deathwing ordered his son to continue his experiments, and even to surpass his previous creations in wickedness and power. Dwelling on the lessons learned from his defeat in Blackwing Lair, he has burrowed deeper into the heart of Blackrock Mountain and rebuilt his sanctuary: the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Shadowflame\"&gt;Vault of the Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;. He also succeeded in the reanimation of his sister, Onyxia, but was ultimately slain with her by adventurers of the Alliance and the Horde.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, full-out warfare has erupted in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; between the black dragonflight and the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Black dragonkin roosted at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Forest\"&gt;Obsidian Forest&lt;/a&gt;, constantly under attack by the red flight, and black drakes spread throughout the southern regions of the Highlands. The broodmother &lt;a href=\"Obsidia\"&gt;Obsidia&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last mature and breeding black dragons, has relocated &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Lair\"&gt;her lair&lt;/a&gt; nearby and was targeted by the red dragons. Even the mighty Aspects themselves, Deathwing and Alexstrasza, become engaged in the battle over &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, as the Dragon Queen decided that the black dragonflight could not be saved and should be totally destroyed.\nAt some point, the Twilight's Hammer cultists recovered the broken corpse of Sintharia, pieced it together, and reanimated it with &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magics. Now a ravaged husk of her former self, she continued building an entire flight of twilight dragons, and oversaw the creation of new twilight clutches. Under the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, she gave birth to a clutch of black dragon eggs that were to be turned into twilight dragon eggs, performing the duties once held by Alexstrasza in Grim Batol, as her fate was ultimately to be an egg factory for Deathwing and the Twilight Cult. With the help of the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, who sacrificed himself during the battle, the adventurers were giving enough strength to finally vanquish Sinestra.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing's upheaval has caused volcanic activity at what was once the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where the broodmother &lt;a href=\"Seldarria\"&gt;Seldarria&lt;/a&gt; and her clutch of black eggs were targeted by the Alliance forces at &lt;a href=\"Farwatcher%27s%20Glen\"&gt;Farwatcher's Glen&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to route out the last remaining blues, black drakes led by the drake &lt;a href=\"Malicion\"&gt;Malicion&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Sable%20Ridge\"&gt;Sable Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in search of the elusive &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, however, they were eliminated by Horde adventurers sent by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. In his crusade to wipe out all life on Azeroth, Deathwing sought to activate the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, which required a powerful artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Coffer%20of%20Promise\"&gt;Coffer of Promise&lt;/a&gt;. He has enlisted &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Schnottz\"&gt;Commander Schnottz&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition to find the coffer and sent black dragon emissaries, including &lt;a href=\"Myzerian\"&gt;Myzerian&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure the artifact became his. To prevent such a disaster, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and a band of adventurers disabled it so that Deathwing's servants could not use it.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, after the defeat of Ragnaros, Deathwing and his black and twilight dragons, aided by his Old God benefactors, laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and the world shaman &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; agreed upon a course of action and fought to bring the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to bear against the Destroyer and bring about his final end. The flight was ultimately destroyed by heroes of the Alliance and Horde, through the aid of the four other dragonflights, and even with the aid of one of their own: the uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, a simple but very powerful whelp due to the experimentation on his egg by the red dragonflight. He has been orchestrating the assassinations of his remaining dragonkin siblings and even ordered the death of his own father, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. After Deathwing's fall, he went into hiding, believing to be the last known black dragon to exist.\nHowever, Wrathion was not the last of the black dragons alive on Azeroth. Some time before the destruction of Theramore, Jaina commented that some black dragons still existed in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. In Outland, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and his group of dragons continued to live there, and the Black prince was unaware of them.\nAt some point after the Cataclysm, black drakes and whelps were present in the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, they surrounded &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and his friends. One of the drakes took hold of &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; until it was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Llaran\"&gt;Llaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iyneath\"&gt;Iyneath&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, remnants of the flight could be found in &lt;a href=\"Hordemar%20City\"&gt;Hordemar City&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dragonspawn%20Refugee\"&gt;Dragonspawn Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s were also visible from the bridge where &lt;a href=\"Ragewing%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Ragewing the Untamed&lt;/a&gt; was battled. A &lt;a href=\"dragonman\"&gt;dragonman&lt;/a&gt; named of &lt;a href=\"Kyrak\"&gt;Kyrak&lt;/a&gt; also joined the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and created &lt;a href=\"Drakonid%20Monstrosity\"&gt;Drakonid monstrosities&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, though the black dragons and their flight were supposed to be decimated, black dragons, black drakonid, and black dragonspawn appeared on &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;island expeditions&lt;/a&gt; and the pristine state of their &lt;a href=\"Unscarred%20Black%20Scale\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; indicated that they were young. These dragons also referred to themselves as \"the earth-warders\" and claimed the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; as theirs by right, &lt;a href=\"Ravenian%20%28black%20dragon%29\"&gt;Ravenian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrantion\"&gt;Tyrantion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stygia%20%28black%20dragon%29\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt; were among them, and were accompanied by several &lt;a href=\"dragonman\"&gt;dragonmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion stated his intent to have the black dragonflight honor its ancient charge to defend the world once again.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; returned from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt;, a clutch of uncorrupted black dragons, as well as a clutch of eggs.\nDespite the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s warnings, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt; forces besieged the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt;; the ancient home of the black dragonflight. Fortunately, the assault was spared massive casualties by the unexpected arrival of Sabellian and the Obsidian Brood. The two forces claimed the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Throne\"&gt;Obsidian Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the apex of the citadel and the literal throne of the leader of the flight. Wrathion and Sabellian then began competing for leadership of the black flight, both stating themselves as the heirs of Neltharion. Wrathion claims his deeds earn him the position while Sabellian claims his leadership of the remaining black dragons and shepherding of the flight's eggs earns him it.\nIf for a long time the magic of the black dragons was feared due to the corruption of their flight by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, after the reopening of the academy, &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Edress\"&gt;Archivist Edress&lt;/a&gt; received the opportunity to become a teacher. She was then able to pass her knowledge to a full class of students, delighted that their ways will not be lost to the ravages of time.\nAnother group known as the &lt;a href=\"Worldbreakers\"&gt;Worldbreakers&lt;/a&gt; also formed; led in secret by remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; who were attempting to deceive the black dragonkin of the isles.\nIn the RPG.\nBlack dragons are associated with earth. The term \"dragon\" is sometimes used instead of the term \"mature\" to describe the adult phase of a black &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s lifecycle, between &lt;a href=\"Black%20drake\"&gt;adolescence&lt;/a&gt; and becoming a &lt;a href=\"Black%20wyrm\"&gt;wyrm&lt;/a&gt;. They are 100\u2013500 years old.\nDescription.\nBlack dragons are large creatures that are carnivorous. They spend their time hunting, as well as watching the various wars around the world, and can often be found torturing prisoners, animals, or anything else unfortunate enough to fall into their care. A black dragon is a large, thickly-built creature with a massive chest and a long, sinuous neck. Its hide is a rich, lustrous black with large scales that are supple yet hard as rock. A crest made of peaked bone spikes runs from its head and down its back, and bristles when the great beast grows angry. Its fangs shine a coppery-red, and deep inside its mouth a constant sulfurous light emits a faint glow. Most civilized races say that black dragons have a cruel, callous look to their serpentine faces. Black dragons do not shed individual scales, but rather molt once a year \u2014 usually by spending a week resting within a lava flow of an active volcano, which peels off and consumes their discarded skin. The skin of a black dragon nearing its molt grows dull and grey.\nMost black dragons appear with their horns and wings in a shade of orange to brown, but a few females appear with purplish wings and horns. Deathwing himself appears black, plated with adamantium, with fiery veins running across his body.\nAge Cycle.\nBlack whelps are trained to kill from the moment they emerge from their eggs; in some cases, they are ready to fight even before that. Terrible and vicious, these predators delight in inflicting pain on the mortal races. Though many can speak Common and Draconic, they typically do so only to get close enough to strike. The dragon's dark scales make it almost impossible to see as it moves in and out of the shadows.\nUnlike most other dragons at their age, black dragons are nearly fearless, quite willing to die in a bloody frenzy in order to inflict as pain as they can on their targets. As such, they are incredibly dangerous, especially in groups; and this is exactly how they like to fight. If encountered alone, a black whelp retreats to find more of its kind, then return to tear apart whatever has invaded their domain. They focus on the same target as the oldest dragon, killing enemies one by one. Whelps delight in using their breath weapons.\nThe average black drake's goal in life is no less than to become &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s right hand (or replacement) and thus to control the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;flight&lt;/a&gt; in conquering or destroying the natural world. Black dragon society is ruled by the powerful, and its \u201claws\u201d are enforced by brute strength, cunning, and magical power. By this age, a black drake has already proven itself to be a survivor; most blacks don't even make it to adulthood, with nearly every creature in the world, including its own kind, looking to take its head or its hide.\nThe black dragon's murderous intent is clear from its posture even before one has a chance to look into its eyes. Massive yet sinuous, the dragon spreads its wings and roars in challenge, jaws snapping the air in anticipation. The midnight scales reflect the ambient light brightly, making the beast look even more nightmarish.\nBlack drakes use every dirty trick, stratagem, and advantage they have to incapacitate or kill their enemies as swiftly and easily as possible. If all else fails, they retreat, no doubt with a plan for vengeance already forming in their minds. When working with a group, they are as showy as possible, trying to assert their dominance and skill over the others, while in reality trying to expend their own energy as little as possible. Drakes use their fiery breath as frequently as possible, but also use flight to their advantage, keeping a distance from opponents on the ground and making strafing flyby attacks. Those who train as spellcasters prefer offensive and manipulative spells, but most drake spellcasters also prepare a few spells intended to help them escape more quickly if all goes badly.\nBlack drakes speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;, and some speak other languages as well.\nCombat.\nAlthough overconfident, black dragons are canny. On spotting a target, black dragons may make a snap decision to attack rather than following and considering the enemy party's size or strength. Still, they will not land until all ranged fire has ended and the enemy seems routed. Black dragons will not remain committed to battle unless certain they can win or unless the enemy taunts them beyond the point of reason. They are not interested in material possessions and are more than willing to leave behind physical goods. They are drawn to prisoners, particularly nobles and children. If the situation seems desperate, a black dragon will flee with a prisoner in each clawed fist. Although they are not as large as some other dragonflights, they use daring and savage intellect to entrap and destroy their enemies. Black dragons prefer to flame their prey, trapping targets on dangerous ground before swooping in for the kill. They are vicious fighters and rarely retreat. They are most often encountered alone, as they are jealous of sharing kills with another. Still, families with a new clutch of drakes or a clutch of enslaved black dragons are not unknown.\nCulture and society.\nBlack dragons were once earth-warders, caring for stone and mountain using their formidable abilities to cause the rise and fall of terrain. They were to watch as the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; changed and to maintain the boundaries and lines of delineation between the races so that none would fall to war over land. They maintained this purpose for a time, living in relative harmony with the other races and shaping the land to better use. In those peaceful times, their leader was known as Neltharion, and his wisdom and power were renowned.\nThen came the madness that destroyed &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;'s mind. As the black dragonflight followed their leader into madness, so did their powers. He lowered mountains and destroyed land so that races would mingle and fight over territory. They traded their gifts over earth for the powers of fire and magma. Destruction was their art and death was their goal. All the other &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth have fought against Deathwing's flight at every opportunity.\nAt this time, Deathwing was known as &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;. When Neltharion was influenced by the Old Gods he no longer was Neltharion but became Deathwing. He began a policy opposite his charge by the titans. He lowered mountains so that races would mingle and destroyed land so that the races would fight each other. His occupation became death. They traded their powers of earth for the powers of fire and magma.\nAll other dragons of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; fight against Deathwing's flight. They are also very hateful to other except their flight, when in mortal form.\nIn modern times black dragons are some of the most evil, sadistic creatures known on the face of Azeroth. Black dragons are vicious, selfish beings, not caring even for the lives of their flightmates and children, often killing other blacks to rise in prominence among the flight. Before Deathwing's disappearance, the black dragons sought to emulate their dark master. A wyrm's goal in life was to become the foul black aspect's right hand or even replace him entirely, caring little for any other blacks that got in the way of this goal. Nowadays the black dragonflight is in civil war. With their leader, missing from the black flight, each individual desires to become the new leader of their dark kind. Most black dragons follow the instructions of another only if they expect a benefit or they're confident that the other dragon could eat them.\nBlack dragons spend their time hunting, as well as watching the various wars around the world, and can often be found torturing prisoners, animals, or anything else unfortunate enough to fall into their care. The Aspect of the black flight, Deathwing, is one of the fiercest and most evil creatures in existence. In his lifetime, he has destroyed many ancient cities. Deathwing often makes deals with the intelligent races, trading members of his dragonflight for slaves and humanoid torture subjects.\nHistory.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; the black dragons were numerous and co-existed peacefully with the other dragonflights, working together to safeguard their world. But this age would not last forever.\nAfter having wiped out nearly every member of the flight, the black dragons were not ready to leave the last few blues in peace. The survivors of the blue dragonflight fled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, then Deathwing attacked the blue dragons, slaughtering them by the dozens. The survivors fought back but were no match for Deathwing's ferocity. In the process, their homes were destroyed and the land so damaged it could never recover. That area became the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. Over what is now &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; another battle between the blacks and blues was waged, and many blue dragons died. Their magic released into the air and settled as glittering light on the ground and the rocks and the trees. Finally, an elder blue dragon, beset by many blacks, unleashed a powerful spell to strip the life from his attackers and turn them to stone. The loose magic altered and amplified the spell, spreading it across the entire region and changing soil and stone and wood and flesh into a living crystal.\nIn the early years following the sundering, is said that Deathwing's black flight attempted to subjugate the bronze dragons. The assault was unsuccessful, primarily because the bronze dragons did not stay and fight as expected. His command of time offering insight into the blacks' plans, Nozdormu alerted his flight of the danger. The bronze dragonflight scattered to the four corners of the globe, where they continued to monitor events."}

The black dragonflight was charged by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; with warding the earth and protecting the various deep places of the world; granting them power over the earth. They were once led by their mighty Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; the Earth-Warder; though he was ultimately corrupted by the insidious &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and made into their pawn alongside the majority of his flight until its destruction.\nAfter being corrupted, the black dragons did the opposite of their mission; sowing discord and chaos. For many centuries, the black dragonflight was one of the most evil organizations on Azeroth, seeking destruction rather than protection as they once had. They held a deep-seated rivalry with the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, who found their cruel ways profane against life. With no other dragonflights on their side, the black dragonflight created other dragons, such as the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragon\"&gt;chromatic dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. When Deathwing returned and caused the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the black dragonflight joined their Aspect in his plan to cause the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; - the liberation of the Old Gods and the end of all life on the planet. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, their evil plans were foiled by mortal champions many times before their most devastating defeat during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;; where the flight was destroyed and their Aspect slain to end the Cataclysm.\nIn the aftermath of the original flight's destruction, it has since been reformed by two groups, the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt;, who seek to restore the original purposes of the flight. The former is made up of uncorrupted black dragons who follow the leadership of Neltharion's son, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, while the latter is a group of mortals who follow the whims of Neltharion's grandson, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. The dragonflight is made up not only of the black dragons, but of their mortal followers and dragonkin as well; the majority of which share scale colors with the flight. Alongside the other dragonflights, the black dragonflight was part of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt;; though their membership in the former was tenuous at best and they eventually departed from and fought against it.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered, the Obsidian Brood returned to Azeroth and helped the Blacktalon to regain control of the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;. After their victory, Wrathion and Sabellian competed to determine who should be the new Aspect of the black dragonflight. However, after they discovered &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt; and the reality of Neltharion's dark legacy, it was Ebyssian who was chosen by his brothers as the new leader of their dragonflight.\nCulture.\n\"Though the black dragonflight was nearly annihilated in ages past, a few of the evil creatures have made their homes in the dry, desolate wastes of &lt;a href=\"The%20Barrens\"&gt;The Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. With their lord, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, either missing or dead, the black dragons seek to appease only themselves. The creatures are immensely powerful and cruel and revel in mortal suffering. The black dragons are the enemies of every other dragonflight, especially the great red dragons of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBlack dragons were for a time, like their Aspect &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, the defenders of Azeroth, living deep in the caverns of the earth. They shaped the lands, raised mountains, and created valleys. The black dragonflight represented the strength of the earth itself. Even the symbol of the black dragonflight is a volcano, as it represents great power of earth and elements. For countless millennia the black dragons and the other flights lived in peace and harmony and worked together to safeguard Azeroth from all forms of violence and destruction. Then they fell prey to the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, Neltharion most of all. Gone was their regard for their charges. Destruction became their sole goal, fire, and magma their instruments.\nOnce held in high regard by all others as wise and steadfast, black dragons of modern times were vicious evil creatures, despised by all decent living beings. They delighted in the pain and misery of others. Having been driven mad by the whispers in their heads, they sought dominion of Azeroth and considered all other flights to be hated enemies. Even members of their own flight were never to be trusted, and could nearly all be described as power-hungry. Black dragons would often take humanoid form and meddle in the affairs of mortal kingdoms in hopes of bringing about their downfall. They would attempt to turn any situation or conflict they may come across to their advantage.\nHowever, in the wake of the Old Gods' defeat, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; has sworn to see the black dragonflight once again fulfill their ancient duty to protect Azeroth. He was later joined by the resurgent &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt;. For a time, the two vyed for power of their flight against one another, before the events of &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt; showed them that neither were prepared to take up the mantle of their flight. Instead, the brothers propped forward their other brother, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, who had been a wise counsel to them both to lead them as their new Aspect.\nBlack dragonkin are sometimes referred to as obsidian or onyx. The scales of the black dragonflight almost always retain their heat.\nNomenclature.\nMembers of the black dragonflight occasionally have names ending in \"ion\" for males, or \"ia\" for females. Sometimes synonyms of the word \"black\", or terms relating to fire and undesirable character traits their way into their names as well.\nMembership.\nThe black dragonflight is primarily made up of, as the name implies, black dragonkin. These include the black dragons themselves, but also black-scaled variants of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;. During the era of Deathwing, they also included strange creatures such as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonman\"&gt;dragonmen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"drakeadon\"&gt;drakeadon&lt;/a&gt;s, and in antiquity, the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nMortals also serve as part of the flight, such as the entirety of the &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt;. The human &lt;a href=\"Samia%20Inkling\"&gt;Samia Inkling&lt;/a&gt; also serves the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt; as their quartermaster under the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuises.\nThe preferred &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt; forms of the black dragonflight when in disguise amongst mortals are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s with black hair and dark eyes. Though black dragons can easily take other forms, humans have been especially useful. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; also can be disguises. The powerful and semi-industrial human kingdoms could more easily accomplish the goals of Deathwing and his ilk than the nomadic tauren, the magically-minded &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, or the mountain-dwelling &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Humans are also far less sensitive to the presence of dragons than other races. A few known exceptions are &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; who used a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; guise as an ambassador to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Spellbinder\"&gt;Blackwing Spellbinder&lt;/a&gt;s took elven form. As Spritwalker Ebonhorn, &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; uses a &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; appearance.\nKnown black dragons that have taken human form are listed in their dragon state and respective human names:\nHistory.\nCharge of the Dragonflights.\nAccording to legends, satisfied that the small world had been ordered and that their work was done, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s prepared to leave Azeroth. But before they departed, they charged the greatest species of the world with the task of watching over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. In that age, there were many &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Yet there were five flights that held dominion over their brethren. It was these five flights that the Titans chose to shepherd the budding world. The greatest members of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; imbued a portion of their power upon each of the flights' leaders. &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Titan shaper and forger of the world, bestowed some of his vast power upon the mighty black wyrm, Neltharion. The great-hearted Neltharion, known afterwards as the Earth-Warder, was given dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world. He embodied the strength of the world and served as &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest supporter.\nIn truth, in Azeroth's ancient past, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion was one of the more intelligent of proto-dragons, capable of broken speech unlike most of the other, more animal-like of his kind. Alongside &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion faced Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;. After killing Galakrond, Neltharion and the others were approached by the other Keepers, and Tyr suggested empowering the proto-dragons to make them defenders of Azeroth, as they proved they were able to stand for the planet. Only &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; disagreed, and forbid the other Keepers to proceed with that idea, but they decided to go against him. They reached out to the Pantheon and each of the titans blessed the proto-dragons with a portion of their vast power, channeled through the Keepers. They became majestic beings called &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, and among them, Neltharion became the Aspect of Earth while his black dragonflight was charged with the task of watching over Azeroth, lest any force should threaten its perfect tranquility. One of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that the titans created them from Galakrond, to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps.\nThe time following this came to be known as the age of dragons when the civilization of dragonkind was at its peak.\nAncient times.\nTwenty thousand years ago, concerned at the rift between the Dragon Aspects and &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion knew a war was coming. He created the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; as \"ideal soldiers,\" combing the essence of dragons with the traits of mortal races, whose potential he saw in those who began to emerge across the world, and used an artifact of &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; magic to keep them under his control. The Earth-Warder then fashioned the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of the Dragon Isles to serve as the dracthyr soldiers' training ground, and divided them into five armies known as &lt;a href=\"weyrn\"&gt;weyrn&lt;/a&gt;s, each led by a &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Scalecommander&lt;/a&gt; in order to serve the interests of the black dragonflight. The &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; were charged with defending the allies of the black dragonflight and protecting its strongholds. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt; were trained to crush the will and leaders of the blacks' enemies, denying their solace in walls and borders. The &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wings\"&gt;Healing Wings&lt;/a&gt; served as the face and symbol for hope among all those who would call the Aspects their allies, embodying the resilience and fortitude of the Earth-Warder. The &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Scales\"&gt;Ebon Scales&lt;/a&gt; were charged with bringing destruction to the enemies of the black dragonflight, raining down fire and unleash spell craft upon those who would stand against the Earth-Warder. The &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Vigil\"&gt;Adamant Vigil&lt;/a&gt; served as the eyes and ears of the black dragonflight, as where the black's enemies trod, the Adamant Vigil would find them, and where the black's armies flew, it was their guidance that directed their talons.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Primalist\"&gt;Primalist&lt;/a&gt; rebellion attacked Neltharion and his dracthyr army at the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, and the relic was destroyed during the fight. Seeing no other way to stop the Primalists, this was the moment that Neltharion gave in to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s that had long haunted him, and used their power to seal Raszageth away. It was at this precise moment that he condemned himself and his flight to the sinister fate that awaited them. Without the titan relic, Neltharion deemed the dracthyr a risk and contacted Malygos to explain everything that had happened, except for his use of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magic. The Aspect of Magic agreed to contain the dracthyr and placed them into stasis with his magic.\nGradually, Neltharion silently chafed at what he felt was a burden that had been inflicted on him; though he could command the entire weight of Azeroth itself, that same weight constantly pressed on his body every waking moment, the load making him feel suffocated to the point that he felt his very spirit unraveling. Neltharion believed that he must bear this burden alone, but ultimately found it to be too much, and began to resent the charge placed upon him. The belief that the titans viewed Azeroth as an experiment only fueled his bitterness. Then came the madness that destroyed Neltharion's mind, changing him and his kind forever. The whispering convinced him that he could have power beyond his imagination, and the voices made Neltharion even paranoid of his own flight, as he began to yearn for a world dominated by the black dragonflight; a world in which the other dragonflights ceased to exist. The Old Gods later convinced Neltharion to create the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this time, the other flights didn't realize that the black dragonflight fell to the whisperings of the Old Gods. The other Aspects attributed Neltharion's oddness to his displeasure with the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nWhen the Highborne opened the portal for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, marking the start of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, all the dragonflights left the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to join the fight against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. On the battlefield, Neltharion led the dragon forces, consuming the demons under their fiery breaths, but their strength was not enough. As the other Aspects began to despair, the Black Aspect suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in the destruction of the Legion. The other Aspects had nothing but the utmost respect for wise Neltharion, and they accepted without hesitation his plan to give much of their own essence toward the creation of this object, which was called the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Neltharion and his flight, however, had secretly refrained from imparting any of their own power. During the time of the Dragon Soul's empowerment, the area where the ritual took place was surrounded by a giant, impenetrable magical barrier as Neltharion didn't want anything or anyone to stop the ritual. This barrier was guarded from the inside by dragons from all flights, but was also patrolled from the outside by black dragons who had the orders to kill on sight anyone trying to enter or even leave the area.\nWhen each dragon had contributed a portion of his or her essence to the artifact, Neltharion deemed it complete. The blacks joined the other dragons in flight over the battle and the Black Aspect brought the Dragon Soul to bear against the Legion, with devastating effects on the demonic swarm \u2014 but only for a precious few moments. He then shocked his fellow Aspects and turned the artifact against the terrified night elves as well, and finally his own brethren. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the Dragon Soul, for it contained a fraction of the essence of each \u2014 with the exception of Neltharion himself. All the dragonflights, save Neltharion's own, were paralyzed in midair until the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, a mate of the red dragonqueen, who had been absent from the initial use of the artifact. While Korialstrasz was no match for the Aspect of Earth, he did manage to interrupt Neltharion's concentration for a moment, freeing the other dragons from their paralysis and allowing them to act. Malygos, infuriated at the betrayal by his ally, struck first, but at a great price. As the blue dragonflight flew into formation to attack Neltharion, the mighty black wyrm unleashed the full fury of the Dragon Soul against them, and the power instantly slew nearly every one of them. As the other dragons turned to act, Neltharion then scattered the hundreds of other assembled dragons before retreating from the field of battle, taking the Dragon Soul with him. Thus Neltharion became Deathwing the Destroyer, the Dragon Soul was renamed the \"Demon Soul\", and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wars\"&gt;Dragon Wars&lt;/a&gt; begun.\nAt some point during the war, one particular brood of Ysera's was closely allied with the night elves of the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, who were ruled by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Toreth\"&gt;Prince Toreth&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera kindly allowed the night elves to ride her children into battle and they were known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riders%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;. However, Ysera's benevolence raised the ire of Deathwing and he launched an attack against &lt;a href=\"Wyrmscar%20Island\"&gt;Wyrmscar Island&lt;/a&gt; where the dragonriders slept. The blacks, including &lt;a href=\"Razormaw\"&gt;Razormaw&lt;/a&gt;, a lieutenant of Deathwing, mercilessly slaughtered the Kaldorei. The greens rose up to protect their allies but were unsuccessful. Not one was spared, though many blacks, including Razormaw, also perished in the battle. In time, Razormaw's hatred for the greens was so great that his restless spirit remained soaring high overhead, forever haunting the island.\nThe black dragonflight's actions left their former allies wounded and shocked, and the noble dragons were forced to abandon their mortal allies. The dragonflights secluded themselves, hoping to recover from the Dragon Soul's powers, but the damage to the draconic race had been done. The Kaldorei and their allies just barely managed to defeat the Legion, but Azeroth was sundered.\nAftermath of the Sundering.\nDeathwing\u2019s betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. If that had not been enough, the ensuing war between the dragonflights decimated the species, most of all the blacks. Some dragons call this time period the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wars\"&gt;Dragon Wars&lt;/a&gt;, though others including mortals may know it by other names. Even though it was everyone against the black flight, easily outnumbering them, it was incredibly emotionally hard for the dragons because they had to fight their friends and loved ones, people they had known and grown up with. The black dragonflight was hunted down and nearly annihilated, all but slain because of Deathwing's mad plots. Deathwing's remaining consorts were slain, by his own recklessness, in the first few days of the war, leaving him with limited options to repopulate his flight. They would never again be seen in the same numbers as before. The age of dragons had passed.\nTo ensure Deathwing would never hold power over dragonkind again, Alexstrasza, Ysera, and Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon the Demon Soul, so that no dragon, including Deathwing, could wield it, and hid the foul disc deep beneath the earth. While Deathwing settled into a deep slumber, as he needed time to recover from his wounds and to regain his strength, the other dragonflights would hunt his corrupted black dragonflight to the brink of extinction.\nWithin &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; to purify one of Deathwing's eggs, which hatched into an uncorrupted black whelp named &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproximately five hundred years prior to the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, former prime consort of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to bring down the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; with a curse that left all the wizards in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; unable to use their magic. Her scheme was foiled in part by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, consort to &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and when Sintharia was defeated, most believed her to be dead when her own magic had been turned on her.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; Deathwing saw his opportunity to decimate Alexstrasza and her flight. Deathwing was unable to wield the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; himself, but it could be placed in the hands of a being that would use it against his enemies. Deathwing sent visions of the artifact to the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; the Whacked, who claimed the disc for the Horde. The device was given to his lieutenant, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;, whose magic the disk eagerly reciprocated, and was used to enslave Alexstrasza and most of her flight, turning them into the Horde's hounds of war.\nBeyond The Dark Portal.\nDuring the orc's second intrusion into Azeroth, the black dragonflight briefly joined the Horde. Seeking magical artifacts, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; had sent a party under &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; to bring the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; back into the fold and acquire their red dragons. &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; refused and Teron left defeated, but they were soon approached by Deathwing. Deathwing presented the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; with an offer. He and his children would lend their aid to the Horde, in return for safe passage of his flight and eggs to Draenor. Gorefiend accepted and the black Aspect summoned his flight to him. Before departing Deathwing spoke with &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, asking them to remain on Azeroth and take command of the orcs left within the spire. The remaining members of the black dragonflight, led by Deathwing and his lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, allowed the orcs to ride upon them in order to retrieve the needed artifacts.\nOnce in possession of the artifacts, Ner'zhul pulled the Horde back to Draenor. The black dragons, taking special care of the eggs, crossed through the Dark Portal. Deathwing spoke with Ner'zhul, bidding his farewell and taking the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. A few dragons stayed with the Horde at &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, but the bulk of the flight settled within the valleys of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, where they could tend to the delicate eggs. Their presence there was not welcome by &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;, father of the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; and ruler of the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Gruul and his subjects, assisted by members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; sent to recover the skull, attacked drake and egg alike. Deathwing was outraged by the destruction of his precious eggs and fought back, only to be driven off by a strategic spell from &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. Sabellian managed to escape as well. The remaining black dragons, now leaderless, quickly fell to the fury of Gruul's children and were crushed and impaled upon the spires of Frostfire Ridge.\nNot long after, Ner'zhul's portals began to tear Draenor apart, and soon the planet was going through its death throes. Deathwing quickly escaped back to Azeroth, abandoning his remaining progeny on the doomed world. Then the cataclysm came and Draenor was shattered, only what would become known as &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; remained. Many of the black dragon eggs were exposed to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and the dragons that emerged were no longer truly members of the black flight. These ethereal dragons would come to be known as the &lt;a href=\"netherwing%20dragonflight\"&gt;netherwing dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle of Grim Batol.\nThe blacks were nearly extinct and their master, Deathwing, was believed to have been brought down during an organized strike by the most powerful members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, his body falling into the sea. But this was nothing more than a ruse.\nSecretly he had assumed the guise of Lord &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt; and sought a way to rebuild his flight. He devised a plan to steal the eggs of his greatest foe, Alexstrasza, slave of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt;. Not wanting to possibly damage the eggs by directly assaulting Grim Batol, he sought a way to bring the eggs out into the open. He fooled Nekros into believing the Alliance planned an invasion, and the warlock ordered to have Alexstrasza and her eggs moved to Dun Algaz where he believed the bulk of the Dragonmaw clan was stationed. When Deathwing appeared Nekros sent &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; to face him, but the old red did not last long against the dark Aspect. Deathwing began stealing Alexstrasza's eggs only to be stalled by the sudden arrival of the other Aspects, who proceeded to battle Deathwing in the sky near Grim Batol. Korialstrasz's human apprentice, Rhonin, defeated Nekros and used one of Deathwing's scales to destroy the Demon Soul. The destruction of the artifact released the ancient power that had been sealed inside for millennia, making the Aspects whole once more and allowing them to overpower Deathwing and force his retreat. This final battle was known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;the Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Aspects gave chase and Deathwing was gravely wounded but not killed. The Black Aspect went into hiding in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the realm of earth inside the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20plane\"&gt;elemental plane&lt;/a&gt;, and no creature, not even members of his flight knew his location. The black dragonflight went into a state of civil war following Deathwing's disappearance, fighting over who would rule the flight.\nThird War.\nLike the other dragonflights, the black dragonflight did not play any significant role in the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, then prince of Lordaeron, did however assist a group of &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; dragon hunters track down and slay the black drake &lt;a href=\"Searinox\"&gt;Searinox&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; also encountered a small group of black whelps and drakes hiding in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt;, and was quick to dispatch the vile spawn of Deathwing.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLong ago, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; drove the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres from their &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Ruins\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmurk\"&gt;Dragonmurk&lt;/a&gt;, a dismal swamp located within &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. She did so in order to procure a place to raise her numerous children, who would then leave to infest the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmbog\"&gt;Wyrmbog&lt;/a&gt;. She and her children became known for terrorizing any travelers who strayed too close to her home. After &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s departure, Onyxia and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; rose to lead their brethren and recouped their failing numbers. Together, with the orchestrations of their human personas, they worked toward replenishing the black dragonflight.\nUnder the guise of &lt;a href=\"Victor%20Nefarius\"&gt;Victor Nefarius&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian claimed &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as his aerie, subverted the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; and ensnared the black dragons not already under his control. Black dragonkin under his command were sent in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, and as far south as the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Nefarian has been experimenting with the blood of all of the various dragonflights to create a &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; of unstoppable warriors, and his soldiers kidnapped &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; of other flights, such as the &lt;a href=\"blue%20whelp\"&gt;blue whelp&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt;, to be used in their experiments. In this task he has succeeded his father, and aided by his sister, he planned to use them to rally the black dragonflight to his command.\nWhile Nefarian remained at Blackrock Spire to create twisted abominations that would carry out his will, Onyxia preferred subtle manipulation to further their goals. For several years, Onyxia masqueraded as one of the highest nobles in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, preventing the people there from sending much-needed aid to the areas near the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, where her brother has great power and influence. Her final goal was to become the ruler of Stormwind, through manipulation and evil schemes. Her plot was foiled by Marshal &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt; and she was unmasked in the halls of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Having fled to her &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;lair&lt;/a&gt;, the recently returned &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; led an army to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to slay Onyxia. After the battle, the king decapitated Onyxia and sent her head to be hung from the ramparts of Stormwind while &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; summoned roots from the ground to seal her lair's entrance and to kill her unhatched progeny.\nMeanwhile, Horde champions fought against Nefarian's twisted creations in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, before confronting Nefarian in his lair, ultimately defeating him. The champions then took &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Nefarian\"&gt;his head&lt;/a&gt; as proof of their victory and returned to Orgrimmar.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe black dragons that accompanied Deathwing to Draenor remained behind when the planet was torn apart, and could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; where they continued their battles against the &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt; that have waged since the Second War. Many of the black dragons there met their end at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt; and his sons, and could be seen impaled on the rocky spires at &lt;a href=\"Dragons%27%20End\"&gt;Dragons' End&lt;/a&gt;. Under Sabellian, the black dragons of Outland, the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt;, were free of the Old Gods' corruption. During the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Sabellian schemed to confront the gronn who have hunted his kind for years. At the same time, his servant &lt;a href=\"Samia%20Inkling\"&gt;Samia Inkling&lt;/a&gt; hired &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to capture whelps from the &lt;a href=\"wyrmcult\"&gt;wyrmcult&lt;/a&gt;, a group of mortals who worship the black dragons, and to deliver them to Sabellian.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing's consort &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; visited the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to seek the eggs of their &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, which were mutated black dragons, to further Deathwing's experiments in creating the ultimate dragonflight. In exchange, she pledged the black flight to serve as the Dragonmaw's mounts.\nIn the years following &lt;a href=\"Gruul\"&gt;Gruul&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, Sabellian and his black dragons bent the Blade's Edge Mountains to their will.\nSecond Battle of Grim Batol.\nThe cursed fortress had not seen the last of the black dragonflight. More than a decade after Deathwing's defeat, his prime consort &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, now called Sinestra, took the mountain for herself, driving off the remnants of the red dragonflight. Sinestra, assisted by the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Zendarin%20Windrunner\"&gt;Zendarin Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and a large brood of black dragonkin led by the drakonid &lt;a href=\"Rask\"&gt;Rask&lt;/a&gt;, set up a lair to continue the experiments started by her son Nefarian to create a new powerful dragonflight. Sinestra planned to use the shards of the Demon Soul in conjuncture with &lt;a href=\"Balacgos%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Balacgos's Bane&lt;/a&gt; to combine the essence of the captured nether dragon &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt; with the stolen eggs of various flights.\nWhen Korialstrasz sensed something deep within the mountain, he returned to Grim Batol and found the black consort in the midst of creating the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, among them, the newest and powerful twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;. Korialstrasz and his allies rushed to stop Sinestra while dwarven resistance fighters battled her brood, managing to kill the drakonid &lt;a href=\"Rask\"&gt;Rask&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice, and the anger felt by Dargonax towards his \"mother\", Sinestra and her creation were defeated. The mountain was once again abandoned, unaware to anyone that Deathwing lurked still deeper within.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragon ambassador &lt;a href=\"Nalice\"&gt;Nalice&lt;/a&gt; was present at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, an alliance of the dragonflights created to oppose &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s crusade against magic users during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; started to siege the various &lt;a href=\"dragonshrine\"&gt;dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s to raise &lt;a href=\"undead%20dragon\"&gt;undead dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, Nalice sent adventurers to meet &lt;a href=\"Serinar\"&gt;Serinar&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;, in order to fight off the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuing his consort's experiments, Deathwing entrusted a batch of twilight eggs to the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Sartharion\"&gt;Sartharion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; beneath Wyrmrest Temple, aided by the twilight drakes &lt;a href=\"Shadron\"&gt;Shadron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tenebron\"&gt;Tenebron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vesperon\"&gt;Vesperon&lt;/a&gt;. Following the sacking of the Obsidian Sanctum by the adventurers on the orders of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful war party of the black dragonflight, led by the fearsome &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt;, have launched an assault upon the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. By destroying the sanctum, the black dragonflight look to crush those that would stand in the way of their &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;master\u2019s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;reemergence&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and to ultimately shatter the Wyrmrest Accord.\nIn the wake of Deathwing's reemergence and his &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, Nalice has mysteriously disappeared from Wyrmrest Temple, and with her, the allegiance of the black dragonflight to the Wyrmrest Accord.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight joined Deathwing in his plan to cause the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; - the liberation of the Old Gods and the end of all life on the planet. Across Azeroth, allied with the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, they caused chaos and confronted the other dragonflights and their mortal allies. After his return, Deathwing began to invade the various regions of Azeroth, raining fire upon the earth and killing any who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in his path.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragonflight continued to work alongside the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, where an army of black dragonspawn led by the drake &lt;a href=\"Minyoth\"&gt;Minyoth&lt;/a&gt; and the drakonid &lt;a href=\"Tugnar%20Goremaw\"&gt;Tugnar Goremaw&lt;/a&gt; settled around &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Rock\"&gt;Dreadmaul Rock&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; veteran &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt; and the reformed Blackrock orc &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt; destroyed them before they could began their invasion. In the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt; took control of the Blackrock orcs in the region, in order to march upon &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, but he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company\"&gt;Bravo Company&lt;/a&gt; before he could achieve his plan. In the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, numerous black whelps led by the drake &lt;a href=\"Pyrricion\"&gt;Pyrricion&lt;/a&gt; fought against the &lt;a href=\"dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs who seek to capture them, they were assisted by dragonspawn.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian and his attempts to create a new breed of dragon were thought defeated following his death. But the Twilight's Hammer reanimated Nefarian with &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magic, and Deathwing ordered his son to continue his experiments, and even to surpass his previous creations in wickedness and power. Dwelling on the lessons learned from his defeat in Blackwing Lair, he has burrowed deeper into the heart of Blackrock Mountain and rebuilt his sanctuary: the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Shadowflame\"&gt;Vault of the Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;. He also succeeded in the reanimation of his sister, Onyxia, but was ultimately slain with her by adventurers of the Alliance and the Horde.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, full-out warfare has erupted in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; between the black dragonflight and the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Black dragonkin roosted at the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Forest\"&gt;Obsidian Forest&lt;/a&gt;, constantly under attack by the red flight, and black drakes spread throughout the southern regions of the Highlands. The broodmother &lt;a href=\"Obsidia\"&gt;Obsidia&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last mature and breeding black dragons, has relocated &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Lair\"&gt;her lair&lt;/a&gt; nearby and was targeted by the red dragons. Even the mighty Aspects themselves, Deathwing and Alexstrasza, become engaged in the battle over &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, as the Dragon Queen decided that the black dragonflight could not be saved and should be totally destroyed.\nAt some point, the Twilight's Hammer cultists recovered the broken corpse of Sintharia, pieced it together, and reanimated it with &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magics. Now a ravaged husk of her former self, she continued building an entire flight of twilight dragons, and oversaw the creation of new twilight clutches. Under the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, she gave birth to a clutch of black dragon eggs that were to be turned into twilight dragon eggs, performing the duties once held by Alexstrasza in Grim Batol, as her fate was ultimately to be an egg factory for Deathwing and the Twilight Cult. With the help of the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, who sacrificed himself during the battle, the adventurers were giving enough strength to finally vanquish Sinestra.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing's upheaval has caused volcanic activity at what was once the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where the broodmother &lt;a href=\"Seldarria\"&gt;Seldarria&lt;/a&gt; and her clutch of black eggs were targeted by the Alliance forces at &lt;a href=\"Farwatcher%27s%20Glen\"&gt;Farwatcher's Glen&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to route out the last remaining blues, black drakes led by the drake &lt;a href=\"Malicion\"&gt;Malicion&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Sable%20Ridge\"&gt;Sable Ridge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in search of the elusive &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, however, they were eliminated by Horde adventurers sent by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. In his crusade to wipe out all life on Azeroth, Deathwing sought to activate the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, which required a powerful artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Coffer%20of%20Promise\"&gt;Coffer of Promise&lt;/a&gt;. He has enlisted &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Schnottz\"&gt;Commander Schnottz&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition to find the coffer and sent black dragon emissaries, including &lt;a href=\"Myzerian\"&gt;Myzerian&lt;/a&gt;, to ensure the artifact became his. To prevent such a disaster, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and a band of adventurers disabled it so that Deathwing's servants could not use it. Although Onyxia was dead, her brood was still at her lair in Dustwallow.\nAt the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, after the defeat of Ragnaros, Deathwing and his black and twilight dragons, aided by his Old God benefactors, laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The remaining &lt;a href=\"Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and the world shaman &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; agreed upon a course of action and fought to bring the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to bear against the Destroyer and bring about his final end. The flight was ultimately destroyed by heroes of the Alliance and Horde, through the aid of the four other dragonflights, and even with the aid of one of their own: the uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, a simple but very powerful whelp due to the experimentation on his egg by the red dragonflight. He has been orchestrating the assassinations of his remaining dragonkin siblings and even ordered the death of his own father, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. After Deathwing's fall, he went into hiding, believing to be the last known black dragon to exist.\nHowever, Wrathion was not the last of the black dragons alive on Azeroth. Some time before the destruction of Theramore, Jaina commented that some black dragons still existed in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. In Outland, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; and his group of dragons continued to live there, and the Black prince was unaware of them.\nAt some point after the Cataclysm, black drakes and whelps were present in the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, they surrounded &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and his friends. One of the drakes took hold of &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; until it was defeated by &lt;a href=\"Llaran\"&gt;Llaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iyneath\"&gt;Iyneath&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, remnants of the flight could be found in &lt;a href=\"Hordemar%20City\"&gt;Hordemar City&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dragonspawn%20Refugee\"&gt;Dragonspawn Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s were also visible from the bridge where &lt;a href=\"Ragewing%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Ragewing the Untamed&lt;/a&gt; was battled. A &lt;a href=\"dragonman\"&gt;dragonman&lt;/a&gt; named of &lt;a href=\"Kyrak\"&gt;Kyrak&lt;/a&gt; also joined the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and created &lt;a href=\"Drakonid%20Monstrosity\"&gt;Drakonid monstrosities&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, though the black dragons and their flight were supposed to be decimated, black dragons, black drakonid, and black dragonspawn appeared on &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;island expeditions&lt;/a&gt; and the pristine state of their &lt;a href=\"Unscarred%20Black%20Scale\"&gt;scales&lt;/a&gt; indicated that they were young. These dragons also referred to themselves as \"the earth-warders\" and claimed the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; as theirs by right, &lt;a href=\"Ravenian%20%28black%20dragon%29\"&gt;Ravenian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrantion\"&gt;Tyrantion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stygia%20%28black%20dragon%29\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt; were among them, and were accompanied by several &lt;a href=\"dragonman\"&gt;dragonmen&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his journey to concoct a &lt;a href=\"Potion%20of%20Mental%20Clarity\"&gt;tonic&lt;/a&gt; that, when imbibed, would cleanse a minor amount of the Old Gods' corruption and silence their whispers, Wrathion understood that all this time he was after a new legacy. A way to make amends for Deathwing's failings as well as his own. A legacy worthy of the black dragonflight's original sacred charge: the defense of Azeroth. The end of the Old Gods.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion stated his intent to have the black dragonflight honor its ancient charge to defend the world once again.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were uncovered, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt; returned from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; along with the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt;, a clutch of uncorrupted black dragons, as well as a clutch of eggs.\nDespite the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s warnings, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt; forces besieged the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Citadel\"&gt;Obsidian Citadel&lt;/a&gt;; the ancient home of the black dragonflight. Fortunately, the assault was spared massive casualties by the unexpected arrival of Sabellian and the Obsidian Brood. The two forces claimed the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Throne\"&gt;Obsidian Throne&lt;/a&gt;, the apex of the citadel and the literal throne of the leader of the flight. Wrathion and Sabellian then began competing for leadership of the black flight, both stating themselves as the heirs of Neltharion. Wrathion claims his deeds earn him the position while Sabellian claims his leadership of the remaining black dragons and shepherding of the flight's eggs earns him it.\nA group of black dragonkin known as the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Outcasts\"&gt;Obsidian Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; also affiliates with the flight, though they are in dire straits. A group of misfits who took on oddjobs, they based out of &lt;a href=\"Dragonbane%20Keep\"&gt;Dragonbane Keep&lt;/a&gt; until the return of the &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt;; who evicted the group from their home. They lay periodic sieges to the area, reclaiming their home for a time before the djaradin regroup and the process repeats. Another group known as the &lt;a href=\"Worldbreakers\"&gt;Worldbreakers&lt;/a&gt; also formed; led in secret by remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; who were attempting to deceive the black dragonkin of the isles.\nIf for a long time the magic of the black dragonflight was feared due to the corruption by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, after the reopening of the &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Edress\"&gt;Archivist Edress&lt;/a&gt; received the opportunity to become a teacher. She was then able to pass her knowledge to a full class of students, delighted that their ways will not be lost to the ravages of time.\nBy the time &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s were opened; the flight led the way to stopping the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnate\"&gt;Primal Incarnate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. Headed by Sabellian, Wrathion, and Ebyssian, the flight attempted to stop Fyrakk and his djaradin allies; though they were unsuccessful, as the primal dragon took hold of the powers of shadowflame. Tensions rose as whispers echoed from the caverns that threatened to corrupt the brothers; causing them to lash out at one another repeatedly and driving a wedge between Sabellian and Wrathion even further. Ebyssian tried to bridge this gap, and was ultimately successful in bringing the Obsidian Brood and the Blacktalon to work together under Sabellian and Wrathion in order to make headway against the various enemies they faced.\nFollowing this, the trio, alongside &lt;a href=\"Emberthal\"&gt;Emberthal&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to stop the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Sarkareth\"&gt;Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;; who was trying to claim Neltharion's dark legacy. This led them to &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion's secret laboratory. Wrathion and Sabellian led the adventurers into the laboratory, confronted with a remaining echo of their father before his corruption. This Neltharion encouraged his sons to claim their birthright within Aberrus; though the further they trekked the less the two were certain of Neltharion's legacy. At last, they found the image to be a facsimile of Neltharion, created by the Old Gods; a &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt; pretending to be their father. As they delved into Neltharion's final sanctum, they found Sarkareth, having claimed the powers of the void that corrupted their father. Alongside heroes of Azeroth, Sarkareth was defeated; though the brothers were shaken by the revelations of Neltharion.\nWrathion admitted he was going about things the wrong way; having desired to claim the title of aspect as he believed that was the only way to guide their people forward. Seeing that this wasn't necessary, he resolved to help lead their people as himself. Sabellian admitted he sought to lead the flight as Neltharion did; as one of the few dragons remaining that saw Neltharion's leadership firsthand before his corruption. But after what he saw in Aberrus, he realized that Neltharion's methods were flawed even before he became Deathwing, and stepped down from pursuing the mantle of Aspect as well. This led to the title falling to Ebyssian, who both believed had counseled with wisdom during their time in Zaralek. He accepted this, and before the other aspects, Ebyssian was declared the new aspect of the black dragonflight. Seeking to keep his brothers close and in positions of leadership of the flight, Ebyssian stated he would serve as aspect, but would need his general, Sabellian, and his diplomat, Wrathion, at his side to do so."}

Resting beneath the ruins of Lordaeron\u2019s capital lies the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, populated by the undead &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. At the gates to the realm deep below are black iron creations under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20Queen\"&gt;Banshee Queen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWhoever built these imposing black constructs has not left a record of how to create them. There is a similarity in the apparent design of these enigmatic constructs with that of &lt;a href=\"stone%20watcher\"&gt;stone watcher&lt;/a&gt;s, giving evidence that they are connected to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. The Black Iron Golems of the Undercity defy analysis. The runes and magic shift and change with each inspection. Although their true purpose remains a mystery, it is obvious that these hulking guardians will remain unique for now. Anyone attempting to create a black iron golem creates a normal &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nSince their discovery, the 13 iron juggernauts have become the guardians of a realm that opposes the undead tyranny of the Scourge. These black iron sentinels prevent incursion from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; above. While the denizens of the Undercity plot to move against the Lich King and his undead armies, these creations of some elder race defend the gates of the Forsaken realm. The Banshee Queen is clearly not the creator of these relics, since they were in the Undercity long before men discovered it. How Sylvanas managed to tame them is a closely guarded secret. Standing 30 feet tall and weighing at least 10,000 pounds, these solid black iron statues at first appear to blend in with the rest of Undercity's d\u00e9cor. The formidable, black iron statues bear the rich runes of an ancient undecipherable tongue. Leering masks hang on the faces of these &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s. These vast death heads grin at those who might seek to trespass through the thresholds under their guard. A black iron golem\u2019s surface almost seems to absorb the light cast upon it. While they don't seem to respond to the commands of Undercity\u2019s denizens, they do not move to block those not under the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s yoke. Even independent &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; serving the Lich King are blocked by these creatures; many spies have been destroyed trying to sneak past them. Yet for some mysterious reason, the Forsaken can pass through the gates without fear.\nIn total, 13 golems block the entrances to Undercity, each one responsible for a different entrance, with the largest entrance to the tunnels and caves guarded by two of the massive statues. When the forces of the Scourge attempt to rush the gates, the golems easily rebuke them, especially when aided by the magic and martial skill of the Forsaken &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s who dwell within.\nTo see a black iron golem in motion is to witness violent death embodied. Swift and indomitable, these creations are relentless in moving to block the gates of the Undercity from trespass."}

A black ooze is a mass of black, viscous liquid that flows along the ground in utter silence. Its surface bears an oily sheen. Swirls of glistening copper and silver rise to the surface and then sink back into the black depths. Black oozes possess a corrosive touch that dissolves metal; while their anatomy remains a mystery, they clearly seek to consume flesh as well. Some theorize that angry natural forces inhabited the original black oozes, animating the contaminated waste of mining operations and using it to enact vengeance on the miners. Others postulate that some miners, working far too deep in the ground, inadvertently operated in areas of powerful buried magic. Mystic energy penetrated the miner's slag pits and animated the sludgy runoff there. Whatever their origins, black oozes now exist as monsters in their own right, requiring no outside influence to live and reproduce (which they do by means of asexual splitting). Black oozes prefer to remain underground, though few venture out onto surrounding mountainsides. They do not appear to have any sort of sentience, society, or ambition beyond engulfing whatever they encounter. Black oozes, being non-intelligent, possess little in the way of tactics. They flow toward the nearest target, wrap around it until it completely dissolves, and then move on to the next target. Black oozes do not appear concerned with self-preservation, and some theorize they cannot feel pain. Thus they rarely retreat, even when obviously outmatched.\nBlack oozes are found in any mountains and underground, usually around &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt;s. A black ooze secretes a digestive acid that dissolves organic material and metal quickly, but does not affect stone. Any melee hit or constrict attack deals acid damage; worse, the opponent\u2019s armor and clothing may dissolve and become useless. A metal or wooden weapon that strikes a black ooze may also dissolves immediately. Slashing and piercing weapons deal no damage to a black ooze. Instead, when struck by such attacks, the creature splits into two identical black oozes half the size of the originals.\nBlack oozes are apparently sometimes referred to as slag beasts, although it may be a type of black ooze."}

Legend says Nefarian crafted the weapon in his human guise as Victor Nefarius, using the forges of the Blackhand orcs. He crafted it especially for Drakkisath. While held, it confers complete immunity to energy drain and ability damage. The weapon binds to its wielder\u2019s hand when wielded. Once per day, the wielder can invoke the Blackblade\u2019s summoning power, calling forth Shahram, a fiery destroyer who serves the wielder unerringly. &lt;a href=\"Shahram\"&gt;Shahram&lt;/a&gt; is bound to the blade and cannot resist the owner\u2019s commands, but otherwise loathes its servitude and does everything within its power to break free.

Razed by dragonfire in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and ravaged by undead in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the land is a dead, ghostly realm. No living creatures, not even animals, remain in this haunted region. The spirits of slaughtered elves roam the landscape like mist given form and voice. The land is now burnt and covered with ash and sorrow. Forlorn ruins jut from the ground and black trees stretch into the distance. Wispy elven spirits flit among them.\nThis realm is sometimes called the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; of Quel'Thalas.\nHistory.\nThough the Blackened Woods is a barren land, it has a rich history, which makes its current state all the more tragic. Ages ago, after the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; banished their &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;arcanist brethren&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the exiled elves made landfall here. They termed themselves the Quel'dorei, the \u201c&lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;\u201d, and named their new land Quel'Thalas, \u201cHigh Kingdom\u201d or \u201cHigh Home\u201d. They created the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; to grant them magic sustenance and established their capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; in the northeast. Eventually, they allied with &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; tribes and taught them &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for help in defeating &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The high elves had good relations with the humans for centuries.\nQuel'Thalas committed its &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sorceress\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, standing valiantly beside its human allies. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s breathed fire across Quel'Thalas, razing the land, but ultimately the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; triumphed and the elves started to rebuild. Not long after, the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; began and the elves again sent their &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s to fight alongside their allies. The &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, leading a huge &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; host, attacked Quel'Thalas, slew its leaders and murdered its citizens. The high elves lost at least 90% of their population in the Second and Third Wars. The embittered survivors, calling themselves \u201c&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\u201d, resolved that the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; would not relish its victory. They set fire to their beloved forests and joined forces with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;. The undead had no use for a dead realm and abandoned the place as well. Now Quel'Thalas is the Blackened Woods, scorched and lifeless.\nA high elf named &lt;a href=\"Ramao\"&gt;Ramao&lt;/a&gt; wrote a letter to his wife, &lt;a href=\"Melena\"&gt;Melena&lt;/a&gt;, but never managed to deliver it as he was presumably burned to death by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'Thas&lt;/a&gt;'s blood elves when they set the forests on fire.\n&lt;a href=\"Gemmuel%20Whitespire\"&gt;Gemmuel Whitespire&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few high elves remaining in Lordaeron, wants to establish a small village for his people in the Blackened Woods. The village would provide safety and succor for people of all races, even &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Gemmuel believes this dream is possible because he thinks the ancient &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s can be activated to recreate their &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;magical barrier&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a force that could keep out all of his foes. Gemmuel seeks heroes to help in his endeavor and protect him from those who would prevent accomplishing this task.\nGeography.\nThere is no much left in this land. Black scorched trees march away on all sides. Ash and grief, almost tangible, cover the ground. Elven ruins jut from the grayblack ash like the bones of the dead, and ghosts of murdered elves pass through the trees. While this land is not under any supernatural or magical curse, you could feel the bitterness, the sorrow and the hopelessness in the air. The &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s still stand.\nThe Blackened Woods is north of the Eastern Plaguelands and northwest of Zul'Aman. Ocean lies to the east and north. The haunted capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; is located on the northeast."}

Millennia later, members of the Twilight's Hammer cult were drawn to the temple by whispers and foul dreams. After sacrificing untold numbers of innocents, the cult was rewarded with a new task: to protect one of the Old Gods' most cherished creatures, a pet that is still in need of nurturing before he can unleash his dark powers on the world.\"\nBackground.\nAncient Kalimdor.\nLathar'Lazal (meaning the \"Seat of the Sky\" in &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;) was a &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28buildings%29\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, built on the western edge of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The temple was a sprawling expanse of gem-encrusted bridges and effervescent lakes, the construction of which was overseen by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself. The temple also hosted a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs masons constructed the temple, Azshara shaped the waters around it with the scepter &lt;a href=\"Sharas%27dal%2C%20Scepter%20of%20Tides\"&gt;Sharas'dal&lt;/a&gt;. She spoke the names of the rivers and the seas, and they moved at her command. Salt water from the roaring ocean and fresh water from the mountain streams trickled to Azshara's side. With the flick of her wrist, the queen partitioned them into great lakes that hugged Lathar'Lazal's sturdy foundation.\nCreatures of all kinds populated these waters, and they were at Azshara's beck and call. Whenever she walked the bridges of Lathar'Lazal, nearby schools of exotic fish would array themselves in colorful patterns. She even kept a colossal &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt; bound to one of the lakes. She used her scepter to make him perform tricks and feats of strength, much to the delight of the watching &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;. Curious night elves from the far corners of the empire journeyed to Lathar'Lazal to study the mythical creature and his habits.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; shattered the glorious temple, sinking it beneath the waves of the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nModern times.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was here on a scouting mission that went bad, with many lives lost. The only ones that survived the mission were the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hekazi\"&gt;Hekazi&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; happened to be in the area, and &lt;a href=\"Misha\"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt; carried the wounded Hekazi to safety, despite his injuries Hekazi would be known as a hero.\nRecently, the corruption of an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; seeped up from beneath the earth and tainted the sacred moonwell. Aku'mai, servant of the Old God, rose from the waters, taking residence within the temple's ruins. The cult known as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; came to bask in Aku'mai's evil presence. Empowered by the ancient rites of the chaotic Old Gods, the cultists, led by &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Kelris\"&gt;Twilight Lord Kelris&lt;/a&gt;, strove to bring about the return of their dark patrons and spread death and terror across the world. They also sacrificed innocents to Aku'Mai for power. &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, drawn by the ruins' ancient power, eventually emerged as well to plumb the secrets of what is now known as the Blackfathom Deeps.\nWhen the Twilight's Hammer cult arrived, its followers roused and imprisoned one of the last peaceful creatures living in Elune's temple. The cult delighted in tormenting the giant turtle for years, flaying its mind and body until it succumbed to madness. Naming the beast &lt;a href=\"Ghamoo-Ra\"&gt;Ghamoo-Ra&lt;/a&gt;, the cultists attempted to use its savagery to protect their lair. &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Heroes&lt;/a&gt; interrupted the ritual before the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Storm%20Mender\"&gt;Twilight Storm Mender&lt;/a&gt;s could bend the creature's will however, unleashing the great turtle's fury upon its masters.\nThe Twilight's Hammer granted &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sarevess\"&gt;Lady Sarevess&lt;/a&gt; her own private cove within Blackfathom Deeps, continuously sending her fresh sacrifices. The cultists hoped that her rituals and research would result in magical protection that would allow them to worship the terrifying hydra at the deeps' core without fear of becoming his next meal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gelihast\"&gt;Gelihast&lt;/a&gt; answered the call of the Old Gods, forcing his way into Blackfathom and slaughtering nearly a dozen surprised Twilight's Hammer cultists with his twin swords. Impressed by his ferocity and brutality, the cult allowed him to stay, and he built his own shrine to offer sacrifices and receive blessings from the ominous presence in the temple ruins.\nMany of the creatures swimming beneath the &lt;a href=\"Moonshrine%20Ruins\"&gt;Moonshrine Ruins&lt;/a&gt; were killed for food after the Hammer took up residence, but &lt;a href=\"Old%20Serra%27kis\"&gt;Old Serra'kis&lt;/a&gt;, the largest &lt;a href=\"thresher\"&gt;thresher&lt;/a&gt; in the water, proved to be uncatchable, and those who persisted in hunting it inevitably died in the attempt.\nWhen the cultists found a strange three-headed creature in the belly of Blackfathom Deeps, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Kelris\"&gt;Twilight Lord Kelris&lt;/a&gt; was convinced the hydra was a herald of the Old Gods' return to Azeroth and his ticket to immortality. Kelris personally supervised the growth of the monster, even feeding him his own subjects to satisfy his wild hunger.\nThe ancient evil Aku'mai, Princess of the Deep, carried within her a small measure of the Old Gods' power. The three-headed hydra was greatly feared for her mindless savagery and insatiable hunger for living flesh, but the Twilight's Hammer worshiped her as a divine sign that the Old Gods will soon return.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; also sent forces to investigate the rumors about the union between the Hammer and the naga. &lt;a href=\"Dawnwatcher%20Shaedlass\"&gt;Dawnwatcher Shaedlass&lt;/a&gt; came to collect as much information as possible, and sent &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Thaelrid\"&gt;Scout Thaelrid&lt;/a&gt; to check on the activity within Blackfathom. Since he had not reported back in weeks, an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; was sent to seek him out. He was found mortally wounded, but before passing, he revealed the truth of what was happening within the watery caverns. The cultists had allied with the naga and started amassing in great numbers within the depths of Blackfathom, where they offered sacrifices to Aku'mai. The brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, among which was the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra Valandril&lt;/a&gt;, fought against the evil within the Deeps and slew Kelris.\nCataclysm.\nThe Twilight's Hammer once more returned to the watery caverns. Members of the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ic order of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; rushed to oppose the cultists within Blackfathom Deeps, knowing that where the Old Gods are invoked, dangers to the whole of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; couldn't be far behind.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Bathiel\"&gt;Twilight Lord Bathiel&lt;/a&gt; assumed control of Blackfathom Deeps, with his first order being to throw his sire, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Kelris\"&gt;Lord Kelris&lt;/a&gt;, into the hungry maw of &lt;a href=\"Aku%27mai%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Aku'mai&lt;/a&gt;. Then, this elemental ascendant committed the depths of his unfathomable power to raising the beast of the Old Gods and covering the world in black.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sarevess\"&gt;Lady Sarevess&lt;/a&gt; failed to provide magical protection, &lt;a href=\"Domina\"&gt;Domina&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; to empower her own dark ritual. Unlike her predecessor, Domina, Mistress of the Dark, had no fear of Aku'mai and hand-fed the beast countless innocents in order to curry favor with the Old Gods. As Aku'mai's power grew, the need for more sacrifices increased. &lt;a href=\"Executioner%20Gore\"&gt;Executioner Gore&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of dragging screaming innocents to their death.\nThe Twilight's Hammer commanded their powerful enforcer, &lt;a href=\"Subjugator%20Kor%27ul\"&gt;Subjugator Kor'ul&lt;/a&gt;, to cleanse the caves of anything not under their control.&lt;a href=\"Gelihast\"&gt;Gelihast&lt;/a&gt; was first to fall under the crushing strength of Kor'ul, who then seized control of the cave-dwelling &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Kor'ul left Gelihast's twisted corpse on display as proof of his dominance and then used the murlocs to horde the possessions of those who perished in these caves.\nUnderneath the cursed &lt;a href=\"Moonshrine%20Ruins\"&gt;Moonshrine Ruins&lt;/a&gt;, ancient creatures battled for territory. &lt;a href=\"Old%20Serra%27kis\"&gt;Old Serra'kis&lt;/a&gt; was driven from the ruins by the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Deep\"&gt;Guardian of the Deep&lt;/a&gt; who was seeking new spawning grounds. It watched over the thousands of eggs until they could hatch, and spread throughout the waterways of Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thruk\"&gt;Thruk&lt;/a&gt; slew the Guardian of the Deep, believing that it would reveal vast hordes of gold.\nThe heroes that ventured into Blackfathom to fight off the growing forces of the Hammer, unfortunately, arrived too late. As &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lord%20Bathiel\"&gt;Twilight Lord Bathiel&lt;/a&gt; died under their assault, the ancient evil Aku'mai emerged from the depths. The Old Gods themselves whispered into the champions' minds, telling them they had earned the honor of being the first that would be devoured.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; both took an interest in Blackfathom and fought against each other there. The Alliance had discovered the presence of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; remnants harvesting &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; entered the ruins, seeking to confirm that the Twilight's Hammer cultists remained dead, just how the Horde's champions last left them. According to the mok'nathal, the cult members had been drawn to the ruined temple through strange whispers and visions sent by their Void lords. In the ruins, their charge was to protect Aku'mai that would be needed in the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Zekhan reported that the naga are still slithering all around the ruins. and that there was no other cultist to replace Bathiel as leader.\nIn the RPG.\nBlack Fathom Deeps are a series of ruins and caverns built into the side of a cliff directly south of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Fathom%20Bay\"&gt;Black Fathom Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Many dangerous creatures lurk within \u2014 including, if tales at the &lt;a href=\"Fish%20Eye%20Tavern\"&gt;Fish Eye Tavern&lt;/a&gt; are to believed, ghosts of heroes that fell to some nastiness while within the Deeps.

The &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; here seem to be searching for something. The &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, a foul cult dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, works with the naga in the underground ruins for an unknown purpose."}

Always keep a warrior with shield bash on any casting mobs, or any other class that can stun/interrupt like Shamans and Paladins. Also, this is a great dungeon to try out crowd control. Many of the enemies pulled to you will come with friends. In addition, there are invisible Satyr that you cannot see until they have come close enough to aggro you. \nCaution should be used when combating the murlocs. Once at low health, they run quite fast, often running back towards the other murlocs and the murloc boss Gelihast. Keep a form of snare on these guys. The latter part of the instance includes the Twilight Cultists. These foes come in groups of two or three, but often can include more if you aren't aware of wanderers. The ideal way to avoid an unwanted add is to pull with range, targeting the casters first (which you can get to follow you by cutting the Line of Sight, i.e. turning around a corner), and sheeping, sapping, or off tanking the adds. Also, having the highest level person in your group do the pulling helps, due to their smaller aggro radius. \nThe 'summoning chamber' with Twilight Lord Kelris includes many other cultists in the room. It is recommended to use the walled off entrance to your advantage, pulling the mobs one by one from the large room until Kelris is alone. After the room is cleared, he is ready to be engaged safely. Once he is defeated, all four candles pieces on the middle altar will need to be lit in order to advance past the large door to the final boss. Right-click these one at a time because a small group of mobs is summoned from the adjacent doors every time you do. Defeat these one at a time to avoid death.\nThe final boss is relatively easy if you have a dedicated tank and healer. See walk-through for &lt;a href=\"Aku%27mai%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Aku'mai&lt;/a&gt;. A stylishly hatted dwarf will await you at the end, giving Alliance players an option to port to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nBlack Fathom Deeps are a series of ruins and caverns that was built into the side of a cliff directly south of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Fathom%20Bay\"&gt;Black Fathom Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Many dangerous creatures lurk within - including, if tales at the &lt;a href=\"Fish%20Eye%20Tavern\"&gt;Fish Eye Tavern&lt;/a&gt; are to believed, ghosts of heroes that fell to some nastiness while within the Deeps. Others suggest that this place, once a night elf temple to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, is now the headquarters of the vile warlocks, known as the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. The naga here seem to be searching for something. The Twilight\u2019s Hammer, a foul cult dedicated to the Old Gods, works with the naga in the underground ruins for an unknown purpose."}

Blackhand saw &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; hardly able to lift a bucket of water, and he took it as a sign of weakness on the part of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;. He told that if such a frail child had been born in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; they would have killed her. Because of this, &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; exiled &lt;a href=\"Kelkar\"&gt;Kelkar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zuura\"&gt;Zuura&lt;/a&gt;, and Draka to the outskirts of the village.\nBattle with ogres.\nA warlord with massive musculature and a dominating presence, the chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; formed brilliant strategies and maintained rigorous order within his armies. He could always turn the tide of battle. He could always find the enemy's weakness. When &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; attacked and his clan faced annihilation, he orchestrated a daring last-minute triumph alongside his second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt;. On the eve of battle, the chieftain reclaimed a famous weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and restored hope for victory.\nRise of the Horde.\nAs all the chieftains, Blackhand was present during a &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival in Nagrand. Later on he went to a meeting to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; told them that &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were their enemies. At first, Blackhand roared in distrust to Ner'zhul's declaration, but changed his mind after learning that other shamans had visions similar to the one described by Ner'zhul. After this, Blackhand then started to attack draenei hunters.\nA Raider of the &lt;a href=\"Sythegore%20Arm\"&gt;Sythegore Arm&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the most honored warriors in the Horde, Blackhand became the renowned chieftain of the powerful Blackrock clan on Draenor. Known as a tactical genius and a ruthless dictator who demanded respect from his warriors, his ego and lust for power made him very easy to manipulate \u2014 a fact which &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; discovered very quickly. Through political manipulation and by stoking the embers of Blackhand's ego, Gul'dan was able to convince the Blackrock chieftain that he was a respected equal in the warlock's dark scheme, both the public leader of the Horde and a member of the secret &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;; he was in fact merely a means to an end for the evil warlock. With popular support \u2014 no doubt manipulated by Gul'dan \u2014 Blackhand was elected Warchief of the newly-formed Orcish Horde, but kept in line with Gul'dan's objectives through subtle bribery and outright blackmail.\nOne day, Gul'dan approached Blackhand and asked him and his clan to create a pair of daggers for his personal assassin, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, to use. More specifically, he wanted the daggers to be created from a mysterious type of ore no orc had ever seen before and to be imbued with a power that would only reveal itself when the time was right. Blackhand agreed to make the weapons himself in his foundry. As he quenched the blades, he felt a terrible, dark presence fill them with unspeakable might \u2014 the raw hatred of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; sinking deep within the daggers and radiating untamed agony. The Warchief named the weapons &lt;a href=\"Anguish\"&gt;Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;, for he knew they would never be satisfied unless they were drinking the blood of new victims.\nBlackhand eagerly offered all of his shamans, cut off by the spirits for waging their demon-incited war against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, to become the first Horde warlocks. In order to increase the number of warriors the Horde would be able to field against the draenei, Blackhand even had his own children's ages accelerated, making them battle-ready. He commanded &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; to do the same with his &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt;, but refused, and so Blackhand gave him another task - to lead an attack on &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;. After its fall, Blackhand's family moved to the town. The Warchief also enlisted the aid of a group of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Krol\"&gt;Krol&lt;/a&gt;. Commanding from the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand directed the later campaigns against the draenei, including the invasion of the draenei temple of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. After Karabor's fall, the orcish clans gathered at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, where everyone was certain that Blackhand was going to be the first to drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, but instead it was &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; who stepped first. Blackhand himself refused his daughter &lt;a href=\"Griselda%20Blackhand\"&gt;Griselda&lt;/a&gt; from drinking. After the orcs consumed Mannoroth's blood, the draenei's stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; fell and Blackhand searched for the body of the &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins, but with no success.\nThe First War.\nLeading the Horde through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; after defeating the draenei and after the first failed attack on Stormwind Keep, Blackhand conducted the entire war effort against the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in what became known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarchief Blackhand ordered raiding parties to cut deep into Stormwind's lands to drive panic into the human populace. Entire villagers in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood\"&gt;Brightwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the southern &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; fell, their inhabitants either killed or forced to flee. By the time Stormwind's patrols rode to defend the villages, the Horde was already gone. They were an enemy unlike any the humans had ever faced.\nDeciding to use the orcs' mobility against them, the King's Champion &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; studied the pattern of targets the Horde would strike and set up ambushes along their paths of retreat. In some cases, small units of human knights were able to bring down entire orc raiding parties without any casualties. The orcs soon realized the humans were unlike any enemy they had ever faced as well.\nThree years after the Dark Portal had been opened, the orcish raids on the countryside had razed farms, towns, villages, forges, and trade houses, causing ruin to Stormwind's economy. Even more dire, many sources of food supply had been destroyed or fallen into the Horde's control, threatening &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; with running out of supplies in a few months. With this knowledge in mind, Warchief Blackhand decided to bring the Horde north to conquer &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and from there launch an attack on Stormwind City. The Horde marched on the foothills of Redridge with little resistance and believed the humans would not attack before they reached Stormwind City, which was exactly what Lothar wanted them to think.\nAn orc raiding party led by Blackhand went into the mountains hoping to claim &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lothar and his &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s suddenly charged down the slopes without warning and surrounded the orcs in a spectacular ambush. The Horde &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s fought hard but almost all of them were slain. Lothar himself had almost killed Blackhand, but the two &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s accompanying Blackhand had turned the tide of battle with their fel fire and forced Lothar to withdraw. Blackhand was humiliated by his brush with death and blamed the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; for not sensing the ambush. He personally executed the two warlocks that saved his life for incompetence, which angered &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as they were his subordinates and limited in number. Weeks later, a larger force took Lakeshire and the surrounding land.\nAfter Brightwood, Westfall, and the Redridge Mountains had fallen, the Horde marched onto Stormwind City, the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of Horde soldiers marched through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and encircled Stormwind, cutting off all access except for the sea. Blackhand had ordered &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to lead their &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans in the assault on Stormwind. To weaken the city's defenses, siege engines bombarded the city walls through the night, and at dawn Kilrogg and Cho'gall launched their attack. While orcs charged the battlements, warlocks engulfed Stormwind's soldiers in &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; fire, resulting in staggering losses. As it seemed Stormwind would fall that day, suddenly cries of an attack came from the Horde's rear lines. Lothar and the majority of Stormwind's knights had moved around the Horde by sea. The King's Commander was now leading a charge through Elwynn Forest, catching the orcs in the rearguard completely by surprise as the knights cut through their lines. As the Bleeding Hollow and Twilight's Hammer tried to push back the knights, Stormwind's large gates opened and soldiers poured out of the city to flank the orcs in a counterattack. Outflanked on both sides and suffering many casualties, the orcs were left with no choice but to flee. This was the greatest disaster to ever happen to the Horde. Blackhand was infuriated and barely stopped himself from executing Kilrogg and Cho'gall because their clan members might revolt. The Horde withdrew to Redridge to devise a new plan.\nDuring the war, his daughter disobeyed him and fled to the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Turok\"&gt;Turok&lt;/a&gt; and his ogres. Blackhand learned about this and sent a group of warriors to kill Griselda and her new friends.\nSoon after Gul'dan fell into a coma after attempting to steal information pertaining to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; from the mind of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand was left vulnerable. Seizing the opportunity provided by the powerful warlock's incapacitation, Blackhand's second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 later known as the Backstabber for the deed he was about to commit \u2014 decided to seize power from the puppet Warchief, hoping he could lead his wayward people from the path they had taken. Orgrim wasn't pleased at forced to kill as he served him as his second-in-command and was sworn to fight beside him. But tradition allowed a warrior to challenge his chieftain for supremacy and Doomhammer was forced to do that. Doomhammer defeated Blackhand in a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; and crushed his skull, becoming both Warchief of the Horde and Chieftain of the Blackrock. Orgrim then led the Horde to the victory in the First War.\nLegacy.\nBlackhand's bloodthirsty reign would leave a lasting mark on the future of the Horde, particularly his own clan. Rather than joining with Thrall's Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; would become a part of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent threat to both the Horde and Alliance, convinced that their savage ways were that of the \"true\" Horde. This hostility would last until the reign of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who granted amnesty to those Blackrock orcs willing to rejoin the Horde.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; reflected on what the Horde's legacy truly was with King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. He recalled how Blackhand had led the first Horde's march to Azeroth on the &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Path of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, which was paved with the bones of their victims. He concluded that the monstrous actions of Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; showed that she was the true inheritor of Blackhand's bloody legacy, contrasted against &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s diplomatic tendencies.\nAppearance and retcons.\nBlackhand's design has changed significantly several times since his original introduction. In artwork for the ' and ' game manuals, as well as in the canceled \"\", he was depicted with a distinctive antlered helmet, a feature that is noticeably missing from his first \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" appearance in the form of a chess piece in the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chess%20Event\"&gt;Chess Event&lt;/a&gt;. His appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"Legends\"&gt;Warcraft Legends&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"A%20Warrior%20Made--Part%201\"&gt;A Warrior Made&lt;/a&gt;\" is identical to his chess event model.\nIn the alternate universe of \"\", Blackhand was depicted as bald, with scarred, burnt skin, glowing eyes, smoldering black armor and with a fist encased in molten rock. The origin of the stone hand was explained in the web comic \"&lt;a href=\"Blackhand%20%28comic%29\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;\", which depicted the unnamed Blackrock chieftain being enveloped by lava and his fist encased in stone by the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;furies&lt;/a&gt; upon attempting to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. After the battle against the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s was won, the Blackrock orcs took to calling their chieftain \"Blackhand\". Several sources, including &lt;a href=\"Words%20of%20Wind%20and%20Earth\"&gt;Words of Wind and Earth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/19941529\"&gt;shaman artifact reveal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackhand%27s%20Secret\"&gt;Blackhand's Secret&lt;/a&gt; and \"&lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20Armory\"&gt;Azeroth Armory&lt;/a&gt;\", indicated the events of the comic to be canonical for the main universe Blackhand as well, retconning his previous depictions.\nHowever, with the release of ', Blackhand's design was changed to be nearly identical to his appearance in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20%28film%29\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" movie, with a black hand tattoo in place of a stone fist. &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Burns\"&gt;Matt Burns&lt;/a&gt; explained that &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; had ultimately decided to move away from Blackhand's \"Warlords of Draenor\" design and backstory; the main universe Blackhand may still have helped Orgrim retrieve the Doomhammer, but he was not consumed by fire. Notably, Blackhand is the only character whose design from the movie was later adopted by the canon universe, though &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s new appearance in ', is heavily influenced by that of movie Durotan's.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackhand%27s%20Fang\"&gt;Blackhand's Fang&lt;/a&gt;s were throwing axes given by Blackhand to Blackrock orcs.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Blackhand briefly appeared during a cutscene. It was mentioned that &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, Blackhand and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; were three blood brothers, but that &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; eventually manipulated the orc against his former friends.\nBlackhand's antlered helm could be found in the stomach of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; as an easter egg.\nAlternate timelines.\nAlternate appears in the alternate in the past during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackhand%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nEven though the story of Blackhand's hand changed from being transformed into stone to simply being tattooed black, he likely still derived his name from his hand's appearance. If so, the Blackrock chieftain's original name is unknown."}

He could always turn the tide of battle. He could always find the enemy's weakness. When &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s attacked and his clan faced annihilation, he orchestrated a daring last-minute triumph alongside his second-in-command, . On the eve of battle, the chieftain reclaimed a famous weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and restored hope for victory. The elements, chaotic forces of nature that had allowed him to survive the ordeal, encased his fist in dark, heavy stone. He took a name worthy of it: Blackhand.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nBlackhand was the first chieftain to join the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After a &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;mysterious prophet&lt;/a&gt; gave him detailed schematics, Blackhand marshaled the Blackrock clan to industrialize warfare on a colossal scale. A genius tactician not to be underestimated, Blackhand leads ironclad battalions of orcs, ogres, and gronn with terrifying resolve. He himself donned battle armor infused with the powers of flame.\nA power-mad and tactically brilliant weaponmaster, Blackhand has both the ambition to rule and the cruelty to maintain his hold on the conquered. Under his leadership, the bold orcs of the Blackrock clan arm an entire world with the strength of steel. Blackrock slaves labor whip-crack to whip-crack on frightful siege engines\u2014weapons that will inevitably be turned against the slaves\u2019 families, neighbors, and homes.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, he ordered his clan, the Blackrock, to stop the invading forces. Their attempts failed, and the Blackrock Quarry was flooded as a result. Later, he was seen on the same cliff with Grommash Hellscream and the other warlords as Grommash ordered the combined might of the Iron Horde army to head after the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; attackers.\nHe led the siege of with as his second. Not hesitating to murder innocents and villagers, he incurred the ire of Doomhammer. When confronted with his brutal acts, Blackhand swiftly killed him. This act angered who with the help of &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; fought on the Blackrock's flagship. During the fight, Blackhand defeated Durotan and killed Maraad who decided to save Yrel at the expense of his own life. He taunted Durotan and seared him with his hammer, but Yrel distracted the warlord and healed Durotan. With the Frostwolf chieftain's axe, Yrel wounded the Lord of Blackrock clan. Enraged, Blackhand vowed they would all die, but &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; teleported his allies and destroyed the boat with an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20star\"&gt;Iron star&lt;/a&gt; before he could act upon this threat.

While his foundry was under attack for quite some time, earning some spite from Grommash, it was the final attack that sealed his fate. Champions of Azeroth stormed the foundry, killing a large amount of important &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; members and eventually Blackhand himself. His severed arm was brought to Khadgar who confirmed the legends about him and the elements.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Following the battle at the Great Gate, he challenged to , where he was defeated by the human warrior.\nHistory.\nWarcraft.\nBlackhand was made Warchief of the Horde by in Draenor. Commanding the many orcish clans, he passed through to Azeroth with the initial warband. \nBlackhand began to lead raids on the nearby human settlements, taking food and prisoners where possible to fuel the opening of the . Despite this, Blackhand seemed to share the disdain for the one-sided nature of their attacks, wishing to find a worthy foe to fight.\nSuch a foe was found when the orcs ambushed a group of armed humans in . While the orcs killed most of the knights with ease, Blackhand sought combat with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;the human leader&lt;/a&gt;, who had already dispatched a number of orcs. Although quickly overpowering , Blackhand was taken by surprise when the in the human's hand exploded, destroying the orc's hand. When cast a spell killing the fel-corrupted orcs, Blackhand quickly realized the tides of battle had turned, and retreated from the scene.\nOn returning to the orc camp, Blackhand was summoned by Gul'dan, where he was told that, according to tradition, the punishment for his failure was death. Despite the loss of his hand, Blackhand showed no pain, and resignedly submitted himself for this punishment, setting the fire to consume his arm and soon his entire body. However, intervened, severing Blackhand's arm, and arguing that it was not the warchief that was to blame for the failure of the attack, but rather Gul'dan's fel magic. Blackhand would later be equipped with a mighty claw in place of his missing hand, with five huge metal blades in place of fingers.\nBlackhand led the ambush on the Frostwolves' meeting with the humans, where he again met Lothar, but before he was able to resume where he had left off, the two were separated by Medivh's impenetrable wall of lightning. However, he found a prize in Lothar's son, intervening to prevent from killing him. Blackhand killed Lothar's son as his father watched, deliberately using his prosthetic weapon to repay the human for the loss of his hand.\nLater, during the Battle at the Great Gate, Blackhand led the Horde against the human attack, and, when the Horde had the humans surrounded, he began to push his way through, wanting the honor of killing the &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;human king&lt;/a&gt; for himself. However, at Llane's insistance, Garona killed him before Blackhand could reach them.\nAnduin Lothar would then arrive, fighting through the Horde with his griffin, and recovering the King's body. Before Lothar could escape, however, Blackhand caught his griffin by the leg and slammed both it and Lothar to the ground. When Lothar regained consciousness, Blackhand tossed &lt;a href=\"Dragonsword\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt; to him, challenging him to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; to finally settle the score between them. Blackhand charged, but Lothar slid between his legs and slashed his midsection, badly wounding him. Blackhand dropped to his knees, and Lothar stabbed him in the back, killing him and winning the Mak'gora. Lothar's honorable victory earned him the respect of the orcs, who let him leave unharmed, much to Gul'dan's anger.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The airstrip rings with the sounds of hammer on anvil morning through night, though half the time you can barely hear them over the gnomish flying machines taking off. A hydrothermal system underlies the area around the airstrip, which connects it to the geyser fields to the southeast, where the gnomes built the &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Pumping%20Station\"&gt;Fizzcrank Pumping Station&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt; used to make fuel for their flying machines, until the &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s took control of it. Several gnomish &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s are stationed there.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Fullthrottle\"&gt;Fizzcrank Fullthrottle&lt;/a&gt; himself designed and oversaw the building of the airstrip when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces under &lt;a href=\"General%20Arlos\"&gt;General Arlos&lt;/a&gt; arrived during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. The gnome engineers thought it was an ideal location to launch recon flights, and it was also near the crashed &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Talramas\"&gt;Talramas&lt;/a&gt;, so they could scrounge interesting mechanical parts from it.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nTurns out some of the parts weren\u2019t from the necropolis. One day while a crew was siphoning oil off the pump station in the geyser fields, they found a bunch of strange mechanical parts stuck in their pipelines. Since no gnome can turn down a puzzle, they figured out that all those parts belonged together, and they rebuilt them into a robot that looked like a giant gnome. It turned on, called itself &lt;a href=\"Gearmaster%20Mechazod\"&gt;Gearmaster Mechazod&lt;/a&gt;, and claimed to have been built by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. He informed all the gnomes that they were flawed beings, &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s who had been tainted by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, and then kidnaped any gnomes he could find in order to convert them into cyborg monstrosities. Fizzcrank lost several people to being turned into angry little robots before Mechazod got stopped by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe airstrip is also of particular interest to engineers. Most of its missions sent adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Geyser%20Fields\"&gt;Geyser Fields&lt;/a&gt;, where they can suck up gas clouds with their &lt;a href=\"Zapthrottle%20Mote%20Extractor\"&gt;Zapthrottle Mote Extractor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Creature%23Mechanical\"&gt;mechanicals&lt;/a&gt; in that area can be dismantled when defeated in a manner similar to skinning, sometimes yielding engineering components or even, rarely, .\nThe airstrip stayed active even after the Lich King was defeated due to its strategic location.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the airstrip sent a distress signal to &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt; because it had been attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Ironbound\"&gt;Ironbound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. Members of &lt;a href=\"G.E.A.R.\"&gt;G.E.A.R.&lt;/a&gt; arrived here and defeated the invaders."}

She helped guide the G.E.A.R. Commander through &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; to her former workshop in the &lt;a href=\"Engineering%20Labs\"&gt;Engineering Labs&lt;/a&gt; so they could retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Prototype%20Arcane%20Engine\"&gt;Prototype Arcane Engine&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently traveled with G.H.O.S.T., the rest of G.E.A.R., and their &lt;a href=\"First%20Squadron%20Prototype\"&gt;First Squadron Prototype&lt;/a&gt; planes to the &lt;a href=\"Fizzcrank%20Airstrip\"&gt;Fizzcrank Airstrip&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; to defend it from the &lt;a href=\"Ironbound\"&gt;Ironbound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. She tasked the Commander with clearing out the troggs on the ground using one of the bombers' guns. When the G.E.A.R. Commander brought back a &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Communication%20Device\"&gt;communication device&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Krugg%20the%20Smart\"&gt;trogg leader&lt;/a&gt;, Tinkerbow installed it into a &lt;a href=\"Remote%20Conversation%20Visualizer\"&gt;Remote Conversation Visualizer&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the identity of the troggs' master, &lt;a href=\"Telzo%20Sparkspanner\"&gt;Telzo Sparkspanner&lt;/a&gt;.\nTinkerbow managed to track Sparkspanner's signal to the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, but as the rangers entered the mountains with their bombers, the signal tracker started going haywire, forcing them to land. While the Commander cleared out some of the nearby troggs using an &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Assault%20Tank\"&gt;assault tank&lt;/a&gt;, Tinkerbow recalibrated the signal tracker, allowing her and the other rangers to move to the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;Terrace of the Makers&lt;/a&gt;, closer to the signal's source. After Tinkerbow finished installing the guns on the squadron's bombers, Winklespring and the Commander used one of the planes to clear out Sparkspanner's army outside the gates of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; but were forced to head into the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt; and crash-land after one of their wings was hit. Tinkerbow and Autoblast followed closely behind in the other, still intact bomber. Once inside the halls, the members of G.E.A.R. confronted Sparkspanner and his &lt;a href=\"Smasher%20X900\"&gt;giant mech&lt;/a&gt; to confront Sparkspanner and his &lt;a href=\"Smasher%20X900\"&gt;giant mech&lt;/a&gt;, with Tinkerbow and Emaedi Autoblast defending the flanks from waves of troggs (Tinkerbow using her mace and the help of her trusty G.H.O.S.T.) while Winklespring and G.E.A.R.'s Commander battled Sparkspanner head-on and defeated him."}

The ship itself contains goblin and gnome architecture and has several barges roped to the main boat. The structures on the ship are very bizarre and covered in thick, pulsating tubes. Despite its massive engine, it seems to have no means of propulsion.\nRaces at the speedbarge are sponsored by the &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Engineers%27%20Guild%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Mechanical Engineers' Guild of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, of which Pozzik and Fizzle are both members.\nBelow deck, &lt;a href=\"Daisy\"&gt;Daisy&lt;/a&gt; serves drinks in the &lt;a href=\"Speedbarge%20Bar\"&gt;Speedbarge Bar&lt;/a&gt;, where gnome and goblin patrons frequently engage in bar fights, with tension rising between the Horde-friendly goblins and the Gnomeregan-aligned gnomes.\nHistory.\nCataclysm.\nWith the flooding of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; and the loss of the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Brassbolts\"&gt;Fizzle Brassbolts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pozzik\"&gt;Pozzik&lt;/a&gt; moved their racing operations to this floating racetrack. The remnants of the raceway are located on the \"lake bed\" beneath the ship.\nThe barge itself is a major quest hub in Thousand Needles designed for both Horde and Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. It used to come under attack by a splinter group of &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Pirates\"&gt;Southsea Pirates&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; Admiral &lt;a href=\"Tony%20Two-Tusk\"&gt;Tony Two-Tusk&lt;/a&gt; through cannonfire and blockades.\nTraveler.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, however, even Tony Two-Tusk has begun partaking in the &lt;a href=\"Annual%20Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge%20Boat%20Race\"&gt;annual speed boat racing&lt;/a&gt; sponsored by &lt;a href=\"Mechanical%20Engineers%27%20Guild%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;MEGA&lt;/a&gt;.\nPerhaps it was the fact that they had already been working beside each other for so long that none of them is willing to cause bloodshed against each other despite joining factions at war with one another. Nevertheless, this is the only joint project between members of the Alliance and the Horde that is not overseen or enforced by a neutral third party, or with the two factions joining a third faction to work toward some overall greater good.\nLater, &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and their friends arrived here and participated in that year's annual boat race."}

Most of the players in this encounter do not use their regular class abilities, but instead use vehicles (similar to drakes in &lt;a href=\"Malygos%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Malygos'&lt;/a&gt; third phase). The rest of Ulduar is not accessible until this boss is destroyed.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventure%20Guide\"&gt;Adventure Guide&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"This massive armored tank guards the courtyard entrance in Ulduar. The watcher &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; constructed the Flame Leviathan as part of his V0-L7R-0N weapons platform.\nOverview.\nThe Flame Leviathan will target and pursue after random Siege Vehicles and quickly destroy any vehicle that it catches! Use the Vehicles supplied by the Explorer's League to avoid and ensare the Flame Leviathan.\nAbilities.\nHard Mode.\nTalking to Lore Keeper of Norgannon at the Expedition Camp will activate the Keeper's Towers. Any Tower that remains active when Flame Leviathan is engaged will enable additional abilities.\nTrash info.\nBetween the Expedition Base Camp and the area Flame Leviathan is staging there is a large number of trash mobs and structures. Many of the structures start spawning Steelforge Defenders when a player comes within range until they are destroyed. Destroying certain structures (most notably the Hard-Mode towers) sometimes spawns additional enemies which may attack from behind.\nSteelforge Defender - 8,316 HP\nRuneforged Sentry - 269,620 HP (heroic)\nUlduar Colossus - 315,000 HP\nMechanostriker 54-A 50,400 HP (normal) - 151,200 HP (heroic)\nMechagnome Battletank 1,575,000 HP (normal) - 5,040,000 HP (heroic)\nStarting the event.\nThe encounter is started by either talking to the &lt;a href=\"Lore%20Keeper%20of%20Norgannon%20%28Ulduar%29\"&gt;Lore Keeper of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. When talking to Brann, all Defense Towers are inactive and hard mode cannot be invoked. After talking to the Keeper, all four towers are active which is the most difficult form of hard mode. The towers can be individually switched off by destroying them. If all four are destroyed, the encounter is equivalent to normal mode. More loot is gained if more towers are up when the Flame Leviathan is defeated. The extra hard mode loot is gained only with all four towers up.\nHard mode.\nEach tower not destroyed increases Flame Leviathan's health by 40% (multiplicative).\nAdditionally each tower has an individual ability which is activated shortly after the fight starts in addition to buffs and debuffs per individual tower:\nStrategy.\nNormal Mode.\nAfter the last row of Storm Beacons there is a row of normal pillars. Beyond this is a roughly square room clear of all obstacles which contains a group of mobs guarding a gate. After this group is killed, the gate opens and Flame Leviathan enters. It is a good idea to kill the mobs from range, so that player vehicles are in a safe distance from Flame Leviathan when it enters.\nWhile mobile, the boss always targets one Siege Engine or Demolisher and tries to ram it (which causes very high damage if successful). The targeted player must kite the boss, preferably using one of the speed boost abilities. The normal kite path is a wide circle along the outer edges of the area. Every 30 seconds, the boss switches to a different target, it also switches when its current target is destroyed.\nRoles by vehicle type:\nFlame Leviathan is a very easy fight in normal mode. It is doable without the need to stun the boss (which will be explained in the next section). There is also no role / class requirement of the players and the gear requirement of the players is not strict. Therefore, it is possible to &lt;a href=\"pug\"&gt;pug&lt;/a&gt; it.\nNormal Mode Pyrite Strategy.\nThe simplest way to defeat Flame Leviathan (and most common in ten-man pugs) is to spam him with Pyrite barrels. Before pulling the last group of trash in front of the gate, the raid should sit at the entrance to the courtyard while Demolisher and Siege Engine gunners shoot down as much Pyrite as they can. After about a minute the area should be littered with enough barrels that Demolishers can attack solely with Pyrite without having to worry about running out of ammunition. Demolisher gunners should concentrate on keeping Pyrite stocks up, Choppers and Siege Engines should attack the boss as usual.\nDrivers will still have to be aware if they are being targeted and run away as necessary, but as Flame Leviathan will only last around a minute in normal mode under sustained Pyrite fire, he won't have time to change targets more than once.\nHard Mode.\nWith towers up, the encounter gets increasingly difficult. To beat it, two additional elements compared to normal mode need to be considered: Shutdown and Pyrite. The fight can be simplified by just using Pyrite, but (depending on gear) it may be neccessary to use Shutdown, and then a rather complex choreography needs to take place.\nPyrite.\nDemolisher drivers can shoot pyrite. This causes a stacking DoT on Flame Leviathan, which at 10 stacks deals about 100-150k damage per tick. In hard mode, all other sources of damage can be ignored, as long as the Demolishers keep the pyrite stacks rolling. To make this possible, the Demolisher gunners must supply their drivers with pyrite. They must shoot it from the sky, and collect it with Grab Crate. The drivers must move so that they are close to pyrite on the ground.\nShutdown.\nDemolisher gunners can load themselves into the Demolisher's main catapult. The driver can then launch them so that they land on top of Flame Leviathan, near one of the . There are 2 turrets in 10-player mode, 4 in 25-player.\nOnce the launched player lands atop the Leviathan he will be unable to move and will only be able to melee the turret closest to him. Ranged classes can reach all turrets, so ranged DPS classes are almost always the ones thrown. The turrets will defend themselves with a flame attack, which while not powerful can be problematic. Having a ranged DPS class that can also heal (such as an Elemental Shaman or Moonkin Druid) can help.\nThe players may eject at any time to be parachuted the ground, although doing so before the Leviathan shuts down is often fatal due to the Leviathan's constant AoE. Players can then jump back into vehicles. Motorcycles, with their sidecars empty, can easily pick up former gunners and ferry them back to their Demolisher seat.\nAfter all turrets are destroyed,and Flame Leviathan goes into an 8 second shutdown, during which it stops moving or dealing damage, uses no abilities, takes 50% more damage and resets the Gather Speed buff stack.\nShutdown is a highly desirable state, but shooting a Demolisher gunner means he no longer gathers pyrite for that Demolisher. A Demolisher can store enough pyrite for 10 shots. If the driver is conservative and shoots only once every 9 seconds just so the debuff stays up, the stock lasts a minute and more, which is in theory ample time for the gunner to destroy the turrets and resume collecting pyrite. In practise, drivers like to have a twitchy trigger finger, and collecting pyrite requires manoeuvering, so it may in effect take longer and the pyrite stack goes down.\nDouble-man Demolisher Guns.\nAnother idea is to assign two gunners to some demolishers. Prior to pulling the boss, one player can preload in the demolisher gun, and a second player can man the gun. In that state, the preloaded player can be launched, while the demolisher retains a gunner to keep up the pyrite supply. After the first shutdown is over, the second player can load himself, and he can be launched as soon as shutdown is over, even before the first player is brought back to the demolisher.\nIn 10 player, one chopper is not used, and that player is used as second gunner in one demolisher.\nIn 25 player, various combinations are possible. If two damage dealers are enough to bring all turrets down fast enough, two choppers can be abandoned and two demolishers get a second gunner. If three damage dealers are needed, one chopper and one Siege Engine are left empty.\nBugs.\nTargeting Demolishers.\nThe Flame Leviathan on live servers targets Demolishers as well as Siege Engines. On PTR builds, it only targeted Siege Engines. This was thought to be a bug, but was confirmed to be working as intended.\nChanging seats.\nCurrently (2009-06-26) drivers of Demolishers can no longer change seats to either hook their own Pyrite or use the Speed Boost. Upon changing seats (via clicking the open space or change seat key binding), the Demolisher sometimes despawns and the player then dies from Flame Leviathan's AoE effects. \nGoing through the barrier.\nIt has been reported that if somebody in the raid group pulls the Flame Leviathan while others are left behind the barrier, the boss may go through the barrier and be killed outside anywhere in the instance. After going through the barrier it may attack empty vehicles and players entering the instance while not in combat. Be advised though, that this is considered an exploit and a bannable offense.\nThis may have been repaired through an undocumented fix as the Flame Leviathan will now reset several seconds after being pulled through the barrier that prevents players from leaving/entering the battle zone. The fix may have been to prevent this glitch and to provide a soft reset for this boss should a vehicle be accidentally left behind the barrier.\nLoot.\n10 man Rewards.\nLeaving towers up for hard mode rewards progressively better loot.\n25 man Rewards.\nLeaving towers up for hard mode rewards progressively better loot. Flame Leviathan also has a standard Heroic Ulduar Boss chance of dropping a runed orb, a crafting recipe, and a &lt;a href=\"Fragment%20of%20Val%27anyr\"&gt;Fragment of Val'anyr&lt;/a&gt;. It has been confirmed that you can have multiple recipes and runed orbs.\nSalvage.\nEngineers with skill 415 or higher can salvage parts from Flame Leviathan.\nItems reported salvaged:\n\"The amount and type of salvage obtained at various difficulty levels is uncertain. You can help collecting data. See the \nQuotes.\nGreat job with that metal monstrosity. There appears to be only a few more obstacles in our way.\nOnce you clear out that clanking robot at the end of the hall, we'll be inside Ulduar.\nWe also noticed an enormous, fire-breathing protodrake and a molten giant.

Ascension of a kyrian atop the crest is the final stage of a journey which can last eons as they train and meditate to become ready for the honor. Ascended kyrian carry out Bastion's most sacred duties, including the ferrying of souls to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; for judgment, and thus the crest is one of the most important tools for the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt;'s followers.\nHistory.\nLong used to elevate &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; aspirants to the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"ascended\"&gt;ascended&lt;/a&gt;, the Crest of Ascension became extremely important at the time of a great &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; drought in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; rebellion. Unlike the kyrian of &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsworn required no crest or trials to ascend their recruits and their numbers quickly grew as a result. In the face of this threat, the &lt;a href=\"Archon\"&gt;Archon&lt;/a&gt; decided that remaining anima stores should be used to immediately ascend available candidates that had completed their trials.\nDuring the ceremony at the Crest of Ascension with the Archon and Paragons in attendance, several aspirants achieved ascension atop the crest as planned. However, after the ascension of &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;, the Paragon of Loyalty &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; suddenly interrupted the proceedings. Striking directly at the Crest, the Paragon shattered it utterly before rounding on her gathered brethren. Devos revealed herself to be the leader of the Forsworn and gave the signal for a large assault to begin on Elysian Hold and the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Spires of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually be defeated.\nWith the Crest ruined, the kyrian were rendered unable to create any more ascended, making them extremely vulnerable to the growing ranks of the Forsworn, as was Devos's intent. Thus the &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt; Forgelite Prime known as &lt;a href=\"Mikanikos\"&gt;Mikanikos&lt;/a&gt; was charged with building a new Crest of Ascension, which could also be empowered to create stronger ascended than ever before. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal allies&lt;/a&gt; of the kyrian, Mikanikos would recover the necessary materials and tools from the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Forge\"&gt;Eternal Forge&lt;/a&gt;, especially the custom-built &lt;a href=\"centurion\"&gt;centurion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bron%20%28goliath%29\"&gt;Bron&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Crest itself rebuilt physically, powerful items from the other realms of the Shadowlands were then sought to empower it (and thus future ascended kyrian).

Though the Horde fleet was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance fleet was supported by &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s, who had learned new tactics for dealing with the dragons during the war. &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;'s ship, and a few other vessels survived intact, but most of the Horde fleet was sunk by Daelin's superior forces, and the dragon riders scattered in all directions. Though Proudmoore succeeded in destroying the Horde's navy, his own ships were decimated by the dragons and many sailors died, including Daelin's own son &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAlmost thirty years after the Second War the island was still deserted and littered with remains of the war. Ruined orcish bases could still be found throughout the isle while shipwrecks and other remains were scattered on the coast and nearby islets, such as a wrecked orcish &lt;a href=\"oil%20rig\"&gt;oil rig&lt;/a&gt; and even the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"giant%20turtle\"&gt;giant turtle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"submarine\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fought to control Crestfall as &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; appeared on the shores.

Known thornweavers come from &lt;a href=\"Bristleback%20tribe\"&gt;Bristleback&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20tribe\"&gt;Razorfen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Briarback%20tribe\"&gt;Briarback&lt;/a&gt; tribes.\nMost of the thorn dome of the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; was weaved by &lt;a href=\"Charlga%20Razorflank\"&gt;Charlga Razorflank&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThornweavers are a &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; variant. While primitive, quilboar have a rich spiritual tradition. Their shaman, sometimes called thornweavers, are valued members of the tribe; indeed, shaman are often their leaders. Quilboar respect their shaman, and in turn the shaman aid them in war.\nWhile quilboar thornweavers enjoy using their spells to decimate their enemies, they know that the actual slaying should fall to the tribe's warriors. Thus, thornweavers support their allies with healing magic and by summoning allies. They have a particular fondness for wild &lt;a href=\"boars\"&gt;boars&lt;/a&gt;. All quilboar honor the ferocity of boars, and the animal is their race's totem creature.\nWhen a thornweaver sees his comrades fall it inspires the thornweaver to greatness, as it does with all quilboar; in addition, the departing ally's spirit briefly infuses him with power. Thornweavers can summon &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dire%20boar\"&gt;dire boar&lt;/a&gt;s, and similar animals. Thornweavers can become a ghost boar rather than a ghost wolf. The thornweaver can also channel his magical and spiritual power to increase his strength and ferocity, calling upon the power of the quilboar's creator, the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThornweavers call upon vengeful spirits of nature, eschewing the peaceful spirits and the gentle side of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; that most &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; revere. The &lt;a href=\"Racial%20iconic%20class\"&gt;iconic&lt;/a&gt; quilboar thornweaver strides forward with his tribe members, clutching a flail. He plants totems in their midst and summons spirit pigs to aid them, then charges into melee with a fearsome grunt-squeal."}
