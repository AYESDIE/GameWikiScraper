{"id": "13975", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13975", "title": "Instance", "text": "Major hostile areas like dungeons, keeps, and other confined areas can have sub-areas called instances (aka instance(d) dungeons). These instances are special areas in the World of Warcraft where your group or raid party is able to interact with a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; privately; that is, without interference from other &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;parties&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s. It is also a respite from the global &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; environment on a PvP server. The term \"instance\" is often conflated and interchanged with the term \"&lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nInstance dungeons tend to feature the most difficult and rewarding content, both in terms of enemies and items, but also in terms of level design. Most mobs inside the instance are &lt;a href=\"Elite%20creature\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of some mobs, and perform well above their level. Instances usually feature multiple &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es, all with special abilities and immunities. Getting through an instance normally requires a well-trained and well-balanced group of players who are of an appropriate level for the challenge.\nLower level instances can be soloed by a higher level character. While an interesting challenge, the drops will not be particularly useful anymore (except to sell or trade to low-level players with enough gold).\nFarming for gear.\nInstances are often farmed for gear by having a high level character take a low level character through the instance; either a friend or for a fee. Boss drops typically &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt;, so the lowbie has to be present.\nThe lower character is going to get a lot of &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; in the instance. If building a &lt;a href=\"twink\"&gt;twink&lt;/a&gt; you will need to plan for this; start farming as soon as you are able and be selective which instances you farm. XP is not your friend (twinks); you want \"as little\" as possible so that you can continue to farm without &lt;a href=\"ding\"&gt;ding&lt;/a&gt;ing past your goal level. You should focus on specific gear and bypass kills you don't need. Note, however, that this is less of an issue since patch 3.2 and the ability to turn off experience completely. Whereas formerly creating a twink took careful planning of gear attainment and experience gain, the main limiting factor now is initial experience gain to the desired level.\nGame mechanics.\nBecause instances are in effect separate from the actual main World of Warcraft maps such as Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Outland, and Northrend, much like the Battlegrounds, players too are literally moved from one part of the map to an artificial creation of the main map sections. However, this is not to suggest that Blizzard did not go to the effort of re-creating instance geography and terrain within the main maps. Areas like &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; are fully constructed within Tanaris though it is impossible for players to enter this area without any way to climb or fly over the hills. This is a rarity since in order to save processing power and make the world smoother to run without rendering useless features that no one would ever see, Blizzard creates a \"false\" portrayal of the instances such as &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; where only what the player sees is worth rendering. Another difference worth noting is that within instances, the corpses of boss characters will remain intact for 1 hour to ensure that players do not miss out on loot.\nInstance locks.\nOnce you kill a boss in a heroic dungeon or raid, you receive an instance lock with respect to that boss. While the instance lock is in place, you can't enter any copy of the instance in which the boss is alive, nor can you queue for it in the Dungeon Finder. If you reset the instance by entering it alone, the new copy will be missing the defeated boss. Instance locks reset at 4:00 server time every morning for heroics and every Tuesday morning for raids.\nRandom heroics are exempt from instance locks; if you receive a dungeon that you are saved to as a random, you can enter it as though you weren't saved. However, random heroics do create instance locks. What this means is that in one day, you can clear a heroic dungeon first as a specific (or by traveling to it without the Dungeon Finder) and then as a random, but not vice-versa.\nLimits.\nA player can only enter ten \"individual\" instances in one hour. This even applies to the same instance when a player uses the &lt;a href=\"Instance%20reset\"&gt;Instance reset&lt;/a&gt; ten times within an hour, because each reset is considered by the game to be a different instance. This applies to all characters on an account, as logging into a different character and trying to enter an instance brings the same message. The intention is to limit, but not stop, instance &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt;. You can, however, still queue for random instances in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; while under this limit, and if you cannot enter the instance you found due to the instance limit you will not be given a &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Deserter\"&gt;Deserter&lt;/a&gt; debuff if you leave the group.\nThis does not apply to simply walking into or out of an instance. A player may enter or exit the same instance as many times as they like or need as they play through provided they do not reset it.\nHosting.\nInstances are hosted on realm servers. For purposes, an instance's server will often be that of a realm that isn't home to anyone in the group, as indicated by the server time zone. If too many members of a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; have high latency, resetting the instance may help by moving it to a different server.\nThe fact that a limited number of instances could run at a given time on a server caused the following error in 2009: This much-maligned error message was frequently seen by players on &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;s during peak instance usage and prevented characters from entering an instance. This instance cap was implemented by &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard to address problems seen when the number of instances active grew too large and started affecting the experience of players already inside instances.\nThis issue was largely fixed with the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, released in December 2009.\nBehind the entrance.\nThe overworld includes a small area behind the instance entrance. For some 5-player dungeons, such as the ones in Icecrown Citadel, this is a copy of the first hallway except that it dead-ends after the first turn (if one pays attention, nearly all instances have a turn or obstruction near the instance for this reason). Crossing the instance entrance (even with an ability such as &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;) automatically \"attempts\" to transfer you to the instance, but the attempt can fail -- placing you in this area -- in the following situations:\nFaction specific instances.\n&lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese are instances located in the capital city for each faction (&lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;), and as such it used to be very difficult for opposite faction characters to get to the entrance at an instance-appropriate level (about level 15 for Ragefire Chasm and level 25 for Stormwind Stockade) without the help of other max level characters. However, if they get there, they can enter through the portal. Since &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt; appropriate level characters can use the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; feature to gain access to these dungeons, regardless of faction.\nThere is an &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Classic%20Dungeonmaster\"&gt;Classic Dungeonmaster&lt;/a&gt; which requires doing both of these. Unless the character used the opportunity to complete them at the appropriate level through the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, this would typically be done at near max level or with the help of others at max level. While the instance will be trivial, getting in will not be. A group of max level characters can race past the guards. Fighting your way in is an option, but you are then essentially raiding the opposing capital, so be prepared. Rogues or druids can stealth in; and there are summoning stones near the entrance, so a small stealthed group can summon others. However, with the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\", flying was introduced to &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with an &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;additional license&lt;/a&gt; which makes these dungeons easier to reach while also avoiding majority of the guards. Since patch &lt;a href=\"7.3.5\"&gt;7.3.5&lt;/a&gt;, flying in Eastern Kingdoms or Kalimdor is no longer required to buy the additional license.\nSee also other &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Raids%20achievements\"&gt;Dungeons &amp; Raids achievements&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIntroduced with patch &lt;a href=\"8.1.0\"&gt;8.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, Battle of Dazar'alor is the first raid to be more faction specific when it comes to the encounters."}

The ID of any instance to which a player is saved can be extended. Doing so will extend the lockout period by the same amount of time as the original lockout (i.e. extending an &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; raid ID will add 7 days, a Heroic: &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt; dungeon ID will add 24 hours, and a &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; raid ID will add 3 days to the lockout time). An ID can be extended more than once.

The term comes from one of the first of such quests created: &lt;a href=\"Attunement%20to%20the%20Core\"&gt;Attunement to the Core&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the endgame instances originally required you to complete a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; or obtain a certain &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; to enter. This strategy has largely been phased out, although some instances (particularly select &lt;a href=\"mythic\"&gt;mythic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s) still require attunement.\nDungeons.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nContinuing with \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\"'s theme, \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" introduced two Mythic difficulty only dungeons that require personal attunements to access. The attunement requirements are different per faction. &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.1.0\"&gt;Patch 8.1.0&lt;/a&gt; introduced Heroic modes for these dungeons that do not require an attunement to access. The attunements were removed in a hotfix shortly after the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%208.1.0\"&gt;patch 8.1.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion returned the concept of personal attunements to three Mythic-only dungeons in the form of lengthy quest-chains. &lt;a href=\"Patch%207.2.0\"&gt;Patch 7.2.0&lt;/a&gt; introduced Heroic modes for these dungeons that do not require an attunement to access. These attunements were removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.0\"&gt;patch 7.3.0&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeroic mode keys.\nPreviously, to enter the &lt;a href=\"heroic%20mode\"&gt;heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; version of an &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; instance you must have earned reputation status with a specific faction related to that instance. Once status is obtained, the keys can simply be purchased from that faction's &lt;a href=\"quartermaster\"&gt;quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;. The currently available instances and their respective factions are listed below. Please note that all party members must have a key to enter the instance in heroic mode.\nRaids.\nThere are presently no raid instances that require an attunement in \"World of Warcraft\". However, many former raids previously required an attunement to enter.\nExcept for &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, all raid members originally needed to become attuned to enter the following raid instances. Both Molten Core and previously Blackwing Lair provide attunement quests that allow the player to quickly travel to the raid entrance, but these are \"not\" required to enter the instances themselves.\nBoss attunements.\nCertain raid and dungeon bosses could also be unlocked through certain player actions. For example, the last two bosses of &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; would only be accessible if at least seven raiders achieved reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;, obtained a specific item from the Waterlords, and brought it with them to the raid. As future expansions are released, prior-expansion bosses are generally unlocked by default and are accessible regardless of party makeup.\nApril Fool's.\nFor April Fool's 2007, Blizzard released a &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple%20attunement%20%28April%20Fools%29\"&gt;joke attunement&lt;/a&gt; page listing all of the impossible tasks that needed to be accomplished in order to enter the Black Temple. This was a reference to a popular &lt;a href=\"Instance%20attunement%20%28Burning%20Crusade%29%23Charts\"&gt;chart&lt;/a&gt; at the time listing all of the attunement requirements for and how they funneled into attuning to Mount Hyjal, making it appear that simply attuning to the raid was a monumental task made up of every attunement in the expansion."}

{"id": "13513", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13513", "title": "Instance grouping guide", "text": "Running &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s with a group of two to five players (or even more in a &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;Raid&lt;/a&gt; group) is one of the three major ways to spend time in \"World of Warcraft\" (the other two being &lt;a href=\"solo\"&gt;solo&lt;/a&gt; play and &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;). The key to successful group &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt; is working together as a team, the first and most important hurdle being good &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; management. A group with a bad mixture of classes but with good teamplay always outperforms a group with a perfect mix of classes but doesn't properly work together.\nMain Group Roles.\nThe most important aspect of group play is that all group members know without doubt which of the three following roles they play, and put this primary function above everything else. Confusing these roles leads to disaster \u2014 a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;) who believes that they're &lt;a href=\"damage%20dealer\"&gt;damage dealer&lt;/a&gt;s are immediate causes for wipes. Similarly, the damage dealers must be clearly aware that they're not tanks, and thus avoid getting aggro by all means.\nTank.\nThe tank is the group member who should take all the damage. Tanks don't deal (much) damage themselves, their job is to gain and hold &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; on all &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s (aka enemies), and make sure nobody else is hit. A tank's primary task is to ensure survival of the healer. A &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; may have a &lt;a href=\"main%20tank\"&gt;main tank&lt;/a&gt; (who holds the boss) and one or two &lt;a href=\"off-tank\"&gt;off-tank&lt;/a&gt;s (who hold adds), or it may have two tanks who take turns pulling the boss off each other.\nThe talent specializations for tanking are the protection warrior, protection paladin, blood death knight, guardian druid, and brewmaster monk.\nHealer.\n&lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt;s do no damage at all \u2014 the exception being Discipline priests with their &lt;a href=\"Atonement\"&gt;Atonement&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 even if this means they have nearly nothing to do at all on some pulls. They save their mana to keep the tank and everybody else alive. Healers can die from their heals drawing aggro. When they have drawn more aggro than the tank, they have to stop healing everybody else except the tank. If the healer still dies, then the tank is either not geared enough to hold aggro or must do a better job at holding it. \nHoly priests, discipline priests, holy paladins, restoration druids, restoration shamans and mistweaver monks are all equally capable healers. At the raid level, each has particular strengths and weaknesses. For example, holy paladins are exceptionally good at tank healing while druids are better at raid healing. In 5-mans, any healer can do the job.\nDamage Dealer (aka DPS).\nEvery class has the ability, given appropriate talent points and gear, to deal significant damage. Without sufficient damage from the group, it is likely that the healer's mana will run out or progress through the location is too slow to be practical, whether for &lt;a href=\"Respawn\"&gt;Respawn&lt;/a&gt; or other reasons. A good damage dealer knows how to kill mobs without drawing aggro, a bad damage dealer doesn't and dies. The central and most important rule for damage dealers is \"dead = 0 &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;\". If a damage dealer dies, it's not the healer's fault, nor the tank's, but always the damage dealers own (assuming a normal &lt;a href=\"Threat\"&gt;Threat&lt;/a&gt; Table). Watching a threat meter is critical \u2014 if a DPS gets too close to the tank, they should cease DPS and &lt;a href=\"bandage\"&gt;bandage&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to the aforementioned it should be noted that for melee classes &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, etc. it is best practice to always deal your damage from behind the target unless you are the main tank, so that your attacks will not be parried.\nSecondary Roles.\nAfter the above three functions are well understood and practiced, proper understanding and handling the following functions further increases the party's efficiency:\nOther Roles.\nThe following functions designations are either obsolete or used only very rarely:\nGroup Combat in Detail.\nWhen clearing an instance, combats are usually followed by short times out of combat. Each combat can be broken down into a sequence of phases:\nIt's very important that all group members strictly follow this sequence. Looting for example belongs to the \"Aftermath\" step, and should never be done during the combat. Another common error is to start dealing damage too soon.\nPreparation.\nThe following really only applies to raids, and perhaps to the very hardest instances like &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;. At any other level, a decently-geared tank can easily hold aggro on a whole pack without much need for crowd control. \nIn this step, the tactic for the upcoming fight is discussed, and if the pull consists of more than one mob, a kill and CC order is determined and the mob are marked appropriately with the &lt;a href=\"target%20marker\"&gt;target marker&lt;/a&gt;s. It's a good idea to mark all mobs in advance, including a few extra mobs which might come as &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s, just to be prepared. The players must agree on a order in which the mobs are going to be killed. A widely used \"standard\" sequence is to kill the Skull ) first, followed by the cross ). The moon , star , and the square are frequently used for a CC target, usually meaning a Mage's Polymorph, Rogue's Sap, or Hunter's Freezing Trap respectively.\nGenerally, healer mobs are killed first followed by caster mobs and everything else last. The reasoning for this is that enemy healers prolong the fight and casters usually do high amounts of damage (Some may be Warlock or Necromancer type mobs that summon minions), while both are usually relatively easy to kill. In some cases if a mob has disruptive abilities like wide range AoEs or fear, they may take higher than normal priority.\nIf there are too many mobs to mark them all, or if the group just feels lazy, it is a good idea to designate a &lt;a href=\"Main%20Assist\"&gt;Main Assist&lt;/a&gt; (MA). The MA should be damage dealer with no other responsibilities (like CC). Party members should not pick their own targets, but rather always assist the MA. The &lt;a href=\"Most%20used%20macros%23Assist%20Main%20Tank.2FMain%20Assist\"&gt;Assist Main Tank/Main Assist&lt;/a&gt; macro/mod makes assisting very quick and easy.\nAnother method is to mark just the mob which is due to be killed (usually with Skull) \"on the fly\". Whenever the current target is dead, the group leader marks the next mob to killed, and the damage dealers just follow the Skull. It's also possible to use two marks (skull and cross), and alternate between them - after skull is dead, nuke cross, and then skull again.\nCrowd Control and Kiting.\nCC can sometimes make the difference between success and failure, On the other hand are some cases where it's used out of habit, but is not really needed and just slows things down. Use CC sparingly, but don't hesitate to use it when really needed. The group leader needs to know the CC skills present in the party, and should reserve a few raid icons for each ability. All party members must know that CC is going to be used, and be very careful not to accidentally break it. Players tasked with CC'ing a mob must keep a watchful eye, and re-apply it if it breaks for any reason.\n&lt;a href=\"Kite\"&gt;Kiting&lt;/a&gt; is a special form of crowd control. In some situations, a group may lack the proper form of CC to master a certain pull. In these cases, it's possible to designate one group member as kiter, and thus get the mob neutralized.\nSome players consider fear effects to be a form of CC too. Theoretically, fear has a similar effect as CC - particularly Warlocks can keep a mob eternally feared, so that it's effectively out of combat. The problem with fear though is that feared mobs tend to bring &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s into the fight. Therefore Fear should not normally be used as CC measure, but instead only in special situations (where adds are impossible), or as a last resort.\nThe Pull.\nEvery group should have one designated puller. He should try to pull one &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; cluster at a time without &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;ing more mobs than absolutely necessary, and pull clusters in a logical fashion. The most common mistakes novice players make when pulling are:\nThe puller is virtually always the tank. On exceptionally difficult pulls, hunters and rogues can help with their &lt;a href=\"Misdirect\"&gt;Misdirect&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tricks%20of%20the%20Trade\"&gt;Tricks of the Trade&lt;/a&gt; abilities.\nAggro building.\nAfter the pull, it is imperative that the group does not immediately start blasting away with all available means. Give the tank enough time to build solid aggro on the mobs. Beyond protecting the party immediately, most tanks \"need\" to take damage in order to be able to build &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;. Druid and Warrior tanks gain rage from taking damage, and Paladin tanks get aggro from damage through their reflective abilities (&lt;a href=\"Retribution%20Aura\"&gt;Retribution Aura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shield%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Holy Shield (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Sanctuary%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Blessing of Sanctuary (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;). It generally not a good idea to put damage reducing buffs (like ) on tanks at the beginning of a battle. The only exception to this is Death Knight tanks, as all they need to build &lt;a href=\"Runic%20Power\"&gt;Runic Power&lt;/a&gt; is use special abilities. However, it is still advised to wait a few seconds to allow the tank to aggro lock the mobs. \nDon't shoot, don't backstab, and don't heal any more than absolutely necessary. Instead, concentrate on crowd control and watch for the tank to generate threat. Feel free to sheep, sap and shackle, but stick to some plan. Learn to recognize the &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt; debuff of &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s on the mob, the &lt;a href=\"Mangle\"&gt;Mangle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swipe\"&gt;Swipe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maul\"&gt;Maul&lt;/a&gt; motions of &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, the distinctive &lt;a href=\"Judgement%20of%20Righteousness\"&gt;Judgement of Righteousness&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Consecrate\"&gt;Consecrate&lt;/a&gt; animations for &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Death%20and%20Decay%20%28death%20knight%29\"&gt;Death and Decay&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pestilence%20%28Wrath%20Classic%29\"&gt;Pestilence (Wrath Classic)&lt;/a&gt; animations for Death Knights. \n&lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt; can also use this early in the pull. It heals and damages everything in range while causing no threat, but pay attention not to accidentally break CC. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shield\"&gt;Earth Shield&lt;/a&gt; are very good on the tank, because they do not place threat on the healer, but rather on the tank.\n&lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hunters\"&gt;Hunters&lt;/a&gt;, turn off auto-cast of torment and growl on your &lt;a href=\"Pet\"&gt;Pet&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Voidwalker%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; or just set them to passive, since their abilities draw mobs away from the tank and prevent him or her from being able to build aggro. It would sound like having aggro would be good on your pet, as long as it's not on a &lt;a href=\"squishy\"&gt;squishy&lt;/a&gt;, but it will hurt the tank's rage or mana generation and the healer needs to mostly be watching the tank.\nThe Battle.\nBattles in an instance should be precise and controlled. Novice players often behave the same way in an instance that they would when soloing. They separate and attempt to fight individual skirmishes. This defeats the entire point of grouping, and virtually guarantees a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt;. Instances are designed to be almost impossible for a single player, so your group must try to act as a single entity. \nThe most common mistakes novice players make during battle are:\nIn many fights (boss fights in particular), there is usually more to watch out for than simply tank and spank the mobs. Make sure you aren't making life harder in battle by standing in range of an &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; attack when you're a long ranged attacker, or standing in places that may get you attacked by patrols or other nearby mobs. On the same note, watch out for mobs that can fling you away, into the air. They'll run at you and you'll go flying \u2013 make sure this doesn't send you toward another group of mobs or maybe worse, off the edge of a cliff. When possible, fight these mobs with your back to a wall.\nPost Battle.\nFirst of all the group needs to stay together post-battle. One easy mistake is that the next mobs are pulled too early before the casters have regained enough &lt;a href=\"Mana\"&gt;Mana&lt;/a&gt;. The most common mistakes novice players make post-battle are:\nRemember: It's as much the Leader's job to check everyone is ready, as it is your own. You can help by making sure you communicate in plenty of time if you are ready or not; equally the Main Tank should check to see if the group is ready for the next encounter.\nDying and Wipe prevention.\nWhen a group member dies or is about to die, it often means the rest of the group will follow soon after. If it is the tank dying, the mobs will scatter and quickly kill the healer or damage dealer who is the next on their threat list. Party members should be willing to do almost anything in their power to prevent a full wipe, or speed up the party's recovery.\nYou are dying (Don't Panic!).\nYou've only got a little health left. There's a monster beating on you or a spell flying at you and your cloth or leather garments aren't doing you any good.\nDo not run away! Running away does nothing to help you. The &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s will follow you all the way to the instance entrance. When running, you can't block, dodge and parry and you will be dazed. You might even aggro more mobs, almost assuring a wipe. If you move at all, move within taunt range of the tank and then \"stop\".\nDo let the rest of the party know that you have aggro. The healer and tank may not have noticed. The /helpme and /healme macros are tacky, but they are designed to get attention. The tank has ways to pull all mobs onto him, and the &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt; will usually have a fast heal or some kind of shield to help you out.\nIf death is inevitable, try to find a place clear of mobs to make &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ing you easier. Don't release on death. This helps the party find your body and lets you share any loot.\nThe tank is dying (Emergency Tanking).\nThis scenario is quite a bit different from a damage dealer dying. It's worse than the healer dying if there is not another healer prepared to take over. When the tank dies, aggro will usually go to more fragile members of the party.\nThe most able members to save the party are those who can both \"get aggro immediately\", and survive high damage. This primarily means any &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s left in the party. They should use their &lt;a href=\"Taunt\"&gt;Taunt&lt;/a&gt; abilities as fast as possible and start building threat. If no one is geared as an ordinary tank, any &lt;a href=\"Tank%23Secondary%20Tank%20Classes\"&gt;secondary tanks&lt;/a&gt; should try to tank an individual mob if they can get its attention.\nEveryone is dying (Wipe recovery).\nIf a wipe is about to happen, the party should concentrate on keeping someone alive who can &lt;a href=\"Resurrect\"&gt;Resurrect&lt;/a&gt;. The leader should make the decision that a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; is inevitable and announce this to the rest of the party. They should then use any abilities they have to put someone who can resurrect, and then themselves, out of combat. The &lt;a href=\"Wipe%20recovery\"&gt;Wipe recovery&lt;/a&gt; article has a large list of ways to do this.\nThis also applies as early as the pull; if the pull has gone bad, the healer and anyone else not yet in combat should run back to a safe place and watch the others die.\nSome abilities allow a party member to return during battle. Don't use self-resurrection abilities while the combat is still going on, unless you died in a very precarious position and there is still a good chance to survive.\nAfter the wipe.\nIf the group wipes, this usually means that:\nTry to be patient with your group, understand that some of them might be even bigger noobs than you, and try to understand/explain how to improve.\nRole Assignment.\nIf you're the group leader, it's your job to know what your group is capable of and to work with it. Especially in pick-up groups with strangers, be sure that \"every\" person's specialization is known.\nWhile it is tempting for a leader to choose roles for the whole group, remember that a player will play the role they \"want\" to play with the most aplomb. In groups below 80, there will frequently not be players specialized for tanking and healing; in fact, there will rarely even be a single one of those. In groups formed through the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, players are expected to perform the role they signed up for, but of course if a DPS is willing to heal or tank that's fine. \nBe warned that many players still dismiss legitimate roles for some classes. You may have to concern yourself with educating players about something as common as a Shadow Priest or a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; tank. Also keep in mind that player ingenuity and proper use of game mechanics can beget potential roles that are not considered \"legitimate\", usually because of a lack of a talent tree devoted to it and/or lack of general mention or notice, but which can nonetheless be quite potent in the proper hands. In those cases, it's advisable to harbour an air of scepticism originally, but remain open-minded and allow the person a chance to both explain and, if he seems competent enough in his explanation, to perform; that player may well surprise you and the rest of the group!\nDealing With Poor Group Dynamics.\nA serious problem that is often encountered with players within WoW in particular, is that although certain activities within the game (raids, battlegrounds, etc.) ideally benefit from a level of group discipline vaguely approaching that which is usually only otherwise seen within real-world military groups, the people playing the game will almost exclusively consist of civilians, who are thus entirely unaccustomed, in many cases, to working within a group in such a focused and controlled manner. This lack of familiarity with a desirable level of discipline, is in itself probably the single main cause of wipes and other failures, during instances or other group-oriented activities within the game.\nMost of this guide is geared toward &lt;a href=\"pickup%20group\"&gt;pickup group&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s that haven't yet established much routine in grouping or &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;ing. If you're in a group that already works, you probably don't need this guide. But what if you're in a group that doesn't work?\nGroups fail if a member of the group ignores their role or compromises their performance in it. Many players misbehave in order to climb the damage meter. Some players are impatient or don't care about the group's procedures in pulling. Other group members may not understand the game well enough to use a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; or a certain spell. Changing this kind of behavior is the highest priority in fixing bad groups.\nIf you are the group leader, make sure everyone knows their role, and encourage them in those roles. Correct poor players and be prepared to boot them for the sake of the group. A poor enough player will drag down the whole group worse than not having them! As a communicator, consider saying as little as possible so the rest of the team will speak up for themselves. (While the group is forming, be slow to relinquish the \"group leader\" icon, since you are giving up \"direct\" power to save the run!)\nIf you aren't the group leader, leave the run if you see deep problems. It's best for everyone to leave as soon as you know that you aren't committed to the group. Ask the group who is going to tank as a litmus test; any decent group will be concerned with this before entering the instance. Be prepared to aid a timid group leader by offering advice or suggesting a boot. \nPositive speech and action can bolster a failing group. Acknowledge your group members when they do well, but diligently correct them when they make mistakes. Give inexperienced players a chance to run the instance; frequently, newer players are good learners. Don't yell at players after a wipe; explain to them how the group may improve.\nAdditional Tips.\nFear.\nBe particularly careful using &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; in any &lt;a href=\"Instance\"&gt;Instance&lt;/a&gt;, as more often than not, fear may draw more mobs and turn a close call into a hopeless battle. As a general rule of thumb, simply don't use fear in an instance. Cases in which fear would be an acceptable thing to do are only when:\nThat said, Fear can be a valuable &lt;a href=\"CC\"&gt;CC&lt;/a&gt; tool in some instance situations. Warlocks in particular have tools to allow them to control their feared target(s). However, this should only be done by experienced players who know how to handle feared targets and are willing to go to the effort, as Fear yo-yo tactics (Fear -&gt; Curse of Recklessness -&gt; (other curse) -&gt; Curse of Recklessness, etc.) can take a great deal of attention, lowering DPS noticeably. [EDIT: It is no longer reliable, as CoR was removed from the game in patch 3.1.0] In general, this form of CC should be treated as a valuable asset, but also as a last resort.\nThe next step.\nStepping it up to Raiding? &lt;a href=\"Raiding%20for%20newbies\"&gt;Raiding for newbies&lt;/a&gt;."}

This way, mobs will come back or, in some cases, unbug.\nSoft reset.\nA soft reset is when all party members leave the instance, and then come back in. This puts people out of combat, making mobs run back to their original places.\nThe term \"soft reset\" can also mean having all party/raid members leave the instance for at least 30 minutes. This causes any trash mobs that have been killed to respawn. The most common reason to do this (deliberately) is to farm trash mobs in raid instances, for reputation or rare drops.\nHard reset.\nA hard reset is when all party members leave the instance, and the instance leader right clicks over his own portrait and the clicks the \"Reset Instance\" button. This restarts the whole instance, and all mobs will be back.\nHeroic dungeons and &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;Raid&lt;/a&gt; instances cannot be hard reset manually. All heroic mode instances (and thus, the IDs) will hard reset at the same time region-wide every day. The date of the hard reset of raid instances depends on the instance.\nIf you are in such an instance at the time of the reset, you will be forcibly returned to your hearthstone's home. At 60, 45 and 15 minutes before the reset there is a warning that the instance will reset. At 10 minutes before the reset you will be informed that you will be forcibly returned to your hearthstone's home.\nWhen resetting a normal dungeon, some restrictions apply. You cannot enter more than five instances per hour, even if they are of the same dungeon. This was added to prevent farming an instance's trash mobs over and over again without killing a boss.\nResetting in &lt;a href=\"Heroic\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt; Instances will reset trash but not bosses."}

{"id": "69548", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69548", "title": "Wilderness stalker", "text": "A wilderness stalker uses stealth to slip unseen and unheard through the woods and sneak in close to her prey. Born of instinct among the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s in ancient times, the way of the wilderness stalker has become a set of skills passed from one generation to another - and to the occasional ally, such as the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; have also developed the techniques of becoming wilderness stalkers - claiming the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, becoming true people of the land.\nA wilderness stalker emphasizes thrown weapons as well as bonding with the world around her. Their &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, may be guardians and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as well, but wilderness stalkers are true creatures of the wild. They gain mastery over the terrain in which they battle, learning how to use the environment to their best advantage. No one can match a wilderness stalker for her ability to survive in harsh environments. Wilderness stalkers claim that that the lands speak to them, aiding them in their hunting and protecting them.\nThough a wilderness stalker excels at closing on unaware prey, she knows that their prey will occasionally sense her before she can get within reach and thus, many wilderness stalkers are also skilled at throwing weapons at a bolting target. A wilderness stalker may move through any sort of nonmagical undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas and other similar terrains) at her normal speed without taking damage or suffering any other way.\nA wilderness stalker gains the ability to cast a small number of divine spells. Wilderness stalkers call upon the spirits of the land and nature to help them. Their spells deal with hunting and surviving in the natural world. In time the wilderness stalker learns the languages of the animals and trees around her, and may speak with any animals or plants. The wilderness stalker learns to become one with the world around her and blend into it. The wilderness stalker learns how to call upon the spirits of trees for help in battle. The highly skilled wilderness stalker can move entire forests to fight for her.\nWilderness stalkers in the world.\nWilderness stalkers are found almost exclusively among the Horde, as only &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s teach the abilities. Wilderness stalkers are most often &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s, though many &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; take up the path as well. There are no known &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt; wilderness stalkers on Azeroth. Among &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, many &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Axethrower\"&gt;axethrower&lt;/a&gt;s learn the wilderness stalker's arts, and many &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Headhunter\"&gt;headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s among &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s become wilderness stalkers. Wilderness stalkers provide a vital role in the Horde as both scouts and stalkers in the wilds. Even the Alliance's elven rangers and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s cannot outwit a wilderness stalker in her preferred environment, nor match the savagery of her attacks. Often a stalker precedes an army, scouting ahead and slaying sentries for the Horde before guiding her fellows through the woods and into the heart of an enemy's encampment.\nWilderness stalkers share a fierce competition with elven rangers. Both groups claim to train the greatest woodsmen and women on Azeroth, and attempt to prove the strength of their paths with almost bloodthirsty fervor. Perhaps the most vicious rivalry exists between &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; rangers and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; wilderness stalkers, who add racial animosity to the deal. The rivalry is so fierce between these individuals that both often abandon their duties and compatriots at a hint of a rival's presence. The resulting battles are perhaps worse than most engagements their respective forces see that day.\nWilderness stalkers gain prestige among their fellows. The path of the wilderness stalker is almost always a solitary one, as the wilderness stalker must learn to commune with the wilds about her. Months of training in natural environments face her, testing her skills and resolve. Among some tauren and troll tribes, the wilderness stalker receives a final test, where she is offered either a knife or a waterskin, and is teleported into an unknown, unfamiliar and unkind environment. If the trainee can survive for one month against the odds, she may call herself a wilderness stalker and join her tribe once again. Not surprisingly, few pass this grueling ordeal.\nDespite their loner mentality, occasionally a wilderness stalker seeks out the companionship of others, if just for a change of pace. Wilderness stalkers prefer to associate with like-minded types, such as &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. While the path of a wilderness stalker is a warrior's path, most other &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are too loud and destructive for the average wilderness stalker's tastes (though some troll stalkers can make even the most savage orc grunt look tame). They also look favorably on druids and shaman, even those of the Alliance, simply for the respect and camaraderie of the world's spirit speakers. Even evil stalkers respect the spirits, or perhaps fear them, and rarely anger a druid or shaman. Most are affiliated with the Horde, and only a few are &lt;a href=\"independent\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt;."}

The clan is led by High Thane &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, who represents the Wildhammer people on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nLike all dwarves, the Wildhammer are descendants of the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nJust prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer clan, ruled by &lt;a href=\"Thane\"&gt;Thane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited the foothills and crags around the base of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. They were one of the three great factions of dwarves under High King &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, controlling the strongest &lt;a href=\"mountaineer\"&gt;mountaineer&lt;/a&gt;s that &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; had to offer. After Modimus died, a civil war broke out between the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer clan, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; for control of the kingdom. The Wildhammer clan was unsuccessful in wresting control of Ironforge, with &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and his clan claiming the city as their own and declaring himself king. Khardros and his Wildhammer warriors traveled north and founded their own kingdom within the distant peak of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a holdfast that would come to rival even Ironforge.\nThaurissan, leader of the Dark Iron clan, and his Dark Irons vowed revenge against Ironforge, founding their own kingdom, named for the Sorcerer-Thane, &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, in the northern &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Thaurissan and his Dark Irons vowed revenge against the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and Wildhammers. Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol. As Modgud confronted the enemy warriors, she used her powers to strike fear into their hearts. Shadows moved at her command, and dark things crawled up from the depths of the earth to stalk the Wildhammers in their own halls. Eventually, Modgud broke through the gates and laid siege to the fortress itself. The Wildhammers fought desperately, Khardros himself wading through the roiling masses to slay the sorceress queen. With their queen lost, the Dark Irons fled before the fury of the Wildhammers. Uniting with the Ironforge dwarves, Khardros and Madoran put their differences aside to make &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; answer for his crimes, though they were ultimately unable to do so as the dark Thane summoned &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; with his hatred, destroying the northern half of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; with his magic. Horrified, the two dwarven leaders fell back. While the Wildhammers were invited back into Ironforge, Khardros' pride prevented him from accepting the offer. Instead, the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Valley of Kings&lt;/a&gt; was erected as a monument to Wildhammer and Ironforge friendship, and while rivalries would continue, the two did not raise arms against one another ever again.\nOnce the immediate Dark Iron threat was eliminated, the Wildhammers returned home to Grim Batol. However, the death of the Modgud had left an evil stain on the mountain fortress, and the Wildhammers found it uninhabitable. Khardros took his people north towards the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, settling within in a mountainous region of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt; and in the lush forests of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the Wildhammers crafted the city of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the Hinterlands, where the Wildhammers grew closer to nature and even bonded with the mighty gryphons of the area. Some of the Wildhammer clans settled closer to Grim Batol, in the area later known as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nFollowing the ravaging of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; pushed farther north into the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, taking &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and converting them into fortresses for the Horde. Grim Batol became the primary base for the land offensive and was also converted into a hatchery for the enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; was a pivotal battleground in the Second War, constantly shifting in possession between the two factions.\nFrom the ominous and foreboding peaks of the Hinterlands and &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt; came the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s. Mounted upon their legendary beasts and wielding the mystic &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s forged deep within the secret chambers of their &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;aviaries&lt;/a&gt;, these feral dwarves feared no enemy - and relied upon no friend. They had allied themselves only with the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; at the time, distrusting both their &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;dwarven cousins&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s alike. Located to the southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; are home to the Wildhammer clan, renowned for their use of gryphons. Led at that time by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer clan came under attack by what ultimately proved to be a diversionary tactic by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The Warchief deduced that if he sent a force to attack the Hinterlands, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; would respond, allowing him to take the remainder of his forces into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;. With their only battle ready dragons having been sent off to guide the orcish fleet north, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s were incapable of defeating the dwarves' hit and run tactics, leading to Doomhammer assailing Aerie Peak itself in an effort to subjugate the Wildhammer. As this went on, Orgrim split his forces and headed north, realizing that the dwarves were only concerned with defending their home. The Alliance soon arrived, aiding the Wildhammers in defeating the orcs and forest trolls; the attack having changed the Wildhammer isolationist point of view, leading to them joining the Alliance as well. The Wildhammers informed the Alliance that the Horde had slipped to the north, evading their army, and Lothar continued to pursue them.\nRealizing their plans, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; dispatched &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, along with half the Alliance forces, to travel north to Quel'Thalas and come to the aid of the elves, while he aided Kurdran in clearing out the remaining Horde forces in the Hinterlands. Afterwards, he and his gryphon riders flew north to aid the Alliance in Quel'Thalas. Kurdran and his Wildhammers later came to the aid of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s forces in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the Admiral's ships to focus on the ships while the gryphon riders battled the dragon riders of the Horde.\nBattle for Grim Batol.\nFalstad Wildhammer, a noble &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; rider of the Wildhammer clan of &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, commanded a small flight of such riders who patrolled the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; for any hostile draconic activity after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Falstad and his comrades protected the town of &lt;a href=\"Hasic\"&gt;Hasic&lt;/a&gt; from certain doom and then transported human mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and his companions across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. During the journey, however, the group was ambushed and Falstad's kinsmen were killed. Nevertheless, at the incentive of &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad continued to Khaz Modan. Later, with the help of a clan of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad reached &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and fought in the final battle there to free the Red Dragon Queen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Aerie Peak and the Wildhammer clan, went to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, Falstad stayed in Aerie Peak to succeed him as the High Thane to rule the Wildhammer clan. Kurdran and his gryphon riders participated in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and were one of the heroes willing to sacrifice their lives to safeguard Azeroth. Kurdran Wildhammer would later have a statue in his likeness built in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; to honor him for his heroic deeds.\nWith the turmoils between the Alliance nations, the Wildhammer dwarves remained in the Alliance of Lordaeron.\nThird War.\nThe daring &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the Wildhammer responded once again to answer the call to war during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. They brought the mighty &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in its time of need. Armed with their trusty, lightning-powered &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s, the fearless wild dwarves sought to keep the skies of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; free from enemy forces. The proud gryphons share their riders' implacable resolve and stand as noble symbols of the Alliance's fortitude.\nThe Alliance seemed to have crumbled following &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s death at the hands of his son, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas, now the head of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;destroyed&lt;/a&gt; his &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;own kingdom&lt;/a&gt; in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and left Lordaeron in shambles. &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt; tried to rally what remained in his &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;, though his terrible leadership led to his undoing and all who followed him.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nUnlike many of the other former-Alliance races, the Wildhammer dwarves continued to prosper in their home of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. The most immediate threat to their security came from the east in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-aligned &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; trolls. The rugged terrain of the Hinterlands was not only home to the Wildhammer dwarves and their gryphons, but also to these hostile forest troll tribes. The trolls viewed the Wildhammers as squatters on their ancestral lands and spare no opportunity to accost the dwarves by attacking the gryphon aeries.\nThe Wildhammers of Aerie Peak were not part of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, but were still friendly and helpful to Alliance adventurers that have proven their worth to them. However, the Wildhammer Dwarves of Aerie Peak did strike an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil\"&gt;Quel'Danil&lt;/a&gt;, much to the ire of their common enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; trolls.\nConsidering the presence of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Gryphon\"&gt;Aerie Gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, it seems an expedition from the Wildhammer clan of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; participated in the battle or lent aid in some capacity.\nOutland.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, chief thane during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and commander of the gryphon riders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, founded &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; as part of the bulwark against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Kurdran is thane of the Wildhammer dwarves in Outland. They seek to push back the encroaching of demons on their territory.\nAnother contingent of Wildhammers also set up a base at &lt;a href=\"Shatter%20Point\"&gt;Shatter Point&lt;/a&gt;, a giant floating rock in northern &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;. As these dwarves were cut off from the rest of their kin, they retained their Alliance loyalties.\nCataclysm.\n\"Since they were driven from the keep of Grim Batol, the nature-dwelling Wildhammer dwarves have resided in isolated territories and prized their independence above all else. Yet, when their Bronzebeard cousins and their Alliance allies have found themselves threatened by orcs or undead, the gruff and free-willed Wildhammers have stepped in to help out.\"\n\"It is only recently that the Wildhammer clan has found itself facing the same problems as the rest of Azeroth at precisely the same time. The rampaging of black dragons and maniacal cultists near the Wildhammers' homes in the Twilight Highlands is simply an echo of the devastation occurring in every other corner of the world. As Azeroth quakes, Magni Bronzebeard, the ruler of the mightiest dwarven city in the world, has been rendered unable to govern his people by an ancient ritual.\"\n\"Not even the reclusive Wildhammers can ignore these signs. They have pledged themselves to the Alliance, and those who champion their cause can avail themselves of mighty enchanted armors and relics unlike any forged by city dwarves.\"\nIn order to prevent political turmoil in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; helped govern Ironforge as part of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. With Falstad's inclusion into Alliance affairs, the Hinterlands Wildhammer dwarves pledged themselves to the Alliance.\nMembers of the Wildhammer clan had also been admitted into the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;. Among those members was &lt;a href=\"Gavan%20Grayfeather\"&gt;Gavan Grayfeather&lt;/a&gt;, who helped advise &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; on his path to aiding the world. The shaman of the Wildhammer became a great asset to the Alliance in their efforts to prevent the further shattering of Azeroth, training their Ironforge kin in the ways of shaman.\nA few Wildhammer &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries were hired by the Alliance to participate in the battle in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; against the Horde in which they firebombed &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wildhammer dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; have also recently been engaged in combat against the Horde-aligned trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the Hinterlands. &lt;a href=\"Kerr%20Ironsight\"&gt;Kerr Ironsight&lt;/a&gt; led Alliance adventurers in combating them.\nThe Wildhammer clan featured heavily in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; as well as in the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt;; where they battled against their long-time enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, who has recently rejoined the Horde, Making matters worse, the natural upheaval of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; had caused the decimation of the icy cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn enslaved &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20of%20Forgemaster%20Finlay\"&gt;Wildhammer smith&lt;/a&gt; forged the &lt;a href=\"The%20Hammer%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hammer of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter rallying the surviving Wildhammer dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and resolving the various clan rivalries, the Wildhammer dwarves have united under the Wildhammer clan once again, and with them, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to fend off the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; Cult and the Dragonmaw orcs. Notable clans include:\nAftermath.\nAt least one Wildhammer shaman was captured by the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt least one Wildhammer shaman and one Wildhammer &lt;a href=\"Rory%20MacDuff\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; accompanied the Alliance on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Stormcaller%20Mylra\"&gt;Stormcaller Mylra&lt;/a&gt;, as of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s latest invasion the Twilight Highlands are overrun and the Wildhammers have been scattered.\nSeveral Wildhammer dwarf shaman were seen in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; stationed in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth%20%28Class%20Hall%29\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; fighting the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s across &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and rest of Azeroth.\nWildhammer gryphon riders accompanied the Alliance into &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Wildhammer &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s patrolled &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20River\"&gt;Darrowmere River&lt;/a&gt;, preventing &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; troop movements. Horde champions were sent to infiltrate their roost at &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill their &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master%20Talonaxe\"&gt;Gryphon Master Talonaxe&lt;/a&gt; was encountered there by the enemy champions.\nThanks to &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Tak\"&gt;Boss Tak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; were trained to become gryphon riders as &lt;a href=\"Roughnecks\"&gt;Roughnecks&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalstad Wildhammer took an important role in the Alliance's effort against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;war campaign&lt;/a&gt;. Several Wildhammer dwarves are seen on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. They also participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nDespite having their own in-game reputation, only the members of the clan in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; are part of that faction.

They also value nature and have close ties to &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt;. The bulk of their people are led by the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;. The ancient fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; was once a massive Wildhammer dwarf city, though it was lost following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are also referred to as wild dwarves, feral dwarves, Aerie dwarves and may also be known as &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20dwarf\"&gt;mountain dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegion.\nThe Wildhammer dwarves are a diverse race of dwarves composing of many familiar &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s. Thus, they have many holdings that each individual clan claims as their home, but not a specific capital. The Hinterlands Wildhammer clan for example, hails from &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a region as yet untouched by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Since Aerie Peak was where High Thane &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; led his Wildhammers to settle after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, it is a prominent and respected Wildhammer city. Many Wildhammer clans also hail from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Highlands), the original land where their former capital, &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, was established.\nAppearance and equipment.\nWildhammer dwarves are taller, leaner, and wilder than their earthier &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge cousins&lt;/a&gt;. Wildhammers are similar in appearance to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, though they have different skin tones in comparison to their cousins. Where the Ironforge dwarves range from tan to pale and ashy, Wildhammers are near exclusively tan, with some having nearly orange-toned skin.\nWildhammer riders favor &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s. Wildhammers are all adorned in war-paint like tattoos and often wear leather garb embossed with &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; or flight-related iconography. Gryphon feathers are also common amongst Wildhammer adornments. Unlike their cousins to the south, the Wildhammers do not use an extensive amount of engineering; to the point where there are few guns seen amongst the Wildhammers, and instead of &lt;a href=\"siege%20tank\"&gt;siege tank&lt;/a&gt;s and other gun-powder weapons, they use &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s. The most instrumental part of Wildhammer warfare is that of their gryphons, whom they rule over the skies with atop their backs.\nRelations.\nWith the Alliance.\nWithin the Alliance, the Wildhammer dwarves are represented mainly by the various Wildhammer clans. Nearly every Wildhammer clan in the modern time has pledged to the Alliance under the eponymous &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;. The clans of the Highlands were united by the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; under the Alliance as well.\nWithin the faction, the Wildhammers have a cordial but complex relationship with their Bronzebeard cousins. The two clans had strong tensions between each other before the War of the Three Hammers, and fought against each other and the Dark Iron clan before the Bronzebeards won and expelled their cousins of Ironforge. Despite this, the Wildhammers did not seek revenge on their cousins, unlike the Dark Irons, and eventually reconciled and allied with the Bronzebeards against the common threat of the Dark Irons in the second half of the war. Nevertheless, the Wildhammers rejected the Bronzebeard dwarves' offer of rejoining Ironforge, though built together the Thandol Span as a token of reconciliation and friendship between the two clans. The two clans would fight side-by-side again during the Second War and Third War, before reuniting with the creation of the council of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, though political and cultural tensions remain between the clans.\nThe Wildhammers had a long period of isolationism. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; itself was not a part of the new &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; at first, having not reforged that bond as their Ironforge brethren had. Though they still kept ties with the Alliance members and even worked with the Alliance, they still valued their independence too much to formalize their relationship. As of \"\", the clan had rejoined the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; moved to Ironforge to aid with its governing as a part of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of the Hinterlands dwarves, however, the Wildhammer dwarves did not all rejoin the Alliance, instead, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; had to reunite the various clans back under the leadership of the Wildhammer clan before they would be considered members again.\nTheir relationship with the gryphons of the Hinterlands has proven profitable as the Alliance has established an extensive travel network using these flying beasts. In addition to convenient travel, the Wildhammers are an important military force. In Outland, for example, the Wildhammer clan is supplying select Alliance members with gryphons of their own and perform bombing operations on important legion-controlled points. Members of the Wildhammer clan reside in towns of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and the human city of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, teaching its denizens shamanism. Wildhammers have a kinship with the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; as observed from their friendship with the &lt;a href=\"Highvale\"&gt;Highvale&lt;/a&gt; elves in the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt; nearby.\nWith the Horde.\nThe Wildhammer people, like most dwarves, have a strained relationship towards the Horde. Even in periods where the clan was outside of the Alliance; most Wildhammers considered the Horde to be their enemy. This is best seen in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;s classic era; where despite not being part of the Alliance, the Wildhammer are openly hostile to the Horde. They assailed the Horde once they began to invade their homeland of &lt;a href=\"The%20Hinterlands\"&gt;The Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and since then have held a hatred for the faction.\nGryphon riders, under &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, attacked &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;'s home of &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Though they inflicted damage to the Darkspear, they were ultimately pushed back and driven out. Wildhammer mercenaries helped firebomb Camp Taurajo. While outside of the Alliance at the time, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Highlands&lt;/a&gt; dwarf clans were heated enemies with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, against whom they vied for control of the region. This bloodshed only seemed to grow after both factions would later join the overarching faction war, as seen in &lt;a href=\"Thundermar\"&gt;Thundermar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. They have also had many conflicts with the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;; a forest troll faction that was one of the few still aligned with the Horde.\nThe only elements of the Wildhammer people that have shown the ability to work with the Horde have been those that work in neutral organizations, such as the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Timewalkers\"&gt;Timewalkers&lt;/a&gt;, and most prominently, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gavan%20Grayfeather\"&gt;Gavan Grayfeather&lt;/a&gt;, a Wildhammer shaman of the Earthen Ring, was instrumental in aiding &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; to make the then-warchief, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, understand he could not lead the Horde and seek to heal Azeroth in the wake of the Cataclysm. &lt;a href=\"Stormcaller%20Mylra\"&gt;Stormcaller Mylra&lt;/a&gt; has been shown to work with the Horde multiple times while still holding some loyalty to her people, as her faction ties are primarily to the Earthen Ring.\nWildhammer dwarves make up a large part of the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them chose to team up with the Horde-aligned &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; to form the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Most prominently one of their leaders, &lt;a href=\"Toddy%20Whiskers\"&gt;Toddy Whiskers&lt;/a&gt;, is a Wildhammmer dwarf.\nCulture.\nThe Wildhammer dwarves rely on action and deeds rather than talk to prove one's worth. Before gaining their trust, one may need to perform a task to prove that they're willing to get their hands dirty, a trait the Wildhammers value in their associates. Though self-reliant, Wildhammer dwarves are expected to look out for each other no matter the clan. Only a coward--a disgrace to the Wildhammer--would turn down the call of their people, especially in a dire time. All the great Wildhammer heroes from ages past are kept alive through the songs of their &lt;a href=\"bard\"&gt;bard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn terms of their communities, Wildhammers value three things: independence, family bonds, and their &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s. Wildhammers revere the gryphon as a sacred animal. The Wildhammer dwarves act as companions, caretakers, and trainers to the gryphons. They're majestic creatures of the skies, and more than just beasts; they're intelligent and cunning. Some say the Wildhammers keep them as pets, but it's more of a friendship. They do everything to protect their kin and gryphons. That includes chasing off predators, whether they be from the forest or from the Horde. Wildhammers train young gryphons by sending them out to hunt rattlesnakes in the Twilight Highlands. Wildhammers are trained to fight using their trusty &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s while riding their gryphon friends, a partnership which makes Wildhammer &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s renowned. Usually, Wildhammer gryphon riders fight with those who are from the same family and fight in groups under the command of a family leader or a wing commander that they trust and respect. When a congregation of gryphon riders fights as a unit, this aviation brigade is known as a gryphon wing.\n&lt;a href=\"Kirthaven\"&gt;Kirthaven&lt;/a&gt; is the spiritual center for the Wildhammers of the Twilight Highlands and the one place where the clans can come together in peace. There, the clans honor their dead heroes before burying them with their gryphons atop &lt;a href=\"Thunderstrike%20Mountain\"&gt;Thunderstrike Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where they are believed to spend eternity at one with the sky. The Wildhammers also believe that their dead ride into the hereafter to join \"the halls of [their] ancestors\" and that their spirits \"fight proud through eternity\". Wildhammers are known for honoring their dead with epic mourning songs. When speaking of a dead person, they sometimes slap a fist over their heart as a sign of respect.\nThe following Wildhammer clans are known:\nNomenclature.\nWildhammers have been differentiated from their kin numerous times, though the terminology is very inconsistent. Throughout \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", Wildhammers are called \"Wildhammer dwarves\", though within the novels and other games this is not always the case.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\" uses terms wild dwarf, &lt;a href=\"mountain%20dwarf\"&gt;mountain dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, and Aerie dwarf to refer the Wildhammer dwarves while Falstad deferentially refers to the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Hill%20dwarf\"&gt;hill dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, meaning that the term is likely not used when referring to Wildhammers in canon. The now non-canon RPG books described them as \"&lt;a href=\"Hill%20dwarf\"&gt;hill dwarves&lt;/a&gt;\" according to \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Conflict\"&gt;Lands of Conflict&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe term wild dwarf is used again in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" manual. \"Wild dwarves are armed with their trusty, lightning-powered Stormhammers, they seek to keep the skies of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; free from enemy forces.\"\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nWildhammer dwarves are feral and untamed, prone to revelry, &lt;a href=\"shamanism\"&gt;shamanism&lt;/a&gt; and daring acts of bravery (and stupidity). They eschew &lt;a href=\"technological\"&gt;technological&lt;/a&gt; gadgets in favor of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and straightforward weapons, including their famous &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s. Wildhammer dwarves are famous across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for their unique relationship with gryphons. They treat these noble creatures as equals rather than mounts or pets. The gryphons respond to their handlers' respect and are steadfast and resolute in return. This close relationship produces the most famous Wildhammer dwarves: the gryphon riders, heroes of the Second and Third Wars.\nWildhammer dwarves are fearless warriors and unswerving opponents of evil. They take to the skies astride &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s to combat vile creatures such as &lt;a href=\"harpies\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black%20drake\"&gt;black drake&lt;/a&gt;s, and unnatural contraptions like &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s. Slightly xenophobic, Wildhammers are content to deal almost exclusively with gryphons and nature spirits. They are distant, even distrustful, toward members of other races. Despite their insular nature, Wildhammer dwarves do not hesitate to come to the aid of their allies when the need arises.\nThe fanatical archaeological fervor that has seized the Ironforge dwarves does not fall upon the Wildhammers. Perhaps they are descended from these mysterious titans \u2014 but what does that matter? Wildhammer dwarves live in the present and do not dwell in the past. Their ambivalence about their titan ancestry denies them the power that their Ironforge brethren have discovered, but the Wildhammers make up for it with bravery, determination, and wild spirits.\nIronically, Wildhammers may have more in common with the Horde than the Alliance, but longtime rivalry and natural distrust prevents meaningful contact. Wildhammers fought orcs in generations of warfare and cannot let old rivalries die. They respect the orcs' fighting prowess and the spiritual shaman of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; inhabiting the nearby &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, but remain suspicious of them and thus aid the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; in their mission to claim the valley. Wildhammers see potential in the tauren \u2014 the tauren bear a great reverence of nature (as do the Wildhammers), practice elemental magic and possess great martial prowess. Wildhammer dwarves are wilder than tauren, but the possibility exists that the two races could become friends.\nWildhammer dwarves do not like goblins. The little creatures are materialistic and technology-driven, and they clear-cut entire forests. Wildhammers take pride in zeppelin hunting.\nThey have founded three kingdoms so far in their history.\nWild dwarf is a term used for the dwarves of the Wildhammer clan.\nThe Wildhammer clan hails from &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a region as yet untouched by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Here they work to preserve nature and prevent evil from tainting their lands, waging a constant war against the native forest trolls. Though cool to humans and to Ironforge dwarves, many Wildhammers traveled to Kalimdor with Jaina Proudmoore to combat the Horde. Those in Kalimdor avoid Theramore, preferring the open skies. Wildhammers are wanderers and explorers, skirting large cities and concentrating in mountains and other wilderness areas.\nWildhammer dwarves have a number of clans, each ruled by a thane. The strongest thane rules Aerie Peak.\nThe Wildhammers were once led by &lt;a href=\"Maz%20Drachrip\"&gt;Maz Drachrip&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are a story-loving culture; the shaman and priests of the Wildhammer dwarves entertain the people on cold nights with tales of past battles, instructions on gryphon handling, and myths of nature and the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. They have three community rituals per year: one holiday where all the marriages are performed, one to honor all children born that year, and one to mourn that year's dead. It seems a bit long to wait if you're born (or die) at the wrong time of year, but it's efficient and has a tendency to strengthen the community as a whole. Children born in the same year grow to be strong friends, as they celebrate their births all on the same day. Wildhammer dwarves commonly marry someone from their same birth year.\nThe climate is ideal for brewing good, dark beer with some weight to it, to keep you warm on the cold, windy nights. Their other beers are of less quality, and the Wildhammers only export their dark beer. One of their stouts is known as Gryphon's Tears.\nThe dwarves in Aerie Peak live as they did before the war, untouched by the horrors that happened on the rest of the continent. They have suffered a bit as their suppliers in the towns of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; are gone, but they still fly south to Stormwind and Ironforge to trade. This frequent contact with the Alliance keeps them abreast of what's happening in the constant struggle with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and remaining &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;; they have even taken some refugees back to Aerie Peak, attempting to do what they can to strengthen the Alliance to what it once was.\nWildhammer dwarves prefer to stay out of conflicts until the Alliance calls upon them. They do not want to muck about with politics, and as long as no one threatens their land or their livelihoods, they are content. They do rise to fight for an ally, and the Alliance is stronger because of them. However, calling in Wildhammer reinforcements certainly isn't enough to win a war; they're great gryphon riders, but they're uncomfortable with technology, and their numbers are dwindling.\nThe few Wildhammer dwarves in Kalimdor are the most affected by the turmoil of the war. They care not for the walls of Theramore and found nothing stopping them from simply launching into the air and traveling north, avoiding the considerable obstacles, beasts and Horde members on the ground.\nTo their credit, before they left, they met with the night elf and Ironforge dwarf delegations in Theramore. The Ironforge dwarves had already started excavating &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and the Wildhammer dwarves wanted to know if it would be suitable for settlement. The Ironforge dwarves thought not, as the Wildhammer preferred colder climates and Bael Modan was baked by the sun. They also expressed polite reservations about the mountain being settled by those who did not share their reverence when it came to the mysteries of the Titans buried there.\nThe night elves agreed to allow the Wildhammer dwarves into their southern mountain peaks, and the Wildhammer dwarves report to the night elves anything out of the ordinary they see from their vantage point. Most think that dwarves and elves working so well together would be the first odd thing the Wildhammer dwarves would report. But life in the post-Third War world is different.\nWildhammer dwarves have a new home in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. It's bitterly cold on their peaks, and they construct homes that are nearly always part cave and part building. Although they do not claim the same love for engineering and architecture as Ironforge dwarves have, their constructions are admittedly impressive. They have a wooded area where they raise their gryphons. The fearsome birdlike creatures prefer the open air, but the natural flying beasts of the land, the hippogryphs, and the wyverns, are sensitive to anything intruding on their territory; so the Wildhammer dwarves are careful to raise their gryphons where they can be shielded to keep them from the sharp eyes of would-be attackers.\nCulture.\nThe Wildhammer dwarves live up to their names, as their life on the high crags caused them to focus on nature, passion and the wilderness. Their communion with nature and their gryphons lead them to follow a shamanistic path rather than that of the Holy Light. A Wildhammer paladin or priest of the Holy Light is about as rare as an Ironforge druid. They just follow their own paths.\nThe 200 or so years since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; has changed their looks in a surprising way. Life outside a mountain's peak is not gentle. Constant exposure to the elements tans and weathers the Wildhammer dwarves' skin. They dress in heavy skins and furs to protect them from the weather and the wind while riding their gryphons.\nThe Wildhammer dwarves get their name from their fierce aerial assaults that rain down &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s on their enemies.\nFaith.\nWildhammer dwarves have close ties to nature. Many are shaman, and some are druids. A few Wildhammers revere the Holy Light, but the faith demands too much organization and philosophy for the comfort of most. Some Wildhammer dwarves in Kalimdor have also been studying with the night elves to learn more about Elune, the moon goddess.\nLanguages.\nWildhammer dwarves usually speak Dwarven or Common. Many Wildhammers learn the languages of their friends; a few learn the languages of their enemies.\nAppearance.\nThe Wildhammers typically do not share the latter's love of technology and do not care as much about their titan ancestry, although they have been known to help with the excavations from time to time. Because of this difference in outlook, they lack some of the new abilities that &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have discovered, such as changing their skin to stone. On the other hand, some Wildhammers practice shamanism, and are augmented by nature-focused divine magic. Wildhammers are larger than Ironforge dwarves and paint themselves in traditional tattoos. They adorn their hair and beards with feathers, beads and other colorful panoply.\nWildhammer dwarves are similar in appearance to their Ironforge kin, though many shave their heads and they are slightly taller and leaner. Exposure to sun and high winds darkens and toughens their skin. Wildhammers string beads and feathers into their hair and beards as good luck charms, and paint tattoos on their bodies in homage to the totems, ideas and creatures they revere.\nTheir height is 3'9\" - 4'5\" (114 to 135 cm) (male), and 3'7\" - 4'3\" (109 to 130 cm) (females).\nThey are referred to as &lt;a href=\"Hill%20dwarf\"&gt;hill dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", some Wildhammer dwarves were seen protecting a &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;gryphon aviary&lt;/a&gt; north-east of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Among the people inside the aviary were notably bearded female dwarves and an irate captain who wanted a new &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "16177", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16177", "title": "Wildkin", "text": "The wildkin are serene, powerful creatures, believed by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; to have been created by the moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to protect her sacred places. They look like a cross between a &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; and a horned &lt;a href=\"owl\"&gt;owl&lt;/a&gt;, which explains both their wisdom and ferocity, and they possess all the best traits of Elune's beloved night birds and the brute force of the benevolent bears. Wildkin have long been allies of the night elves, helping to protect their sacred sites. Though they are thoughtful creatures, wildkin harbor a particular hatred for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, recognizing the danger they pose. While wildkin are not naturally hostile to the other denizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, some who have been corrupted or otherwise manipulated have become aggressive, lashing out at travelers and even their night elf allies.\nThe wildkin also go by many other names \u2014 moonkin, owlbear, owlbeast, ravenbear and owlkin, to name a few. These gentle giants possess a natural energy described by an academic of the Kirin Tor to be &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic and similar to that of the night elves. Wildkin feathers appear to contain traces of magical qualities. These powers don't seem to be wielded by the creatures, they are simply inherent to the species--part of their very essence. Wherever they are found in the world, they are protecting something of importance, as they reportedly were entrusted to do long ago by Elune. But if Elune's influence over them wanes or is cut off, the creatures can become dangerous and destructive.\nThese bird-faced humanoids are considered an abomination by most, but find favor with night elves and the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, being considered a sacred animal by both these races. The priests of Elune see the wildkin as imbued with the spirit and strength of the Moon Goddess Elune, and the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s see them as guardians and protectors of nature. Wildkin lay eggs and, although they can't use their wings to fly, they can use them to make their fall slower.\nHistory.\nSome &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; scholars and priests claim that wildkin are the creation of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, that she created them to guard all of her sacred places. They claim that Elune created the first wildkin in the early days of the world to serve as guardians to a powerful gem through which she channeled her infinite wisdom and could communicate with her priestesses. But now, many years later, the wildkin have grown more feral, and without the guidance of the goddess, they are confused. They wander without purpose, though many find their way back to the sacred areas that they once were sworn to protect.\nDuring the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, besides &lt;a href=\"Wildkin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt; wildkin, &lt;a href=\"Enraged%20Wildkin\"&gt;enraged&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berserk%20Wildkin\"&gt;berserk&lt;/a&gt; wildkin could also be found in the wilds, stronger and more resilient than their brethren. Some intelligent wildkin also served among the night elf &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. Eastern Kingdoms wildkin were also exhibited at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Menagerie\"&gt;zoo&lt;/a&gt;.\nA group of wildkin was located in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. They went mad when Illidan and his &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; ravaged through the area. Maiev encountered them as well and ordered her Watchers to put them out of their misery.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, the wildkin led by &lt;a href=\"Bloodbeak%20the%20Berserker\"&gt;Bloodbeak the Berserker&lt;/a&gt; destroyed an orc village. &lt;a href=\"Samuro%20%28blademaster%29\"&gt;Samuro&lt;/a&gt;, in turn, killed them.\nLately, adventurers traveling through the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; have reported strange wildkin attacks. The wildkin seem confused, even maddened, and attack relentlessly and randomly.\nEven though the wildkin were once numerous in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, such are their ties to the land that the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that devastated Darkshore also decimated their numbers, causing several enraged wildkin spirits to wander Darkshore. &lt;a href=\"Aroom\"&gt;Aroom&lt;/a&gt; is the last of his tribe and a powerful elder with a strong connection to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture and behavior.\nWildkin have their own &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; which possibly has many dialects and, although they are, in fact, capable of speaking &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, not all of them do. They make nests for their eggs and live in small societies. It's not uncommon for them to sleep inside caves or hollowed-out trees, and some of their settlements have a fireplace in the middle which they use for heating and cooking. They commonly use torches too. They also have been observed to make &lt;a href=\"Effigy\"&gt;effigies&lt;/a&gt; of themselves to mark the beginning of their territory and, occasionally, organize rituals with varied purposes.\nThey commonly have leaders of which there is usually only one per community. How or why one wildkin becomes the leader is not known. These leaders have an organizational purpose in their communities and often organize the invasion or defense of some territory during conflicts with other races.\nMoonkin children are taught dancing, enjoy &lt;a href=\"Moonberry\"&gt;moonberries&lt;/a&gt; and can use &lt;a href=\"Moonfire\"&gt;Moonfire&lt;/a&gt; from a very young age.\nIt is unknown if they can read, but a book was found among the possessions of the &lt;a href=\"Blackfeather\"&gt;Blackfeather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cukkaw\"&gt;Cukkaw&lt;/a&gt;, in a cave in &lt;a href=\"Stormtorn%20Foothills\"&gt;Stormtorn Foothills&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wildkin collect the feathers of their fallen kind onto a &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;funeral pyre&lt;/a&gt; which is then burned with a special torch holding their creator deity &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s fire. They believe that, once laid to rest, their spirits will return to Elune.\nCraftmanship.\nThe wildkin are capable of creating and using simple weapons and tools such as spears, hammers, knives, and rope, which they use to craft many of the items commonly found in their settlements or for decorative purposes. Although they can craft pots, containers, and cages made of sticks and rope, they commonly use items made by other races, mainly bags.\nWildkin understand and use symbols and effigies with ritualistic or territorial purposes, which they commonly construct using wood, stone, rope, and bone or draw using a white paint of unknown origins, one commonly found symbol made with this white paint is their paws or feet.\nBreeds.\nBesides the regular wildkin, there are other breeds that can be found throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes the word \"wildkin\" is used to refer to all of these breeds:\nOwlbear.\nOwlbears are lumbering, misshapen creatures, beloved by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s alike. They are benevolent by nature, but fearsome when roused or angered. Though they stay away from populated areas, they are often found in the serene glades of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Several of them were part of the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Guardians\"&gt;Primal Guardians&lt;/a&gt; group on &lt;a href=\"Moonglade%20Isle\"&gt;Moonglade Isle&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nOwlbears can be found in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOwlbeast.\nOwlbeasts are wildkin found in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nils%20Beerot\"&gt;Nils Beerot&lt;/a&gt; calls them \"soulless, feathered monstrosities sent from the darkest depths of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; to prey upon the weak\". Some of the owlbeasts in Winterspring are referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Moontouched%20Owlbeast\"&gt;moontouched&lt;/a&gt;\", but what exactly this means is unclear.\nThey were charged by Elune to protect her places of importance and sacred places.\nWhen cut from the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt; of Elune, they may turn aggressive.\nOwlkin.\nOwlkin are found on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;. This specific breed is not normally hostile to other humanoids. However, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; ship \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;The Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" recently crashed nearby, and the radiation from the power crystals of the ship have caused some of the &lt;a href=\"Nestlewood%20Owlkin\"&gt;Nestlewood Owlkin&lt;/a&gt; to become &lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Owlkin\"&gt;Mutated Owlkin&lt;/a&gt;. The owlkin have also absconded with some of the draenei's spare parts which were scattered about the area. Recently, some draenei have been inoculating as many of the unaffected owlkin as they can, hoping to protect the innocent creatures. Unfortunately, for the &lt;a href=\"Mutated%20Owlkin\"&gt;Mutated Owlkin&lt;/a&gt; it is too late.\nMoonkin.\nMoonkin (sometimes called owlbears) are blessed by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and spread nature's grace wherever they travel. Native to &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; areas in northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, these large, flightless, sapient, and bipedal creatures have the size of an upright walking bear, but with bird-like features such as a beak, feathers, and flightless wings. They also drop &lt;a href=\"egg\"&gt;egg&lt;/a&gt;s of various sorts. The distinct roar of the moonkin is one of the most terrifying sounds in nature. A group of them also lives in &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Wilds\"&gt;Verdant Wilds&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost notably, &lt;a href=\"Druid%23Balance\"&gt;balance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, druids who wield and balance the power of the sun and moon, can take the &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt; of a moonkin.\nRavenbear.\nRavenbears are black-feathered wildkin found at &lt;a href=\"Blackbeak%20Overlook\"&gt;Blackbeak Overlook&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stormtorn%20Foothills\"&gt;Stormtorn Foothills&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nCreation.\nDesiring a creature of might to claim as her own and disenchanted with the violence of wolves, Elune combined the best traits of her beloved night birds, the owls, with the brute force of benevolent bears. The result: a swift, elegant, and fiercely loyal hunter. Other scholars claim that wildkin were the misguided creation of a sorcerer. Regardless of their origins, wildkin have been the beloved allies of night elf &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of the wild and &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s alike since the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\nWildkin resemble a bear with a head of an owl with antlers that has feathers trailing down its limbs making them look like miniature wings. They stand upright at about 10 to 12 feet tall, and their body is covered in hairy feathers, usually brown or white. Their arms have a wing-like shape that end in clawed talons, and their heads have a beak and antlers. These odd creatures also emit a distinctive sound when riled, sounding like a combination of growl and screech. Wildkin feathers are very highly prized in certain circles for their rare magical properties. Wildkin in Hinterlands have mutations, such as deformed limbs, scabbed pelts with large bald patches, or red eyes. No one knows how this wildkin corruption began.\nWildkin possess a high intelligence and often understand good reasoning. Most wildkin do not speak, but they understand &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. Some particular wildkin, namely the ones that acted as &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, seemed to be capable of speech. They prefer the serenity of nature and stay away from populated areas, frequenting the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; or the glades of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. There are also considerable numbers in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Some wildkin can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to assist night elves and &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s in guarding locations that those races deem important. Wildkin are very territorial, and as such are good guardians. Most wildkin treat peaceful travelers with respect, sometimes coming to their aid or assisting lost visitors out of their forests. Wildkin are slow to anger, but they fight fiercely and relentlessly when roused. They ferociously attack hostile creatures on sight. They have a particular hatred of all undead and minions of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The great beasts slash with their claws and stab with their beak in combat. A badly injured wildkin may retreat and pursue enemies later, once it heals. Heroes who encounter wildkin either come away speaking of their incredible gentleness or their tremendous ferocity. Wildkin mate for life and bear fuzzy gray cubs that do not develop their claws and brilliant plumage until 2 or 3 years of age. Night elves consider the shimmering pelts and golden eyes of the wildkin to be beautiful. Full-grown wildkin exceed 10 feet in height and weigh between 1,000 and 3,000 pounds, and sometimes even more.\nOwlbeasts, larger and more powerful cousins of wildkin, seem derived from the same species, but their origins remain shrouded in mystery. The night elves claim that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; also created the owlbeasts to serve as her guardians, but owlbeasts do not possess the gentle natures of wildkin. Owlbeasts embody chaos over good; they fly into uncontrolled rages in combat. No one knows what sets off an owlbeast's wrath, so cautious adventurers give the creatures a wide berth. Owlbeasts attack relentlessly and fearlessly. They fly into a frenzy immediately upon entering combat and fight to the death. Owlbeasts grow to almost 20 feet tall and weigh 3,000 pounds or more. They prefer colder climates than do wildkin, and as a result they develop white or silver feathers in the snowy season. Like wildkin, owlbeasts do not speak, but understand &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Owlbear\"&gt;owlbears&lt;/a&gt; are also described in &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\", though these owlbears seem to be slightly different from the previously described. According to this source, owlbears are probably the result of unusual natural selection. They roam all terrain and feed on anything they catch, but they prefer to live near settlements were they can steal livestock to complement their hunting. Owlbears are nomadic, and live in caves or fallen trees until their chicks grow up to be strong enough to keep up with the owlbear's frequent moves. They can be found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, usually in groups of one or two, and sometimes in family units. Most farmers in Azeroth call them a blight.\nInspiration.\nThe wildkin are likely inspired by the , a magical half-avian, half-ursine beast in \"\" that was in turn based upon a plastic toy from Hong Kong. The pet description for &lt;a href=\"Ragepeep\"&gt;Ragepeep&lt;/a&gt; references this by saying \"Part owl, part bear... and part stag, which handily avoids potential lawsuits.\"\nGallery.\n\"For images of druids that shapeshift into wildkin see\" &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form%23Gallery\"&gt;Moonkin Form#Gallery&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are assigned to specific groves of &lt;a href=\"Dream%20tree\"&gt;Dream tree&lt;/a&gt;s ruled over by a &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Night\"&gt;Droman&lt;/a&gt;. They grow through being infused by &lt;a href=\"animacone\"&gt;animacone&lt;/a&gt;s that grow in the area surrounding a given grove, looked after by caretakers and tenders of their grove. Wildseeds are the purpose of Ardenweald. Wildseeds can be striken with nightmares due to a violent death, which can usually be soothed either with anima infusion, songs, or confronting the nightmares from within the dreams of the spirit directly through a ritual in &lt;a href=\"Dreamshrine%20Basin\"&gt;Dreamshrine Basin&lt;/a&gt;. Wildseeds can rarely bond with the spirit of its caretaker, but it is a very rare occassion.\nRecently the land has grown sick with a anima drought and has forced the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; to make hard choices over which groves to save and which to let go\u2014losing beloved nature spirits in the process. With the drought weakening Ardenweald's guardians &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; invade from &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt; to feed upon the dying groves and grow stronger with every wildseed that perishes. Before the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Noch\"&gt;Tirna Noch&lt;/a&gt; had been culled of its seeds, and upon the adventurers arrival &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Rowen\"&gt;Tirna Rowen&lt;/a&gt; is being culled of its seeds. &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Marwol\"&gt;Tirna Marwol&lt;/a&gt; had been culled long ago. Expended and discarded wildseeds are thrown to &lt;a href=\"Gormhive\"&gt;Gormhive&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"gorm\"&gt;gorm&lt;/a&gt; to consume.\nAdventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Conservatory\"&gt;Queen's Conservatory&lt;/a&gt; nurture wildseeds helping the souls of ancient deities return to life. Many spirits of nature suffer within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; but anima alone cannot heal wounds inflicted by &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and spirits plucked from his grasp must be planted anew in wildseeds and tended with care in this grove unlike any other.\n&lt;a href=\"%3AWildseed%20Cradle\"&gt;:Wildseed Cradle&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"cart\"&gt;cart&lt;/a&gt;s imbued with anima to hover over the ground to carry wildseeds.\nKnown.\nKnown spirits in wildseeds.\nRevived spirits:\nLost spirit:\nSpeculation.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; revived in Ardenweald he would also have been in a wildseed.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Parting%20Ways\"&gt;Parting Ways&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ashamane\"&gt;Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt; are brought from the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; to the care of the Winter Queen in Ardenweald and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; is given a chance by the Winter Queen to be reborn after some rest a path never before walked by a mortal soul, this will likely mean they could be put in wildseeds.\nIt's not clear how the Tirna grove &lt;a href=\"dream%20tree\"&gt;dream tree&lt;/a&gt;s generate animacones to feed the wildseeds, as all &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; comes only from souls of dead mortals. Some have speculated all animals that die go to Ardenweald, and \"lesser\" or \"normal\" animals usually just become animacones to feed and revive the Wild Gods. &lt;a href=\"Droman%20Tashmur\"&gt;Droman Tashmur&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Spirits%20of%20the%20Glen\"&gt;Spirits of the Glen&lt;/a&gt; mentions all mortal souls who arrive in Ardenweald give some of their anima in exchange for their &lt;a href=\"soulshape\"&gt;soulshape&lt;/a&gt;, which may be how animacones are generated."}

When small expeditions have been sent in the past, some of the Rot Hide Gnolls have been slain, certainly. But each assault has been repulsed by Nightlash's magic, and the gnolls have been reinforced every time.\nOne of the things that &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Hadrec\"&gt;High Executor Hadrec&lt;/a&gt; wants you to do is to go to the Dead Fields and dispatch Nightlash, returning with what dust remains of her corporeal shell.\nThe Master of Fenris Isle.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Hadrec\"&gt;High Executor Hadrec&lt;/a&gt; tells you that the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; have been gathering at &lt;a href=\"the%20Decrepit%20Ferry\"&gt;the Decrepit Ferry&lt;/a&gt;, and he wants you to find out.\nYou journey there, and discover a boat, heaped with corpses! It is clearly evident that wherever these corpses came from, they are headed for &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nA bit of glitter in the boat attracts your attention. On the hand of the recently deceased corpse of a woman, you find a gold ring, with the inscription \"For Deliah\".\nWhen you bring the ring to Hadrec, he tells you that the only nearby source for such a body would be the mass graves of Tirisfal. The &lt;a href=\"Rot%20Hide\"&gt;Rot Hide&lt;/a&gt; gnolls must be taking these bodies to Fenris Isle.\n\"See also: &lt;a href=\"Deliah%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Deliah's Ring&lt;/a&gt;\"\nIt is evident that something on Fenris Isle needs to be taken out. But just what that is, and who is behind it, is still a mystery. More needs to be discovered before an assault is made. Hadrec directs you to gather ichor from the Rot Hides on Fenris Isle and bring it to &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Renferrel\"&gt;Apothecary Renferrel&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt takes a bit (you manage to destroy many of the rot hides too thoroughly to collect ichor from them), but you collect the amount Renferrel needs and bring it to him.\nApothecary Renferrel reduces and analyzes the ichor as best he can, and does discover some of its properties. It is not entirely alchemical, though, and he asks you to take a sample to &lt;a href=\"Bethor%20Iceshard\"&gt;Bethor Iceshard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith his knowledge of magic, Bethor is able to divine more about the spells involved in the Ichor... and who created them.\nIt turns out that the ichor was created by &lt;a href=\"Thule%20Ravenclaw\"&gt;Thule Ravenclaw&lt;/a&gt;, one of Bethor's colleagues who sided with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; rose to power. On the plus side, Bethor knows a lot about the magic that Thule uses, and gives you a scroll that Apothecary Renferrel can use to craft a potion that should counter Thule's more powerful spells.\nYou return, then, to the Sepulcher, where Renferrel concocts the potion.\nRenferrel refers you back to High Executor Hadrec, who has access to the Sepulcher's arsenal. Hadrec concurs with Renferrel that Thule must be dealt with, and offers you some items to improve your armor and weaponry.\nArmed and ready, you gather friends about you and set off. You have to battle quite a number of Rot Hide gnolls as you work your way through the castle, but finally you come face-to-face with &lt;a href=\"Thule%20Ravenclaw\"&gt;Thule Ravenclaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nVictorious in battle, you retrieve his head as proof that you have slain him.\nReturning to High Executor Hadrec, you are praised, and told that fallout of your battle was felt as far away as the Sepulcher."}

He believed that the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; would return. Through the haze of his paranoia, he saw treachery behind every smile, a scheme behind every vow of devotion, and cunning traps in the calm prophecies of the &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; waterspeakers. Later, he had a maze built beneath his palace, with a safe room at the center. The next time his fear gripped him, Ku fled for it, shut the door, and waited for the terror to subside. It never did. The maze had been so cleverly constructed that the emperor had forgotten the way out.\nSearch parties sometimes heard him calling, but years passed. Occasionally, an explorer went into the maze and ran out screaming, wild with terror, for Ku's time in the dark had twisted him into something appalling to behold. Soon, a cub named &lt;a href=\"Li%20Tao\"&gt;Li Tao&lt;/a&gt; chased his &lt;a href=\"bandicoon\"&gt;bandicoon&lt;/a&gt; kit into the maze. He soon realized he was being followed. Even though he was too frightened to look, little Li Tao still understood that here was someone even more frightened than he was. So he reached back and led the poor emperor out of the maze."}

He tell you everything that's going on out here?\nGood... let's take care of business then!\nNotes.\nFine then, have a seat. This might take a while.\nWhen we first came to this frozen hell, &lt;a href=\"General%20Arlos\"&gt;General Arlos&lt;/a&gt;, down in &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt;, gave my group of flying daredevils and I a special task: to establish a forward airbase for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; operations.\nThis airstrip is the result. Let me tell you, it wasn't easy, what with all the nasty beasts and the ground rock-hard from being frozen! But we managed, and we did it quickly too!\nAnyway, we needed to pump up lots of sand and oil for the machinery. The nearby pools proved to be perfect for that.\nSome of the sand even proved to have magical properties... can you say possibilities!? But that's a different tale.\nSo, we drained most of the water out and build the pumping station smack dab in the middle. Everything was going swimmingly until one day the main suction pipe got clogged.\nMind you, this part I learned later because I wasn't out there at the time.\nWhen they ratcheted up the suction on the pump, up came pieces of a robot that looked like a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;! Of course the fools worked night and day to put it back together without telling us.\nThis is when we lost communication with the pumping station.\nAfter a couple of days of silence, I sent a scouting party out to the platform. They never returned.\nI sent another group the next day with the same results, and lost a couple of &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;s out on aerial recon.\nAt that point I sent someone south to find help, and we hunkered down to prepare for the worst. We turned all of our attention to making armor, weapons and robots so that we could head out there in full force.\nWhen we did a few days ago, we couldn't believe our eyes!\nAs I was saying, what we saw out there defied explanation.\nMy people where nowhere to be found, but in their place as a veritable army of robots and androids going about their business!\nThe droids all looked like gnomes and they said that they'd been expecting us. In fact, in their own strange way, they acted like they knew us. We were surrounded and quickly taken to the top of the pumping station.\nThat's where we saw their leader and what he was doing to the surviving gnomes!\nHe called himself &lt;a href=\"Gearmaster%20Mechazod\"&gt;Gearmaster Mechazod&lt;/a&gt;. When we arrived he was busy transforming the survivors into mechanical beings!\nHe greeted us warmly and explained that he was one of the first gnomes ever to be created by something he called \"The Grand Architect\", a &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; keeper from within the halls of fabled &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nApparently, he was the blockage that my team had accidentally sucked up from where he'd malfunctioned thousands of years ago. It was just our luck that we'd built the pumping station right above him.\nThe station's mechanics had put him back together, bringing him back to \"life\".\nAnd now, by way of thanks, he was going to return the favor by curing all of us of what he called the \"&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of the Flesh&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAccording to Mechazod, it's a condition that eventually befalls all creations of the Titans! In other words, we all supposedly start out as robots of some kind, and, over thousands of years, slowly turn into fleshy beings!\nPreposterous, I know.\nIt didn't look like much of a \"cure\" to me, and I wasn't about to stand around listening to some crazy robot while he was butchering my people!\nWe did what any sane gnome would do... we ran! Well, actually, most of us parachuted off the side of the platform, but you get the picture.\nNot many of us managed to make it back here, and we're still spread thin from having to deal with everything else too, like the &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt; to the north and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to the east. To make things worse, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; just set up shop to the northwest!\nAnd that's where we find ourselves now, &lt;name&gt;.\nWe can't possibly deal with all of this by ourselves, and quite frankly, I feel a little out of my depth. Jinky knows what needs to be done. You should go see her now.\nI just hope you'll be able to get us out of this with our bodies intact."}

He tells you that &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20DeLavey\"&gt;Bishop DeLavey&lt;/a&gt; is looking for an adventurer with discretion. Intrigued, you go visiting.\nYou cross the city to arrive at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where you have an audience with the good bishop. \nThe bishop tells you that a diplomat sent to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; never arrived at his destination. The king's agents are already looking for the diplomat, but the bishop has his own contacts that he'd like to involve.\nThe bishop hands you a sealed letter, and asks that you deliver it to a fisherman named &lt;a href=\"Jorgen\"&gt;Jorgen&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, and follow any instructions he may have.\nJorgen is unhappy about it, but he's obligated to help you. He writes a letter (sealed) that he wants you to deliver to &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling Trias&lt;/a&gt;. He emphasizes that he is trusting you to keep this secret.\n&lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling Trias&lt;/a&gt; is a man with fingers in many cheeses. And to save on coin, you are his latest courier. Or agent, or whatever. Elling hands you another letter (sealed, of course) to take to &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Backus\"&gt;Watcher Backus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;. Ask him about &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; activity, suggests Elling.\n&lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Backus\"&gt;Watcher Backus&lt;/a&gt; greets you cordially enough. And when asked, he does remember some recent odd Defias activity around &lt;a href=\"Addle%27s%20Stead\"&gt;Addle's Stead&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is a long run to Addle's Stead, but you get there. Sure enough, there are Defias all over the place. Over their objections, you retrieve a docket of information from a chest at this hideout, and return with it to Watcher Backus.\nThe watcher verifies that they \"look\" authentic.\nAfter looking at the documents only briefly, Watcher Backus hands the docket back to you, saying it's too complex to be just a red herring. Definitely \"above his pay grade\". He directs you to take it back to &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling Trias&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind.\nElling, in turn, reads through the documents himself, and tells you that this is definitely his area of expertise.\nOne of the names in the docket is familiar: &lt;a href=\"Dashel%20Stonefist\"&gt;Dashel Stonefist&lt;/a&gt;, a resident of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; district. Elling asks you to follow up on this lead by talking to him.\nWhen you do, though, &lt;a href=\"Dashel%20Stonefist\"&gt;Dashel&lt;/a&gt; takes exception to you prying into his business. So much so that he sics his friends on you. You defeat him (without actually having to kill him), and he calls his friends off.\nHis part in the plan was done when Plan A failed due to some adventurers. Plan B, though, was someone from &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil&lt;/a&gt; that they'd gotten on the inside. Someone called &lt;a href=\"Tapoke%20%22Slim%22%20Jahn\"&gt;Slim&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot much, but you take it back to &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling&lt;/a&gt;.\nSurprise, surprise, Elling has a contact in &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. He's since become a bartender, a good profession for knowing things. Elling asks you to go to the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and talk to him.\nYou find &lt;a href=\"Mikhail\"&gt;Mikhail&lt;/a&gt; in the inn in Menethil Harbor. He greets you warmly, and moreso once you reveal that Elling Trias sent you. As it happens, &lt;a href=\"Tapoke%20%22Slim%22%20Jahn\"&gt;Tapoke \"Slim\" Jahn&lt;/a&gt; is in the inn with you, listening intently. As you notice him, he decides that discretion is the better part of valor and attempts to slip out unnoticed.\nToo late for him, though. You give chase, and subdue him and an accomplice in front of the inn.\nYou put the question to Slim, and he decides to turn state's evidence, considering the strength of your 'argument' outside.\nIt turns out that the diplomat you've been chasing after is none other &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the missing king of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;! Slim's job was to slip someone named &lt;a href=\"Private%20Hendel\"&gt;Hendel&lt;/a&gt; onto the king's ship.\nMikhail says he'll pass word back to Elling, and that he has may be able to help you find this 'Hendel'.\nMikhail tells you that he believes that this Hendel was one of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"marine\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt;s who come to Menethil from &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; for leave. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Samaul\"&gt;Commander Samaul&lt;/a&gt;, at &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, is the one you need to talk to about them. While he is loyal to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, he will still help you - discreetly - if you mention that &lt;a href=\"Elling%20Trias\"&gt;Elling Trias&lt;/a&gt; sent you.\n&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Samaul\"&gt;Commander Samaul&lt;/a&gt; is wary, concerned for his troops, but quickly opens up when you mention Elling. &lt;a href=\"Private%20Hendel\"&gt;Private Hendel&lt;/a&gt; was stationed at the first tower out of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentry%20Point\"&gt;Sentry Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou proceed to Sentry point, then, and meet with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tervosh\"&gt;Archmage Tervosh&lt;/a&gt;. The archmage informs you that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; has been informed of what is going on, and that she has instructed Tavosh to aid you.\n&lt;a href=\"Private%20Hendel\"&gt;Private Hendel&lt;/a&gt; is to the west, guarding some of Theramore's infiltrators who have come back from trying to locate &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall\"&gt;Brackenwall&lt;/a&gt;, the local Horde base. Archmage Tervosh promises to catch up with you for the showdown with Hendel, but has business to attend to first.\nFinally, you meet the elusive &lt;a href=\"Private%20Hendel\"&gt;Private Hendel&lt;/a&gt;. A proper soldier, he's a bit busy with his duties. You confront him, and he is outraged.\nHe assaults you (and a couple of the nearby guards assist him), but you manage to subdue him.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tervosh\"&gt;Archmage Tervosh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrive, and you pass custody of Hendel into their hands.\nLady Proudmoore thanks you for your services to the crown and country, offering you her signet ring.\nSummary.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;This is the quest chain .\nThe Missing Diplomat continuation.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Aden\"&gt;Lieutenant Aden&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; continues the Missing Diplomat quest chain when he is informed of a Defias shipwreck off the coast.

{"id": "359409", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=359409", "title": "The Monkey King", "text": "The Monkey King is a &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; who was a companion of &lt;a href=\"Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;, the last emperor of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nRise to power and Fu Zan.\nLong ago, only a few years before the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the Monkey King had become the leader of an ungovernable people. He had risen to power without spilling a single drop of blood and was beloved by every hozen tribe, despite that hozen fought endlessly, constantly, for the simplest reasons. Any disagreement meant physical violence, but the Monkey King knew this. So he told the hozen tribes, \"I am the Monkey King. Your tribe supports me with all its heart.\" When a single hozen would question him, he would tell them that their tribe's leader had already agreed to it. No hozen wanted to challenge their leader on a whim--and be in a fight--so they declared, \"You are the Monkey King.\"\nWhen the tribe leaders learned his name, all of their subjects were already calling him the Monkey King. They were confused, but they did not want to fight their people, so they did not challenge him either. The Monkey King's wild claim, his lie, eventually became true because nobody dared to disagree with it. Soon tribal fighting had ceased. The Monkey King passed judgment on all disputes and the hozen obeyed. The Jade Serpent &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt; could see the Monkey King's motivation. It was simple: he disliked the sight of blood. At the most fundamental level, this was a creature who loathed battle and loved peace. And from that, he had achieved what no other hozen ever had.\nYu'lon needed to know how deep the Monkey King's cleverness ran, so she visited him in disguise. All the Monkey King saw was another hozen, but this one did not call him king or bow before him. He demanded that she show respect. Instead, the newcomer asked him a riddle, telling him that a true king would have no trouble answering it. He snapped out the correct answer in seconds. She gave him another. He answered again. On and on they went, for three days and three nights. The Monkey King grew enraged, but even in his anger, he continued to answer her questions. Yu'lon was convinced. Violence and tyranny were not in the Monkey King's nature, or he would have tried to shut her up with force long ago. She revealed her true form-which caused considerable chaos in that hozen village-and presented him with &lt;a href=\"%3AFu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;:Fu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion&lt;/a&gt;. The Jade Serpent told him the story of &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt; and how the staff had come to be. Then she warned him: she sensed that, one day, his cleverness would not be enough to stop evil. When that day came, he would need to act decisively. The Monkey King did not believe her. But he did think the staff was very, very pretty.\nWith Fu Zan in his grasp, the Monkey King's authority over the hozen became absolute. He could bend like a willow in the wind, avoiding any blow from a challenger to the throne. The staff was as light as a feather, and yet anyone who tried to steal it found they could not lift it an inch. It was his; no one else was allowed to wield it. But there was a serious problem with Fu Zan. To look regal while carrying it, the Monkey King needed to use two hands. That meant he had no free hand for his most prized possession, a small keg that he always kept filled with brew. But that was easy to solve. The Monkey King has two metal bands added to the end of Fu Zan and hung his keg from them. Luckily, the staff was not permanently damaged.\nThe Burdens of Shaohao.\nThe Monkey King and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Prince Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; became friends. When Shaohao was crowned emperor, he embarked on a quest to save Pandaria from the impending &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and consulted his companion, the Monkey King, on how to divest himself of his burdens, to purify his spirit, and to become one with the land. The Monkey King believed that Yu'lon's prophecy had come to pass: this was the day he needed to face evil directly. He declared that he would stay by Shaohao's side until the end.\nWeary of waiting, while Shaohao meditated for days, the Monkey King whittled a strange grimacing visage out of bamboo, he urged the Emperor to place the mask of doubt on his face. While mischief was the Monkey King's motivation, the mask worked, as Shaohao pulled the mask away, his doubts took on a &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;physical form&lt;/a&gt;. The two companions then traveled to each temple of the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;, purging the Emperor with the help of the Monkey King's masks. After Emperor Shaohao gave his life to save Pandaria from the Sundering, the Monkey King went home and hurled Fu Zan into a river in a fit of rage. His friend had vanished, and the Monkey King had seemingly failed Yu'lon's prophecy. Eventually, he went to the river to retrieve the staff, but only because those waters were sacred for a &lt;a href=\"jinyu\"&gt;jinyu&lt;/a&gt; tribe, and they could not remove it themselves-it was too heavy. It still belonged to the Monkey King.\nAfter the Sundering.\nSome believed that all the other lands had been destroyed, other wanted to explore the world beyond the mists, and a few wanted to claim Pandaria for themselves, with force. Not much has been written of this brief surge of would-be tyrants. Very few of Pandaria's denizens were harmed by any of them, as whether they were mogu warlords, fringe hozen tribes, or even brutal yaungol raiders, none of them ever launched a true campaign of conquest. Before they could, they were always approached by a mysterious hozen who would chatter endlessly about a hidden cache of artifacts that had granted him untold power. He could demonstrate miracles, as no weapon could touch him, no matter how many combatants tried to attack him, and it was very convincing. These ambitious, greedy beings would eagerly follow the Monkey King's directions. Sometimes they would walk off a cliff. Sometimes they would find themselves ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;. In any case, their story always came to quick end, and the Monkey King would stride away, Fu Zan resting easily across his shoulders.\nThe Monkey King had never has such fun. Turning evil beings into stumbling fools became his most cherished pastime for years. He saw it as his way of honoring his old friend Shaohao, who now watched over the land but could no longer protect Pandaria's peoples directly. But just as Yu'lon had told him, his cleverness would one day not be enough to defeat evil. A &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; despot called &lt;a href=\"the%20Jade%20Warlord\"&gt;the Jade Warlord&lt;/a&gt; had followed the Monkey King's directions, traveling deep into a tomb beneath &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. But rather than finding nothing--as the hozen had expected--the Jade Warlord found an ancient cache of knowledge written by the Thunder King, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;. In that warlord's hands, it would grant him terrible, awful power.\nThe Monkey King knew he had made a mistake, and as the ground began to shake, he knew there was no time for anyone else to stop the mogu. He took Fu Zan and went into the tomb to deal with the problem directly.\nThe Monkey King loathed violence. He detested it. But he also knew he was the only one who could oppose the Jade Warlord before it was too late. The two of them dueled beneath Kun-Lai for hours. For years, Fu Zan had been an aid to the Monkey King's mischief-that proved to be excellent practice for avoiding the powerful, lethal magic the mogu soon unleashed. The Monkey King believed he would not leave the tomb alive that day. Indeed, he did not. But he was not killed. The Jade Warlord had no command of his new power, and an errant spell did what neither of them expected: it froze them both in jade. They remained there, locked in battle, for almost ten thousand years, able to communicate all the while.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter hearing about the Horde's acquisition of the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; began searching for a means to counter its power. His research led him to an item known as the &lt;a href=\"Harmonic%20Mallet\"&gt;Harmonic Mallet&lt;/a&gt;, which was last seen in the hands of the Monkey King. The tomb of the Monkey King is located in &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;Tomb of Conquerors&lt;/a&gt;, where he and his mogu adversary were frozen in jade. Anduin discovered an incantation to release him from the jade imprisonment but it would release the Jade Warlord as well. After the Alliance champion defeated the Jade Warlord, the Monkey King asked the champion to solve his three riddles in exchange for the whereabouts of the Harmonic Mallet: an instrument used by the Pandaren rebels in ancient times to counter the mogu's Divine Bell by turning its power into pure harmony. After solving his riddles, the Monkey King revealed that he had to break the mallet and sent his minions to hide its pieces in the far away corners of Pandaria, in order to prevent it from falling into mogu hands.\nThe Monkey King could later be seen on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, overseeing the battles in the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt;. After some time had passed, the Monkey King sensed that his travels with Fu Zan were nearing their end. So, he traveled to the temple of Yu'lon and passed the staff back into her care so that one day it can again be given up to another who is worthy to wield it.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Monkey King and his Entourage arrived to the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Ring of Balance&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tian%20Monastery\"&gt;Tian Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, observing &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20Student\"&gt;Hozen Student&lt;/a&gt;s train. He assisted Brewmaster monks of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; in obtaining his staff, &lt;a href=\"Fu%20Zan%2C%20the%20Wanderer%27s%20Companion\"&gt;Fu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion&lt;/a&gt;. First, he sent them to the Legion-assaulted &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Granary\"&gt;Imperial Granary&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Pools of Purity&lt;/a&gt; to collect items he requested. Then he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Temple%20Grounds\"&gt;Jade Temple Grounds&lt;/a&gt; and worked on a brew. Eventually, they entered the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt; where the staff was held, but it was overrun by the Legion. The monks then rescued the temple's inhabitants, defeated &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, aided &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually retrieved the staff.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacked Tian Monastery, he also helped to defend it by killing demons and assisting &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; in defeating &lt;a href=\"Skola%20Greatsword\"&gt;Skola Greatsword&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Clarion%20Bell\"&gt;Clarion Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; and joined with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, he beat down &lt;a href=\"Barnes\"&gt;Barnes&lt;/a&gt; and announced the play \"\".\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Monkey King could be found at the &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20Throne\"&gt;Hozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; tiki bar in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, flanked by two winged hozen: &lt;a href=\"Ginger-Ginger\"&gt;Ginger-Ginger&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flap-Flap\"&gt;Flap-Flap&lt;/a&gt;. When asked how they acquired wings, the Monkey King responded \"There are many secrets both mysterious and divine, you have yours and I have mine.\"\nHe later sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Gorilla%20Gorge\"&gt;Gorilla Gorge&lt;/a&gt; to deal with &lt;a href=\"gorilla\"&gt;gorilla&lt;/a&gt;s who have been made smarter by &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt;.

Although it may be considered &lt;a href=\"contested\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; characters have no settlements or NPCs and it is thus a place they use mostly for passing through to reach &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Crest\"&gt;Flame Crest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn idyllic region of rushing rivers, towering elms and rising elevations, the Redridge Mountains are under &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind's&lt;/a&gt; protection. Their inhabitants supply Stormwind with timber, fish, and crops. A force of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orcs from the Burning Steppes has once secured &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but are still in control of the northern roads. In comparison with Westfall, Redridge is still relatively stable.\nOn the western bank of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, the central hub for this faction's adventurers, offering many services and quests, as well as &lt;a href=\"flight%20path\"&gt;flight path&lt;/a&gt;s. As the town is under constant siege by &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s the townsfolk are concerned and can be seen protesting at the Town Hall. Adventurers should use caution on the roads to this town, especially the ones northbound.\nThe enemy-held &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;Tower of Ilgalar&lt;/a&gt; are connected with quests, but are also very dangerous and require a party to handle properly.\nThe crossroads known as the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt;, located in the southwest corner of the zone, connects the town of Lakeshire with Elwynn, Duskwood and, via the Lakeridge Highway, Stonewatch Keep. The highway itself is quite a dangerous place occupied by &lt;a href=\"gnolls\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, and wild animals. There are also a few camps located in Redridge \u2014 an orc camp in &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowhide%20clan\"&gt;Shadowhide&lt;/a&gt; gnoll camps near the Tower of Ilgalar, and murloc camps near the lake. While the lake's surface appears peaceful enough, murlocs reside beneath the waves, and rumors of sightings of a sea monster persist. There are also &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; nests in the Mountains.\nHistory.\nGeographically, the Redridge Mountains form the spine of the continent of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, although its many limbs and valleys have come to be known by separate, often ominous names such as '&lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;' and the '&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;'. After the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the dangerous and destructive &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; was hidden beneath the Redridge Mountains. Protected by magical wards and &lt;a href=\"Orastrasz\"&gt;Orastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, it would remain hidden for ten thousand years before Deathwing led the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; there in dreams and visions.\nCenturies ago, throughout the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate human nations flourished, among them the smallest and most isolated of the kingdoms was &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, it found prosperity through the farmsteads that dotted the surrounding fertile region, and as its population grew, small towns sprang up in the nearby regions, notably Redridge Mountains.\nAlthough claimed by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; founded its own kingdom in the northern reaches, fleeing defeat in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;.

This not only destroyed his clan's &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;new city&lt;/a&gt; but utterly devastated the ecology of northern Redridge, forever leaving it an ash-choked wasteland.\nThe humans of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; remained dominant in the unblemished southern ranges. Now a much smaller region, the Redridge Mountains were eventually conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, in which the southern kingdom was forced into exile. The humans eventually returned triumphant and began rebuilding their former holdings. Yet the orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;s would also return, this new \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" plaguing the town of Lakeshire from their former stronghold of Blackrock Mountain.\nEventually, the orcs allied with the wicked human &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Morganth\"&gt;Morganth&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Shadowhide%20Gnoll%20Clan\"&gt;Shadowhide&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; lackeys, and seized the eastern half of Redridge, capturing the human castle of &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; before the events of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". Weakened by political turmoil in Stormwind, Lakeshire was left with little military aid to fend off the encroaching orcs until the return of &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald Windsor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region remains heavily contested. Desperate, the people of Redridge seek help from outside sources, recruiting passing adventurers to help in the defense of Lakeshire and the liberation of Stonewatch.\nWith the guidance of the dragon &lt;a href=\"Darkblaze\"&gt;Darkblaze&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; have also begun invading Redridge sometime after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. An Alliance adventurer deputized by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Redridge to aid the beleaguered Stormwind guards and reform &lt;a href=\"Bravo%20Company\"&gt;Bravo Company&lt;/a&gt; to combat the threat. During their war with the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Valley&lt;/a&gt; was blown up but the Dark Horde has been driven back to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. Stonewatch Keep has also been reclaimed.\nStormwind also increased Redridge's security by constructing &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Watch\"&gt;Tower Watch&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Corners\"&gt;Three Corners&lt;/a&gt; and stationing a garrison of &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Garrison%20Watchman\"&gt;Redridge Watchmen&lt;/a&gt; there.\nAt some point in the past, &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt; hid three crystal shards from the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; that held the essence of a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; that was a key do the defense of Azeroth against the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charnas\"&gt;Charnas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gimble%20Sprysprocket\"&gt;Gimble Sprysprocket&lt;/a&gt; transported &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and her friends to the area on the \"&lt;a href=\"Cloudkicker\"&gt;Cloudkicker&lt;/a&gt;\". Due to the political situation, while Makasa and her group were in Lakeshire and surrounding areas looking for the crystal shards, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s stayed hidden somewhere in the northern mountains. The first shard was in Lakeshire, in the backyard of the &lt;a href=\"Glade\"&gt;Glade&lt;/a&gt;s' house, the second one was in a cave northeast of the village that has been guarded by a &lt;a href=\"blue%20drake\"&gt;blue drake&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Telagos\"&gt;Telagos&lt;/a&gt; for several years, and the last one was in a mine shaft of the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lakeshire quarry&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt; also secured the help from the &lt;a href=\"Everstill%20murlocs\"&gt;Everstill murlocs&lt;/a&gt;, taking them aboard the \"Cloudkicker\" to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, Redridge Mountains came under attack from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. To fight against the undead, troops of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;Stormwind Army&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; were mobilized in order to protect the region and its inhabitants.\nGeography.\nThe Redridge Mountains contain no dungeons, raid dungeons, or battlegrounds. The micro dungeon &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch\"&gt;Stonewatch&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this zone. The Redridge Range stretches from the zone of the Redridge Mountains to the zone of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;.\nRedridge Range.\nThe Redridge Range is a mountain range in the southern sub-continent of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. It reaches from the &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; in the south to what's now called the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Two hundred years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the northern reaches of the range were obliterated by the summoning of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Firelord Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and the creation of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D18\"&gt;Topographic map of Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;\nNotable characters.\nThe Redridge Mountains are home to several humans of note, the great bulk of which reside in Lakeshire. At the fallen bridge &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Marris\"&gt;Marshal Marris&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young humans to eradicate the clusters of Shadowhide gnolls and Blackrock orcs who have taken a chokehold on the land. He is assisted in his efforts by &lt;a href=\"Verner%20Osgood\"&gt;Verner Osgood&lt;/a&gt;, who also seeks to rid Redridge of the vile gnolls. And at the Lakeshire Town Hall, the aging &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt; recruits adventurers to seek help from Stormwind's other settlements like Stormwind City, Sentinel Hill, and Darkshire.\nDig sites.\nRedridge Mountains has one &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the RPG.\nThe Redridge Mountains is a lovely area surrounded by some troubled spots, but so far has been untainted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to the north were formerly part of the Redridge Mountains as well was the area of &lt;a href=\"Lethlor%20Ravine\"&gt;Lethlor Ravine&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, which was once beautiful and verdant. Both were transformed after the summoning of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the northern part of the mountains.\nSupplying the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; with timber, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and crops, the Redridge Mountains is also a vacation spot for many residents of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The tranquil woods, rivers, and lakes make it a sought-after retirement area for veterans with fish to catch and tales to tell. Only a handful of dangers trouble it: the usual monsters of the woods and the small matter of the Alliance keep overtaken by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Army\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; maintains a token presence here and handles Redridge's few crime problems. There is no better place in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to enjoy a pint.\nTo summarize, Redridge is a haven in the midst of a troubled continent.\nHistory.\nRedridge was once a larger stretch of mountains in which the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; established a colony in the northern reaches called &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurisan&lt;/a&gt; after their exile from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Their mad &lt;a href=\"thane\"&gt;thane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurisan&lt;/a&gt; befouled the region when he summoned &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Half the mountain range melted into the Burning Steppes, but the rest remained pristine.\nThese mountains and foothills were used as thoroughfares in the many wars in the past fifty years, but they somehow remained untouched while the surrounding regions suffered. Now it is the last true area wholly under Alliance influence in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and it sometimes struggles to remain so.\nGeography.\nWhile the ravaged mountains of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; border it on the north and the deadly &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; border it on the south, the Redridge Mountains more reflects the beautiful &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Redridge matches Elwynn's climate, being warm and temperate with just the right amount of rain. The higher altitude and closer proximity to the mountains make it a bit cooler than Elwynn, but no less pleasant.\nSeveral elms and pines make up the forests in this region, providing a traveler much needed relief from the sun if he is coming from far away lands, but also giving monsters and orcs good places to hide. &lt;a href=\"River\"&gt;River&lt;/a&gt;s snake through the area, most of them emptying into the massive &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough a peaceful Alliance region, the mountains remain dangerous at times, with &lt;a href=\"tarantula\"&gt;tarantula&lt;/a&gt;s in the east and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in the north, and the usual &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; prowling the forests.\nFilm universe.\nThe Redridge Mountains are depicted close to their \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnation. &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep%23Film%20universe\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; is shown falling to the .\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Although it may be considered &lt;a href=\"contested\"&gt;contested&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; characters have no settlements or NPCs and it is thus a place they use mostly for passing through to reach &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Crest\"&gt;Flame Crest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Stonard\"&gt;Stonard&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn idyllic region of rushing rivers, towering elms and rising elevations, the Redridge Mountains are under &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind's&lt;/a&gt; protection (though since the second war it is technically independent), and remain one of the last peaceful regions in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The people are content and calm, and supply Stormwind with timber, fish, and crops. A force of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; orcs from the Burning Steppes has secured &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but so far the orcs keep to themselves. In comparison with Westfall, Redridge is still relatively stable.\nOn the northern bank of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Everstill\"&gt;Lake Everstill&lt;/a&gt; is the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, the central hub for this faction's adventurers, offering many services and quests, as well as &lt;a href=\"flight%20path\"&gt;flight path&lt;/a&gt;s.

The highway itself is quite a dangerous place occupied by &lt;a href=\"dragon%20whelp\"&gt;dragon whelp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gnolls\"&gt;gnolls&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, and wild animals. There are also a few camps located in Redridge \u2014 an orc camp in &lt;a href=\"Render%27s%20Valley\"&gt;Render's Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow Hide gnoll camps near the Tower of Ilgalar, and murloc camps near the lake. While the lake's surface appears peaceful enough, murlocs reside beneath the waves, and rumours of sightings of a sea monster persist.\nGeography.\nThe Redridge Mountains contain no dungeons, raid dungeons, or battlegrounds.

Garfang had spent years conquering the other gnoll packs in the surrounding regions until he had an entire army of vicious raiders at his command. The gnolls now began launching vicious attacks on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself, but only as a distraction \u2014 while the city soldiers were busy holding off the gnoll attacks, farmsteads in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; would burn. The numbers of raiders attacking the capital were so great that the kingdom could not afford to send troops to protect the outer agricultural areas, and these events would come to be referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to stop the Redridge packlord King &lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn\"&gt;Barathen Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and a small party of elite &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s rode east to the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where Garfang's camp was located. The camp had been left exposed and undefended; the packlord had sent nearly all of his raiders to attack the capital, but had not accompanied them himself; like other gnolls, Garfang preferred to let others to his hard work for him. The battle between the king's knights and Garfang and his personal guards lasted for a full day and night until King Barathen himself sank his blade into the packlord's neck. With Garfang's death, the gnolls fell to infighting. Though several new self-proclaimed packlords arose, none had Garfang's cunning, and before long the gnolls had decimated their own numbers, allowing King Barathen, known thereafter as the Adamant, further decimate what remained of the gnoll packs. Though pockets of gnolls would remain in the distant corners of the kingdom, they would never again rise to become a major threat to Stormwind.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nRedridge gnolls have been taking &lt;a href=\"Verner%20Osgood\"&gt;Verner Osgood&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s when they stray and are led by &lt;a href=\"Yowler\"&gt;Yowler&lt;/a&gt;, who is noted to be a dangerous creature. Verner Osgood seeks directs Alliance adventurers in thinning out the Redridge tribe numbers and killing their leader.\nThey also hijacked a Stormwindian caravan.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; the Redridge entered into an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and plan on invading &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader is another Yowler, speculated to be one of the many sons of the original named after their father, is killed under &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Solomon\"&gt;Magistrate Solomon&lt;/a&gt;'s command.\nAt some point after the Cataclysm, when &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and her friends were looking for a crystal shard of the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; northeast of Lakeshire, they arrived near the area of gnolls. &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; stopped them and asked &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt; to sniff the enemy gnolls out to confirm their presence. When Hackle returned, Makasa's group quickly passed the gnolls when they were moving east to hunt &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s and entered a cave containing the crystal."}

It allowed 40% of a single secondary stat (such as critical strike, dodge, haste, hit or parry rating) or spirit to be exchanged for another secondary stat or spirit. Reforging was handled by NPCs known as &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Reforger\"&gt;Arcane Reforger&lt;/a&gt;s located in the major cities. The cost of reforging an item was equal to its sale value. Restoring an item to its original state was free. Stats could only be exchanged for other stats which are not already on the gear.

He later reappears in Cataclysm helping Alexstrasza in her battle against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; started their &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;first invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; agreed to enlist the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; against the marauding Qiraji with the night elves. Even with the might of the dragons backing them, however, the sheer numbers of the Qiraji and silithid proved overwhelming. And so Anachronos called upon the progeny of the remaining flights, including Caelestrasz of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nCaelestrasz, along with &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, pushed the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; back into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; to allow &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, and the night elves to create a magical barrier to hold in the Qiraji. The three dragons and their companions flew headlong into the Qiraji legions, into the city where they hoped their sacrifice would not be in vain. Though the magical barrier was created, the three dragons were lost within the walls, where they still remain today, in humanoid form, as prisoners of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight Highlands.\nCaelestrasz, in his &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; guise Calen, reappears outside &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Lirastrasza\"&gt;Lirastrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, Alexstrasza confronts &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. After several minutes of battle, Deathwing and Alexstrasza fall from the top of the mountain towards the ground, clutched tightly in each others' claws, determined to destroy each other. Calen and the player fly in pursuit. Alexstrasza, exhausted and gravely injured, is reduced to mortal form and lays on the ground halfway down the mountain. Deathwing continues to fall beyond the crest ouf the mountain, out of sight. Calen (who likewise takes elven form), the player and the player's drake race to the dragon queen's side. Like a phantom, Deathwing rises up, his gigantic form casting a shadow over the land. Deathwing sets the ground at his feet aflame, glowering over the group. Calen runs back to put himself between his queen and Deathwing. You throw Alexstrasza's body over your mounts back and take her to safety. Calen takes his true form again, and your drake launches you in the air, flying away with all haste despite Alexstrasza's protests. Calen, while gigantic by mortal standards, is completely dwarfed by the Black Aspect. Realizing he can't stand a chance against Deathwing, he shoots a fireball or two at him, darting back and forth to distract him and keep him from pursuing you.\nBastion of Twilight.\nCalen also appears in his night elf guise during the &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; encounter, the heroic only final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. In this fight, he does battle with Sinestra, only to lose his life in the process. Upon dying, he grants the raid a 3 minute buff, granting 100% additional haste.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nDeathwing has returned. He's seized Grim Batol and much of the Highlands, and I feel near powerless to stop him.\nSoon, our queen shall arrive, and together we shall put the once Earthwarder in his place."}

At some point it became part of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the island was invaded by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the fortress sacked, and the sacred &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt; captured. The stone was hewn into pieces which were used to create the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; structures which allowed &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;instill magic&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde's &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; allies.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; embarked for the isle on a mission of mercy to aid and comfort the survivors of the bloody raid, he was ambushed by privateers from &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;. In the naval battle that followed, some of the sailors were captured; during questioning in Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt;, they confessed their nation's treachery to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, leading to Alterac's eventual ruin.\nThe Barovs and Scholomance.\nFollowing the Second War, the fortress at Caer Darrow was restored. The manor was the &lt;a href=\"Barov\"&gt;Barov&lt;/a&gt;'s primary residence amidst their far-reaching empire which comprised Caer Darrow, &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring these times of peace, the &lt;a href=\"Fordring\"&gt;Fordring&lt;/a&gt;s would often visit Caer Darrow for their excursions. During their last visit, &lt;a href=\"Artist%20Renfray\"&gt;Artist Renfray&lt;/a&gt; painted the portrait of them poised along the beachside. \nAs the years closed to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the aristocrats became depressed, greedy, and rageful. After decades of rule, in order to preserve their fortune and hold of the land well past their lifespan, the Barovs made a deal with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. The once opulent keep of Caer Darrow secretly became the horrific &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, a school of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nSix months passed and the keep became decrepit and inhabited by dark &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; beings. &lt;a href=\"Acolyte\"&gt;Acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s of the Cult learned their craft, while the family servants were used as experiments for the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, while the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; did not even yet fully exist in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, a devastating disease, which was not the Plague that the Scourge would employ later but an experience of Scholomance, was unleashed and ravaged Caer Darrow before a visit from Uther the Lightbringer was scheduled. None survived, while the plague variant compelled its victims to wander as ghosts.

Allying with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; upon its arrival on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne stood as one of its wisest and most venerated leaders, until his unfortunate death in a duel against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the new Warchief of the Horde. He was succeeded as chief by his son &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly history.\nThe fearless and wizened leader of the Bloodhoof Tauren, Cairne lived near the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. He was childhood friends with &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;. His lifemate was &lt;a href=\"Tamaala\"&gt;Tamaala&lt;/a&gt;, who bore their son &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, but she died prior to the Third War.\nCairne was a peerless warrior and a wise leader of his ancient people. Though slowed somewhat by the weight of age, Cairne still possessed great strength and valor. He knew that his people were in grave danger of extermination from the marauding &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s. However, he never gave up hope of one day finding a way to lead his people to a new land where they could make their home and live in peace. Concerned about the rising threat of vicious centaur tribes, Cairne sought to establish home for all tauren tribes in the land of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Centaur%20Marauders\"&gt;Centaur marauders&lt;/a&gt;' attacked his people and their hunting of local game to near extinction.\nThird War.\nThings changed when Cairne met &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the young &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the new &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and, watching him battle and destroy a group of centaurs who had been attacking a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, he became intrigued with their nobility and savagery. When Thrall told him that they came to look for their destiny, Cairne directed him to the north, where there was an Oracle.\nThrall reported seeing an army of centaur going north, and Cairne quickly left to defend his village. Thrall brought his followers with him and followed Cairne to defend the village. After defending against wave after wave of centaur warriors, Cairne told Thrall of his plight, and Thrall vowed to protect the caravan of Tauren as they crossed the barrens to Mulgore, in exchange for the location of the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.\nCairne and Thrall managed to evade and defeat the centaur marauders, and finally made it to Mulgore. Cairne told Thrall that the Oracle was within &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and bid him good luck.\nUpon arriving at Stonetalon, Thrall was surprised to find that Cairne had sought him out, and pledged to repay the debt they owed Thrall and the Horde. Cairne enlisted the &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s to help them and helped to free them from the harpies. He then helped to claim the peak from the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s so that they could enter freely. However, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; entered first.\nCairne and Thrall split upon entering the bowels of Stonetalon, and Cairne found an enchanted spirit stone that would activate an ethereal bridge towards the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;. When they found the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne and Thrall found Jaina already there. All three spoke to the Oracle, who told them that they must all ally if they wished to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The three hesitantly agreed.\nCairne's wisdom and strength, and the power of his tauren warriors, helped Thrall to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. In a combined effort, the sorcery of all three races were needed to purge the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic influence from Hellscream. United in arms, Cairne pledged the loyalty of his race to the Horde, and together, they managed to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; once again.\nFounding of Durotar.\nCairne helped the orcs establish their new nation of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; before bidding them farewell and leaving to take his own people to a new land in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. There, they established a strong defense against the centaurs and &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; who harassed them. Several months later, however, Cairne's son, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, was captured by centaurs. Cairne feared the worst, and slipped into a lethargic depression. His followers scrambled to lead their people adequately, but they were no substitute for Cairne's wisdom. His second, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20%28tauren%29\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt;, tried to help Cairne, but Cairne would not hear of it. Tagar feared that without the leadership of Cairne, the tauren would not last long.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; arrived to ask Cairne for the tauren's assistance in the coming battle against &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; forces, Cairne told them to leave him and tell Thrall that he had died. Tagar told the heroes of Baine's capture, and they quickly left to investigate his disappearance. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt;, they recovered Baine and returned him to his happy father.\nCairne, overjoyed, told Rexxar that not only would he pledge the service of his people to Thrall once more, he would be returning himself. He joined with Rexxar's band of warriors and returned to &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow\"&gt;Dustwallow&lt;/a&gt;, and then helped to repel Proudmoore's forces. Victorious, they then took the fight to the humans and ended Proudmoore's invasion. Cairne returned to his people and his son in Mulgore.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nCairne also recognized that the nomadic traditions of tauren society were a danger to the survival of the people. There were few tauren, and their wandering lifestyle meant that they would be vulnerable to attacks by centaur, quilboar and other races. With the help of the Horde, Cairne secured the grasslands of Mulgore as a permanent home for all the tauren tribes and constructed their first city high atop &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;.\nOver time, the scattered tauren tribes united under Cairne\u2019s rule. There were a few tribes disagreeing about the direction their new nation should take, but all agreed that Cairne was the wisest and best suited to lead them towards the future. Yet Cairne was not without his detractors. Although Cairne welcomed all tribes in their newly established capital of Thunder Bluff, Elder Crone &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; often butted heads with the high chieftain, believing she should lead the tauren.\nCairne assigned &lt;a href=\"Maggran%20Earthbinder\"&gt;Maggran Earthbinder&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. He also sent &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Thurloga\"&gt;Primalist Thurloga&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; in order to assist the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nCairne Bloodhoof was a &lt;a href=\"faction%20leader\"&gt;faction leader&lt;/a&gt; located on the &lt;a href=\"High%20Rise\"&gt;High Rise&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. He honored members of the Horde who attained the title of &lt;a href=\"The%20Loremaster\"&gt;Loremaster&lt;/a&gt; by delivering to them their &lt;a href=\"Loremaster%27s%20Colors\"&gt;Loremaster's Colors&lt;/a&gt;. When the Horde entered into negotiations with Quel'Thalas, he openly opposed the blood elves' methods, but recognized the Blood Knights' strategic value.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt; were mysteriously being haunted by a powerful Earth Elemental. Cairne Bloodhoof was hesitant to drive it away because he wanted to understand what has disturbed it first, so as to discover what has disturbed the natural balance of Azeroth. During a night, it was said that Cairne left the city and the gladiator champion named &lt;a href=\"Lo%27Gosh\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; was able to defeat it and cleanse the Pools of Vision. Magatha Grimtotem glorified Lo'Gosh's victory in order to discredit Cairne for being unable to cleanse the elemental from the Pools of Vision. However, &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rehgar\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt; and his gladiators thought that the elemental was Magatha's doing.\nStormrage.\nWhen the Nightmare attacked Azeroth, Cairne was among the first of the tauren to fall under it's sway and into slumber.\nElemental Unrest.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; invasion, Cairne defends the main mesa of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; from attacking elementals. He also assists Horde players in the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kai%27ju%20Gahz%27rilla\"&gt;Kai'ju Gahz'rilla&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nCairne traveled to Garrosh at Warsong Hold where he also met Saurfang in whose eyes could see that ghost will be haunting him. While the elder orc remained in Northrend, Grom's son went with Cairne to Garrosh's Landing from where they should aboard the ship that Cairne came. However, they were attacked by Kvaldir and were forced to retreat. Surprisingly, Garrosh revealed hidden grenades which were used against invading Kvaldir. Both, the tauren and the Mag'har orc then entered the ship and sailed into Orgrimmar. However, a natural catastrophe occurred and when it was over, an alliance ship came in view and he witnessed Garrosh's brutality and mercy. Cairne was impressed with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s ability as a commander after visiting &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend. After they came into Orgrimmar, Cairne, Hamuul and other tauren representatives took a part in Garrosh's ceremony, where it was decided that Hamuul would go to a meeting with Cenarion Circle druids in order to get help of materials for the Horde. After the ceremony was over, Cairne saw Magatha speaking with Garrosh and set off home with tauren veterans and Perith to Baine.\nLater on, he opposes his selection as Thrall's replacement, and makes his feelings known to the outgoing Warchief; the old friends bitterly part ways as Thrall leaves for Outland, both leaders refusing to budge on their positions. Some time later, Cairne met with Hamuul and discussed how Garrosh had had Orgrimmar rebuilt. Cairne had not liked the more aggressive ways of the older Horde and now, Orgrimmar looked like as if it was their bastion.\nUpon receiving word from the owl Hamuul sent, that the new Warchief sanctioned the killing of innocent druids (actually carried out by orcs loyal to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;), Cairne issues a \"&lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;\", challenging Garrosh for the leadership of the Horde. Garrosh accepts but adds the caveat that the combat would not be the non-lethal combat sanctioned by Thrall, but by the old laws - to the death. Cairne agrees, and the combatants meet in the arena in Orgrimmar.\nEach combatant is allowed one weapon and no armor. Cairne takes up his &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Runespear\"&gt;Bloodhoof Runespear&lt;/a&gt;, a sacred weapon of the Bloodhoof chieftains, while Garrosh carries &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt;, the axe that belonged to his father, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The weapons are blessed by shaman; Gorehowl is blessed by &lt;a href=\"Magatha%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Magatha Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, who seems approving of the new Warchief. At first gaining the upper hand, the Runespear is shattered by Gorehowl and Cairne takes a glancing slash in the chest. Cairne suddenly becomes faint and unable to raise what remained of his Runespear to defend himself, and he realizes that Magatha has poisoned Garrosh's weapon. Cairne's last thought is a lament - that he, who had lived with honor, would die betrayed, just as the howling axe of Hellscream slices into his neck. The tauren leader dies before he even hits the ground.\nThe moment Cairne died, Magatha orders the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; to take over Thunder Bluff and the surrounding towns, murdering everyone who stood in their way. Baine, Cairne's son and heir, manages to escape, and with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Jevan%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Jevan Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the goblins of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;, retakes Thunder Bluff and exiles Magatha and the surviving Grimtotems who chose to follow her instead of Jevan. Baine is formally installed as leader of Thunder Bluff and chieftain of the tauren.\nCairne's remains are placed upon a pyre along with the shattered debris of his Runespear. Thrall returns from Outland to mourn him, regretting that he parted on bad terms with his friend. He weeps for the loss of a future lifetime of his friendship, his kindness, wisdom, and humor. Thrall speaks to the wind, hoping that Cairne's spirit hears him, to tell him that Cairne and the tauren were always the heart of the Horde - their true spiritual center, of forgiveness, compassion, and guidance. Thrall places his hand reverently on Cairne's now peaceful brow, to say a final goodbye to his old friend, and took with him the smallest piece of Cairne's Runespear to forever remember him and be in touch with his heart. The fragment was etched with a single rune, whose meaning did not escape Thrall - \"healing\".\nDeath and legacy.\nAfter his death and the retaking of Thunder Bluff, &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20totem\"&gt;his totem&lt;/a&gt; was collected by Baine. During &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt;, Cairne is shown being honored by his son and the elders of Thunder Bluff. He is then allowed to join the other elders in the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20World\"&gt;Spirit World&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the trial of Garrosh Hellscream, Cairne's ghost was &lt;a href=\"Death%20ritual\"&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Kador%20Cloudsong\"&gt;Kador Cloudsong&lt;/a&gt; in order to speak with Baine who was troubled with defending Garrosh. He advised him to do the thing he feels is the best. Apparently, Cairne knew about the outcome that will come but was not allowed to say it and thus vanished.\nYears later, during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, malevolent spirits rose up to attack Mulgore. Baine and a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;powerful champion&lt;/a&gt; of the tauren people stood together before the chieftain's tent in Thunder Bluff to banish it, but as Baine called on it to be destroyed, the spirits of Cairne and Tamaala appeared before him. Cairne reminded Baine that the tauren way was harmony, not destruction, and that light and shadow were both needed to see what lay before them. Thanks to Baine and the champion, the spirits were in balance again. Baine asked if his parents could stay longer, as he had so much to tell them; Cairne gently told him that he knew, but that conversation would have to be for another time. As he returned to the Spirit World, Cairne expressed pride in his son, and admonished him to remember that the Earth Mother watched over him - as did he and Tamaala. To this day, Cairne and Tamaala's souls remain on Azeroth, awaiting the day Baine will join with them.\nPersonality.\nCairne was dedicated to serving his people and to watching over their safety in an ever-darkening world. An outstanding warrior, Cairne was considered one of the most dangerous creatures alive. Despite his strength and valor, he was a gentle soul who longs only for the peace and tranquility of the open plains. It was rumored that if he could lay the responsibilities of chieftain on another, Cairne would leave Thunder Bluff in an instant and retire to the wilds. Many believed that he was training his son, Baine, to take his place as chieftain one fateful day.\nIn the RPG.\nCairne Bloodhoof is the High Chieftain of the United Tauren Tribes.\nHe employs only tauren &lt;a href=\"holy%20strider\"&gt;holy strider&lt;/a&gt;s, out of respect of their long heritage. Although his demeanor does not suggest a covert mind, Cairne does not disclose how many holy striders he employs, only that they are all tauren. &lt;a href=\"Perith%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Perith Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;, a notable holy strider works only for Cairne Bloodhoof and keeps many of his leader\u2019s secrets (even secrets &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; doesn\u2019t know).\nCairne is the spiritual leader for the tauren tribes in Kalimdor. He has an incredibly strong connection with the environment and deeply respects both the elemental forces and the natural beasts of the wild.\nCairne is an extremely wise individual, but his lumbering demeanor often comes across as ponderously slow to members of other races. He always prefers to contemplate problems before acting to try to solve them, and frequently meditates for several days in a row without interruption. However, when he does decide to act, Cairne can rarely be deterred from his path. He fights with incredible passion but is never out of control. He prefers to observe his enemies before fighting them so that he can more fully understand their strengths and weaknesses.\nCairne has a very trusting attitude toward orcs and greatly respects their newly shamanistic culture. Night elves are likewise regarded positively because of their strong connection with the woodland environment. However, he usually avoids humans, dwarves and goblins; and if they must be dealt with, he tends to treat them in a patronizing manner. Cairne believes that the spiritual eyes of these races have not fully opened yet and that members of these races are, in essence, children who are still learning and must be coddled. He has great disdain for the arcane practices of high elves and deeply resents their abandonment of the natural ways.\nTactics.\nThunder Bluff is a very easy city to get into. It can be under-guarded by Horde players so you do not always have to worry about them. Get the entire raid onto an elevator and go up. However, if word of incoming Alliance raids reaches the Horde, it is likely that shamans and balance druids will blow players off the platforms, making it much much more difficult to get to him. Run straight for the giant totem pole in the center and run up it to Cairne's rise. Go to the center of the little amphitheater and AoE all the guards that you pulled. Then pull and kill Cairne.\nCairne isn't as difficult to deal with as the other Horde bosses. He has several knock-back attacks that he will use on the tank as well as a random charge. The main tank should immediately run behind Cairne, while the rest of the raid should spread out. No one is to go beyond the first set of tents because if Cairne charges them, he will run back to his tent and reset.\nWithout the worry of a reset, Cairne was a really simple fight and could be downed without much resistance.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nGreetings young one, and welcome to Thunder Bluff. You'll find safe refuge from the burdens of the world here. All denizens of the Horde are welcome here.\nThe spirits of the present and past come alive here in this sacred place, my friend. Honor them, and in doing so honor yourself.\nAlternate timeline.\nIn an alternate timeline, Cairne died just like he did in the main universe. As a contrast, his son avenged his father by killing Garrosh and becoming the next Warchief of the Horde. When Warchief Baine was teleported inside the Temple of the White Tiger, it was Cairne's words that enabled him to accept his other self.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Once the princess of the fallen kingdom, she is now a member of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; after having been raised into undeath by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nCalia survived the destruction of her homeland during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and went into hiding for years, eventually reappearing as a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoping to reunite with her lost husband and daughter, whom she had become separated from during the Third War, Calia later worked with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to organize the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, where undead Forsaken could get the opportunity to reunite with their living &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; relatives. During the event, Calia was slain by the Forsaken's ruler &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, but was subsequently resurrected as an undead infused with the Light under the guidance of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, to whom she had grown close, Calia eventually joined the Forsaken, assisted in the reclamation of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and now serves as a member of the reformed Desolate Council governing the faction.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nCalia is the eldest child of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lianne%20Menethil\"&gt;Queen Lianne&lt;/a&gt;. She was two years older than her brother &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, who was born in year 4 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;, which puts her birth at around 6 BDP. Although Calia was older, Arthas, as the firstborn son, was the heir apparent to the throne. As such, Calia was never formally taught about politics, since no one ever expected her to rule. Calia loved her brother and the two got along \"well enough\". She was doted on by her father, but although Terenas was a kind and understanding man, he made clear that he would choose his son-in-law, and that Calia would agree to it.\nCalia was in the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;royal palace&lt;/a&gt; with her family during the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;Siege of Capital City&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. During the eleven-year-old &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s brief stay in Capital City, she and the fourteen-year-old Calia became close friends.\nWhen Calia was sixteen, still two years away from marriage, Terenas planned to betroth her against her will to the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; noble &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, who was secretly the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in disguise. Deathwing hoped that by taking control of Alterac and wedding the daughter of one of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful monarchs, he would put himself in a political position from which he could undermine and destroy humanity from within. Calia was deeply upset at the idea of being forced to marry a man she didn't know, but Terenas, who was in secret being magically controlled by Deathwing, refused to accept her protests. Calia made Arthas promise to not do the same thing to his own children and to marry a woman who loved him. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, Prestor disappeared and the plans of his betrothal to Calia dwindled away.\nFive years later, Calia attended Arthas' ceremony to become a member of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. After the ceremony, she hugged her brother and told him that his family was proud of him. As Arthas grew up and Terenas turned his attention toward him, Calia fell in love with someone her father would never have approved of: a Lordaeron &lt;a href=\"footman\"&gt;footman&lt;/a&gt;. It was her way of bucking Terenas' plan for her; had she been heir to the throne, she would have gone along with it.\nOnce in the dark of night, they snuck away and begged a priestess to marry them; when the woman refused, the couple returned many times until she finally agreed. Eventually, Calia became pregnant and confided in her mother Lianne. While at first furious, Lianne could tell from Calia's face that it was true love and aided her in keeping her relationship and pregnancy a secret after she was assured that her grandchild would be legitimate. A few weeks after giving birth, it was decided the father would raise their daughter away from Lordaeron, ignorant of her birthright. Lianne promised that once Arthas was properly wed and produced an heir, they would acknowledge Calia's daughter and possibly elevate her husband to a nobleman's status.\nCalia once listened to &lt;a href=\"Benedictus%20Voss\"&gt;Benedictus Voss&lt;/a&gt;'s sermons. She had met and knew Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; well enough to easily recognize his face. She and the great Lordaeronian historian &lt;a href=\"Parqual%20Fintallas\"&gt;Parqual Fintallas&lt;/a&gt; also knew each other.\nThird War.\nCalia was officially thought to have perished on the day Arthas murdered their father. Arthas himself believed his sister to have died, but in truth, she survived. Calia doesn't remember much of the time, other than that she at one point hid in a muddy trench for two days to avoid prowling &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEventually, Calia made her way to &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, where her husband and child had been hidden away and were safe from the Scourge, and tearfully reunited with her beloved family. With everyone assuming she was dead she lived there in secret with her family for some time until the town was attacked by &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;. The three fled along with the rest of the town, but Calia was once again separated from her family in the crowd. Screaming their names in the middle of the street, a man pulled her onto his horse and galloped past the town limits barely in time, and she joined a cluster of refugees in the forest. She prayed she'd be one of those that would be reunited with their loved ones, but this time she never saw them again, not knowing their fate.\nAt some point, while escaping from mindless undead, Calia stumbled upon one who was still sane and who she recognized. &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, who was a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, showed her that not all undead had lost their minds and there were some who still were themselves even after death. This made her understand that the Forsaken and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; were two separate entities, with the former still deserving of dignity and compassion. That gave her the chance to move through her shock and pain to a place of healing. Seeing the Forsaken as her old friends still living, she hoped that if her family had been killed by the undead and raised, they would live on as Forsaken instead of mindless Scourge.\nLegion.\nHaving become a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; at some point, Calia reappeared during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; alongside Alonsus and was initially encountered by priests at &lt;a href=\"Faol%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Faol's Rest&lt;/a&gt;. As a member of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;, Calia traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; to return the &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saraka\"&gt;Saraka&lt;/a&gt; back to its holy form, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;. She later became a champion to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;High Priest&lt;/a&gt;.\nCalia participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Ishanah\"&gt;High Priestess Ishanah&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; met Calia at the Netherlight Temple. After Faol introduced her as Terenas Menethil's daughter, Anduin considered her the rightful queen of Lordaeron, and was shocked and relieved to know she had survived. As Anduin worked with the Conclave to heal &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' destruction and reconcile the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and their human counterparts, Anduin began to see Calia as a kindred spirit and developed a bond with her similar to the one he had with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Calia was also fond of Anduin and saw in him similarities to her beloved little brother Arthas before he became evil.\nSometimes Calia would dream of happier times, like when she sang lullabies to her infant daughter and spent time with her family. During one such dream, Calia sadly considered how her daughter would never inherit her birthright. However, her dreams frequently turned into night terrors involving the undead before she awoke from them. Usually, Calia would speak of her dreams with the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;. Saa'ra would tell Calia that the nightmares will stop once she was ready for them to stop and that there are things she must do and become before that peace would be granted unto her. However, Saa'ra also warned that some of her trials may involve pain and blood. Though Calia admitted it didn't make her feel any better, Saa'ra told her it might once she understood that even painful developments may become hidden gifts and to trust in the purpose of her destiny. Saa'ra's insights would ease her apprehension, and she would try to repress the horrors she had endured or the memories of her daughter. Instead, she would retreat into a darkness that granted safety for wild creatures, momentary privacy for those who wanted to create, and sanctuary from her troubles. Saa'ra's warmth would then comfort her and told her to sleep in peace. As Calia left to return to her room for rest, her friend &lt;a href=\"Elinor\"&gt;Elinor&lt;/a&gt; privately spoke with her to inform her of King Anduin's plans for a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; between Forsaken and their living relatives. The conversation filled Calia with hope and purpose, making her feel as if healing had finally come her way.\nAnduin, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, and Calia later worked to recruit suitable human participants for the Gathering from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s side. As they worked together, Anduin asked Calia if she sought to reclaim the throne of &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. When Calia asked if Anduin would aid her in reclaiming her throne even if it meant war, Anduin became conflicted. Before Anduin could respond, Calia reassured him she had no intention of reclaiming Lordaeron and the best she could do for her people in the Forsaken is to work to ensure the Gathering's success. However, she did request to participate in the Gathering. Since his body did not respond to any nefarious intentions, Anduin agreed to permit it should Faol also consent. Anduin also asked Calia if she had a child that could one day become her heir, to which Calia did acknowledge a daughter and told Anduin the tragic tale of her family. Anduin surmised the reason she identified with the Forsaken is she hoped to be reunited with her family at the Gathering should they have been raised as undead. She later disguised herself and secretly observed the reunion between her friend Alonsus Faol, &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, and King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nCalia attended the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; as one of the priests that were offering the participants their blessings. Disguised in a cloak and hood, she healed &lt;a href=\"Ol%27%20Emma\"&gt;Ol' Emma&lt;/a&gt; when she fainted from heatstroke. This brought the attention of &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Elsie Benton&lt;/a&gt; who she had a pleasant conversation with. As the day went, &lt;a href=\"Parqual%20Fintallas\"&gt;Parqual Fintallas&lt;/a&gt; recognized Calia beneath her hooded cloak and saw it as a reason and opportunity to defect into the Alliance. He asked Calia for a blessing and whispered to her, saying, \"We need you now. It's time. You'll see. Be ready.\" Shortly after, Parqual, his daughter &lt;a href=\"Philia%20Fintallas\"&gt;Philia&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Felstone\"&gt;Felstone&lt;/a&gt; family began to walk towards &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 where the Alliance were stationed. As Calia Menethil saw this unfold, she revealed her true identity and took it upon herself to try to convince the other Forsaken on the field to join the Alliance, first speaking with Elsie. After being made aware of her existence, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; personally flew through the field and murdered Calia, who she saw as a threat to her authority. Calia's corpse was later sent back to Netherlight Temple but miraculously did not decompose. Saa'ra informed Anduin and Alonsus that they would together bring Calia back as the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and she herself would have her be, and the two priests proceeded to raise the fallen Menethil back as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; touched by the Light. Calia explained to Anduin that although she was untrained in the ways of politics, as Arthas was supposed to inherit the throne, and did not intend for the Gathering to become a bloodbath nor reassert her claim to Lordaeron, she could not stand by and let a usurper like Sylvanas butcher her people out of jealousy. Seeing the Forsaken as her people, Calia had followed her heart on the field to accept them as her responsibility but now acknowledged that she was not yet ready to lead as she hadn't been the heir to the throne. For now, she would learn under Faol how to be an undead walking in the Light to better serve her people.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nA set of &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Scarlet Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; propaganda pamphlets can be found near the &lt;a href=\"Calston%20Estate\"&gt;Calston Estate&lt;/a&gt; in Tirisfal. In the pamphlets, the Brotherhood makes a number of spurious claims, including that &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; is an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;-loving traitor who worked with his \"lover\" &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to stage a fake massacre at the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. According to the Brotherhood, this was done in order to drum up sympathy for the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and to lure out Calia so that she could be murdered and raised into undeath, allowing Anduin to marry her and usurp Lordaeron. The pamphlets advise members of the order to rally behind the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and help him wipe out the Forsaken, after which they will turn on Greymane and destroy the worgen as well in order to ensure that Lordaeron belongs only to \"pure-blooded humans\". Finally, the pamphlets state that the Brotherhood has secretly raised someone that they claim to be the son of Princess Calia and an &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; nobleman and therefore the rightful king of Lordaeron (apparently ignoring the fact that Calia's actual child was a daughter with a common footman, not a son with a nobleman). The Brotherhood promises that they will reveal this so-called Menethil heir and place him on the throne after the undead and worgen have been wiped from the land, thereby restoring the &lt;a href=\"House%20Menethil\"&gt;Menethil&lt;/a&gt; dynasty.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina Proudmoore told Anduin that she had heard rumors about Calia and asked the king to tell her what happened in Arathi. After &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; reunited the recently resurrected &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; with his sister, Jaina brought Derek to Calia in the hopes that she could help him.\nIn time, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries clashed with Sylvanas's loyalists, which saw the conflict ending in Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. In the aftermath, Jaina met with Calia and Derek at &lt;a href=\"Seabreeze%20Village\"&gt;Seabreeze Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting, Calia and Derek learned that the war was over and it was implied that Calia and Derek had grown close. As the three conversed, the Proudmoore siblings remarked that &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; would benefit from Calia's guidance, much like Derek had. Unbeknownst to the three, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; was spying on their meeting at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, who after being informed of the details remarked that she must act quickly.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on Azeroth, Calia received a letter from Lilian asking her to help the Forsaken in the wake of their abandonment by Sylvanas. Calia agreed as she wanted to help her people and honor her father and the name Menethil. In another meeting in Stormsong Valley, she informed Jaina and Derek of her decision to leave &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. To her surprise, Derek decided to accompany her. Jaina accepted Calia and Derek's decisions but insisted on first bringing them to &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tandred%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Tandred&lt;/a&gt; so they could get a proper farewell. Calia and Derek traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Calston%20Estate\"&gt;Calston Estate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, where Lilian apologized for her role in Derek's rebirth and introduced the two to &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the other Forsaken &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who had likewise been abandoned by Sylvanas. Calia and Derek quickly offered to help the undead elves and subsequently left the estate with them, vowing to help them find a future rooted in something beyond hatred and malice.\nShadows Rising.\nAt some point after the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Calia joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and became a councilor of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nKnowing that the Forsaken couldn't remain in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; forever, Voss and Calia sought a new home for their people, while believing that the ruins of Lordaeron could one day be reclaimed and their homes there restored. Despite the truce between the Horde and Alliance, they knew that the Alliance ships wouldn't be happy to see Horde flags at sea, though Calia was confident that Derek could intervene on their behalf if they were intercepted. Calia then attended a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting where &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; noticed that she appeared to be watching Voss's every move, as if she might be tested on it later. When Calia and Voss explained why they had been late to said meeting, she brought up her belief about Derek causing &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; to declare that &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; could do nothing for them as she blamed them for the death of her father, &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and objected to peace with Jaina. However, Voss was quick to remind her that Derek was one of the Forsaken and that the Forsaken were the Horde. The meeting was soon adjourned.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; shaman &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; warned Thrall that something was terribly wrong in the spirit world, Thrall made the decision to go to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and decided to bring &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and Calia, due to her desire to bridge the divide between the Forsaken and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; who were raised into undeath, with him. She was struck by the beauty of Nordrassil and considered it a place of mourning after sensing the darkness over the place. Upon meeting with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Calia found herself shifting nervously in the face of their frosty, rigid silence. Thrall subsequently formally apologized to the night elves and cited Calia as an example of how the Horde hoped to change. Nodding silently by Thrall's side, she listened as he revealed to them how Voss now spoke for the Forsaken and how both women sought to reforge themselves anew, free of Sylvanas, free of her poisonous influence.\nWhen the meeting started to dissolve into an argument about &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;responsibility&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Calia voiced that these disagreements were a distraction and that the divided sides only kept them from apprehending the one who gave the order. In the aftermath of Tyrande's revelation that she saw their words as empty pledges of justice, Calia, along with Baine, allowed herself to be corralled out of the area by Yukha. However, Thrall refused to be corralled out and promised Tyrande that he would deliver what is owed: Sylvanas's head. The group subsequently departed Nordrassil and arrived in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; soon after.\nDeath Rising.\nCalia joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; in convening atop of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. She soon learned from &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had also been abducted, and that an attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who neutralized her attackers. She reflected on how she thought she understood the Forsaken when she was among the living, only to truly see the depths of what they have endured after her resurrection. She further revealed that with the help of &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, she found ways to help those who felt abandoned and alone. She then declared that all of Azeroth trembled beneath the specter of death. And fear, that if left unchecked will consume every soul it touches. She thus vowed to not allow that to happen, not to the people of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, nor to any who fight for the good of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; expresses satisfaction at the death of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and hope that &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s rage remains fixed upon &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Calia reminds him that she had given counsel to the kaldorei who were raised into undeath after the battle for Darkshore. She further explained how she hoped giving them a path forward and sharing this knowledge with Tyrande, would help ease her spirits, if only a little. In response, Lor'themar revealed that &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; had informed him of her efforts and hoped that fate would offer her the chance to see her kind offer bear fruit.\nDuring this time she spoke with &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; and affirmed a friendship with her.\nShadowlands.\nCalia joined the council in a meeting with the leaders of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. When Lor'themar voiced how they couldn't afford to go on what might well be a suicide mission to rescue their allies for the stability of the Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; grew hostile. Though prepared to battle alongside the Horde, Calia reminded Tyrande that the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; needed her in order to have any hope of finding peace. However, Tyrande was unmoved and was outraged that Calia spoke of peace, in light of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;atrocities&lt;/a&gt; committed by the Forsaken during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the Horde and Alliance stood down when Bolvar reminded them that they could not afford another conflict in Azeroth. Calia then witnessed the ritual to open the doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and watched as &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and even Tyrande Whisperwind enter to rescue their comrades and seek out Sylvanas.\nCalia later traveled with &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the Shadowlands to meet up with Bolvar there. The pair pleaded for Bolvar to use the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; to seek out their allies who had been captured by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his initial reluctance, as such attempts seemed to be costly and dangerous, Bolvar was eventually moved by his daughter's repeated pleas, and he agreed to honor the request of his \"Shining Star\". While Talia was chilled by the cries of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Calia focused on how they hadn't heard &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and thus asked if Bolvar could try again to find them. However, Bolvar revealed that there was a price to be paid for such visions, and he dare not attempt another so soon.\nFollowing Baine's and Thrall's recovery from &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, Calia sent word to &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. After discovering that Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; intend to turn Anduin into a weapon, Calia stated that the Light is strong with Anduin, and believed the Light would help him see things through.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of the Jailer, Bolvar felt a darkness calling to him within Torghast. Though Calia was worried over the effects of peering within Torghast would have on him, Bolvar declared that they must know the truth. She subsequently learned that a new mourneblade was being forged within the tower and that the Jailer decided that the time had come for Anduin to become his agent, regardless of his choice. When the Jailer attempted to gain control of Bolvar, Calia learned that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was meant to herald his coming. As a result of this, while Calia still acknowledged that her brother had made his choices, she felt that the Jailer had a hand in them too.\nEternity's End.\nAfter the Jailer's defeat, Calia attended Sylvanas's trial in the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; alongside a visiting Lilian Voss.\nSometime later she joined &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in mustering in the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as they sought to reclaim as much as they could of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. Thus she called Horde champions to aid and meet her at &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, while also accepting the aid of Alliance champions who had taken a disguise to blend in with the Forsaken. However she received a mixed response, as while the likes of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; were willing to give her a chance, &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; was both distrustful and skeptical about her. For her own part, Calia accepted that she wouldn't be universally accepted because of Arthas' deeds or perceptions about her seeking leadership or advocating the Alliance's interests. She merely vowed to help the Forsaken in any way she could, thus she called upon a number of influential figures that had risen to prominence among the Forsaken, in order to meet and discuss the path forward.\nWhile Voss wanted to directly focus on dealing with the plague in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, Belmont questioned what they should do about Calia, only for &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; to declare that they should focus on the blight. She then turned to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; and questioned if he had more plague eaters, only for him to reveal to Calia and the others that he only had one left, and that while he could make more for them to be effective, they must be formulated to survive the plague. This in turn inspired Calia to point out that they might be able to turn to the plague-lords of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; for insight. When Faranell revealed that he required an undiluted sample of the plague from deep within its reaches, Calia vowed to acquire it for him, but both Faranell and Belmont were skeptical of her being able to acquire it and survive.\nCalia then called upon the light and with the champion by her side, she ventured into the plague and successfully acquired the plague sample, which greatly surprised Belmont. With the sample in their possession, Calia, Voss, the champion, and the plague eater went to Maldraxxus, where they met with &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Sin'dane directed the group to meet with &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Deviser%20Marileth\"&gt;Plague Deviser Marileth&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt;, Calia questioned Sin'dane about the nature of undeath, and revealed how while the Forsaken were raised through necromancy, which provided them a shared origin, and sense of unity, she had been raised by the light. She further remarked that this difference made her question if she could ever truly find a place among them. In response, Sin'dane revealed that regardless of any magic, necromancy is necromancy, that Calia perceived a difference when there was none. Calia subsequently thanked the Margrave for her aid before leaving to seek out Marileth. As they worked together to empower the plague eater, Calia called upon the light to shield them from the caustic fog. She also directed them with slaying creatures within the House of Plagues to help the plague eater to help it gain fortitude. Near the end, the blight turned into a living manifestation known as the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Blight\"&gt;Lordaeron Blight&lt;/a&gt;, which was quickly slain, and proved the plague eater could aid them in reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. With this accomplished, Calia and the others returned to Tirisfal Glades to deliver the plague eater to the apothecaries, where Calia informed Faranell of how the blight sample became a living manifestation, to which Faranell was quick to declare it ingenious, as it would be easier to kill.\nThis plan was ultimately successful as the plague manifested as an &lt;a href=\"Amalgam\"&gt;Amalgam&lt;/a&gt; and was slain, liberating the Ruins of Lordaeron from the plague. Following this, Voss declared that the Forsaken have many points of view and should be led by a council, not a single ruler, a motion accepted by the other Forsaken leaders. While Belmont had his reservations about having a Menethil on the council, Calia was quick to declare that she had no desire for a throne, that her place was amongst them, with a vow to serve all their people. Thus a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; composed of Voss, Calia, Belmont, Faranell, and Velonara was created to lead the Forsaken. With the council's formation, Calia journeyed into the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;Lordaeron Throne Room&lt;/a&gt; room where she reflected on the past and the tragedy of her family, of how she was all that remained of the Menethil line, before being comforted by Voss, who talked about how the Forsaken were their home. However, Calia questioned if the other Forsaken would truly ever accept her, to which Voss admitted that while it was a long road, they could use her help, which gave Calia the encouragement she needed to step forward.\nFollowing this, Calia styled herself as The Pallid Lady, officially recognized &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; as her champion, and promised the Alliance heroes who had aided the Forsaken that one of the first topics that she planned on proposing to her fellow council members was the withdrawal of Forsaken troops from the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Calia, accompanied by Derek and Voss, were among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken spoke with &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; during the reception. After they realized that &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia Greymane&lt;/a&gt; had gone to the wedding in &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;her husband's&lt;/a&gt; stead, the three Forsaken exchanged uncomfortable glances, with Calia remarking that it was a pleasure to see the queen again.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Commander%20Forsythe\"&gt;Scarlet Commander Forsythe&lt;/a&gt; seized control of &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, they used it as a staging ground to strike against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As a part of the Forsaken counterattack, she directed Forsaken &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Hawlsey\"&gt;Lieutenant Hawlsey&lt;/a&gt; and obtain &lt;a href=\"Hawlsey%27s%20Armor\"&gt;their armor&lt;/a&gt; in order to spy on the crusade. Following the crusade's defeat and the death of Commander Forsythe, Calia returned to the Ruins of Lordaeron where she joined the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; in declaring that the champion represented what it meant to be Forsaken.\nAppearance.\nAt age fourteen, Calia was gawky and coltish. She was blond and slender like &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, but whereas Jaina was lively and playful, Calia was delicately boned, pale-skinned, and soft, with a face like out of an old painting. When she was sixteen, her father Terenas believed that she would surely soon grow into a beauty. As an adult, shortly before her death, Calia was tall and slender and wore her golden hair long. As an undead, Calia is a ghostly pale, silver-haired woman who appears to glow from within, though her features lack the flush of life. Her voice is echoing and sepulchral, but warm and kind.\nIn \"\", Calia is described with blue eyes. Her model and \"&lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Before the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" instead depict them as blue-green, sea-blue, or sea-green, the same color as Arthas' eyes. Since her resurrection, her eyes now glow a soft white.\nQuotes.\nShadowlands.\nThis Eternal City is shining and beautiful. And yet the touch of Death is everywhere upon it.\nI am touched by that power, too. Perhaps there are secrets here in Oribos that can help me understand what that means.\nThe attendants speak with such certainty of their \"Purpose\". Perhaps they can help me find mine as well.\nThe people of Lordaeron have suffered greatly. I hope that I am able to find my home here among them, with the Forsaken.\nDragonflight.\nThe Forsaken have fought to reclaim these lands, and I am proud to stand among them. \nI promise that I will do anything in my power to protect our people.\nMy memories after the fall of Lordaeron are hazy, but I think I may have spent some time in Silverpine. Something about the scent of the trees reminds me... and fills me with a distant dread.\nIn the RPG.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Horde%20Player%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Horde Player's Guide&lt;/a&gt;\" subtly implies a differently plotline for Calia. In one of the many short stories, a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Andarin\"&gt;Andarin&lt;/a&gt; tries to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to free prisoners. To his shame, he is quickly discovered by a fallen &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Trevor\"&gt;Trevor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; makes him \"an offer he can't refuse\": in turn for helping him, Andarin must help Trevor free some of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;'s prisoners. The paladin ponders the situation but finally agrees, together they descend into the city. After having fought some guards and abominations, the strange duo decides that fighting the prison guards will not work and comes up with a plan: Andarin will distract the guards while Trevor will free the prisoners. Knowing that he has no other choice, the paladin agrees. Trevor quickly manages to get a hold of a keyring and opens the door of a cell in which a girl was locked up. The girl recognizes the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and is shocked, but Trevor simply bows, saying \"Good evening, my princess.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; alluded to this at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202011\"&gt;BlizzCon 2011&lt;/a&gt;, mentioning that \"There were some hooks in the RPG line that kind of suggested [Calia] was going one way or another\". The background of Trevor shows some similarities with the one Alonsus Faol himself was later given in .\nSpeculation.\nFeelings for Daval Prestor.\nIn the novel \"\" Calia was greatly disturbed to the point of hysterical over her arranged marriage to Prestor, and even had a heated argument with her father, Terenas Menethil II over it. Her &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Calia%20Menethil%27s%20Copper%20Coin\"&gt;coin&lt;/a&gt; in the Dalaran Fountain expresses her desire to be noticed by him, however.\nIt is possible that it was merely an error on the developers' part. Another possibility was that Daval Prestor (Deathwing) placed an enchantment on her when he realized her objection to be married to him. He had already done this to the kings of the Alliance in \"Day of the Dragon\" to make them fond of him, so there is precedent. When Deathwing was weakened and went into hiding after the battle with his former fellow Aspects, the enchantment was lifted. Furthermore, the novel also mentioned that Terenas at one point started to suspect him.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}
