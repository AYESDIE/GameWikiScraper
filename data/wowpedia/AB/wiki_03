His crest was a black falcon, which appeared on the standard of his personal troops, who also wore red and gold livery.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBlackmoore was the son of &lt;a href=\"Aedelyn%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelyn Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, a general who had been convicted of selling state secrets when Aedelas was a child. Around three years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Aedelas saw battle against an unspecified opponent. One of his men, &lt;a href=\"Randrel\"&gt;Randrel&lt;/a&gt;, kept serving Blackmoore and eventually got elevated to the rank of personal cook for his service. A veteran of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Blackmoore later proved himself quite effective in combat, amassing a record of victories and demonstrating a particular ferocity in fighting against the orcs. What wasn't generally known was that while Blackmoore acquitted himself well on the battlefield, his courage in battle was often boosted by alcohol, as Blackmoore was a heavy drinker. It is possible that Blackmoore's drinking problem originated from his frustration at having to live with the stigma of being the \"son of a traitor.\" Due to his father's treachery and the suspicion of his peers that such traits were hereditary, Blackmoore had to repeatedly prove himself and work harder than other soldiers and officers to earn the respect he so craved, which did not have a positive effect on his disposition.\nDespite the stigma he bore on his name, he was given control of an imprisonment for orcs outside his fortress &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; of southern Lordaeron and rose to the position of overseer of all the orcish &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, moving the headquarters from &lt;a href=\"New%20Stormwind\"&gt;New Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to Durnholde. This promotion came after &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, who delegated command of the camps to high-ranking veterans of the Second War, was lost beyond the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. At his side was present &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Skarloc\"&gt;Skarloc&lt;/a&gt;, a fiercely and loyal &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; who rose to the rank of Captain of the &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20military\"&gt;Durnholde military&lt;/a&gt; alongside his friend &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, an other apprentice of Aedelas. When Aliden decided to take up operations in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Skarloc stayed with his Lord and mentor, and became Aedelas's most trusted comrade and advisor, earning the title Blackmoore's Spear.\nWith the war over and finding himself elevated to a position which placed fewer restrictions on his behavior, Blackmoore had more free time and spent most of it drinking. Unfortunately for Blackmoore, his often public intoxication did nothing to help his reputation. In addition to people whispering about him being the \"son of a traitor\", albeit one who had proven himself in battle and risen to the rank of Lieutenant, they now also considered him a drunk, and with all rights too.\nBlackmoore was capable of occasional kindness and civility when sober, but more often than not was temperamental and impatient without being concerned in the least for how his actions affected others. As bad as he could be when he was sober, Blackmoore exhibited even more of a vicious streak when drunk.\nDiscovering Thrall.\nIn the year 1, Blackmoore came across the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ling he would later name &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; when he was hunting with his servant &lt;a href=\"Tammis%20Foxton\"&gt;Tammis&lt;/a&gt; amongst the dismembered remains of the baby's family. He immediately seized the opportunity, taking the child back to Durnholde. There, Thrall grew up under human tutelage, learning the skills of a warrior before his teens and also demonstrating a keen intellect during the lessons he was given by human educators. He learned to read and write, while also earning Blackmoore a good deal of money in the gladiatorial ring. It was there he was pitted against the champions of other rich and prominent people.\nHowever, Blackmoore had more in mind for Thrall than merely making him into a great gladiator. He had only revealed his plan to his most trusted confidant, &lt;a href=\"Karramyn%20Langston\"&gt;Karramyn Langston&lt;/a&gt;, telling him that he would raise Thrall to become a general, so that Blackmoore could send an army of orcs made up of the prisoners in the internment camps against a splinting Alliance. Thrall would earn the orcs' trust and respect in Blackmoore's plan and would lead them into battle, but Thrall would also have been conditioned to be completely loyal and obedient to Blackmoore by that time and would turn over the kingdom to the human lord once he had conquered it. It seemed that treachery runs in the blood, or that if one is suspected of being a traitor his entire life he might come to resent his accusers enough to betray them in reality.\nRaising an orcling and rising in the ranks.\nAs Thrall continued to grow, so did Blackmoore's lifestyle. To his credit, in the years since he had found the baby orc he rose from the rank of Lieutenant to Lieutenant General. But he sank deeper into drunkenness, and frequently used &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha&lt;/a&gt;, the daughter of Tammis and secret friend of Thrall, as a concubine. Blackmoore was apparently rough with Taretha during sex, as Thrall noticed a bruise on her wrist she admitted was from being with Blackmoore, although it is likely they were from him in fact raping her. Taretha was sad and ashamed with the situation, but in no position to refuse her lord. Since Taretha's mother had reluctantly been Thrall's wet nurse, it is possible that Blackmoore threatened to reveal that embarrassing fact to the masses if Taretha didn't cooperate fully.\nDuring Thrall's life at Durnholde there had been times when Blackmoore was nice to him, but it was more often that he treated him terribly. Thrall's response was to try to do better. Be a better gladiator, a better student, a better thrall. Surely if he performed his tasks well enough, Blackmoore would be kinder to him and not punish him. This naive notion was dispelled one terrible day. On that day, Thrall would be convinced that he had to escape from Blackmoore's clutches at any cost.\nOn that day Thrall had fought eight straight bouts in the arena, victorious in every one. Blackmoore was pleased; he had come to expect nothing less from his undefeated \"pet orc\". But Thrall tired more with each bout, and after the eighth contest against a pair of large mountain cats Thrall was bleeding in addition to being so exhausted he could barely remain standing. The Sergeant who had trained Thrall had advised Blackmoore not to push him too hard, partly out of pragmatism but also out of concern for his student. Blackmoore would hear none of it, confident that Thrall was unbeatable and eager to take money from any who cared to bet against Thrall. The more tired Thrall got, after all, the higher the odds against him became and the more money Blackmoore would win. Drunk at the time, Blackmoore also resented what he perceived to be laziness on Thrall's part.\nIt was with this reasoning in mind that Blackmoore forced Thrall to fight a ninth bout, against arguably the most deadly opponent he would face that day: an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; who towered Thrall in size and was well rested. Thrall was impaled on the ogre's spear and beaten to within an inch of his life before the two fighters were separated and Thrall was carried back to his cell.\nBlackmoore was enraged that Thrall had allowed himself to be defeated, caused him to lose thousands in gold, and had embarrassed him.\nLying in his cell in excruciating agony, Thrall hoped that the healers would arrive soon as Blackmoore had always sent them in the past to fix him up after his fights. He remembered how Blackmoore had praised him so many times in the past after he had won, after he had made Blackmoore money. Thrall had no reason to expect anything different this time; he knew he had lost against the ogre but he was sure that Blackmoore would understand and be impressed that Thrall had fought nine bouts in a row, something which had never been done before, and won eight. Thus it was a rude awakening when a drunken and angry Blackmoore entered his cell and informed him that the healers wouldn't be coming anytime soon, raged at how Thrall had cost him so much money by losing, and began to beat and kick the grievously injured orc viciously. Thrall wasn't able to do anything but lie there and take it, and even when Blackmoore had finally worn himself out it wasn't finished. Many others had bet on Thrall and lost money, and Blackmoore had invited them all to join in the punishment. Man after man entered the cell and vented his anger on the helpless orc before he finally, mercifully, lost consciousness.\nThrall escapes from Durnholde.\nAfter he had finally been healed, not out of mercy but so he would remain alive to fight for Blackmoore again, Thrall was visited by the man who had trained him to fight, a man he knew only as \"&lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20%28Character%29\"&gt;Sergeant&lt;/a&gt;.\" Sergeant told Thrall he wished he had been there earlier to stop the beatings, and that he had pulled the men off the orc as soon as he discovered it. Sergeant sympathized with Thrall and told him that he had done extremely well in the ring, that Blackmoore should have been proud of him and that he didn't deserve to be treated so horribly. Sergeant then left Thrall to sleep, but the damage was done. Thrall was grateful to Sergeant for his kindness, but now he knew that he would never be able to please Blackmoore and that the man would never be satisfied enough with his performance to give him any love or respect. It was on that night that Thrall vowed to escape.\nThrall did escape, with Taretha's help (see &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Escape from Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; for a slightly altered version of these events). With the word that Thrall was on the loose reaching the capital, Blackmoore was called before &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; to account for his actions. The King was incredulous that Blackmoore had decided to train and educate an orc (not knowing Blackmoore's true intention, of course), and threatened to send a representative of the crown to ensure that the funds being provided for the maintenance of Durnholde and the camps were properly distributed if Blackmoore could not account for them himself.\nBlackmoore scoured the countryside, almost capturing him again at &lt;a href=\"Lorin%20Remka\"&gt;Remka&lt;/a&gt;'s camp, but the orc continued to elude him. Thrall had already escaped by the time Blackmoore arrived at the camp, but the soldiers who captured him had taken his possessions and still had them at the camp for Blackmoore to inspect. Among those possessions were letters from Taretha which Thrall had saved for their sentimental value. Blackmoore felt angry and betrayed, but kept his knowledge of the friendship between Taretha and Thrall hidden from her at that time.\nDespite the odd \"Thrall sighting\", Blackmoore didn't hear of Thrall for several seasons, until Thrall returned with a new Horde at his back and began freeing entire orcish internment camps. During the course of Thrall's &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;Liberation of the internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s was serving Aedelas and protecting the camps and eventually Durnholde itself. After five camps were taken, Thrall made way for Durnholde.\nThe night before the battle, Taretha snuck out of Durnholde - Blackmoore, she believed, had drunk himself to sleep - and met Thrall in secret so he could inform her of his plans. Thrall told Taretha that he hoped he could negotiate a release of all the captive orcs without bloodshed, but neither of them were optimistic that Blackmoore would agree to it. Feeling that a fight was inevitable, Thrall urged Taretha to leave Durnholde so there would be no chance of her being harmed. But Taretha told him that if she were discovered missing it would alert the human forces, and that if she left then Blackmoore would take his anger out on her parents. Though she didn't want to, she told Thrall she had to stay, although she hoped for Thrall to emerge from the battle victorious. \nUpon Taretha's return to Durnholde, she found Blackmoore and his men waiting for her. Blackmoore, who had feigned his drunken state and was in fact quite sober when she returned, made it clear that he knew what she had done; he had sent a stealthy scout to tail Taretha's movements and saw everything.\nThe siege of Durnholde.\nThe next morning, Thrall's army surrounded the keep. As planned, Thrall attempted to parlay but when Blackmoore appeared on the parapet to speak with him it was immediately clear that he was sloshed to the gills, having drunk himself into a near-stupor. Thrall told Blackmoore that he wished for the rest of the imprisoned orcs to be freed and that he hoped bloodshed would not be necessary. He went on to say that they only wanted freedom and that they would leave the Alliance alone after they had it. But Blackmoore wasn't listening. Alternating between amusement, anger, and grief; he honestly could not understand how Thrall could be so ungrateful after he had \"given him everything\". Blackmoore began screaming his plans to everyone in earshot - his intent to use Thrall to take over the Alliance and become lord of all humans. When told once more to negotiate or die, Blackmoore answered Thrall by throwing the severed head of his dear friend, Taretha Foxton, from the castle wall to land at his feet.\nBlackmoore may have intended to break Thrall's spirit with this gesture, but it had the complete opposite effect. It was too much for Thrall to take, and along with his profound grief at Taretha's fate came an elemental fury. The time for talk was over. He ordered his forces to attack and used the shamanistic magic he had learned against the defenders as well. Blackmoore retreated into the fortress, but Thrall tracked him down, engaging him in single combat. At first, Thrall allowed Blackmoore a fighting chance - the fight seemed to revitalize him, and he was able to hold his own against the raging Warchief. Blackmoore tried to explain, tried to convince Thrall to aid him, but Thrall filled with rage at remembering what Blackmoore had done to Taretha. Throwing his full strength into his attack, Thrall disarmed Blackmoore and forced him against a wall. Blackmoore attempted to make the best of it by drawing a dagger from his boot and slicing it across Thrall's face, narrowly missing his right eye. The Warchief sliced his massive sword down into the body of the master of Durnholde, forcing him to the ground. However, before life left the dying Blackmoore, he managed to say \"You are... what I made you... I am so proud...\"\nAfter Durnholde's surrender, Thrall allowed the survivors and their families to go free. Calling upon the Spirit of the Earth, Thrall leveled Durnholde and buried Aedelas Blackmoore beneath the rubble of his own fortress.\nBlackmoore's legacy.\nBlackmoore's only appearances as a character in Warcraft lore are in the novels \"&lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20the%20Clans\"&gt;Lord of the Clans&lt;/a&gt;\" (which is based on the cancelled ') and ' (on two brief occasions), both by &lt;a href=\"Christie%20Golden\"&gt;Christie Golden&lt;/a&gt;, but his legacy continues to shape the world of Warcraft years after his death. He does not appear in \"World of Warcraft\", but is mentioned several times in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; instance of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, where players aid his \"pet orc\", Thrall, in his escape from Durnholde. He is also mentioned in , where Thrall - his essence scattered to the four winds, and pouring out the rage within his soul - believes that death was too good for Blackmoore, and that all who would enslave another deserve a worse fate than death.\nBlackmoore was also the mentor of &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Syndicate, who longs to return to the days where the orcs were prisoners of the humans. The crescent-moon pendant worn by Blackmoore's mistress, Taretha Foxton, was in the possession of Perenolde's own mistress, &lt;a href=\"Elysa\"&gt;Elysa&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, members of the Syndicate held the ruins of Durnholde and used it as a base to strike against the unwary in Hillsbrad.\nPersonality.\nBlackmoore was a bitter drunk. He was driven to drinking due to his father being a traitor and everyone believing that the apple does not fall far from the tree, and in that regard, they were not wrong. When he was sober, he could be kind, but also at times be almost as cruel and harsh as when he was drunk. When he was drunk, he would fly into outbursts of anger, and went to far as to order Taretha Foxton's execution, although it is unclear whether he had actually been drunk knowing the orcs were coming or drank because of what was going to do to her, as when Taretha came back he was down right sober but drank so much to the point he could stomach the order of her execution. Despite his treatment of Thrall, he was proud of him, and with his last words he told him so, that he had become what he wanted him to become. And privately, though early on he had been \"rough\" with Taretha, he fell deeply in love with her, but it was all shattered upon the revelation that she had written to Thrall for years.\nIn the alternate timeline, he was no different, still just as cruel and bitter, despite not being a drunk anymore, as he still had plans to use an orcish army to take over the Alliance, but came about twenty years ahead of schedule due to his soberness and the death of an infant Thrall. While fighting Thrall, he was shown to be just as bad as the real Blackmoore was to Thrall, except he had no sense of pride for Thrall for he had not trained him, for to this Blackmoore, he was just the one that in the true timeline that got in his way.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Blackmoore was the main antagonist. Having the rank of lieutenant, he secretly raised the orcling &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; within the confines of his prison fortress &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;. He planned to mold the orcling into the perfect warrior: a warrior conditioned to human thinking, but with all the savagery of an orcish heart. He had also partnered with the murderers of Thrall's father, &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, who were traitors to their race and collaborated with the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; system for gold and favors. During the finale sequence of the game, Thrall stopped Blackmoore from making a blood pact with Rend and Maim. The human officer fled, but his former slave managed to catch him on the walls of the keep. Thrall eventually decided that he wasn't worth killing, so Blackmoore waited for him to turn his back to him and tried to backstab the orc, but he was stopped by &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who threw his axe at him. The human officer died by falling off the walls.\nIn his game incarnation, Blackmoore was from &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the canon story about his father's betrayal might have originally be the one of his entire kingdom. Blackmoore kept a flag of Alterac inside &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Concept art for the game furthermore showed Blackmoore troops in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The novel said Blackmoore's crest was a black falcon, a reference to . Even \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" depicted Blackmoore as being close to &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; from the traitorous kingdom, with the ruins of Durnholde Keep being occupied by &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; (Alteraci) agents.\nAlternate timelines.\nA version of &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; existed in a &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeway&lt;/a&gt; where history turned out completely different and from which he was sent to kill Thrall during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; era.\nBefore Thrall entered the Blackmoore world, Thrall and the alternate Aedelas entered yet another timeway at a point during the murder of Durotan and Draka. In contrast with the main universe, Thrall and the alternate Aedelas threw themselves into water alerting the attention of the approaching Blackmoore on foot who took the orcish infant. His servant, Tammis told him that the noise had to be large turtles.\nIn another timeline, Aedelas managed to train Thrall as his personal and obedient pawn.\nIn the RPG.\nAedelas allowed &lt;a href=\"Rufus%20Montaine\"&gt;Rufus Montaine&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Montaine\"&gt;Morgan&lt;/a&gt;, to duel with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;."}

Aedelas Blackmoore was robbed of his ultimate weapon and most efficient method of taking over the Alliance, so he did the unexpected - instead of going further down his drunken path, he sobered up, conscripted more soldiers and mercenaries, and trained his would-be army himself. His hands-on approach won him popular support, and Blackmoore himself led the charge into Blackrock Spire. He even managed to kill Orgrim Doomhammer in single combat, dealing the Horde a devastating blow. Rather than having the defeated &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s put into internment camps, Blackmoore gave them a choice: join his private army or die.\nBlackmoore returned to Lordaeron after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Battle of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; with his personal army of humans and orcs and had conquered the Kingdom of Lordaeron and dethroned the House of Menethil, during which King was killed along with and . He then became the self-proclaimed King of Lordaeron, assisted by his duplicitous advisor, . He even had Doomhammer's plate reforged into a suit of armor for himself. He was not a well-loved ruler, and , his former mistress, believed that even planned to restore and his wife to the throne of Lordaeron, both of whom had fled to the safety of Stormwind in the aftermath of Blackmoore's coup.\nHis rule ended after about nineteen years, when he mysteriously disappeared, having been taken by the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in the original timeline. He first appeared inside of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; where he killed Thrall's ally, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt;, severing his head. Aedelas then clashed with Thrall but the fight was interrupted by a &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; who tossed Thrall into a timeway portal. As the orc landed, the King threatened to kill him. He eluded the bronze dragons, entered the timeway and emerged somewhere in the Hillsbrad foothills area. He found Thrall holding his infant, alternate-self in arms. The assassin came closer in order to kill the infant but the adult Thrall slammed into him, taking themselves into the nearby water, leaving the baby Thrall to be found by approaching Aedelas and Tammis. While underwater, both struggled to fight for a while but Thrall swam out and was teleported into the Blackmoore's world. The orc learned from Taretha about the world and confirmed that he is no longer here. At this point, Thrall realized that the assassin was, in fact, the missing King Blackmoore. He wasn't sure who the attacker was when he first appeared but sounded familiar.\nAfter Thrall freed Nozdormu, the Aspect confirmed to him that the assassin was King Blackmoore, an agent of the infinite dragonflight. Blackmoore didn't continue chasing Thrall but instead, returned to the main universe, and atop a twilight dragon, he followed Thrall into &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. It was later revealed that he was also working with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;. When Arygos failed to be made the next Aspect, he retreated into the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; where Aedelas found him. The &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; told him to work together in order to bring Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; down and thus please &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. As Aedelas agreed and climbed, he stabbed the dragon and his blood poured into the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, activating it and reviving the &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragon\"&gt;chromatic dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; with its energies drawn by a &lt;a href=\"surge%20needle\"&gt;surge needle&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey eventually clashed in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, right after Thrall had fallen from Kalecgos. As he recovered from the fall, he regained his clarity and was ready to battle Blackmoore. Although the battle lasted for a time, King Blackmoore was ultimately overwhelmed. As Thrall was about to strike the final blow, Aedelas begged for mercy, a thing that wasn't granted as the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; crushed his head."}

{"id": "17610", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=17610", "title": "Aegwynn", "text": "Aegwynn (sometimes spelled Aegwyn and pronounced \"AYG-wihn\"), Matriarch of &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, was the penultimate and only female &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, and is recognized as the most powerful Guardian. She is also the mother of the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Order of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; was originally forged to protect the world from demonic corruption of magic \u2014 namely by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and these &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s were given considerable power and longevity. The Order was kept as a secret among only the greatest magi. But over time, the Guardian became a puppet of the Order, and the focus was lost. When Aegwynn became the Guardian, however, she refused to be manipulated. She remained focused on the matter at hand \u2014 the demonic powers at play in Azeroth. The same hubris that led to the Guardian's diminishing caused their downfall.\nAegwynn served as the Guardian of Tirisfal for over 1,000 years. Following the end of her reign, she would eventually serve as &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s chamberlain for a time near the end of her life. Aegwynn is recognized as one of the greatest sorcerers of all time.\nBiography.\nGenesis.\nAegwynn lived in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. When she was little, her mother would take her to the woods of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; on a camping trip.\nAegwynn was trained in magic by the Guardian Magna &lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn was the only girl among five apprentices. Most of the boys didn't treat her fairly, claiming that she couldn't become a wizard, but Aegwynn persevered. Before the end of her first year as an apprentice, she had mastered the lost incantations of the &lt;a href=\"Meitre%20scrolls\"&gt;Meitre scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, the last surviving work of one of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; wizards from nine thousand years earlier (human mages were dissuaded from even reading the scrolls until well into their careers \u2014 even &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei\"&gt;Quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt; couldn't read them until a decade into their apprenticeships). During her training, she had a brief affair with her fellow apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Jonas\"&gt;Jonas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor this feat, she was chosen to succeed Scavell as Guardian of Tirisfal. Though her fellow (male) apprentices complained, the Council maintained that she was the best and the Guardian could not afford to be anything less. The elves on the Council at the time believed that as Aegwynn had faced greater challenges to become a mage than the others, she was most deserving \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Erbag\"&gt;Erbag&lt;/a&gt; the gnome chided the boys for their immaturity.\nAegwynn was subsequently supplied with the power of the \"Tirisfalen\", and began work immediately. One of Aegwynn's first challenges was the destruction of the demon &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; who had begun to possess children in a schoolhouse. Aegwynn rushed in and vanquished the demon before damage to the children could result. Erbag and &lt;a href=\"Relfthra\"&gt;Relfthra&lt;/a&gt; admonished her for her quick action \u2014 she had rushed in without a thought to Zmodlor's grand scheme, and could have put the world at further risk. Aegwynn fired back that she couldn't allow children to suffer just because the Council favored a reactive solution to demons.\nSomething had always perplexed Aegwynn about Meitre, the author of the scrolls. While studying his writings, she realized that the elf had wielded immense power-more than any regular sorcerer should have been capable of. After Aegwynn inherited the mantle of Guardian, she became obsessed with finding out how. Aegwynn discovered another series of lost scrolls written by Meitre. They described an arcane being named &lt;a href=\"Aluneth%20%28entity%29\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; in detail, and even included spells the elf had used to tap into the being's power. Aegwynn believed she could use Aluneth as a formidable weapon against the Burning Legion. Yet unlike Meitre, she would not simply tap into the entity's energies; she would bring the being into Azeroth and bind it to her will. Aegwynn summoned Aluneth with ease, but it would not obey her commands. The fickle creature thrashed against the Guardian's containment magics and nullified her spellwork. Aegwynn reveled in the challenge of taming Aluneth. After many setbacks, Aegwynn finally bound the entity to an enchanted greatstaff. The task of containing &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt; was done, but it would take the Guardian years to truly harness its power.\nAegwynn and the dragon hunt.\n823 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, Aegwynn traveled to the world's roof, &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, in order to defeat a hunting party of demons that were stalking dragons.\nAs her mastery over the cosmic power of Tirisfal grew, Aegwynn became aware of a number of powerful demons that stalked the icy northern continent of Northrend. Traveling to the distant north, Aegwynn tracked the demons into the mountains. There, she found that the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s were hunting one of the last surviving &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s and draining the ancient creatures of their innate magic. The mighty &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, who had fled from the ever-advancing march of mortal societies, found themselves too evenly matched against the dark magics of the Legion. Aegwynn confronted the demons, and with help from the noble dragons, eradicated them. Yet, as the last demon was banished from the mortal world, a great storm erupted throughout the north. An enormous dark visage appeared in the sky above Northrend. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the demon king and lord of the Burning Legion, appeared before Aegwynn and bristled with hellish energy. He informed the young Guardian that the time of Tirisfal was about to come to an end and that the world would soon bow before the onslaught of the Legion.\nThe proud Aegwynn, believing herself to be a match for the menacing god, unleashed her powers against Sargeras' avatar. With disconcerting ease, Aegwynn battered the demonlord with her powers and succeeded in killing his physical shell. Aegwynn raised Aluneth high and called down a storm of arcane magic to annihilate Sargeras. Nothing happened. The entity bound to Aegwynn's weapon resisted her command. As she struggled to assert her will over Aluneth, Sargeras launched a furious assault against the Guardian. Ultimately, Aegwynn put Aluneth aside and opted for a more reliable weapon. She summoned &lt;a href=\"Atiesh%2C%20Greatstaff%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, a mighty staff passed from Guardian to Guardian, and renewed her attack against Sargeras. With the help of the dragons, Aegwynn battled and ultimately defeated the Lord of the Legion.\nFearing that Sargeras' spirit would linger on, the naive Aegwynn locked the ruined husk of his body within one of the ancient halls of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; that had been blasted to the bottom of the sea when the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; collapsed. Forevermore would Sargeras' body be trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; so that it might never be rejuvenated by the powers of the Nether. Following this historic event, Aegwynn, by her own admission, grew arrogant and cocky. She felt that she no longer needed to act in concert with the Council, that she had done the impossible, and thus she \u2014 not the \"Tirisfalen\" \u2014 would choose the next Guardian. Aegwynn would never know that she had done exactly as Sargeras had planned. She had inadvertently sealed the fate of the mortal world, for Sargeras, at the time of his corporeal death, had transferred his spirit into Aegwynn's weakened body. Unbeknownst to the Guardian, Sargeras would remain cloaked within the darkest recesses of her soul for many long years.\nFor centuries, Aegwynn had strengthened her control over Aluneth. She dispatched the Legion's demons with ease and secured Azeroth's safety for generations.\n320 years ago, Aegwynn was given access to the redoubt of the deceased elven mage &lt;a href=\"Erthalif\"&gt;Erthalif&lt;/a&gt;, and the Guardian found notes taken by the legendary elf wizard &lt;a href=\"Kithros\"&gt;Kithros&lt;/a&gt; in the library. She used them to write a new banishment spell.\nDisappearance.\nSargeras, now within Aegwynn, was slowly twisting her thoughts. She became more distant from the council; rarely being seen by them. Sargeras amplified fears she had already had about the council. The council had been using its powers to manipulate the politics of the Eastern Kingdoms. They believed they had the power to prevent war suffering, for the greater good. Aegwynn believed the constant manipulations would end in disaster. She decided to not relinquish her roll as Guardian, for fear that the council could elect a new weaker Guardian they could control and manipulate. They did not completely approve of her decision to stay on as Guardian but they allowed it for the moment.\nHer relationship with the council would become more distant over the centuries. Hidden from the council's watchful eye, Aegwynn constructed the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;. The tower acted a siphon for ley lines Aegwynn could gain power from if needed. She would also use the tower as a refuge when avoiding the Council of Tirisfal. As older members of the council passed new younger ones would join. These new members want to force Aegwynn to give up her powers. They formed the Tirisgarde, an order of magi armed with ancient relics they could use to subdue Aegwynn. For years the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; had searched for Aegwynn till they found her refuge at Karazhan. She sealed Karazhan so the council could never gain control of its secrets and fled to the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; where she &lt;a href=\"The%20Guardian%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;would hide&lt;/a&gt; for hundreds of years; all the while keeping an eye on the Council of Tirisfal.\nShortly after Aegwynn's four hundredth birthday, her loneliness got rather overwhelming, so she decided to have a pet. She viewed domesticating a &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt; as a challenge, so she caught one and named him &lt;a href=\"Scavell%20%28thunder%20lizard%29\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt;, after her old mentor.\nAt some point, Aegwynn was found and confronted by &lt;a href=\"Tarthen\"&gt;Tarthen&lt;/a&gt; of the Tirisgarde in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of the power used by the two magi, the duel that ensued was one of the greatest to have ever occurred between a Tirisgarde and the renegade Guardian. But it was also one of the shortest. Tarthen bore &lt;a href=\"%3AEbonchill\"&gt;:Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt; in battle--the greatstaff reported stolen some months ago. When he unleashed the weapon's stored power on Aegwynn, she immediately turned the energies back on him with a counterspell. A storm of frost magic surged over Tarthen, encasing him in a layer of diamond-hard ice. Despite the hot weather in the region, Tarthen was still frozen solid when the Council members found him. It took considerable effort to thaw his corpse and free Ebonchill from his lifeless hand.\nAround this time, she would also clash with &lt;a href=\"Laith%20Sha%27ol\"&gt;Laith Sha'ol&lt;/a&gt;, wielder of Apocalypse, sent by the Council to hunt her down likely after Tarthen's failure, and was nearly overwhelmed by his weapon, with her spells unable to shield her from the blade's power, but narrowly defeated him by shattering his connection with the sword at the last minute. Unable to destroy Apocalpyse or neutralize its powers, she sealed it away in the hopes none thereafter would find and use it.\nThe birth of Medivh.\nAegwynn would on occasion leave Suramar to watch the council. It was one of these times that she was finally caught by the Tirisgarde magi, &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt;. Aran would use various artifacts at his disposal to nullify her magic and slow her down. Over the course of several months, the two came at odds. However, the fighting would end when both realized each other's true nature. Aran learned that Aegwynn was not the traitorous rebel the council made him think she was. And she learned that Aran also loathed political manipulations the council had been carrying out.\nIt was not long before the two fell in love. They agreed they must work together to prevent the Council from controlling another Guardian. They decided to create an heir and pass on the title of Guardian to. She gave birth to a son she named Medivh. She locked her powers and knowledge of the Council within Medivh where they could manifest upon &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;maturity&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn soon left Medivh in Aran's care. She went into hiding watching her beloved Medivh from afar. In time, Aegwynn planned to bequeath Aluneth to her son, but that day would never come. Upon reaching the age of 14, Medivh went into a coma after the explosion of power that had emerged from Medivh killed his father Aran.\nMedivh's awakening.\nMedivh awoke a decade later, assuring the clergy of &lt;a href=\"Northshire\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt; that he was in full control of his powers. When the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was opened by him, almost every creature attuned to magic on Azeroth felt ripples as the gateway flared to life. Aegwynn could not fathom what had happened, but she sensed the presence of fel magic and knew Medivh must have somehow allied himself with the Legion. Aegwynn traveled to Karazhan with the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt; to confront Medivh about it. The tower was crowded with nobles who were expecting a gala, and so Aegwynn entered alone at first, hoping to convince Medivh to give up his power peacefully. It was then that Medivh revealed that, as he died in battle before her, Sargeras had spirited his essence into Aegwynn's own body like a cancer, lying in wait for her to conceive as he knew she would. Sargeras later stitched himself into the fabric of Medivh's unborn body so that when he awoke and realized the power of Tirisfal he would also manifest his unholy, demonic heritage.\nAegwynn was stunned as the truth set in, but she did not lose herself to despair. Instead, Aegwynn became angry and knew she would defeat Sargeras there and then, even if it meant striking against her beloved son. The battle between the two shook the tower to its foundations and sent the would-be revelers fleeing. When Aegwynn was temporarily incapacitated, Arcanagos joined in. However, despite being a blue dragon, Arcanagos was severely outmatched. Sargeras struck him down, burning him from the inside out until all that was left was bone. Her friend's death sent Aegwynn further into her rage. Sargeras may have had the full weight of a Guardian's power, but she had centuries of experience. Even with Aluneth at her command, Aegwynn could not best the demon-possessed Medivh, but as their duel continued, Aegwynn slowly gained the upper hand. Unable to kill Aegwynn, Medivh instead banished her and hurled her elsewhere. He didn't know where he had sent her, but he could not sense her presence anywhere on Azeroth.\nIn a desperate attempt to spread word of Medivh's evil, Aegwynn had an audience with &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt;. She warned him that Medivh was behind the orcish invasion and that he would eventually have to be dealt with. Llane refused her.\nAegwynn, knowing that she had done all she could possibly do, watched the events unfold before her. She watched her son die, the fall of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and Gul'dan, and her last testament was a praise to the Alliance before she left to prepare herself for her death. For a time, Aegwynn retreated from society, and she entrusted Aluneth to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nExile and return to society.\nAfter witnessing the fall of her son, Aegwynn evaded death's grasp. At some point in the proceedings above, Medivh had stripped her of all remaining magic, but neglected to drain her anti-aging spells. Unraveling the spells, Aegwynn used them to teleport herself as far away as she possibly could \u2014 to the &lt;a href=\"Bladescar%20Highlands\"&gt;Bladescar Highlands&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn then built herself a small home in these hills and grew a garden, to live out her life in solitude. Or so she thought. Aegwynn's magic was still effective enough to scry using her well. When Medivh died a few weeks later, she formulated a plan \u2014 she would save up her magic, piece by piece until she could bring back The Last Guardian. It took her years to do so, and again nearly cost her her life. It was accomplished though and she revived Medivh, by summoning his ghost. While his spirit had been beyond the physical realm Medivh's vast power had allowed him to glimpse into the Twisting Nether and touch the minds of the demons, allowing him to learn of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; preparing for their next invasion.\nAfter his disappearance, Aegwynn again sought solitude but was rudely interrupted by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Though Aegwynn was willing to assist Jaina in her attempt to relocate a herd of thunder lizards, she was annoyed by the deference Jaina showed her, and the continued use of the title \"Magna\". Shortly after Jaina's arrival they were sealed in Aegwynn's home by familiar magic: &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt;'s. After a well-timed escape, Jaina, Aegwynn, and Jaina's colonel &lt;a href=\"Lorena\"&gt;Lorena&lt;/a&gt; discovered Zmodlor had been freed and was now working to create a war between &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. The trio confronted the demon, but Jaina was incapacitated by the warlocks. In a last desperate act to fulfill her duties as Guardian (which she had never shirked in the past) Aegwynn supplemented Jaina with her last source of magic: her own life energy. Against all conceivable odds, Aegwynn survived yet again.\nThe New Council of Tirisfal.\nDeclared by Theramore's surgeons to \"have the constitution of an elf,\" she began serving as Lady Jaina's chamberlain and advisor, under an assumed name to avoid any unwanted guests.\nWhile in the marsh with &lt;a href=\"Sven\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt;, she found two wind riders battling and collapsing into a web. A blood elven assassin named &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; and her wyvern were able to kill a human assassin and his gryphon, &lt;a href=\"Blackklaw\"&gt;Blackklaw&lt;/a&gt;. Aegwynn, seeing a great future in her, immediately helped her and delivered to Theramore. She asked Sven to find &lt;a href=\"Helaina\"&gt;Helaina&lt;/a&gt; and assist Valeera, as well as to find someone for her wyvern &lt;a href=\"Bristlefur\"&gt;Bristlefur&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe then assisted Jaina in helping to uncover some lost memories of a gladiator nicknamed Lo'Gosh. It turned out it was the long-forgotten king of the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later she assisted Valeera, a direct descendant of &lt;a href=\"Relfthra\"&gt;Relfthra&lt;/a&gt;, in subduing her magical addiction. Shortly after she was present at a summit where the &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; made an attempt on Varian's life. In the events that followed, Aegwynn discovered Garona's son, &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt;, bore a striking resemblance to her own son. Adding to that fact was that Med'an gave off a powerful aura like a \"beacon of power\", much like Medivh did. Aegwynn could only conclude that he must be her grandson. This knowledge gave her a new surge of hope and joy, and she began to see him as a chance for redemption, likely from her choices that had shaped Medivh's life.\nAegwynn learned about Arthas' story from Jaina. She was present when Jaina felt that Arthas had awoken.\nAegwynn considered whether or not to tell Med'an how he is related to Medivh, but also believed that revealing herself as his grandmother was ultimately a selfish wish on her part. As her arrogance had killed her son and brought disaster to her world, whatever was best for Med'an would take precedence: his future was too important. Though the boy's guardian, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, strongly disagreed, she would come to decide that no one, especially Med'an, should know who had fathered him. She believed that the son of Medivh would be distrusted and shunned by any who learned of it: his future would be blighted, and his potential wasted. Aegwynn convinced Meryl into silence only by agreeing to keep quiet about his possession of &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;. She is one of the founding members of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;New Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the final battle between the New Council and the newly-empowered ogre mage &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, she sacrificed herself to give her grandchild the extra power he needed to defeat the evil ogre. Afterwards, the council buried her at &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Morgan's Plot&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, next to her son.\nAfter her death, Jaina found herself missing Aegwynn and her advice.\nLegion.\nAn echo of Aegwynn was left in the Tomb of Sargeras in case the wards she placed there failed. This echo appears in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; is defeated and the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; is activated, much to the surprise of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. She explains that the Pillars of Creation can restore her wards and that the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; can destroy the felstorm. Aegwynn's old staff &lt;a href=\"Aluneth\"&gt;Aluneth&lt;/a&gt;, which has since been claimed by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, initially responds with fear when Aegwynn appears, declaring that she will not bind it again. But upon realizing that it is only an echo, Aluneth assures the Archmage that it is nothing to be concerned about.\nThe echo guides &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s through the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras raid&lt;/a&gt; as they place the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; throughout the tomb, and reveals that the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; built their &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; that would become the tomb over a &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; vault.\nOriginal backstory.\nThe Guardian Aegwynn grew powerful over the years and used the Tirisfal energies to greatly extend her life. Foolishly believing that she had defeated Sargeras for good, she continued to safeguard the world from the demon king's minions for nearly nine hundred years. However, the Council of Tirisfal finally decreed that her stewardship had come to an end. The Council ordered Aegwynn to return to Dalaran so that they could choose a new successor for the Guardian power. Yet Aegwynn, ever distrustful of the Council, decided to choose a successor on her own. Though powerful, Aegwynn was at her core mortal and consequently knew that she would have to pass on her powers, lest the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s be given free reign of Azeroth. She was determined to prevent the council from manipulating her successor as they had continually tried to manipulate her. Around the year -45, the proud Aegwynn planned to give birth to a son whom she would divest her power to. She chose the conjurer of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt;, to father her heir. Nielas was initially elated when it appeared that the Guardian had fallen in love with him, but was slightly thrown to realize that she had used him only to sire an heir and take the choice of next Guardian away from the Council.\nTime passed, and Aegwynn gave birth to a son in a secluded grove in the fall of that year. He was named &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, or \"&lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Keeper of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;\" in the Elven tongue. Aegwynn left the baby Medivh in the care of his father at Stormwind Keep. She locked deep within him the knowledge of Tirisfal, to be made manifest when he reached physical maturity. Content with her work, she then wandered into the wilderness and prepared to pass into whatever afterlife awaited her. When that time came, however, the power of Tirisfal was too much for Medivh to properly channel and the resulting backlash of magical energy pouring from the child killed his father Nielas and reduced Medivh to a comatose body.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The Stonemother has shown little concern for the rebellious Aeonaxx, even allowing his spawn to be taken from her realm.\nHe is much like &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Proto%20Drake\"&gt;Time-Lost Proto Drake&lt;/a&gt;, being a rare dragonkin that is guaranteed to drop a unique mount. GMs have yet to be drawn on information about spawn points and times.\nAeonaxx initially appears friendly to players, and is mountable as a vehicle. Upon mounting, he becomes hostile, and the mounting player must kill him to survive and loot.\nSpawn Information.\nAeonaxx shares a spawn timer with &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Seeker\"&gt;Blood Seeker&lt;/a&gt;, a level 15 bat from the pre-Cataclysm &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, which has been observed to be roughly 6 to 22 hours. Aeonaxx has a spawn chance of about 6%. \nEarly videos of players encountering Aeonaxx were on the west side of the Temple of the Earth where he has more spawn points, but eastern locations have also been confirmed. There are currently six known spawn points, commonly labeled as \"NW1\", \"NW2\", \"SW1\", \"SW2\", \"SE1\", and \"NE1\". Each spawn will be random between the six points. Once spawned, Aeonaxx or Blood Seeker will fly in a small circle around the spawn location. Blood Seeker will automatically despawn after six minutes, whether alive or killed. \n&lt;a href=\"Phasing\"&gt;Phasing&lt;/a&gt; does not affect a player's ability to see Aeonaxx, though it may keep one from seeing nearby players in other phases. Once a player mounts Aeonaxx, that player is visible in all phases.\nEncounter.\nUpon spawning, Aeonaxx is friendly and appears to be mountable as a vehicle with a green mouseover arrow. Once a player mounts Aeonaxx, he becomes hostile and other players will not be able to mount. \nAfter mounting, the player will receive an announcement: \"Kill Aeonaxx before his whelps overwhelm you.\" Aeonaxx will fly a route around the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt; and through northern areas of Deepholm. He summons Young Stone Drakes to attack the mounting player throughout the encounter. The young drakes have 7,749 hitpoints and need to be killed so the player can continue attacking Aeonaxx. Aeonaxx does no damage to the player himself; he relies on the young drakes for defense. \nWhen Aeonaxx is killed, his corpse will fall to the ground. The player will automatically receive a slow fall parachute buff that will allow the player to land safely. Once on the ground, his body may be looted for &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Phosphorescent%20Stone%20Drake\"&gt;Reins of the Phosphorescent Stone Drake&lt;/a&gt;. Players low on health would be well advised to hold off on finishing him until he is over an area that is not crowded with mobs which could potentially aggro and kill the player.\nCamping.\nAeonaxx is large in relation to player mounts and is visible from far away. As such, some spawn locations are visible from others. The northern spawn points can be seen together from a position between those three points, and the southern spawn points can be seen together from a position between those three points. The placeholder, Blood Seeker, has a small range of visibility. As a level 15 &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;, players will have to be directly over spawn locations to see Blood Seeker.\nWith four spawn locations in the west and two spawn locations in the east, camping for Aeonaxx in the west may provide a better chance for sighting, but also makes the west more popular and crowded. Proper etiquette is to camp at a location that no one else is camping. As with camping for any mob, crowding or stacking on a player already camping at a location is discourteous, and lowers the odds of a kill for both players."}

{"id": "14098", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14098", "title": "Aerie Peak", "text": "Aerie Peak (or the Aerie (s)) is the &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; affiliated with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. It is located in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; in a mountainside to the northwest, and it has a range of different services including a &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20master\"&gt;gryphon master&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"leatherworking%20trainer\"&gt;leatherworking trainer&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAerie Peak is the home of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; Wildhammer dwarves, a faction that broke off from the rest of dwarven society after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Following the total defeat of &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; during the war, the Wildhammers returned to their home in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. What they had found was that the death of &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt; had left an evil taint in their fortress. The Wildhammers found Grim Batol uninhabitable and founded a new home in the Hinterlands. Because of the horrific underground battles the Wildhammers were forced to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; during the war, the Wildhammers chose to build most of their dwellings above ground, instead of burrowing into the mountain as is typical of dwarven designs.\nSecond War.\nLocated to the southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; are home to the Wildhammer clan, renowned for their use of gryphons. Led at that time by &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the Wildhammer clan came under attack by what ultimately proved to be a diversionary tactic by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The Warchief deduced that if he sent a force to attack the Hinterlands, the Alliance would respond, allowing him to take the remainder of his forces into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing their plans, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; dispatched &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, along with half the Alliance forces, to travel north to Quel'Thalas and come to the aid of the elves, while he aided Kurdran in clearing out the remaining Horde forces in the Hinterlands. Kurdran pledged his and his kingdom's aid to Anduin Lothar after the human Alliance aided them in forcing the invading orcs and forest trolls out of their homeland.\nKurdran and his Wildhammers later came to the aid of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s forces in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the Admiral's ships to focus on the ships while the gryphon riders battled the dragon riders of the Horde. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and other Alliance heroes, reached Grim Batol and fought in the final battle there to free the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; Queen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Kurdran Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; went to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Falstad stayed in Aerie Peak to succeed him as the High Thane and rule the Wildhammer Clan. Kurdran and his gryphon riders participated in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and was one of the heroes willing to sacrifice their lives to safeguard Azeroth. Kurdran Wildhammer would later have a statue in his likeness built in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt; to honor him for his heroic deeds.\nThird War.\nThe daring &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of the Wildhammer clan have responded once again to answer the call to war during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. They've brought the mighty &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peaks\"&gt;Aerie Peaks&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in its time of need. Armed with their trusty, lightning-powered &lt;a href=\"Stormhammer\"&gt;Stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;s, the fearless wilddwarves seek to keep the skies of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; free from enemy forces. The proud gryphons share their riders' implacable resolve and stand as noble symbols of the Alliance's fortitude.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; seemed to have crumbled following &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s death at the hands of his son, &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas, now the head of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed his own kingdom in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and left Lordaeron in shambles. &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt; tried to rally what remained in his &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;, though his terrible leadership led to his undoing and all who followed him.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe dwarves of Aerie Peak are master gryphon riders, and their contributions to the Alliance during war cannot be overstated. Their High Thane, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, rules over the Wildhammer dwarves from the top of the Aerie. The Wildhammers of Aerie Peak were not part of the reformed &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, but were still friendly and helpful to Alliance adventurers that have proven their worth to them. The rugged terrain of the Hinterlands is not only home to the Wildhammer dwarves and their gryphons, but also to hostile forest troll tribes. The trolls view the Wildhammers as squatters on their ancestral lands and spare no opportunity to accost the dwarves by attacking the gryphon aeries. The Wildhammers count the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; aligned &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; trolls as enemies. Though they remained independent of Alliance affairs, the Wildhammer Dwarves of Aerie Peak did strike an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil\"&gt;Quel'Danil&lt;/a&gt;, much to the ire of their common enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; trolls.\nCataclysm.\nIn order to prevent political turmoil in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; will help govern &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. With Falstad's inclusion into Alliance affairs, the Hinterland Wildhammer dwarves have pledged themselves to the Alliance. Since Falstad Wildhammer left for Ironforge, &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master%20Talonaxe\"&gt;Gryphon Master Talonaxe&lt;/a&gt; took over the coordination and defense of Aerie Peak. &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Rualeth\"&gt;Ambassador Rualeth&lt;/a&gt; also presides at the Aerie as an Alliance emissary.\nAppearance.\nThe area contrasts to that of the dwarves of the south. Rather than snowy mountains, the hills of the Hinterlands are vibrant and green. Aerie Peak spans the entire length of the mountain that flanks the entryway to the Hinterlands. Most iconic is the large &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;gryphon aviary&lt;/a&gt; that crests at its center. This aviary looks very similar to the way they are depicted in \"\", and is the only one in game depicted this way. At the other end of Aerie Peak is the mighty &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Keep\"&gt;Wildhammer Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and a graveyard decorated with several carved trees and gryphon fetishes. Although the in-game appearance of Aerie Peak looks like a small town, it's described as a majestic, sprawling city in the lore.\nCanonically, Aerie Peak has an interior that is not accessible to players. It can be seen briefly in , as the Wildhammer elder, &lt;a href=\"Mastran\"&gt;Mastran&lt;/a&gt; tells stories to the younger Wildhammers before a mighty hearth. This hearth seems to be accessed in some way from the gryphon aviary, as &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keers\"&gt;Keers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kardan\"&gt;Kardan&lt;/a&gt; are seen having exited from this hall. Later on in the story, a massive dormitory that sprawls underground, can also be seen and is accessed from within the mountain; as Kardan and Lieren later are seen leaving from atop massive battlements that sprawl against the mountain face. These battlements can also be seen in game.\nIn the RPG.\nAerie Peak, the massive &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; capital, is carved into an enormous mountainside of the same name. After the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; the Wildhammers founded their new kingdom atop Aerie Peak, staying on top of the mountain instead of dwelling within.\nThe city is located in the northwestern &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and overlooks &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20Lake\"&gt;Darrowmere Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Aerie Peak resembles a &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;gargantuan gryphon head&lt;/a&gt;, with open spaces at its eyes and nostrils. Generations of Wildhammers worked on this undertaking, and the sculpture is an excellent likeness. Even the individual feathers are apparent. Wildhammer structures and battlements jut from the cliff's base. &lt;a href=\"Gryphon\"&gt;Gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s make their nests in the carved head and the mountain, and forever flap around the place like bees about a real gryphon's head.\nThe Wildhammers know who their friends and enemies are. They welcome the former and savagely defend their city against the latter. Aerie Peak's architecture is reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s, but its buildings jut into the air with open ceilings to allow the Wildhammers to see the sky. The dwarves practice &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon riding&lt;/a&gt; and hammer tossing on the ground and cliffs surrounding Aerie Peak.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; suspected that the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Linnena%20Hallow\"&gt;Linnena Hallow&lt;/a&gt; could be sniffing around the city."}

She was described as stout and cheerful, and physically being pink-cheeked and muscle toned curvaceous, with her brown hair tied in a long braid running the length of her back.\nBiography.\nAerin was among the first women to be asked to join the dwarven elite guard, whereas before the events of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; and the rise of &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, only men were chosen.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, she served as Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s bodyguard and warrior trainer during his stay in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, as she had trained many others before. During their time together, the human prince became a close friend of hers. Eventually, Anduin began feeling more than simple friendship toward the warrior.\nUnfortunately, when earthquakes started to erupt in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, Aerin was killed while trapped under the rubble of the collapsed &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Distillery\"&gt;Thunderbrew Distillery&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin used all his strength to try to save her from underneath the rubble, despite suffering injuries himself. Though the prince cried out for aid to the dwarves and draenei nearby, he found none, and fell into unconsciousness. The last thing he saw was the face of the brave Aerin, dead beneath the debris.\nLegacy.\nThe tragic death of his companion played a role in Prince Anduin's shaping morality and worldview, issues he would later confront with Aerin in mind during the trial of deposed Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. She also inspired Anduin to continue with his sword combat training.\nRelatives.\nShe may have been related to &lt;a href=\"Bailor%20Stonehand\"&gt;Bailor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Buliwyf%20Stonehand\"&gt;Buliwyf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gelman%20Stonehand\"&gt;Gelman Stonehand&lt;/a&gt;."}

This fight is mainly healing intensive for low levels. He does not have a strong melee and the tank can be easily healed. DPS should focus on just dpsing him down. Every few seconds, he will lift the party up and cause 200 damage per second for around 4\u20135 seconds (800-1000 damage). Shields and HoTs should be given prior to this spell. He will cast a healing spell after the party returns to the ground, which should heal the group to near enough their full health. Repeat this process until Baron Ashbury dies.\nHeroic Mode.\nIn heroic mode, Stay of Execution will heal Baron Ashbury as well as the other players. The fight hinges on correct use of interrupts and healing: as Asphyxiate reduces everyone to 1\u00a0hp, it is impractical to attempt to heal everyone back to full health; and without Stay of Execution, Ashbury is likely to kill multiple people with Wracking Pain before the healer can catch up.\nPain and Suffering, a channeled DoT on a random party member, should be interrupted or dispelled. Stay of Execution, cast immediately after Asphyxiate, should be interrupted after it ticks once or twice: too few ticks will end up getting people killed; too many, and Ashbury will regain too much health.\nCalamity is essentially an enrage at the end of the fight. Once it starts, no more interrupts or tanking is necessary. DPS should burn all cooldowns at this point and try to take him down before the healer runs out of mana.\nQuotes.\nAshbury will occasionally talk to the prisoners before the fight:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "19710", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19710", "title": "Baron Geddon", "text": "Baron Geddon is a &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. He patrols near &lt;a href=\"Shazzrah\"&gt;Shazzrah's&lt;/a&gt; spawn area while guarding the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Zeth\"&gt;Rune of Zeth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; was ripped from the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, several subjects from the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; followed in his wake. Baron Geddon fought against the titans and aided in the betrayal of Thunderaan, Prince of Air. The Firelord devoured the essence of the prince, but was unable to consume him entirely. Thus, the remaining energies were trapped within a talisman of elemental binding, which Ragnaros split into two perfect halves which he gave to his two lieutenants. Rumor has it that &lt;a href=\"Executus\"&gt;Executus&lt;/a&gt; supplanted Baron Geddon, and the two have been rivals ever since. Although this rumor has yet to be confirmed, there is certainly no doubt that Ragnaros does not tolerate failure. Thus, the lesser flamewakers (and, of course, Baron Geddon) eagerly awaited a misstep by Executus, anticipating their chance to vie for the coveted attention of the Firelord.\nBaron Geddon guarded one half of the talisman deep within the fiery confines of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. Though the two have fought side by side for countless millennia, Baron Geddon harbored suspicious that &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt; would seek to supplant him as the sole guardian of the talisman. Geddon, therefore, remained ever cautious of his former comrade. In fact, it was &lt;a href=\"Shazzrah\"&gt;Shazzrah&lt;/a&gt; who sought to posses both halves of the talisman so that he might find a way to siphon its energies for his own use.\nGeddon also taught a &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Incendius\"&gt;Lord Incendius&lt;/a&gt; to harness his destructive powers, but the baron never expected his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to grow so lethally efficient. Increasingly wary that Incendius might usurp him, Geddon sent the blazing elemental out of the Molten Core to guard the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;' fabled &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventurers of the Horde and the Alliance stormed the Molten Core and defeated both lieutenants and managed to get the halves of the talisman.\nCataclysm.\nBaron Geddon returned a few years later when Ragnaros assaulted &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, but adventurers once again banished him back to &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;The Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nBaron Geddon is one of the eldest of all fire elementals, and he served as Ragnaros\u2019 right hand during the beginning of the war against the titans. During one of the first battles against the then-unknown titan attackers, Geddon was defeated and forced into humiliating retreat. Ragnaros immediately demoted his commander, thinking that Geddon had been defeated by an inferior foe, since the Old Gods and their lieutenants had never yet met a challenge. His replacement was the flamewaker &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;; Geddon was infuriated that a creature not purely of fire replaced him, a noble among the elementals. In an effort to regain his master\u2019s faith, Baron Geddon planned the now legendary betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderaan the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of a great battle, Geddon separated the massive lightning elemental from his allies, and together with &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, they ambushed the great elemental in an effort to steal his power.\nThunderaan was a powerful foe, even to an elemental lieutenant such as Ragnaros, and the Firelord was unable to completely destroy him as he had hoped. The three did manage to seal the Windseeker away, however, and imprison his essence in the talisman known as the &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Bindings of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros then broke the talisman in half and charged each of his lieutenants, Garr and Geddon, with keeping one half safe. It is said that if the halves are brought together again then Thunderaan might escape. However, Geddon did not win back his old position by his master\u2019s side. Today, he waits and bides his time, hoping to grow strong enough to find a way to overthrow or discredit Majordomo Executus. Baron Geddon currently dwells in the tunnels of the molten core of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where he keeps a tireless vigil against intruders. Both Baron Geddon and Garr draw their considerable might from the blazing runes carved deep into the floor of &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nHis appearance is a vaguely humanoid upper torso composed of pure flames. He is bound at what might be his wrists by two thick metal bracers. The lower portion of his body is a whirlwind of spinning flames that barely touch the ground. Baron Geddon opens combat using ignite mana on any obvious powerful spellcaster. He continues doing so until forced into melee or until every powerful spellcaster is under the influence of ignite mana. Baron Geddon then uses inferno to drive away nearby attackers, to a (presumably) safe distance. He uses living bomb on anything he can target until once again engaged in melee. Baron Geddon stays mobile, moving around with Spring Attack to keep his foes from bringing all of their melee to bear on him. He repeats the cycle \u2014 inferno, living bomb, and melee \u2014 whenever his foes get too close. He refreshes ignite mana when he suspects it has been dispelled. Baron Geddon can intensify the heat of his body to the point where flames erupt all around him. Baron Geddon can turn creatures into living bombs. The creature starts building up elemental energy and can feel the heat rising inside itself. If the effect is not dispelled, the creature explodes in flames, damaging those around him.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Baron Geddon targets three players with Living Bomb instead of one. In addition, both Living Bomb and Inferno leave patches of fire on the ground.\nStrategies.\nStrategy 1.\nBaron Geddon is usually pulled to Garr's room for an easier fight. Typically the raid is setup in one of two ways:\nWhen Baron Geddon starts his inferno all melee DPS needs to leave, even the MT. No matter how well geared the MT is, he will have a hard time surviving the inferno (unless he has over 315 FR)(and if he does survive it will cost a lot of healer mana). Beginning groups in MC that can't take the damage may want to have all players do ranged DPS and only allow the MT to get into melee range. Ignite mana should be dispelled, but not from warriors or rogues. Druids, if not otherwise engaged, can shift to bear or cat to eliminate both the mana loss and the damage taken from Ignite Mana until the debuff can be dispelled (see Notes section for a small problem with this strategy for Druids). Whoever is the living bomb MUST run away from the group and blow up by himself. Some groups have everyone else run away from the person with the bomb, but this method means all magic DPS and healing stops and is not recommended. It's suggested to try and run to one of the edges of the room where the ceiling is sloped down to stop one from flying up as high. There are places in the room where you don't even leave the ground when you explode. Most raids using a voice talking server (Ventrilo or Teamspeak) will have someone calling the name of the player with the bomb debuff. \"Volk is the Bomb! Volk, run away from the group!\" would be a typical response to a player named Volk being debuffed. \"Alright. Lets rez up and rebuff.\" would be the result of Volk not getting away from the group. In the case of exploding in an open area, Mages and Priests can use Light Feathers to cast Slow Fall or Levitate, which will mitigate the falling damage and increase those classes survivability from being the bomb. Mages can also Ice Barrier, and Priests can Power Word: Shield prior to the explosion to help blunt some of the damage. Mages can use Ice Block and Paladins can use Divine Shield to remove this debuff from themselves. Druids can shift into bear form to absorb some of the explosion damage with their increased health then shift into cat form (if fast enough) while airborne to cut falling damage in half. Druids as well as Shamans can use Nature's Swiftness and Healing Wave to heal while airborne.\nThis fight is one of the easiest to MT in Molten Core. You must remember that he pulses 9 times each AoE. This fight will be frustrating the first two or three times, but it will quickly become cake when everyone figures out what's going to happen. Using CT_RA and Boss Mods will make identifying the bomb much easier.\nYou can also let a hunter use Eyes of the Beast to pull Geddon to the Garr room, where the raid is waiting for him standing on the rune, only the Tank will be outside the rune at this point. When Geddon comes the warrior aggroes him (there won't be needed more than a hit since the pulling pet have just walked into his aggro zone). After the initial aggro you let the tank get a lot of aggro, using Sunder Armor, whereafter the rogues and other warriors engage in melee combat, and when the pulses come they run out and begins shooting at him. I have never tried with the tank running out. \nWhen someone get the bomb they run to the nearby pylons (near the tunnel where Geddon enters) where a priest is standing casting Power Word: Shield on the bomb. The priest should of course be well out of range of the bomb damage.\nCombustion does not affect the crit chance of the Bomb, so don't bother using it if your plans are to suicide bomb your raid group.\nStrategy 2, The \"Easy One\".\nWith a higher level group setup (all necessary members past level 70 or up to 80), the main threat to the group is fall damage, since it scales based on your level to do equal damage. In this group setup, Garr's room is not the best idea due to the high ceiling. \nInstead, the tank pulls Geddon into the hallway connecting Garr's room with Geddon's room. The low ceiling makes for zero fall damage. Necessary dispel to have available is magic dispel. Though the fight is not difficult, the mana burning debuff can still put healers in a very uncomfortable position, especially if the healers are not 80. Therefore, a paladin, priest, or warlock with felhunter is necessary to dispel the mana burn. \nTo deal with the bomb, the group stays together tightly in one spot while the tank holds Geddon towards the exit of the tunnel, leading away from Garr's room. When someone in the group gets the bomb debuff, they run down the tunnel to get away from the rest of the group. Once the bomb is gone, the group member runs back to the cluster of the rest of the party. If the whole group is in good shape, at least 70, and has a good healer, though, running with the bomb becomes rather unnecessary.\nReward.\nBaron Geddon's death rewards 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; up to 20,999/21,000 Revered.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

From his balcony atop the &lt;a href=\"Salty%20Sailor%20Tavern\"&gt;Salty Sailor Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, he has an overview of the entire &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Cove\"&gt;Blackwater Cove&lt;/a&gt;, and is able to observe strangers and visitors of his town.

He is significantly invested in maintaining Booty Bay's independent affiliation.\nRevilgaz has some sort of vision problem with his right eye, which required a magic spyglass be custom made for his use at great cost.

However as the goblin broke a rule - never betray a client's confidence, Revilgaz dismissed him permanently.\nCataclysm.\nBaron Revilgaz prepares for the battle of his life as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; (led by &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Master%20Firallon\"&gt;Fleet Master Firallon&lt;/a&gt;) have finally launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, Revilgaz wanted to keep the trolls at bay by looting an object from them. He sent &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Blingbang\"&gt;Overseer Blingbang&lt;/a&gt; to find it.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nHe has lost &lt;a href=\"Magical%20Spyglass\"&gt;his magic spyglass&lt;/a&gt; and was glad when an adventurer returned it to him. In exchange, the baron gave them an &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; crystal as a reward.\nDragonflight.\nThe blue dragon Zeros was in debt with the Baron. Even after getting paid, he was about to steal Zeros' scales before being scared by &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nWelcome to Booty Bay, partner. I hope your stay in my town is enjoyable and uneventful - emphasis on the latter.

He has the \"Goblin Leader of Blackwater Raiders\" title.\nRevilgaz is mounted on top of a large, steam-powered contraption that resembles a metal suit with whirling buzzsaws in place of hands. He wears extremely gaudy clothes, adorned with all manner of jewelry. As the contraption\u2019s engine runs, it makes the goblin bounce up and down, seemingly out of control, causing his jewelry to rattle and clink in ridiculous fashion. Extremely cautious in battle, Baron Revilgaz prefers to fight only when he holds a clear advantage. Unafraid to flee when a situation favors his enemies, Revilgaz\u2019s first priority is always to preserve his own life. His shredder suit is custom-built to provide enough armor and weaponry to allow him to fight toe-to-toe with heavily armored warriors, although he will avoid doing so if at all possible.\nWhen engaged in combat, Revilgaz\u2019s first action is always to call for his bodyguards \u2014 a trio of disguised Blackwater Raiders who usually lurk nearby. Fully aware of the dangers of fighting spellcasters, Revilgaz then tries to hurl bombs at any obvious wizards and sorcerers before engaging other targets in melee combat. If possible, he maneuvers his shredder to the sides of his enemies and attempts to flank them, taking full advantage of his ability to deliver sneak attacks. If overmatched, he ejects from his shredder and flees on foot, only stopping to fight with his enchanted short sword as a last resort."}

Originally ruling over the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, he led the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; in place of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Mograine&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nIn life, Baron Rivendare was a rich landowner in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and a friend to &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who convinced him to join the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; left for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to hunt &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, Rivendare sent a shipment of grain to a village of Lordaeron where &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt; happened to be stationed. When the villagers turned into mindless zombies, Thomas understood that Rivendare was a traitor and reported it to the rest of the Silver Hand paladins. Rivendare eventually became a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; and was placed in control of the burning remains of Stratholme. When he became a champion of the Scourge, he condemned his favorite horse, &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger%27s%20Reins\"&gt;Deathcharger&lt;/a&gt;, to join him in undeath. At some point, he held &lt;a href=\"Ysida%20Harmon\"&gt;Ysida Harmon&lt;/a&gt; captive.\nWhile he held Stratholme against the Scarlet Crusade, Baron Rivendare later coordinated the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and battled with agents of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Nicholas%20Zverenhoff\"&gt;Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff&lt;/a&gt; to Stratholme to kill him. Aided by his son &lt;a href=\"Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Aurius&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurers defeated the baron, but not before his unnaturally savage blows wounded Aurius, who later succumbed to his injuries. He was later part of the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and eventually became a member of the Four Horsemen in Naxxramas. Although Naxxramas was raided by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, his existence remains a mystery, and it is likely that he will never fully be destroyed until Kel'Thuzad meets his end.\nAfter Rivendare's defeat, Deathcharger's saddle was returned to Stratholme. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; sent champions on behalf of &lt;a href=\"Salanar%20the%20Horseman\"&gt;Salanar the Horseman&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve it, in order to him to create new steeds for the order's Four Horsemen. The ghost &lt;a href=\"Vivian%27s%20Lament\"&gt;Vivian's Lament&lt;/a&gt; was the major obstacle to this goal.\nIt is unknown if Rivendare is dead or not. As Kel'Thuzad was permanently defeated in \"\", it is possible the Baron may still be alive, albeit on his last life.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\".\nBaron Rivendare was originally the final boss of the undead side of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; until he was replaced by &lt;a href=\"Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nRivendare appears in next to &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; during the initial phases of the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; intro questline, before moving to the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Remembrance\"&gt;Crypt of Remembrance&lt;/a&gt;. He gives the quest &lt;a href=\"Lambs%20To%20The%20Slaughter\"&gt;Lambs To The Slaughter&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also appears in the \"\" version of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, replacing &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; as the fourth member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nOnce a wealthy human landowner, the plague corrupted Rivendare and he pledged himself as a death knight. Rivendare\u2019s duty is to round up and murder any human survivors he can find, and he and his patrols do just that. \nHe fell under Kel'Thuzad's sway and helped build and structure the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Rivendare then achieved the title and powers of a death knight. Now, Rivendare has his base in Stratholme. He serves Kel'Thuzad eagerly and exults in his power. One of his greatest joys is to instill corruption in others, especially paladins, and most especially members of the Argent Dawn. This knight is a regal figure \u2014 his face is pale but aristocratic, and white hair hangs to his shoulders, while a scarf covers his face. He crouches over a horned, skeletal steed, and purple runes glitter across his black armor, cloak, and runeblade. Baron Rivendare excels at melee combat (especially mounted warfare) and he knows it. At the earliest possible moment, he charges, whether afoot or mounted on his skeletal horse, Deathcharger. Then the baron unleashes the dreadful power of his runeblade. He prefers to fight with created undead to support him, and he uses death pact on these to recover hit points. Rivendare enjoys testing his mettle against fellow close combat specialists, but strikes at arcanists and healers if they prove bothersome.\nQuotes.\nIn the Scarlet Enclave.\nCrusaders...\n&lt;Rivendare shakes his head.&gt;\nI am convinced that they are a unique lot amongst the humans. My theory is that they lack higher brain function, unable to logically assess a situation and calculate an outcome. One has only to make mention of the Light to get them frothing and battle ready - at which point they will rush headlong into any engagement with complete disregard for their own well being."}
{"id": "191310", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=191310", "title": "Baron Rivendare (tactics)", "text": "Baron Rivendare is a powerful &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, coordinating the efforts of the Scourge in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Ruling over the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, he currently battles with agents of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; sent to Stratholme to kill him.\nStrategy.\nThe Baron Rivendare fight presents two major challenges. First, his damage aura, which applies shadow damage to everyone in range. Second, he periodically spawns waves of skeletons from the bone piles scattered around his room. If these skeletons survive long enough, he casts Death Pact on them, killing them but healing himself.\nTo deal with the shadow aura, have your tank position the Baron against one wall of the chamber. Have your healers and ranged damage dealers stand on the opposite wall. This will allow them to stay out of range of the aura, avoiding the damage and casting interruptions. The tank and melee damage dealers will have to absorb the aura's damage. A &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; can buff the group with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; can use the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Shadow Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate that damage. If the tank has any kind of shadow resistance gear, it's not a bad idea to equip it, although not absolutely required to defeat Baron.\nThe skeletons will almost always immediately aggro your healer. One of the easiest ways to deal with this is to have a class with high &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage, like a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; in the group, and position them right next to the healer. They can then AoE the skeletons, which have moderate damage but very low hit points, as they rush towards the healer.\nIf you don't have a mage or a warlock in the group, there are other ways to deal with the skeletons. A &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt; talent can kill the skeletons and keep the ranged party members healed at the same time, but this is very mana intensive, and he might need that mana to heal through the Baron's damage. A &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; can use &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Wrath\"&gt;Holy Wrath&lt;/a&gt; as well, which will normally kill all the skeletons and hurt the Baron somewhat.\nYou can also try having members of your party use the that can be gathered throughout the instance. One bottle is generally enough for each wave of skeletons.\nAt the beginning of the Stratholme Undead side instance, there is an NPC you can talk to. If you have the Medallion of Faith, obtainable in the Stratholme Live side, you can give this to the NPC and he will assist you once you attack the Baron. This quest is repeatable.\nOwners of &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s must note to have their pets in passive mode as they enter the chamber, as their response to the shadow aura damage will likely trigger the encounter before the party is ready.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

As expected, Ninadar sent Kel'Thuzad's \"acolyte\" to obtain overdue scrolls held by the Grimoirium's &lt;a href=\"Studious%20Acolyte\"&gt;studious acolytes&lt;/a&gt; and capture loose animated quills and parchment before she parted with the list of Kel'Thuzad's books and told the acolyte that the volumes could be found in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Tomes\"&gt;Hall of Tomes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter his ritual was sabotaged by the Maw Walkers and the deposed baron &lt;a href=\"Balmedar\"&gt;Balmedar&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad openly launched a coup against &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;, confronting her and Ninadar at the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Hall of Sorcery&lt;/a&gt;.

With the help of &lt;a href=\"Emeni\"&gt;Emeni&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, the Maw Walkers pushed through the baroness' forces and damaged her until she was forced to retreat by teleporting to the Grimoirium. There, she began drawing out a massive amount of energy from the house's &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; reservoir, and Balmedar (who was accompanying the Necrolords) warned that she had to be stopped before she destroyed them all. After becoming empowered by anima, Ninadar began fighting the Maw Walkers, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; until she was nearly defeated again. Yelling that she intended to have what she had been promised, Ninadar began absorbing even more anima, ignoring Balmedar's protests that it was too much for her to control. Moments later, the excessive power created an explosion that completely obliterated the baroness. She left behind the Staff of the Primus, which the Necrolords subsequently used to free Sin'dane and defeated Kel'Thuzad.\nAbilities.\nAs Baroness Ninadar (stage 2):\nAs Empowered Baroness Ninadar (stage 4):"}

He serves as Stormwind City's chief architect.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Baros moves to the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; in to serve its &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; as the architect for their new fortress.\nBiography.\nIn his childhood, Baros lived and worked on the &lt;a href=\"Alexston%20Farmstead\"&gt;Alexston Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, his family's home was burned down and taken over by thieves. Baros's father was unable to save all their possessions, so he hid many away on the farm.\nBaros eventually became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt;, where he worked with , their main project being to rebuild Stormwind City after its destruction in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Through years of work, the Guild completed the reconstruction of the city. Following a refusal by the Stormwind &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; to compensate the Stonemasons as agreed, Edwin VanCleef (who had been elected Guildmaster) spoke out, demanding full restitution for their works. In response, the House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, leading to riots. VanCleef eventually led the Stonemasons out of the city in rebellion. It was at this time that Baros was offered the position of city architect if he did not join with VanCleef. Owing to certain ideological differences with the Guild, Baros chose to accept the offer.\nIt is known that owes Baros a favor, though it isn't explained why.\nWorld of Warcraft and the Cataclysm era.\nBaros's father revealed to his son that he hid the family possessions. Baros eventually asked the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance to go to his former house and to find them, his first compass among them. He was also involved in the events leading to the exposing of &lt;a href=\"Gregor%20Lescovar\"&gt;Gregor Lescovar&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal. On the dead body of Edwin VanCleef, an &lt;a href=\"An%20Unsent%20Letter\"&gt;unsent letter&lt;/a&gt; addressed to Baros was found.\nStill working as chief architect in Stormwind, Baros hired &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Wick\"&gt;Foreman Wick&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Stonecutter%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Royal Stonecutter's Guild&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Mason%20Goldgild\"&gt;Mason Goldgild&lt;/a&gt; to remove a wall of Stormwind's Canals using explosives, and to build the gatehouse and road leading down into &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Baros ordered the two to recover and repair &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;'s statue in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nBaros was put in charge of rebuilding Stormwind, after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s attack, and kept the &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; informed of the progress and price.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; in , Baros was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to build &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt;, an Alliance &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; situated in . He expressed his eagerness to claim the land for the Alliance.\nFollowing this, Baros served as the chief architect of the settlement for &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;its commander&lt;/a&gt;, remarking on his previous work in rebuilding Stormwind City and stating that building Lunarfall would be \"a walk in the park\". Baros, however, soon found himself overwhelmed with the many stresses of managing the garrison. He is subsequently revealed to have romantic interest in &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Thorn\"&gt;Lieutenant Thorn&lt;/a&gt; and often speaks fondly of her to the commander.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Jr.%20Surveyor%20Dorn\"&gt;Jr. Surveyor Dorn&lt;/a&gt; told Baros about unusual seismic activity, but the architect was skeptical and sent the commander to investigate it.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; eventually attacked Lunarfall to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Gorgorek\"&gt;Heart of Gorgorek&lt;/a&gt;, Baros courageously threw himself in the way of a blade meant for Lieutenant Thorn, saving her at the cost of his own life. Thorn was distraught over Baros's death, so much so that it is implied she will never transform out of her &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; form again, and lamented their lack of time spent together but resolved to continue on in his memory."}

However, the Barracks couldn't be built by the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28high%20elf%29\"&gt;High elf worker&lt;/a&gt; unit likely due to the limited ability of the map editor prior to the ' expansion. With the addition of The Frozen Throne expansion's map editor, it is possible to make additional groups with building orders.\nThe barracks also helped the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign in The Frozen Throne. This barracks produced unique blood elven-only units but had the same design as the human ones.\nDraenei barracks.\nThe draenei barracks was a &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; building that trained &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Seer\"&gt;draenei seers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Vindicator%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;draenei vindicators&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Stalker\"&gt;draenei stalkers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Salamander%20%28campaign%29\"&gt;salamanders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Harbinger\"&gt;draenei harbingers&lt;/a&gt; who helped &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBarracks can be found all throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Smaller, wooden barracks are sometimes used by neutral groups like pirates.\nFor some reason, the human &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; design used in \"Warcraft III\" was combined with the Alliance barracks design of the same game to create the type used in \"World of Warcraft\". This means that the human barracks found in \"World of Warcraft\" are very similar to keeps, to the point that barracks and keeps are often interchangeable in dialogs. Buildings that are distinctly ruined keeps have a clock tower like they did in \"Warcraft III\", but there is no intact keep model. As an example, &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Keep\"&gt;Menethil Keep&lt;/a&gt; previously had a barracks model when it was intact, but now that it has been partially destroyed it uses a keep model with a clock tower. This changed with the new style of buildings used by the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where keeps are similar but distinct from the barracks due to their tower. Sadly this does not stop the confusion, as &lt;a href=\"Recruitment%20Officer%20Blythe\"&gt;Recruitment Officer Blythe&lt;/a&gt; calls the presumed keep part of &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; a barracks in &lt;a href=\"Enlistment%20Day\"&gt;Enlistment Day&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilarly, the orc &lt;a href=\"stronghold\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; design was combined with the Horde barracks of \"Warcraft II\" to create the type used in \"World of Warcraft\". Though, the same model is not used for both structure types; the old barracks design went to the stronghold (minus the rear fifth tower for some reason), and a new, more open design based on the style from \"Warcraft III\" was created for the barracks. Once again barracks and strongholds are often interchangeable in dialogs. Starting with the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs also began building metallic barracks, to the point that during the offensive they often replaced &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;s in orc bases. There are two variants of these metallic barracks models, one with two floors inside the tower and one with three. Given the pattern, the expanded orc barracks is probably also sometimes a stronghold.\nIt is unknown why the second-level &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;s and barracks of both races were merged. To make matters worse, dwarven keeps like &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Garok\"&gt;Dun Garok&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angor%20Fortress\"&gt;Angor Fortress&lt;/a&gt; were previously often described as either keeps or barracks.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Champions%27%20Hall\"&gt;Champions' Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Command%20Center\"&gt;Command Center&lt;/a&gt;, and in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; district of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; all seemed to be in the style of the Alliance barracks of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is a massive savanna, with a few oases in the north-central region around the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; and with low mountains serving as natural borders.\nLong ago, the Barrens was mostly forests, tended to by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. The combination of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, war, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; turned the woodland into a barren expanse. Now, the divided Barrens are a shade of their glory, one that is in short supply in this dry place. Despite this, it is more than an infertile soil and sand.\nHistory.\nThe Barrens were once a verdant, thriving forest, tended to by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;. An expeditionary force sent by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; established the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Then%27Ralore\"&gt;Then'Ralore&lt;/a&gt; in the lush wilds. It is said that during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the demigod &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; confronted the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the lush land that later became the Barrens. After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, war and disaster raged across the land, turning this valley of nature into the harsh, sun-scorched plain it is today.\nIt is said that at some point a person named &lt;a href=\"Dethorin\"&gt;Dethorin&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the land after he had found his &lt;a href=\"Allurana\"&gt;Allurana&lt;/a&gt; in arms of her lover. Dethorin cried out and the sands of the Barrens burst forth the axe &lt;a href=\"Killmaim%20%28axe%29\"&gt;Killmaim&lt;/a&gt; with which he killed Allurana.\nFor countless generations, the tauren roamed the plains of the Barrens, honoring their people and culture, hunting the mighty &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cheetah\"&gt;cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"zhevra\"&gt;zhevra&lt;/a&gt;, and seeking the wisdom of their eternal goddess, the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. Their tent settlements were scattered across the landscape and changed with the seasons and the weather. The wandering tribes were united only by a common hatred for their sworn enemy, the marauding &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;. The centaur hunted the tauren for sport and launched intermittent attacks on their foes, taking a heavy toll on both sides. The tauren did not shy away from combat and made the centaur pay for every unprovoked attack, but they had no love for war and always opted to find a new home rather than throw their lives away whenever the horse men appeared. As such, the tauren lived in a constant state of upheaval, and a year of peace was always followed by a year of war. The shu'halo accepted this cycle of conflict as inescapable as it was the only life they knew, but that would eventually change.\nThird War and aftermath.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s under the new Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt; landed on the Barrens, it saw civilization anew. First, the area was crossed by the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Thrall reunited his warriors scattered on the shore, and the Horde then helped the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; at their village. The tauren and the Horde marched through the Barrens, visiting its oases and finding a group of Warsong warriors. The tauren crossed the Barrens into Mulgore, fighting against &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; warbands and ultimately triumphing over them.\nAfter the Warsongs were corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, they took the area near the northern border of the Barrens. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; fought against the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their demonic allies.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall led the Horde to the eastern Barrens and claimed it as their own, fighting the local &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; and naming the land &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; with its capital &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCycle of Hatred.\nOne year before the events of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", the Barrens was considered neutral territory, serving as a buffer between &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, tensions were also rising between the Horde and Theramore. Though Thrall and Jaina desperately attempted to keep the peace between their two kingdoms, the Horde grew out of Thrall's control when his chief warrior &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt; took an army of orcs and trolls to &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 whose build up of human forces was viewed as an act of aggression\u2014 and demanded they dismantle it. After the battle began, Jaina contacted Thrall with information that his Burx was working for the orcish end of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; cult. Infuriated at the idea that an orc would once again serve the Legion (the demon &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; was pulling the strings of the cult), Thrall immediately stopped the battle (with some impressive aid from the Spirits) and denounced Burx. When the warrior protested that he was acting within the Horde's interests, Thrall smashed his skull with the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; confronted Zmodlor in &lt;a href=\"Dreadmist%20Peak\"&gt;Dreadmist Peak&lt;/a&gt; and successfully banished him into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; built new settlements among the dry grasses and arid hills, and placed the Barrens solidly into the heart of Horde territory. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has set up numerous outposts in this barren land, the largest being the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; at the intersection of two major roads, and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; outpost near the border to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. The Barrens are also dotted with numerous farms populated by &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and their families, and &lt;a href=\"watch%20tower\"&gt;watch tower&lt;/a&gt;s manned by orcish and tauren guards. The Horde continued to fight against the Razormane and Razorfen quilboar, Kolkar centaur, Burning Blade cultists in the north, or the newly arrived &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; in the south.\nThe humans of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; have also occupied the land and have taken &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; as a defensive outpost. The &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; have also established a stronghold near the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; excavation site of &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; and named the stronghold &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Keep\"&gt;Bael'dun Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Outrunners\"&gt;Alliance Outrunners&lt;/a&gt; were patrolling the area, usually near the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Gold%20Road\"&gt;Southern Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe neutral goblin port Ratchet, led by Gazlowe, was also built here. A group of Cenarion Circle druids led by Naralex arrived to the Wailing Caverns in order to enter the Emerald Dream and restore the harsh land to its former green form.\n&lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; lies just opposite the road, but this dungeon has been infested by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and poses a great threat to anyone who is traveling to or from the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;, the area was invaded by the armies of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nSomething was polluting the water, and in turn beginning to wreck the northern Barrens ecosystem. Sick gazelles have been sighted in northern Barrens, and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; provided aid.\nCataclysm.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, the Barrens was drier than ever. The oases, the salvation of the Barrens, had begun drying up as mysteriously as they had appeared.\nThe day before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance forces streamed out of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch\"&gt;Northwatch&lt;/a&gt; and marched up the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt;, besieging &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; as dusk fell. Then, in the heart of the night, they force-marched southward, leaving their campfires burning behind in order to surprise attack &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt; at dawn's first light.\nAfter the Cataclysm, the Barrens was split in two with a lava river separating the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Southern Barrens is a generic term for all the lands on the southern part of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Divide\"&gt;Great Divide&lt;/a&gt;. This region is not only one of the most hardest hit by the Cataclysm, but also is one of the biggest war zones in the escalating conflict between the Alliance and Horde. In the wake of the Cataclysm, the Alliance has been pushing into the Barrens in retaliation to the aggression of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;new Warchief&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Barrens continued to be an important place and a location of several wars, including the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion's third ivnasion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Barrens are huge, one of the largest zones in the game. The land is mostly flat, with a few hills scattered throughout. The climate is harsh and hot, but survivable due to several lush oases. With a stretch of &lt;a href=\"The%20Merchant%20Coast\"&gt;coastline&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;marsh&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, and the desert conditions to the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;northeast&lt;/a&gt;, the Barrens is surrounded by extremely varied landscapes.\nThe herbs of the Barrens are not quite like herbs in other lands. Their properties are mostly the same, but the oasis water here alters the plants; they are just slightly different. Occasionally, rain does come to the Barrens.\nIn Warcraft III.\nA number of intelligent races occupied the Barrens that are absent in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\":\n&lt;a href=\"Vulture\"&gt;Vulture&lt;/a&gt;s were also said to be found throughout the Barrens \u2013 seeking carnage upon which to feed. The mottled scavengers have been known to aid the vile harpies from time to time \u2013 drawn by the promise of freshly slain flesh and blood.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nThe Barrens was once a thriving forest under the protection of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and their kind. Several &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; settlements dotted the land, and there was no ocean for miles. Then came the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, which shook ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to the bedrock. This forested landscape transformed into a scorched plain and is battered now each day by the sun's rays. The Barrens is a sprawling and arid savanna that stretches between the Stonetalon Mountains to the west and Durotar to the east. The grasslands and mesas of Mulgore rise to the southwest, while the wetlands of Dustwallow Marsh lie to the southeast. \nGeography.\nThe majority of the region consists of vast plains. Mountains to the west hold in heated air, creating the swirling winds that rage across the plains. These windstorms stir up dust devils and tear apart anything larger than the small, tenacious scrub trees. Water is more valuable than gold in the Barrens, and the locations of hidden watering holes are the residents' most closely held secrets. Dry riverbeds and a never-ending spider web of canyons make any journey across the Barrens a dangerous and winding trek. The few brave adventurers willing to scrape out a life on the arid plains inevitably run afoul of centaur warbands or quilboar raiding parties. Despite its often uninviting terrain and hostile inhabitants, the Barrens receive a good deal of interest from Alliance and Horde alike, as well as races native to Kalimdor. Trade routes crisscross the landscape leading to and from more inviting regions, most notably the Gold Road that runs north-to-south through the Barrens and beyond, and rumors suggest that precious minerals and ruins await those with the courage to investigate.\nInhabitants.\nBefore the upheaval, several large &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; cities stood here. Now, those brave few willing to scrape out a life on the arid plains inevitably run afoul of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; warbands or &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; raiding parties. Despite its often uninviting terrain and hostile inhabitants, the Barrens receive a good deal of interest from &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; alike, as well as races native to Kalimdor. Trade routes crisscross the landscape leading to and from more inviting regions, and the most notable route is the &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Road\"&gt;Gold Road&lt;/a&gt; that runs north-to-south through the Barrens and beyond. Rumors suggest that precious minerals and treasure-filled ruins await those with the courage to investigate.\nCentaur warbands are most often seen in the Barrens' canyons, though they roam as far as the river that forms its eastern border with Durotar. Fearlessly aggressive, the centaur are known for their savagery, especially against &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. They are not above attacking trade caravans also, for the goods or just for the sake of violence. Travelers who survive the centaur\u2019s battle lust are used as slave labor in the hardscrabble mines the centaur carve into the hard-baked earth.\nDisplaced from Durotar by Orcs, quilboar have built crude villages along the river that separates the orc nation from the Barrens. From there, they strike out across the river to raid settlements or deeper into the Barrens to attack caravans along the Gold Road. The caravan raids have hurt the goblin trade princes\u2019 profits, so they have started negotiations to pay the quilboar gold and goods to protect caravans against centaur warbands.\nThe quilboar have also erected a fortress called &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; in the southeastern Barrens. Razorfen is a sprawling mass of giant, twisting thorns and crude mud huts. It serves as the center of quilboar society.\nOther dangers include harpies who watch from perches atop mesas in the northern Barrens and large beasts such as lions and thunder lizards - though these creatures tend to avoid the Gold Road.\nNative dangers have not stopped the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; from establishing a stronghold near the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; excavation site of &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;. The centaur have made forays against it, but are repelled decisively each time. Scouts claim that the centaur are amassing other tribes to launch a major attack, but the dwarves are unconcerned. Each day that passes sees Bael Modan grow stronger as the inhabitants build up its defenses.\n&lt;a href=\"Carcass%20of%20Durross%20Malfactin\"&gt;Carcass of Durross Malfactin&lt;/a&gt; is said to be roaming the Barrens."}

Rumours suggest that precious minerals and treasure-filled ruins await those with the courage to investigate.\nGeography.\nThe Barrens are a temperate and warm land. It has hot rugged hills, plains (grassland), some rocky desert and rugged mountains.\nThe Barrens are huge, one of the largest zones in the game. The land is mostly flat, with a few hills scattered throughout. The climate is harsh and hot, but survivable due to several lush oasis. With a stretch of &lt;a href=\"The%20Merchant%20Coast\"&gt;coastline&lt;/a&gt; to the east, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt; to the northwest, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;plains&lt;/a&gt; to the west, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; to the north, &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;marsh&lt;/a&gt; to the southeast, and the desert conditions to the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;northeast&lt;/a&gt;, the Barrens is surrounded by extremely varied landscapes.\nThe Barrens contain three instanced dungeons, the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Kraul\"&gt;Razorfen Kraul&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde entrance to &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; is located to the north. There are two Horde aligned travel hubs in this zone: &lt;a href=\"the%20Crossroads\"&gt;the Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the flight path and boat in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; available to both factions. There are no raid dungeons in the Barrens.\nTravel hubs.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; is likely the biggest travel hub for Horde characters, with a total of 13 flight paths. &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, a secondary hub in the southern Barrens, is very useful for travel from one end of the zone to the other. &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; has both a Horde and Alliance flight master, and a boat which sails to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable characters.\nThe Barrens are home to several characters of note. At the Crossroads, &lt;a href=\"Sergra%20Darkthorn\"&gt;Sergra Darkthorn&lt;/a&gt; sends promising young adventurers to prove their worth to the Horde by hunting local wild creatures. She is assisted in her efforts by &lt;a href=\"Jorn%20Skyseer\"&gt;Jorn Skyseer&lt;/a&gt; in Camp Taurajo, who also refers them to continue their quests in Thunder Bluff. And at his fortified camp west of the Crossroads, the beleaguered &lt;a href=\"Regthar%20Deathgate\"&gt;Regthar Deathgate&lt;/a&gt; fights a one-man battle to keep the savage centaur from breaking through the Horde defenses. The Barrens is also home to &lt;a href=\"Mankrik\"&gt;Mankrik&lt;/a&gt; who gives out the ever so infamous quest to find his wife.\nQuests.\nBeing such a huge zone, the Barrens has a wealth of quests for Horde characters between levels 10 and 20. Of particular note are the hunting quests given by &lt;a href=\"Sergra%20Darkthorn\"&gt;Sergra Darkthorn&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, which lead to similar quests in other zones. Many quests in the Barrens deal with fighting back the centaur and the quilboars. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; has taken a foothold in the northern Barrens and several quests involve investigating and causing trouble for them.\nNotes and trivia.\nAvoiding the Barrens.\nHorde players can completely bypass the Barrens if they wish by questing in &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are a number of reasons that a player might choose to do so:"}

{"id": "25101", "revid": "5472342", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=25101", "title": "Barrens chat", "text": "Barrens chat is a condition which occurs when you have a large, sprawling area that is the primary means of leveling from 10-20. \n\"Barrens chat is like a stupidity centrifuge, distilling the unexpurgated banal thoughts of a thousand morons into a hardened impenetrable lump of smacktardery, spilling endlessly across the bottom of your screen.\"\nNow, Barrens chat has become all but extinct, as most \"trolls\", or players that enjoy provoking others into confrontations, spend their days in Trade chat in the main cities. Some servers manage to keep it alive in their own way, but with the introduction of the Random Dungeon system, characters level 15 and higher spend their time leveling through dungeons, so the Barrens is fairly barren now. There's always the wait in the queue for DPS classes, and the grind from 10 to 15 for those characters without high-level friends to run them through low-level instances, but the occurrences of Barrens chat are much rarer than before.\nA common Barrens chat example would be:\nAnd so on. While some find it annoying, many older players remember Barrens chat with fond nostalgia. Barrens chat can be avoided by simply /leaving the general channel.\n\"Barrens chat\" is not, however, restrained to quest-specific topics: puns and wordplay are common, as are discussions with (relatively) more depth, such as philosophy, physics, and subjects encompassing various areas of theoretical science.\nOrigins.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s proceed to the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; after their respective starting areas (&lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; for the former and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; for the latter two). It is not uncommon for &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to proceed to this area as well instead of heading to &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, most of the new Horde population is stuck here for 10 or so levels. The Barrens is a large and desolate area, branching into other leveling areas such as &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, and back to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; towards &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, it becomes a massive focal point for characters from as low as level 10 up to level 30. The boredom that results in the long runs to questing areas and hand-ins contributes to the Barrens chat phenomenon.\nSadly, (or fortunately depending on how you view it) Barrens chat is nearly extinct. Barrens chat was prevalent because most players during its heyday were brand new, and therefore inexperienced about the quests in the area, and more talkative. Most players in this level range now are usually &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s who have no need to ask about quests or engage in small talk. Moreover, the addition of a flightpath in &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; has eliminated the need to make long runs and subsequently addressed most of the boredom that leads to Barrens chat. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; offer another option for leveling through the teens. Barrens chat is, however, making a comeback as of late. With a large flow of new and old players still heading into and through the Barrens, the chat persists as even alts get bored and attempt to incite Barrens chat with often successful results. New topics have included , &lt;a href=\"Felsteed\"&gt;Felsteed&lt;/a&gt;s, and flamewars current and recent (usually on the trade channel). The mere mention of incites a chain reaction of every Chuck Norris joke ever made.\nThis banter refers mainly to the chat in the Barrens, but can also refer to similar non-game-related chatter in other zones. In such cases, however, the name \"Barrens chat\" is replaced with a title appropriate to the specific zone.\n\"Many experienced players level their alternate characters in this zone and frequently make up stuff in general chat to drive the lower level characters into your classic \"Barrens chat\" nonsense it only takes a little bit to get them going.\" \u2014 Zodd, Thunderlord\nBad cow puns.\nWhile it is usually restricted to &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; character names, Barrens chat sometimes sees an explosion of 'cow' puns and jokes, which often involve plays on various beef- and butcher-related professions and udders.\nBarrens Chat and Blood Elves.\nWith the release of the Burning Crusade, blood elves have a chat area that is much like the Barrens, called the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; (blood-elf starting area for levels 10 - 20). The topics are a bit more quest-related, but still bring out the Barrens nostalgia.\nBarrens Chat and Wrath of the Lich King.\nWith the coming of &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the new hero-class &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; starting at level 55, &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; temporarily became the new version of Barrens Chat. This is because at the start of the expansion almost everyone wanted to try out the new class, which led to over-population and thus evolved into a Barrens Chat situation.\nAlliance equivalent.\nOn certain servers, the &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; chat seems to have become the Alliance version of Barrens chat. As a popular hangout for both new players and bored high-level players, Goldshire is generally avoided by serious players who do not wish to be aggravated by random /yell commands, fish-stick jokes, and &lt;a href=\"ERP\"&gt;ERP&lt;/a&gt;ing. Goldshire is usually used for dueling and the Goldshire chat is not as bad.\nTrivia.\nIn the Blizzard Catalog, there is a shirt that reads: \"I survived Barrens chat.\"\nSome who play &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; characters rephrase the quote \"Stay away from the voodoo, mon\" to \"Stay away from the Barrens, mon\"."}

It also hosted &lt;a href=\"prison\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; vaults of the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nAfter awakening the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; from their slumber, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; entered the Barrow Deeps in search of the remaining Druids.\nDeep in the caves, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; discovered giant &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s which were mutated by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic corruption, and Tyrande saved a Furbolg Shaman after he had been bitten by the creature. They also came across the dwelling of &lt;a href=\"The%20Largest%20Panda%20Ever\"&gt;The Largest Panda Ever&lt;/a&gt;, which would attack if disturbed.\nHaving nearly forgotten after all the years, Malfurion and Tyrande found an ancient gateway to the prison of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion's brother. Despite adamant protests from Malfurion, Tyrande entered the prison. She believed that Illidan would be a powerful ally against the Legion so she split off from Malfurion and went in search of his imprisoned brother.\nMalfurion continued on in search of the Druids of the Claw. He soon found them but they were lost and feral, their minds gone into atrophy. The Druids had slept for so long in their bear forms that they remained as such and even began to believe that they were bears. Malfurion freed them from their hibernation with the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Grateful to be awake and in their right minds once more, the Druids of the Claw agreed to follow Malfurion in the fight against the demonic Legion.\nMeanwhile, Tyrande had freed Illidan from his prison. When reunited with his brother, Malfurion refused to trust Illidan after his betrayal long ago but accepted the aid offered.\nIt contained the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Uberfish\"&gt;Shrine of the Uberfish&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIn the video, Maiev called herself the warden of the barrow prisons. She says only one prisoner has escaped (presumably referring to Illidan Stormrage).\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20troll\"&gt;Dark troll&lt;/a&gt;s lived in the caverns beneath Mount Hyjal. They might have been in the Barrow Deeps.\nIt is possible that the Barrow Deeps are only a small part of a vast cave network extending across most of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, connecting &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and even with &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, the uncorrupted furbolgs of the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; have a side tunnel, currently blocked by a door headed south, likely towards Hyjal. These tunnels supposedly harbor a small portion of the furbolg race that have managed to escape corruption. In \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\", the Barrow Deeps were occupied by at least one tribe of uncorrupted furbolgs fueling speculation these tunnels and the Deeps may be one and the same.\nAlthough there are no subzones called Barrow Deeps, they could be partly represented by &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Hyjal Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt; since they are located very close to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, are guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps%20Watcher\"&gt;Barrow Deeps Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s and they also seem to serve as a prison. They could be connected to the closed tunnel seen in Timbermaw Hold, thus representing the route used by Tyrande and Malfurion to reach the summit of Mount Hyjal before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;."}

Gnomish inventors are the classic counterpart to &lt;a href=\"goblin%20alchemist\"&gt;goblin alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSecond War.\nThe inventors were highly adept at creating outlandishly clever contraptions for military use. Among the many bizarre inventions created by the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s were the &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Flying%20Machine%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;flying machines&lt;/a&gt; that hovered high above both land and sea, as well as the implausible &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Submarine%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;submarine&lt;/a&gt; that could move under the seas. The gnomes were also responsible for perfecting the technique of extracting various chemical compounds out of &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; to make gunpowder and explosives. Although the gnomes were a bit odd and eccentric, none could deny their value to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Third War.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;'s heyday, inventors would compete for status by pitting their creations against one another.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", one scene had the young &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; helping the goblin &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; against a group of nearby gnomish inventors.

One is always trying to push the limits of his devices to unknowable extremes while the other does everything he can to keep the invention from becoming disastrous. It was two pairings of just this type that created the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;underground railroad&lt;/a&gt; that connects &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nGnomish inventors are credited for the creation of several items, such as the &lt;a href=\"Steam%20Gauntlets\"&gt;Steam Gauntlets&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20rocket\"&gt;gnomish rocket&lt;/a&gt;s, and several &lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt; upgrades. &lt;a href=\"Devonix\"&gt;Devonix&lt;/a&gt; is mentioned as a gnomish inventor and explorer."}

In the wake of , survivors of the fallout make their way to New Tinkertown, the gnomes' foothold outside their captured city. Although work is now under way to retrieve and decontaminate irradiated survivors from Gnomeregan itself, another battle has ignited in Dun Morogh against one of &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;'s henchmen, &lt;a href=\"Razlo%20Crushcog\"&gt;Razlo Crushcog&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe gnomish &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s are found by the &lt;a href=\"Survivor%20Assistance%20Facilitation%20Expedition\"&gt;Survivor Assistance Facilitation Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, S.A.F.E., a team dedicated to rescue any survivors from the inner city. Despite being in contact with the the radiation that permeates Gnomeregan for a long time, the adventurers are found to be resistant to it.

Finally they are decontaminated and brought to the surface to meet with the gnomish leader, &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;High Tinker Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, the fight goes on at the surface. The adventurers help their fellow gnomes bringing &lt;a href=\"Spare%20Part%20%28Dun%20Morogh%29\"&gt;spare parts&lt;/a&gt; to build and test multi-bots, and clearing the contamination at the &lt;a href=\"Toxic%20Airfield\"&gt;Toxic Airfield&lt;/a&gt;.

Then, after learning that Crushcog's minions had taken over an old arsenal to the north of New Tinkertown, Mekkatorque sends the adventurers to destroy the weapons and tanks the leper gnomes were building. After they are sent to &lt;a href=\"Brewnall%20Village\"&gt;Brewnall Village&lt;/a&gt;, they join forces with a cadre of mountaineers from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurers are first sent to eliminate the network of sentry-bots on the island in the middle of the frozen &lt;a href=\"Iceflow%20Lake\"&gt;Iceflow Lake&lt;/a&gt;, and then, together with the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, they finally manage to take Crushcog down.\nWith Crushcog defeated, Thermaplugg can't afford to send any more of his followers to the surface, so the gnomes finally take control of Chill Breeze Valley. Due to their heroic deeds, the adventurers are recommended by &lt;a href=\"Jarvi%20Shadowstep\"&gt;Jarvi Shadowstep&lt;/a&gt;, of the &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Covert%20Ops\"&gt;Gnomeregan Covert Ops&lt;/a&gt;, to speak with &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tharran\"&gt;Captain Tharran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kharanos\"&gt;Kharanos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.

Their love of money, explosives, and technology makes them a very dangerous race, both to their enemies and themselves. Most goblins have a neutral standpoint, preferring to sell their contraptions, knowledge and services to other races for the right price.\nA number of &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s rule over the various goblin holdings around the world. In turn, each controls rings of trade, mining, deforestation, slave rings, and poaching. Trade Prince &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; of goblins who are part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nIn ancient times, the keeper &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; had discovered &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt; and, attempting to determinate its properties, he experimented on various races. He found that the ore was extremely potent and that it increased the intellect of his subjects. One of these subjects was a small primitive life race that roamed around the forests near &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. By consuming kaja'mite, they were transformed into a new, highly intelligent race known as the goblins. The goblins share a common ancestor with &lt;a href=\"Pygmy\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; with the help of goblin artificers led by &lt;a href=\"Meklo\"&gt;Meklo&lt;/a&gt;. The goblins also fashioned &lt;a href=\"Adamantine\"&gt;adamantium&lt;/a&gt; plates to hold Neltharion's body together when the Demon Soul's power began to overwhelm him, and the enslaved &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; placed those plates onto his body.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; happened thousands of years after the goblins' creation, they were cut from their supply of kaja'mite ore. In just a few short generations, most changes and boosts to their intelligence vanished. The goblins then took refuge on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Kezan\"&gt;Isle of Kezan&lt;/a&gt; and they had already forgotten the influence kaja'mite once had on their society.\nAfter the Sundering, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s that once ruled a large part of Azeroth started exploring numerous islands that dotted the newly formed sea. During one of these trips, they discovered Kezan and the goblin race, who were very primitive but still possessed some intellect. Initially the two races kept a distance as the Zandalari only came to the island in order to mine kaja'mite. They didn't really know too much about it, but they realized that is was very potent, so they saw it as a sacred component in their rituals and ceremonies. For many centuries the trolls mined and occasionally even paid goblins in trinkets in order to work for them, but this arrangement was soon to change. At some point the trolls, while digging, discovered that Kezan possessed an unimaginable deposit of kaja'mite underground, more than they would ever need. So rather than digging themselves, they enslaved the goblins and force them to drill in frightful conditions. For thousands of years the goblins, too weak to resist, suffered under the rule of the Zandalari.\nLiberation and Trade Wars.\nFinally, it was kaja'mite that led the goblins to their salvation. Over time, the goblin workers breathed in the dust of the ore that clouded the mines they worked in and eventually it started to awake the goblins' intelligence. Secretly they plotted to start a rebellion, gathering any materials they can find and hide in order to create a wide range of weapons, traps and explosives. One hundred years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the troll overseers were caught completely off guard, when goblin masses stormed out from the mines, armed with technology that the Zandalari couldn't even imagine at the time. The trolls' hold over Kezan was shattered completely, their mining operation failed and the surviving Zandalari fled. The goblins were now free and in order to celebrate their liberation they turned on each other, creating chaos as countless allegiances were formed. Soon enough they were split into various different groups, and the most powerful of these groups were known as &lt;a href=\"cartel\"&gt;cartel&lt;/a&gt;s. As the battles were getting completely out of hand and no one was actually winning, the cartels brokered a truce; however, the conflict would never really cease as the goblins would now turn to trade, battling in the economic arena. For the years to come the cartels were rivals, constantly outshining and outsmarting each other as they continued in their quest for wealth and power.\nWith their newfound intellect, goblins became renowned for producing a number of ingenious inventions. Eventually, kaja'mite supplies ran low and as the goblins' heightened intelligence vanished, their inventions became increasingly unreliable. As a result, the goblins turned to mercantilism as a source of income and transformed Kezan into a profitable trading hub.\nGreat Wars.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the goblins of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; had taken over a &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; settlement named &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Cove\"&gt;Blackwater Cove&lt;/a&gt; that had been abandoned by &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; after it was overrun by &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon claiming the town as their own, the goblins renamed it &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the war, the goblins witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival and the conquest of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;more conflicts&lt;/a&gt; in the horizon, they were determined to profit from it. &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Steamwheedle\"&gt;Trade Prince Steamwheedle&lt;/a&gt; allied his &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde and offered aid in form of new technologies, maps, and other useful information to the orcs for the right price. Orgrim treated his new allies as equals, and paid them gold from Stormwind's coffers. The Warchief also hired them to oversee the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20navy\"&gt;Horde's fleet&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the war and the Horde's defeat, the Steamwheedle Cartel and other goblins realized that it was much better to remain neutral due to thriving trades. Still, this made diplomacy difficult, as most of the nations of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were now wary of their loyalty, with &lt;a href=\"Krix%20Wiklish\"&gt;ambassador Wiklish&lt;/a&gt; not being seriously considered at the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;court&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nApproximately four years after the Second War, the goblin city of &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; had already been built in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, as it was visited by &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing also still had goblin servitors, just as he did during the War of the Ancients. The three known ones were &lt;a href=\"Kryll\"&gt;Kryll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nullyn\"&gt;Nullyn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Voyd\"&gt;Voyd&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe goblins of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; offered their services to the Alliance and Horde across the world. The &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, however, began hostile campaigns in various territories, prompting various conflicts with the two factions.\nSeveral goblins joined the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; stationed at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and its surroundings.\nA group of goblins called &lt;a href=\"Braintrust%20of%20Orbital%20Operations%20and%20Mechanics\"&gt;B.O.O.M.&lt;/a&gt; operate their money-making schemes in &lt;a href=\"Area%2052\"&gt;Area 52&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, several goblins were part of the &lt;a href=\"dreamform%20army\"&gt;dreamform army&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a diamond shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, several goblin representatives attended the ceremony in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel, having recently created an intelligence-boosting beverage called &lt;a href=\"Kaja%27Cola\"&gt;Kaja'Cola&lt;/a&gt;, were going about their daily lives. Suddenly the dragon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; appears over &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt; claiming that the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; will soon fall. Launching a molten projectile into Kezan's volcanic &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing departs as suddenly as he arrived. The goblins, not very concerned with the vague threats, continued with their party preparations but it soon became increasingly clear that Mount Kajaro was about to erupt. Being goblins, many naturally tried to cash in on the ensuing disaster. Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; requested a bazillion &lt;a href=\"Stack%20of%20Macaroons\"&gt;macaroon&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;CEO&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kajaro%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Kajaro Trading Company&lt;/a&gt; in order to save the civilians who came to him and lead them to safety, however, Gallywix was not true to his word and instead took the money only to make all of those civilians, and the CEO, slaves.\nGallywix and his new goblin slaves set sail for &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, but were spotted by Alliance ships attempting to capture the Horde Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. The goblin's ship is sunk and they become stranded on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors cobble together a small base on the shore and while scouting the island the discover an orcish journal mentioning a base camp established by the orc survivors. The goblins send a representative to ask for help from the orcs and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; agrees to assist the goblins in turn if they would assist the orcs. The human fleet too had made landfall on the smaller of the islands, but the combined orcs and goblins thwarted the Alliance agents and rescued Thrall.\nThe goblins later decided to go to the larger of the two isles and deployed a &lt;a href=\"Town-In-A-Box\"&gt;Town-In-A-Box&lt;/a&gt; so they could have a &lt;a href=\"Town-In-A-Box%20%28Lost%20Isles%29\"&gt;location&lt;/a&gt; to rest themselves, but were met with hostilities from local &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pygmy\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt;, but were able to fight them back. The goblins looked to slay the pygmy's turtle \"god\" &lt;a href=\"Volcanoth\"&gt;Volcanoth&lt;/a&gt;, but this makes the island's volcano violently erupt. The goblins, having incidentally caused the destruction of their Town-In-A-Box with the volcanic eruption, return to Thrall and the orcs just in time to help stave off the Alliance assault. Impressed with the goblins cunning and strength the orcs agreed to take the fight to &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, which had enslaved the majority of the members of the Bilgewater Cartel and put them to work mining resources. After disrupting Gallywix's operations, the free goblins overthrow Gallywix himself with the assistance of Thrall. Surrendering himself, Gallywix promises the Bilgewater Cartel will reform and become a part of the Horde. Thrall accepts, offering to send a representative to the Horde's new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Garrosh Hellscream and promises them a new home in Azshara and a place within the Horde.\nThe goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel now reside chiefly in Azshara, which they have massively altered. Goblins have also been seen assisting their allies in other areas such as &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. The goblins have made a home in Orgrimmar where &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt; runs the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Slums\"&gt;Goblin Slums&lt;/a&gt; an area of filth, pollution, and technology, just how the goblins like it. Notably, during the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;, they created a foul-smelling mist to halt the Alliance.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblins terraformed Azshara's coast to resemble the Horde symbol and established &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. In the mainland, they built the &lt;a href=\"Rocketway\"&gt;Rocketway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;Gallywix Pleasure Palace&lt;/a&gt; with a sculpted Jastor's giant head.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel assisted the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; and then on the invasion campaign of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Although they initially assisted Garrosh in excavating Pandaria, they ultimately joined the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh and the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;, however, hired the &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAlthough the Blackfuse Company was defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the remaining goblins joined the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; on the . The Steamwheedle Cartel sent &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Preservation%20Society\"&gt;an expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the alternate world. Units of the Bilgewater Cartel followed the Horde to the alternate Draenor as well. The goblins of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; also helped the Horde establish the &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, the Steamwheedle Cartel built two settlements: &lt;a href=\"Pinchwhistle%20Gearworks\"&gt;Pinchwhistle Gearworks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pinchwhistle%20Point\"&gt;Pinchwhistle Point&lt;/a&gt;. When Pinchwhistle Point is overwhelmed by invading fungus and its citizens zombified by fungal spores, the goblins of Pinchwhistle Gearworks ask for aid from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to save their brethren.\nLegion.\nThe Bilgewater Cartel defended &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt; and fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; while the Steamwheedle Cartel defended &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde goblins participated in the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, joining various &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt;s and battling on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Horde goblins are mining &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nBilgewater Cartel goblins are seen on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; is sent to &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt's implied that the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; in Ratchet supported the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;new war&lt;/a&gt; against the Alliance.\nThe Venture Company can be found in Stormsong Valley running an &lt;a href=\"Oil%20platform\"&gt;oil rig&lt;/a&gt;, they've come into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Tortollan%20Seekers\"&gt;Tortollan Seekers&lt;/a&gt;. The Company also attacked &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; and stole &lt;a href=\"%3AIronfoe\"&gt;:Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt;, earning the Dark Iron dwarves' and Alliance's ire. On Kezan, &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; started &lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;great dig sites&lt;/a&gt; in search of Azerite. The Company can show up on &lt;a href=\"island%20expedition\"&gt;island expedition&lt;/a&gt;s looking for Azerite. &lt;a href=\"Crapopolis\"&gt;Crapopolis&lt;/a&gt; is later seen as now belonging to the Bilgewater Cartel.\nNear the very end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas and Gallywix abandoned their people following the rebellion of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, leaving Thrall to promote Gazlowe as the successor to Gallywix as trade prince of the Bilgewater Cartel.\nAppearance.\nGoblins are slight and wiry, with female goblins on average standing at 4'1\" while males tend to be around 3'11\", to 4 feet in height. Some goblins do reach a \"tallish\" height of 4'6\". Female goblins are on average taller than males. They have three fingers and one thumb on one hand and four toes on one foot. Their noses grow larger as they age. Goblins' green skin can tan; &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt;'s pale yellow-green skin turned into a rich forest-emerald due to exposure to the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; sun. They apparently also have green blood. They have sharp teeth and small, pointed nails. Although small, they are extremely strong for their size.\nGoblins that have hair often have it as mohawks, ponytails, or spiky.\nCulture.\nShrewd, greedy, and ruthless, goblins have a long-standing reputation for being neutral in the rest of the world, despite the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; allying with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. Heroes of goblin society are not bastions of honor or integrity. Instead, goblins tend to admire the ruthless acquisition of profit, by any means necessary. Goblins are gifted engineers and accomplished seafarers, but are best known for their unabashed avarice.\nGoblins have their own currency named &lt;a href=\"macaroon\"&gt;macaroon&lt;/a&gt;s. They refer to money as \"moolah\". &lt;a href=\"Galleon%20%28coin%29\"&gt;Galleons&lt;/a&gt; were a beloved goblin currency until they were lost to time and newer forms of barter. Goblin &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s are usually open to haggling.\nThe goblin's capitalistic society is ruthless, but not lawless. Lawyers are known to exist and enforce the comprehensive contracts they make, lest they end up in costly lawsuits. Of course, goblins might try to weasel out of these contracts' rules anyway in order to make more money.\nGoblins seems to be into using drums as musical instruments.\nTechnology.\nThe many races of the Horde are far more primitive than those of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and thus are not nearly as technologically advanced. Most advances have taken place in the field of war machines and weaponry, and the Horde had to employ technological \"consultants\" - goblins - to create the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The permanent inclusion of goblins, with their emphasis on engineering and mechanical development, into the Horde has opened up tremendous technological potential. Today, the Horde is slowly realizing real gains through technology, both for military and domestic purposes.\nMilitary tactics and forces.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the daring goblins control the captured &lt;a href=\"Giant%20Turtle%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;giant turtles&lt;/a&gt; and were dedicated to destroying enemy ships by launching hazardous, steam-driven canisters containing highly volatile liquids that can shred even the strongest of armor.\nAmong their most used war and work inventions are &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpirituality.\nMagic.\n\"&lt;a href=\"The%20Old%20Wizard%27s%20Almanac\"&gt;The Old Wizard's Almanac&lt;/a&gt;\" claims that goblins lack the capacity to understand the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and tend to be distrustful of magic, preferring to focus on technological ventures instead. However, this is disproven by the existence of many goblin &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; across the world, including accomplished wizards like &lt;a href=\"Gazban\"&gt;Gazban&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"the%20Great%20Akazamzarak\"&gt;the Great Akazamzarak&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoblin &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s pragmatically treat &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy as a cheap, renewable, and reliable energy source, and they view the accompanying risk of losing one's soul to interdimensional horrors as a case of \"risk versus reward\".\nPriests.\nGoblin &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s use willpower to wield the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, driven by greed. They administer blessings at a price and often ask for gold donations in the form of tithes. The &lt;a href=\"Airborne%20Priest\"&gt;airborne priests&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Battalion\"&gt;Bilgewater Battalion&lt;/a&gt; serve a military role, acting as pilots, as battlefield medics who resurrect dead soldiers (for a fee), and performing blessings (and if necessary, exorcisms) on machinery. Blessed flareguns are used to signal members of the priesthood to airdrop in.\nShamanism.\nGoblin &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; follow the motto of \"Controlling the Elements for Fun and Profit\". They are an extension of their society's single-minded devotion to making profit; to a goblin shaman, &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s are potential customers with whom they can negotiate and enter contracts, as exemplified by the contract between &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Goldmine\"&gt;Initiate Goldmine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magmatooth\"&gt;Magmatooth&lt;/a&gt;. They tend to be a bit more forceful in their negotiations than the other shamanic races (especially the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;) would like, though not as forceful as the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;.\nGoblins have found ways to imbue their mechanical devices with the energy of elemental spirits. Instead of lugging around large totems, they have keyrings (probably the same rings on which they keep their house and motorbike keys) with small totems they've tinkered to serve as conduits for the elementals they do business with. Some goblin shaman mechanically modify both their totems and their elemental minions. To shaman of other races, these methods can seem unorthodox or outrageously disrespectful to the elements.\nDeath and burial.\nStatus is supreme in goblin society, which is reflected in their funeral practices; the higher the deceased's status, the larger and more extravagant the funeral. Tradition dictates that goblins be buried with their most valuable possessions so they can enjoy them at the &lt;a href=\"Everlasting%20Party\"&gt;Everlasting Party&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin afterlife. The reading of the list of assets that belonged to the deceased in life serves as the highlight of the event. All of this is performed in full view of the deceased's family and rivals in order to inspire feelings of jealousy. The only thing more important than being buried with one's possessions is the burial gifts bequeathed to the dead by other goblins, which serve as a reflection of wealth and social standing and consist of everything from coins, pearls, furniture, and clothing to weapons, food, and alcohol. In at least some cases, the goblin can draft a list of burial gifts they demand from the attendees. Wealthy funeralgoers bring their gifts in chests or butler-pushed wheelbarrows that they then empty into the coffin (which can consist of a simple metal container hammered into a funerary shape). After the gifting ends, the attendees dance on top of the coffin to usher the deceased on to the Everlasting Party before lowering it into a hole at a burial site. Prominent goblins serve as pallbearers at the head of the coffin, while goblins contractually obligated to serve as pack mules carry the rear. The burial is followed by partying and feasting; it's common knowledge that a goblin funeral is nothing more than an excuse to throw a party with someone else footing the bill. As was the case with &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Donais\"&gt;Trade Prince Donais&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin can pick out the musicians and refreshments that will be present at their funeral.\nGames.\nGoblins took part in the &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Drag%20Car\"&gt;Goblin Drag Car&lt;/a&gt; prior to the flooding of the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; in the Cataclysm, after the flooding goblins take part in boat races at the &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20and%20Pozzik%27s%20Speedbarge\"&gt;Fizzle and Pozzik's Speedbarge&lt;/a&gt; located on the new &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Deep\"&gt;Shimmering Deep&lt;/a&gt;. The goblins of Kezan played their own sport &lt;a href=\"footbomb\"&gt;footbomb&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kajaro%20Field\"&gt;Kajaro Field&lt;/a&gt; just prior to the Cataclysm.\nLanguages.\nGoblins speak &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelations.\nGoblins tolerate carrying armed passengers in their &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s, however, they don't transport cannons or heavy artillery in their zeppelins because that could compromise their neutrality.\nAlliance.\nGoblins don't like gnomes much, as they are the two races that are best at engineering. It is hard to say who is the best at engineering, the goblins or gnomes. Despite this, a rare marriage between a goblin and a gnome is known - &lt;a href=\"Grizzek%20Fizzwrench\"&gt;Grizzek Fizzwrench&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is at least one goblin affiliated with the Alliance and that is SI:7 agent &lt;a href=\"Renzik%20%22The%20Shiv%22\"&gt;Renzik \"The Shiv\"&lt;/a&gt;, Mathias Shaw's second in command.\nHorde.\nEven before the Cataclysm, there were many goblins still working with the Horde found in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;; even then, goblins working for the Horde run the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; system. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; some goblins joined the Warsong Offensive, some even displaying the Horde symbol on their tabard (&lt;a href=\"Chief%20Engineer%20Leveny\"&gt;Chief Engineer Leveny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Infra-green%20Engineer\"&gt;Horde Infra-green Engineer&lt;/a&gt;s) and fighting on the front lines (&lt;a href=\"Injured%20Warsong%20Engineer\"&gt;Injured Warsong Engineer&lt;/a&gt;s). During the final battle in the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, goblin members of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Rocketeer\"&gt;Kor'kron Rocketeer&lt;/a&gt;) were seen participating the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;gunship fight&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the goblins of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; joined the Horde after an encounter on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther organizations.\nOther goblins are found in even the darker factions of the world, such as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Very rarely are goblins truly loyal to their factions. Most goblins would likely trade sides for even the smallest boost in payment.\nIn the RPG.\nBackground.\nGoblins are small humanoids, crafty and shrewd, bearing an overwhelming interest in commerce and a strong curiosity about mechanical things. Goblin society is fragmented, defined chiefly by commerce and trade. The ultimate schemers and con artists, goblins are always in search of a better deal. Despite their seemingly chaotic natures, they exist in a fairly strict and straightforward &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20hierarchy\"&gt;hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;. Other races universally view goblins as inventors, merchants and, without exception, maniacs. Goblins value &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; as a useful aspect of commerce. Some say that their advantage \u2014 and their curse \u2014 is to be the primary users of technology in a world governed by magic. While &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s share a similar gift, goblin technology is more far-reaching and sinister and makes a larger impact on the natural world.\nFollowing their liberation on Kezan, goblins rapidly expanded their knowledge of technology. Goblins created Azeroth's first steam technologies. Rumors are that goblin technology back then was far more advanced than current dwarven technology. Goblins established themselves as master technicians, selling their goods on the open market. Desperate, goblins spread out into the world, attempting to find any pockets of kaja'mite they might have missed.\nThey employ vast teams of &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s who expand on current &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; and produce gadgets to suit a wide array of applications. They constantly build and repair machines and work on new ideas. Unfortunately, goblins alternate passionate genius with wandering focus. Their lack of discipline means that many creations end up half finished as something else catches their attention. Goblin workmanship has a partially deserved reputation for unreliability, and a goblin device may explode simply because its creator forgot to add a vital release valve. Goblins are envious of the Ironforge dwarves' invention of firearms, both from a commercial and a technological standpoint. Goblins recognize that firearms represent a new source of power, and he who controls the source controls the gold \u2014 which is, to goblins, the ultimate power. Fortunately for the rest of the world, goblin firearm experimentation suffers from the race's normal laxity \u2014 and improperly tended gunpowder experiments continue to end the careers of many aspiring goblin &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s. However, goblin ingenuity has paid off a few times; goblin gunpowder weapons tend to be inelegant and violently explosive (land mines, rockets and the like).\nA number of trade princes rule over Azeroth's various goblin holdings. Though the trade princes all live in the goblin island city of Undermine far from Kalimdor and the eastern continents, each controls his own private army and trade fleet. Each trade prince has his own specialty, monopolizing trade in a certain area, such as mining, deforestation, slavery or poaching. The trade princes are the most cunning of their race and stop at nothing to amass their fortunes and power, whether through legitimate means or via black markets and treachery. Goblins encountered on Kalimdor and the eastern continents are freelancers, privateers or agents of Undermine's trade princes. Goblins are tenacious fighters. They attack from range with crossbows or firearms (making individual modifications to dwarf-made weapons) and use maces, short swords or bizarre, home-brewed steam weaponry in melee. When attacked in their warrens, they fight with tools as well. Goblins have a good grasp of tactics and strategy, and are masters of siege warfare. Their love of large machines makes them ideal mercenaries for attacking fortifications.\nGoblins are shrewd in business, and clients who believe they walked away with the upper hand are almost always sorely mistaken. \"To cheat a goblin\" is a dwarven idiom meaning \"to do what is practically impossible.\" (\"Gamgi cheated a goblin when he escaped that cave-in!\") Goblins are also consummate tricksters and con artists. Their mission in the world is to create incredible new inventions, accrue the resulting wealth, and cause as much subtle mischief as possible along the way.\nOld friends, the goblins fought with the Horde in the First and Second Wars, but broke off when they realized that it's more profitable to work both sides. However, many goblins remember the fun of the Horde and are willing to lower mercenary prices to Thrall and his people. Goblins offer almost exclusive transport services for the Horde, whether in their steamboats or zeppelins. You're more likely to find a team of goblin sappers, who take great pleasure in the chaos the Horde creates, meshed into Horde forces than those of the Alliance. Perhaps with enough persuasion, the goblins could be convinced to rejoin the Horde for the first time since the Second War (although that could be just as harmful as helpful, knowing the goblins).\nThe Great Wars.\nUnfortunately, over the next few thousand years, up until roughly five hundred years before the First War, the goblins could find no further deposits of kaja'mite and goblin intelligence peaked. Without kaja'mite to strengthen their minds, goblins were unable to reproduce their brilliant technology or properly maintain it, and their works rapidly devolved into the crude jury rigged machines of today. The world began to fear the volatile machines, and sales dropped considerably. Goblins always had a love of money, however. With the loss of their intelligence and slow degradation of their technology, goblins embraced commerce. About two hundred years before the First War, the beginnings of &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Fleets\"&gt;Trade Fleets&lt;/a&gt; sailed out of Kezan and into the world. Goblins chose war as the perfect opportunity to cash in some gold, and began building their trade empire during the First War.\nBy the Second War, the goblins had established themselves as the traders of the world. Then, they became exclusive partners with the Horde.\nA Horde ambassador ventured forth and met with a single trade prince, asking for the goblins to provide machines and technology to the orcs, in exchange for spoils and gold. In the beginning, the arrangement seemed perfect. The goblin trade prince believed that the orcs would win the war, so he found it natural to join the winning side. As the profits flooded Undermine's coffers, the goblins expanded their slave markets. However, other goblins disagreed and remained neutral; thus, only this single trade prince and his subordinates joined the Horde. In the end, the trade prince realized his mistake and left the Horde, and the goblin race remembers the mistake and remains neutral to this day. A lot of the goblin race is . They discovered it was more profitable to play both sides against each other.\nTrade.\nThe goblins are also legendary for the sheer variety of trade in which they are willing to indulge and for their tenacity in bargaining. Goblins rarely let an item slip from their shelves for a single copper less than it is worth. The industrious goblins have established shacks and minor trading towns across much of Kalimdor in an impressively brief span of time. These outposts may vary in size and location, but all have a similarly impressive array of goods. The outposts get regular supply shipments (or as regular as possible, given the hazards of travel across Kalimdor), all coordinated by the goblin trade princes.\nThe trade princes are the most cunning of their race and will stop at nothing to amass their fortunes and power, whether through legitimate means or via black markets and treachery. Goblins encountered on Kalimdor or the Eastern Kingdoms are either privateers or agents of the various trade princes of Undermine.\nGoblins are not purely mercenary. They are known to form strong bonds with individuals of other races. Their small forms and odd behavior make other races \u2014 elves in particular \u2014 ill at ease, but goblins do not seem to care much for the impression they make. They judge by deeds, befriending those who treat them as friends and standing apart from those who would offer them abuse.\nGoblin shops.\nAt some point after the Second War, the goblins apparently grew tired of carrying explosives for the Horde and decided that they needed to take control of their own destinies. Surprisingly, they proved smart enough to know that building an army of their own would be an even bloodier choice for their race than sapping and planting mines. So they chose a different path.\nThe goblins have taken to the role of merchant with a vengeance, and now it's hard to travel for more than a day or two without stumbling across a goblin shop of some size. Goblin zeppelins fly across the continent, delivering goods, supplies, messages and passengers from one shop to another, and I've heard more than one goblin brag that if it isn't in his shop, he can have it on the shelves within a week. One joker challenged that claim and ordered a dozen shredders, only to find them waiting outside his cottage two days later.\nGoblin shops can be found nearly anywhere on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, seemingly regardless of whether or not there are towns nearby and heedless of dangers such as the Scourge. The goblins will sell anything to anyone, at only slightly inflated prices.\nApparently, the proprietor of each goblin shop determines how to protect his business from theft. Some of the solutions employed include the hiring of &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; fighters as security guards; complicated, tinker-built security systems; and, most notoriously, enormous bombs on a dead man's switch that can be detonated on a moment's notice if a goblin merchant feels threatened. After news spread of thieves and bullies entering shops that were replaced moments later by smoking craters, few have found the nerve to probe how a given shop might be protected.\nThough many shops remain &lt;a href=\"Independent\"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;, a growing number of them have signs declaring that they are owned and operated by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, which the proprietors claim is headquartered in a faraway city ruled by goblins where the streets are paved with gold.\nGoblin Forces.\nGoblin forces are terrifying to behold. The Trade Fleets are outfitted with the most fanatical and destructive creatures on Azeroth. The average person wonders why the trade princes require such powerful armies, if they are holding to their neutrality stance. It certainly seems excessive.\nThe simple truth is, the forces are not excessive. The life of those living on the South Seas is harsh, due to attacks from everything from pirates to rogue magical beasts. Conflict exists everywhere, and a trade prince is always in peril of death. Every day, a trade prince must test his food on three different people. There is only one way to become a trade prince, and that's to take out the competition. Thus, to prevent rivals from taking their thrones and to ensure that business may be conducted as normal, each trade prince enlists a hefty force of warriors. It's absolutely necessary to keep order in the goblin world.\nThe Trade Fleets also require extreme guards. Undermine's goods sail everywhere, especially into hostile or desolate territories to make a coin. Simply put, goblins go to dangerous places. Without strong guards, there would be no trade, because there would be only dead traders.\nDespite appearances, goblins maintain rigid procedures and formations for battle. They only look disorganized. Goblins are intelligent, and they use their brains in battle. Confuse the enemy, and the enemy leaves blind spots. Slip in between the cracks and break the forces open from the inside. Many battles during the Second War were lost when Alliance forces underestimated goblin tactics.\nNot surprisingly, all goblin forces use a wide and dizzying array of technological weaponry. From the simplest firearms to the largest steam-driven war instruments, goblin technology dominates war fields. Even magic has a difficult time creating as much destruction and havoc as goblin war machines. \nWhen goblins fought in the Second War, they created three units especially for the war effort. Goblin zeppelins rode high above the terrain to scout out the area, and occasionally transported warriors. Goblins also lent their services as sappers, using explosives to take out enemy fortifications. Often the goblins went with the explosives, but this was of little consequence. Sappers were a copper a dozen.\nFurthermore, during the war, goblins fought from all angles, especially the sea. The &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; captured &lt;a href=\"Giant%20turtle%23As%20submarines\"&gt;giant sea turtles&lt;/a&gt; native to the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;southern seas&lt;/a&gt;. Pacified by potent spells of control, these lumbering monstrosities were fitted with watertight canopies strapped onto the backs of their shells and were used as submersible orcish craft. By submerging under the waves, the giant turtles could steal upon unsuspecting enemy craft and report their position to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fleet as they were visible solely to &lt;a href=\"tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;s, creatures of the air, and other submersible vessels. The daring goblins who controlled them were dedicated to destroying enemy ships by launching hazardous, steam-driven canisters containing highly volatile liquids that shredded even the strongest armor.\nDuring the Third War, goblins also fielded shredders to anyone who paid well enough. The pilots cared little about the actual war, preferring to chop down forests for their pay. However, when push came to shove, goblin shredders proved lethal in battle. The pilot's inexperience with battle was evened out by the shredder's armor and powerful steam saw, which cut down enemies as easily as trees. Goblins hired themselves to anyone with the gold, and alongside shredders, the goblins fielded sappers and zeppelins once again in battle. Even tinkers and alchemists joined the fight, granting explosive and chemical warfare to the highest bidder.\nRelations.\nGoblins are a wily, cunning race of traders and &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s whom adventurers typically encounter as parts of trading envoys or on pirate raids. Goblin ships frequent the seas, ferrying or seeking riches, slaves or exotic wares. Kalimdor's main goblin port is the party town of Ratchet, a harbor city located on the eastern shore of the Barrens directly between Durotar and Theramore. Goblin trade outposts are found everywhere, including all major cities and such inhospitable realms as Northrend and Stranglethorn Vale. Their zeppelins run a wealthy business ferrying passengers across kingdoms and continents. \nGoblins are neutral and take pains to make sure their nearby customers play nice with each other. Goblin guards patrol Ratchet and a few of the other goblin settlements, keeping tabs on the various Horde and Alliance visitors. Despite these enforcers however, the goblins' neutral settlements can still be dangerous places, as members of either faction will often still attack each other in the belief that they can evade the guards. With the exception of Ratchet, their settlements generally have a consistent appearance and construction.\nTraveling goblin merchants employ bodyguards to protect them and their wares. Goblins are independent. Goblins hired themselves out to the Horde in the Second War, but now they belong only to themselves and whoever pays them. Constantly building and inventing requires massive resources, both for creating the machines themselves and maintaining those that actually work. Cannibalizing old machines only partially sustains this fervent activity of creation, so goblins rely on trade with as many races and cultures as possible. They are the quintessential merchants, peddling all manner of exotic goods for the highest possible prices.\nGoblin mechanical and mercantile pursuits are not always (or even often) performed within the bounds of polite society. Though not evil, goblins are willing to embark on shady business ventures - slavery, deforestation, poaching, smuggling and oil drilling, for example - to accomplish their goals. They are opportunists to the core and revel in bartering the better deal at every turn. Goblins try to get along with all other races. Doing so is part of their business. Nevertheless, everyone views goblins with justified suspicion. Night elves in particular dislike the goblins because the little creatures have no respect for nature or natural resources.\nGoblins are a capitalistic bunch and most buy or sell anything to make a profit. Goblin merchants love to haggle, have excellent wares and are too smart to be cheated - or so they claim. Most big cities have at least one stationary goblin merchant shop, managed by a goblin family. The heads of the family run the shop while the younger goblins travel the land to find, buy or steal the inventory. They sell to anyone: &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Independent\"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt;. Some even deal with demons if the price is right. Some goblins drive their carts from town to town, buying and selling as they go. These carts look rickety and secondhand, but the appearance is likely a diversion. A goblin's cart is usually in perfect driving condition; the goblin never knows when he may have to leave town quickly or outrun an enraged customer. These merchants are often less than reputable and more likely to have items that they cannot identify themselves. Goblin merchant houses are not necessarily places to avoid, however. Often a hero can discover hard-to-find items, even rare or magic items, within the walls. As long as the hero is able to spot a bad deal, it should be safe for him to enter.\nThe goblins are an unbending bunch, refusing any sort of barter and demanding to be paid only in gold. There is a saying around Ratchet: If a traveling goblin merchant were starving to death and someone offered to trade food for the goblin's merchandise, he'd starve before he accepted anything but gold. A customer who enters a goblin shop intending to barter finds himself laughed out into the street. The goblins do not even allow their employees to receive discounts or work for merchandise. Goblins deal only in gold. The merchants accept gold in any form and have precise scales to aid their customers. Goblins accept recently mined nuggets, panned dust or defaced Alliance gold coins that would be refused in other areas. They are grumpier about accepting silver, but do so.\nAlliance and Horde.\nThe goblins care little for the Alliance and Horde conflicts; what concerns them, as usual, is the effect these events have on their cash flow. The goblins do not, as a rule, like the Scourge, as the undead threatened to wipe out the entire populations of the Alliance and Horde, leaving the goblins with no customers. War is profitable for the goblins; annihilation is not. Once they served as suicide mercenaries for the Horde; now the goblins have made their place as the strongest merchant race in the world. If one wants to purchase something, whether it is supplies, equipment, weapons, magic items or even slaves, the goblins either have it or know where to get it. All that matters in their eyes is the price.\nThe goblins like a balance of power. Military conflicts make money for the goblins as the combatants purchase supplies, and if the two sides are evenly matched, conflicts could go on for generations. This promises fat purse bags for the goblins for years to come. The goblins helped out the Horde for years because of this, but now they feel the Horde has come to match the Alliance in power, and they rest in the neutral middle, satisfied to play mercenary and merchant to either side.\nThe goblins understand the Alliance better than they understand the neutral races, as they have a long history of dealings with the Alliance. As merchants, they are frequently found in Theramore, and as mercenaries, they may even be found among the Alliance armies. True business entrepreneurs, goblins understand their customers very well and almost always know what they want. Their favorite Alliance customers are the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, who jump at the chance to buy magical items. Although many in the Alliance consider the goblin mercenaries to be war profiteers, they are not above using them. If they have no &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s, or their tinkers have died in a previous battle, they sometimes have to go to the goblins for repairs or supplies. And the goblins are always ready to help a customer, for the right price. The goblins' skills certainly don't stop at trade. Although not as talented at the invention of firearms as the Ironforge dwarves, the goblins have refined their inventing talents to create a handful of very useful tools that are, of course, for sale. Since the latest conflicts, the goblins have modified their marketing tactics to focus on pushing their deforestation operations to the night elves, of all races, to help clear out the cursed Felwood Forest. They also sell their zeppelins to the night elves, so that these customers can spot and put an end to deforestation. They made a great deal of money selling items to help the Alliance fight Illidan and his army of blood elves and naga, and constantly remind the Alliance members who travel through Ratchet that Illidan is still out there and supplies are always needed. Some merchants are able to mask the tone of glee in their voices while saying this, but most don't bother.\nThe Horde and the goblins get along fairly well, as the orcs remember the (well-paid) sacrifice of the goblins for their cause in earlier wars. They still purchase zeppelins and other goblin services. The goblins often enjoy the company of the orcs, and the war veterans from both races will get together and drink if offered the opportunity. Old friends, the goblins fought with the Horde in the Second War, but broke off when they realized that it's more profitable to work both sides. However, many goblins remember the fun of the Horde and are willing to lower mercenary prices to Thrall and his people. Goblins offer almost exclusive transport services for the Horde, whether in their steamboats or zeppelins. You're more likely to find a team of goblin sappers, who take great pleasure in the chaos the Horde creates, meshed into Horde forces than those of the Alliance. Perhaps with enough persuasion, the goblins could be convinced to rejoin the Horde for the first time since the Second War (although that could be just as harmful as helpful, knowing the goblins).\nPerhaps the only remaining goblin scruple is that they will not betray a customer. While they understand each side of the war very well, if the Alliance is paying them for services, merchant or mercenaries, they will not act as double agents for the Horde. This is as close to honor as the goblins usually get.\nTechnology.\nThough once nothing but fodder for more &lt;a href=\"taproom\"&gt;taproom&lt;/a&gt; banter, goblin inventions have shown their worth in recent years. They're particularly fond of &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;tinkering with mechanical things&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, and explosives. Their love of mechanics often places them into direct competition with &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s who enjoy similar devices. The \"competition\" between goblins and gnomes seems to be friendly, an example of this is in the shimmering flats where the two races are constantly competing (by racing) with one another. Whether clockwork \"&lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s\" that allow a single goblin to do as much harvesting as 10 field hands or zeppelin-like \"airships\" that can ferry troops over otherwise impassable terrain, the goblins' inventions have become legendary. Such technological ingenuity is as central to the goblins' rise among the races as any trading prowess.\nEven with the malfunctions and explosions that occur (not as frequent as tavern chatter suggests, but far from rare), goblin &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; is proving to be of a quality that rivals the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and their firearms. If they possessed physical strength and mystic power to match their inventiveness and cunning, they would be a force of some significance. Of course, the goblins claim that they are already \u2014 if not for their frail physical forms, goblins would rule the world. Then they laugh and say they prefer a challenge and offer to buy the taproom guests the next round.\nAppearances.\nThey weigh between 30 and 50 pounds. They have long, sharp noses, chins and ears, and green skin. Their arms are long and slender and their four fingers are deft. They tend to wear leather clothing, often cut into aprons to protect against caustic fluids. Goggles usually cover their eyes, and various &lt;a href=\"technological\"&gt;technological&lt;/a&gt; devices are strapped across their bodies.\nFaith.\nGoblins place their faith in themselves and in gold. They raise eyebrows at insubstantial concepts such as shamanism and the Holy Light, preferring gods they can see, weigh, and spend.\nLanguage.\nGoblins know myriad languages in order to trade with as many races as possible.\nDevelopment.\n' was originally planned to have six playable races. While the fifth race was planned to be the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, \"deciding on a sixth race was like a game of roulette, with the development ball stopping on various ideas\", one of which were the goblins, who had been first introduced in '. Early plans for a fleshed-out goblin race played up their kamikaze mentality with designs such as a catapult that flung units across the map. However, as six and even five races proved too difficult for Blizzard to balance, the amount of playable races was eventually scaled down to four; the goblins and Legion remained in the game, but not as fully playable factions.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, goblins were also initially planned to be a playable race in classic \"World of Warcraft\", which was developed at the same time as \"Warcraft III\". &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; stated that Blizzard went back and forth on whether or not to make goblins or gnomes the fourth playable Alliance race. The developers all thought it would be very cool to play from the goblins' perspective, but since they were already widespread as neutral NPCs that got along well with both Alliance and Horde, it would be tough to fit them into a two-faction system, and so gnomes became a better fit.\n&lt;a href=\"Johnathan%20Staats\"&gt;Johnathan Staats&lt;/a&gt; also explained that the goblins proved \"too intensive\". Blizzard wanted to implement the goblin capital of &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;, but due to a lack of goblin art assets, doing so would have required \"a ton\" of work, causing the playable goblins to be cut from classic WoW. He also stated that before they were cut, Blizzard considered the idea of making the goblins a neutral race that was neither Horde nor Alliance.\nYears later, goblins were eventually implemented as &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28playable%29\"&gt;a playable race&lt;/a&gt; in the ' expansion. During the development of \"Cataclysm\", there were talks about goblins being available to both factions, with players picking a faction. In the end the goblins added more to the Horde than they would have added to the Alliance since the Alliance's pint-sized comic relief spot was already ably filled by gnomes. The concept of a neutral race would later be realized in \"\" in the form of &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;playable pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Goblins are notoriously neutral, usually found selling arms and supplies to anybody who can pay, and caring little for faction lines. However, the Bilgewaters became members of the Horde after being shipwrecked alongside them by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of which they fought together.\nBeginning on their island of &lt;a href=\"Kezan%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; (levels 1-5), &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction of their home forces them to flee by boat. The Alliance intercepts and attacks the goblins, stranding them on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt; (levels 5-12). After this adventurous introduction to the Horde, the Cartel settled down in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, where they built a new capital, &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"trike\"&gt;trike&lt;/a&gt; is what Bilgewaters ride as a mount. The goblin's racial language is &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;named after themselves&lt;/a&gt;, and they also speak &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nOpening cutscene.\n\"The wise and cunning goblins of Kezan have lived in relative peace for generations. Though some of their race sided with the marauding orcs during the Second War, most goblins remained neutral throughout the various conflicts of the Alliance and Horde. Ruled over by corrupt yet highly affluent Trade Princes, the goblins created a virtual paradise for themselves throughout the islands of the South Seas. Their fantastic feats of engineering and vast trade fleets helped make their island capital of Kezan one of the great technological wonders of the world. And now, as the elements themselves rise up in anger across the world, the goblins' mechanical paradise will be put to the test. For, very soon, fate will force them to choose sides in a conflict that will shape the very history of the world.\"\nHistory.\nOriginally the slaves of jungle trolls on the Isle of Kezan, the goblin race was forced to mine &lt;a href=\"kaja%27mite\"&gt;kaja'mite&lt;/a&gt; ore out of the volcanic bowels of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s used this potent mineral for their voodoo rituals, but it had an unexpected effect on the slaves who were in constant contact with it: kaja'mite generated a startling new cunning and intelligence in the goblins. Crafting their own powerful artifacts of engineering and alchemy in secret, the goblins soon overthrew their oppressors and claimed Kezan for their homeland. The mines that had been their prison, their slave camp, and the base of their rebellion now became the city of &lt;a href=\"Undermine\"&gt;Undermine&lt;/a&gt;. Weaving through the heart of the island in a dizzying network of tunnels, vaults, and lava tubes, Undermine epitomizes the goblins' complex, unpredictable mindset.\nThe goblins' natural greed soon lifted them to prominence as masters of mercantilism. &lt;a href=\"Trade%20prince\"&gt;Trade prince&lt;/a&gt;s arose during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; as the cleverest goblins learned to take advantage of the strife. Great fortunes were amassed, and the Isle of Kezan became a hub for fleets of goblin trading ships. One of the trade princes agreed to lend his faction's services to the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Horde's defeat, the goblins learned from their colleague's failed example, and soon they realized that their profits could double if they weren't stuck in such a restrictive relationship. By the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, goblins were providing weaponry, vehicles, and devious services to both the Horde and the Alliance.\nGallywix's takeover.\nMany years later, &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; rose through the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. Gallywix became the president of what became known as the &lt;a href=\"Copper%20Street%20Conglomerate\"&gt;Copper Street Conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;, an advisor to the &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Union\"&gt;Tinkers' Union&lt;/a&gt;, a major figure in the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;, and the second wealthiest goblin in the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; - second only to &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Maldy\"&gt;Trade Prince Maldy&lt;/a&gt; himself. With the aid of the moguls of the Bilgewater and from &lt;a href=\"Tek%27zik%20Riddlevox\"&gt;Tek'zik Riddlevox&lt;/a&gt;, Director of the Tinkers' Union, all of whom believed that Maldy had gone soft (he was known to dote over his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Nessa%20Maldy\"&gt;Nessa&lt;/a&gt;, with whom Gallywix had fallen in love with on first sight), Gallywix initiated a hostile takeover of the Bilgewater Cartel. He bought the loyalty of Maldy's staff, and replaced his security with his own mercenaries; he even owned the land on which Maldy's manor (the site of &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%27s%20Villa\"&gt;his own villa&lt;/a&gt; many years later) was situated. Though Maldy hoped to re-buy his possessions with the money he gained from trading weapons to the Alliance, Gallywix eliminated that possibility by destroying Maldy's trade fleet. Now in total control, Gallywix exiled Maldy and his daughter from Kezan, and later arranged his (supposedly accidental) death.\nJoining the Horde.\n&lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt;, one of the primary cities and home of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, continued to mine kaja'mite ore mainly for the production of &lt;a href=\"Kaja%27Cola\"&gt;Kaja'Cola&lt;/a&gt;, a beverage that gives goblins short bursts of ideas, but the kaja'mite supply continued to dwindle. Unfortunately for the goblins of Kezan, their time on the island was limited - &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;a volcano&lt;/a&gt; long dormant on the island, suddenly erupted and the goblins found themselves with nowhere to go. Despite the name of the city, there was only one real port to be found, and &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; - leader of the Bilgewater Cartel - owned it. Gallywix offered to let the survivors of the volcanic eruption ride his yacht to safety, for a price of course. Frantic goblins threw their entire life savings at Gallywix as the volcano rumbled and threatened to blow the island up for good, and as Gallywix sailed away, he revealed his real plan. Owning everyone's life savings was a good start, but now he had them at his mercy on his yacht he may as well sell them in to slavery as a bonus. If the yacht had made it safely to a port, this may very well have been the case.\nHowever, fate conspired against Gallywix's plans. The yacht managed to sail right into the middle of a naval battle between an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fleet and one &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ship. The Alliance ships spotted the goblin vessel, and the captain of the fleet ordered the ship destroyed, despite the fact that it was a neutral vessel. Gallywix's ship was destroyed, and the goblin slaves washed up on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;a nearby island&lt;/a&gt;. In exploring the small island, these goblins encountered a few orc survivors who were obviously enemies of the Alliance that had attacked the goblin ship. Figuring that the enemy of an enemy could actually be an ally (an ally with possibly deep pockets), the goblins assisted the few orc survivors, and discovered why an entire Alliance fleet was after the single Horde ship - the ship was carrying &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, former &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Warchief of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallywix wasn't done with his plans just yet. He began capturing the surviving goblins and using them as slaves. In a final confrontation, the freed goblins and their new orc allies fought against Gallywix and won with Thrall's help. Gallywix begged for mercy, promising the former Warchief that he would change his ways and reform the way the Bilgewater Cartel was run. After thinking for a moment, Thrall decided to keep the Trade Prince as the leader of the Cartel and asked them to join the Horde.\nFor now the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel are happily working alongside the Horde and have transformed &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; so that the land now resembles a giant Horde symbol - partially out of gratitude, partially out of greed. After all, the Horde is expanding its borders in a major way, and that kind of expansion means a lot of gold to be made for the industrious and unscrupulous. In the meantime, they're constantly seeking a substitute for their beloved kaja'mite, though their efforts remain futile at the moment.\nCharacter.\nThe player starts as an up-and-coming business goblin in the flourishing and busy city of &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Port\"&gt;Bilgewater Port&lt;/a&gt;. The player does several jobs to make gold and build their reputation, when suddenly &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; shows up and destabilises the island's volcano as part of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. The player escapes with the last ship of refugees after paying their life savings to Gallywix, and subsequently being forced to be his slave. The Bligewater Cartel then encounters an ongoing battle between the Alliance and the Horde, and the ship is attacked by the Alliance, not wanting any witnesses to the battle. The player manages to survive and plays a major role leading the survivors on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;, rescuing &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance and earning the gratitude of the Horde. After a battle with the local savages' \"god\" in the island's volcano, that volcano also erupts and forces the goblins to evacuate. Thrall takes the Bilgewater Cartel into the Horde and offers them a new home in Azshara. At this point the player is level 10 and can choose to continue their adventures in Azshara or branch out to other areas.\nMounts.\nWith the Bilgewater goblins now in the trenches with the bigger brutes of the Horde, a significant number of trampling deaths have been reported. Normally unconcerned with such matters, Trade Prince Gallywix was alarmed to learn that &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; accountants refused to pay soldier death benefits if the soldiers never got to the actual battle, and accidental stomps caused by tauren maneuvers made it extremely difficult to calculate how many goblins had made it to the battlefield before they were rendered flat. Gallywix offered a substantial cash reward for an invention that could both lift goblins out of hoof traffic and speed them along at comparable velocities so that goblin soldiers could die in \u201ca calculate-able and reimbursable fashion.\u201d Hundreds of submissions were made. Most exploded upon delivery. In the end, the clear (and relatively undamaged) winner was the sturdy transport trike created by the remarkably aged &lt;a href=\"Jibidiah%20Gragglefutz\"&gt;Jibidiah Gragglefutz&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The bomb dispenser was invented with these safety-first goblins in mind. The device consists of a multi-chambered miniature assembly plant stored within a large backpack. The bottom of this pack contains a hatch that can be opened and closed by pulling on control handles attached to the shoulder straps. Inside the container, all the parts for a self-actuating bomb wait for assembly, each kept separate from the others so that accidents never happen. Almost. Sometimes the deployed bomb explodes prior to moving.\nTo use the bomb dispenser, the wearer tugs on a control bar attached to the straps on his shoulder, automated equipment inside the bag gathers up the separated parts and assembles them into a small, mobile bomb. A beep warns the wearer that the bomb is now ready. He can then deploy it by pulling on a different strap, opening the trap door. If too much time passes without deployment, the bag\u2019s safety measures take the bomb back apart. When the user releases the bomb, it drops to the ground between the user\u2019s legs and charges on spindly legs directly towards the target ahead of the user\u2019s present facing. The bomb doesn\u2019t discriminate friend from foe, but charges straight ahead."}

This diversity can give Goblin Engineers the element of surprise and situational advantages when facing enemies.\nBecoming a Goblin Engineer.\nMuch like with &lt;a href=\"Gnome%20Engineering\"&gt;Gnome Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, this is a three step process.\nThe referral.\nYou first have to get a referral from an engineering trainer. There are a number of people who will give you a referral. Remember, you do have to have 200 skill, and be at least level 30 to be eligible.\nThe pledge.\nThe person you are sent to is &lt;a href=\"Nixx%20Sprocketspring\"&gt;Nixx Sprocketspring&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. He will hand you an unsigned pledge, and ask that you sign and return it. This seals your commitment to Goblin Engineering.\nShowing your work.\nNixx will then ask you to show examples of your work. You will be handing over:\n Raw mats:\n 2x &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Bar\"&gt;Silver Bar&lt;/a&gt;\n 30x &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Bar\"&gt;Iron Bar&lt;/a&gt;\n 40x &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Stone\"&gt;Heavy Stone&lt;/a&gt;\n 20x &lt;a href=\"Solid%20Stone\"&gt;Solid Stone&lt;/a&gt;\n 10x &lt;a href=\"Silk%20Cloth\"&gt;Silk Cloth&lt;/a&gt;\n 20x &lt;a href=\"Wool%20Cloth\"&gt;Wool Cloth&lt;/a&gt;\n 20x &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Bar\"&gt;Bronze Bar&lt;/a&gt;\n 5x &lt;a href=\"Medium%20Leather\"&gt;Medium Leather&lt;/a&gt;\nHaving done that, you are issued your &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Engineer%20Membership%20Card\"&gt;Goblin Engineer Membership Card&lt;/a&gt;, which entitles you to training on the 'goblin engineer only' engineering recipes. Congratulations! You have specialized in Goblin Engineering!\nYour membership card.\nPrior to the release of WotLK, having completed the exercises above, you were given a &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Engineer%20Membership%20Card\"&gt;Goblin Engineer Membership Card&lt;/a&gt;. It remained valid for 14 days of 'played time', not 14 real days.\nIf you ever found yourself without this card, you could pay 2 gold in dues to the &lt;a href=\"Engineering%20Trainer\"&gt;Goblin Engineering trainer&lt;/a&gt; (still &lt;a href=\"Nixx%20Sprocketspring\"&gt;Nixx Sprocketspring&lt;/a&gt;) and get a new one. Since the release of WoTL, Goblin Engineering is added to your book as a skill.\nAn added benefit of renewing your membership prior to patch 3.2.2 was that you would be sent a renewal gift of some useful engineering schematic. formerly could only be acquired this way. However, this item now drops in Gnomeregan.\nSwitching specializations.\nTo switch between Goblin Engineering and &lt;a href=\"Gnome%20Engineering\"&gt;Gnome Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, bring up the \u201cProfessions\u201d tab in the \u201cSpellbook &amp; Abilities\u201d interface. Within the \u201cEngineering\u201d section, on the top-right side, there will be a button for your current specialization. Immediatedlty to the left of that button will be a small red circular icon. You can click that icon to remove your current specialization. Important: Do not click the similar icon that is to the left of the green skill bar since that would completely remove your Engineering skill (and not just the specialization).\nOnce you have removed your specialization, the &lt;a href=\"Engineering%20trainers\"&gt;Engineering trainers&lt;/a&gt; in your faction\u2019s home city should offer you the choice of specializations quests: &lt;a href=\"Gnome%20Engineering%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Gnome Engineering (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Engineering%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Goblin Engineering (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt; until \"\", Gnomish Engineers and Goblin Engineers could switch profession specializations for by visiting &lt;a href=\"Narain%20Soothfancy\"&gt;Narain Soothfancy&lt;/a&gt;'s hut in northeast &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; and interacting with the book on the table.\nQuotes.\n\"It might not work ALL the time, but what kind of goblin engineer are you! If survival was your first priority you could never be a real Goblin Engineer!\" \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Zap%20Farflinger\"&gt;Zap Farflinger&lt;/a&gt;\nFrom the &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Engineering%20Disciplines\"&gt;Manual of Engineering Disciplines&lt;/a&gt;:\n\"You want to know about goblin engineering?

THAT'S goblin engineering.\" \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Ringo%20Tragediction\"&gt;Ringo Tragediction&lt;/a&gt;, gnome &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;\n\"Say what you want about us goblins, but I will tell you this: WE HAVE EXPLOSIVES!\" \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Yazz%20Nitrospork\"&gt;Yazz Nitrospork&lt;/a&gt;, goblin &lt;a href=\"bombardier\"&gt;bombardier&lt;/a&gt;"}

The underside of each sole contains two small jets, and when activated the device jets emit powerful blasts of fire, propelling an individual forward and increasing his running speed. Goblin rocket boots require an experimental substance called goblin rocket fuel. The boots have been known to malfunction and explode injuring the wearer and creatures around him.\nAnnoyed by the goblins' success with their powerful rocket boots, the gnomes set out to build a better, more stable version. They succeeded, although the high cost often drives most buyers to the goblin variety instead.\nNotes.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"patch%202.3.2\"&gt;patch 2.3.2&lt;/a&gt; the boots were hotfixed to require an &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; skill of 225 to use, though it does not appear in the patch notes. The boots do indeed explode, and on average, after only two or three goes. The explosion does no actual damage, but does knock you down, and leaves you with ruined boots, although some components can be recovered from the wreckage.\nIn general, a cost prohibitive way to escape from trouble, and the &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Rocket%20Boots\"&gt;Gnomish Rocket Boots&lt;/a&gt; are generally considered a better choice as despite being slightly slower and requiring Engineering skill to wear, they don't get destroyed when they malfunction.\nHowever, there are theories that the Goblin boot explosion can be avoided if the speed effect is cancelled before the 20 second span is reached in full. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/%3Fi%3D14648\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nStill... a plan without Rocket Boots, is no plan at all...\nMalfunction Effects: \nTransforms &lt;a href=\"Black%20Mageweave%20Boots\"&gt;Black Mageweave Boots&lt;/a&gt; (41 &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;, +7 &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt; and +11 &lt;a href=\"Spirit\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;) into Goblin Rocket Boots (41 &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Use\"&gt;Use&lt;/a&gt; effect) which function identically to &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Rocket%20Boots\"&gt;Gnomish Rocket Boots&lt;/a&gt;.

However, he serves as a resource gatherer and does poorly in melee combat.\nThe Goblin Shredder is the most efficient wood gatherer in-game. Every swing of his saw gathers 10 wood at a time, meaning that he cuts a healthy tree down in 5 swings. Unlike the workers of each rate who are limited in gathering wood (5 for &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wisps&lt;/a&gt;, 10 for &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peons&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peasants&lt;/a&gt; and 20 for &lt;a href=\"Ghoul%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ghouls&lt;/a&gt;), the Goblin Shredder harvests 200 wood at a time, and moves as fast as a Ghoul without Ghoul Frenzy.\nKeep him well protected in your base as he gathers wood. Many players tend to replace their lumber gatherers with shredders because of their usefulness; non-Undead players can devote workers to harvesting gold, while Undead players can remove their Ghouls and free up food space for other units. Generally, one shredder will do the job in keeping the player's lumber stockpiles high, though a second shredder will certainly speed up operations."}

The only thing left to do is to speak to Revilgaz himself.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Sponsorship%20%284%29\"&gt;Goblin Sponsorship (4)&lt;/a&gt;\nRevilgaz, it turns out, never had the fuel regulator in the first place. He had sent word to the goblins because he thought he could steal the blueprints for a new design of the part from the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, who has a base of operations in northern &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. But the venture company resistance was stronger than he expected. It seems the only way to get that part is to steal the blueprints yourself, and Revilgaz offers you a hefty bag of silver to do just that.\nHeading up to the lake the baron mentioned, you manage to defeat the gnome who is in charge of the place and steal his keys, then return to his house and pilfer the blueprints from his lockbox. At last, with the blueprints in hand, you return to Revilgaz and receive payment.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Sponsorship%20%285%29\"&gt;Goblin Sponsorship (5)&lt;/a&gt;\nAll that is left to do is return to Pozzik a the racetrack and deliver the blueprints. At first he seems disappointed that the fuel regulator was not already assembled, but as he mumbles to himself he begins to get more and more excited, as new tweaks and modifications to the design come to him. Thanking you, he wanders off to begin his work.\nRazzeric the Pilot.\nRocket car pilots are not known for growing to a ripe old age... in fact, they are better known for exploding in giant fireballs. Razzeric is no exception - he plans to go as fast as possible, no holds barred, no safety precautions taken. But to do it, he is going to need help.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Eighteenth%20Pilot\"&gt;The Eighteenth Pilot&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter receiving the fuel regulator blueprints, Pozzik sends you to speak with his pilot, Razzeric. \n&lt;a href=\"Razzeric%27s%20Tweaking\"&gt;Razzeric's Tweaking&lt;/a&gt;\nRazzeric has another job for you: he's gone and ordered his own special part, one Pozzik doesn't know about. You gather from his description that it is some sort of turbo booster. But the zeppelin carrying the part crashed in Dustwallow Marsh and, you guessed it, he needs you to go get it. Yet again you are promised good compensation, and so off you go.\nThe marsh is full of nasty, powerful creatures; crocolisks and spiders and other such beasties. Finally, after slogging through who knows how much slime and goo, you at last discover the crashed zeppelin site. Once there, the booster isn't hard to find. The part in hand, you book it out of the swamp as fast as your legs can carry you.\n&lt;a href=\"Safety%20First%20%28Thousand%20Needles%29\"&gt;Safety First (Thousand Needles)&lt;/a&gt;\nRazzeric is delighted at the recovery of the part - at first. But then he discovers a safety was left on. And he wants you to take it to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; and get it released. Grumbling, you wonder why he didn't just make a trip to Gadgetzan to get the part in the first place, as it is just south of the flats... but as he is paying you for an easy trip, you agree.\nThe goblin &lt;a href=\"Shreev\"&gt;Shreev&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; shakes his head in exasperation when you explain what Razzeric wants - it seems there is no safety on the device, it has actually been modified to deliver even more boost than normal.\n&lt;a href=\"Safety%20First%20%282%29\"&gt;Safety First (2)&lt;/a&gt;\nDespite his misgivings, &lt;a href=\"Shreev\"&gt;Shreev&lt;/a&gt; modifies the booster further, muttering that he hoped Razzeric didn't kill himself with it - who knew if the nineteenth pilot would be as good? At last you return to Razzeric with the finished part, and he is ecstatic, rewarding you with your choice of his very own seat belt (which he never uses anyway) or his prize racing gloves.\nRewards.\nIf the player follows the entire quest chain from beginning to end, he or she will receive:"}

This event is streamed on the \"World of Warcraft\" Twitch channel.\nMDI was rebranded from Invitational to International on 17 January 2019.\nOfficial description.\n\"World of Warcraft esports is expanding into the fast-paced, highly competitive world of Mythic Keystone dungeons with the Mythic Dungeon Invitational. We\u2019re looking for the best of the best from around the world to battle it out for a share of $100,000.\"\nStages.\nProving Grounds are a qualification period open to any player with a good standing &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; account. In order to qualify for the next stage, a group of 5 players would need to team up and complete five level 14 &lt;a href=\"Mythic%2B\"&gt;Mythic Keystone Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; within a time frame. If successful, each player on the team will have their account flagged to have access to the &lt;a href=\"Tournament%20Realm\"&gt;Tournament Realm&lt;/a&gt; and continue onward to the Time Trials.\nEach team will have to make five attempts at each dungeon in a three-dungeon pool. Players are informed on what dungeons and &lt;a href=\"affix\"&gt;affix&lt;/a&gt;es 48 hours prior to the Time Trials beginning. The dungeons and affixes alternate each week.\nTeams that have completed the time trials will receive a banner toy associated with the season.\nAll-Stars.\nThe All-Stars was a special live exhibition tournament that summoned some of the best dungeon-running teams in the world for &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202018\"&gt;BlizzCon 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Blizzard brought the worlds of the MDI and the &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Arena%20World%20Championship\"&gt;WoW Arena World Championship&lt;/a&gt; together in Anaheim for the first time ever.\nThe top four teams from the MDI Global Finals were invited to the MDI All-Stars, where they tackled the newest \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" dungeons live on stage in front of thousands of attendees and esports fans that watched from online. This was the first MDI tournament to feature \"Battle for Azeroth\".\nThe Great Push.\nThe Great Push where teams competed by doing the highest &lt;a href=\"Keystone\"&gt;Keystone&lt;/a&gt; (starting at +24) and attempting to complete the dungeons as fast as possible. Teams were able to repeatedly run any dungeon during this time and by conclusion of the finals runs, the team's highest keystones from every dungeon would be combined to determine the final standings. This is a race to complete as many Mythic+ dungeons as possible. It was introduced on 7 April 2021.\nIt returned for a season two in December 2021 with a toy, &lt;a href=\"Tormented%20Banner%20of%20the%20Opportune\"&gt;Tormented Banner of the Opportune&lt;/a&gt; rewarding to all registered teams that complete under time the two dungeons within the Proving Grounds.\nIt returned once again with &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20Season%204\"&gt;Shadowlands Season 4&lt;/a&gt; along with a new banner toy, the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Banner%20of%20the%20Opportune\"&gt;Shrouded Banner of the Opportune&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\nSeason 2.\nThe \"Group Stage\" started on April 13 and ended on May 6, 2018.\nThe \"Time Trials\" started on March 27, 2018 to judge the overall skill, expertise, and flexibility of the teams in three dungeons across different difficulties.\nThe \"Proving Grounds\" took place on February 27 and March 6 and ended on March 13, 2018.\nSeason 1.\nThe \"Proving Grounds\" took place on 25 July to 8 August 2017. The season ended on 1 October 2017."}

If the current Keystone was deleted, another one won't be available from any of the possible Keystone sources until after the weekly dungeon reset.\nIf it was accidentally deleted, it can be recovered through the &lt;a href=\"Battle.net\"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Item%20Restoration\"&gt;Item Restoration&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Game%20services\"&gt;service&lt;/a&gt;. However, with &lt;a href=\"patch%208.1.0\"&gt;patch 8.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, the keystone can no longer be deleted.\nAcquiring the Keystone.\nThere are three ways to obtain a Keystone:\nUpgrading the Keystone.\nIf one successfully completes a Mythic+ dungeon within the time allotted, the Keystone that was used to start the attempt will become upgraded by at least 1 level. The faster one clears the content, the larger the upgrade, up to a maximum of 3 levels higher.\nAt the end of the dungeon run, the upgraded Keystone will be placed in the initiating player's bag. Each time a Keystone is upgraded it will select a new dungeon at random from the set of dungeons the initiating player has access to (&lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt; does not follow this rule). For example, if the player who started the run has not yet unlocked &lt;a href=\"The%20Arcway\"&gt;The Arcway&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; dungeons, the Keystone will only choose from the remaining valid dungeons.\nChanging a Keystone.\nCompleting a dungeon after the timer changes the keystone to another (random) dungeon of the same difficulty. Resetting an in-progress dungeon downgrades the keystone by one level without changing the dungeon.\nAn NPC near the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Vault\"&gt;Great Vault&lt;/a&gt; offers to downgrade a keystone, and at the end of each Mythic+ dungeon to change your keystone to a different random one at the same difficulty (unless yours is a higher difficulty than the dungeon just completed)."}

Mythrax's body was sealed within the temple of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, until recently when &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;, an ally of &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, roused Mythrax.

With his mission complete, Mythrax returned to his master's side in Uldir.\nBiography.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;Aqir and Troll War&lt;/a&gt; roughly 16,000 years ago, Mythrax was tasked with invading Vol'dun. He descended upon the region, slaughtering &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; alike. The &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed herself to save them, but though she struck Mythrax down Mythrax was still able to destroy the disc at the heart of &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;: one of three seals keeping &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; locked away. After witnessing the destruction firsthand, the sethrak knew that something had to be done to prevent anyone from raising Mythrax again. &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Korthek&lt;/a&gt; worked together to seal Mythrax within the great pyramid.\nYears later, Korthek grew power hungry and sought to free Mythrax to conquer &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. He gathered like-minded sethrak and declared himself emperor. &lt;a href=\"General%20Jakra%27zet\"&gt;General Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt; allied with Korthek, and though Korthek was slain Jakra'zet successfully stole the keys to Atul'Aman and completed the ritual to revive Mythrax by sacrificing himself.\nMythrax joined &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; in an attack on &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the final seal on G'huun. He was initially held off by the loa &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt;. Although Zul died, Mythrax successfully destroyed the seal. Mythrax serves as a boss in &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, where he was slain by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s seeking to put an end to G'huun.\nDragonflight.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"time%20travel\"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt;ling with &lt;a href=\"Andantenormu\"&gt;Andantenormu&lt;/a&gt;, Mythrax is briefly seen in the past of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, fighting with &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s, who were crafted by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s to protect the world, trapped her deep beneath the Arathi Highlands. Only through some crystal shards is she able to speak with the surface world \u2014 so she cries for help from the mortal races.\nEventually, her cries are heard by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Skuerto\"&gt;Skuerto&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zaruk\"&gt;Zaruk&lt;/a&gt;, the trapped being introduced herself as a princess of the earth and asks for their aid. The adventurers are sent to &lt;a href=\"Drywhisker%20Gorge\"&gt;Drywhisker Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Drywhisker\"&gt;Drywhisker Kobolds&lt;/a&gt; reside, to take an amount of &lt;a href=\"Mote%20of%20Myzrael\"&gt;Motes of Myzrael&lt;/a&gt; from them and then speak to the princess through the shard deep inside the gorge. After taking care of the kobold allies of the giants and successfully gathering the motes, Myzrael sends the adventurers to the Stones of Binding in order to collect the keys needed to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Inner%20Binding\"&gt;Stone of Inner Binding&lt;/a&gt;, the strongest of all stones. The adventurers took care of the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; exiles that protected the keys and managed to unlock the strongest stone, Myzrael then asked that they defeated the &lt;a href=\"stone%20guardian\"&gt;stone guardian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fozruk\"&gt;Fozruk&lt;/a&gt;, one of her captors, and got his &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Order\"&gt;Rod of Order&lt;/a&gt;. Fozruk used to wander with &lt;a href=\"Feeboz\"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sleeby\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Znort\"&gt;escorts&lt;/a&gt;, but for some reason they disappeared after the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, thus leaving the mountain giant unprotected. Without anyone to aid him in battle, the mountain giant fell and the rod was retrieved to the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Inner%20Binding\"&gt;Stone of Inner Binding&lt;/a&gt;, not even an ambush from &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thenan\"&gt;Thenan&lt;/a&gt; was able to stop the adventurers from further freeing the \"princess\".\nThe adventurers, however, began feeling uneasy for aiding the imprisoned princess, and decided to report to the ones who sent them there, the Alliance adventurers reporting to &lt;a href=\"Skuerto\"&gt;Skuerto&lt;/a&gt; while the Horde ones spoke to &lt;a href=\"Zaruk\"&gt;Zaruk&lt;/a&gt;. While the adventurers were gone aiding Myzrael, Skuerto \"persuaded\" a &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"agent\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt; in disguise at &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gerrig%20Bonegrip\"&gt;Gerrig Bonegrip&lt;/a&gt;, into saying what were the true intentions of the fake princess and Zaruk asked for the Horde adventurers' pardon for he already knew her true motives and the whispers of his past times as a member of the Twilight's Hammer were too strong. Skuerto then gave the Alliance adventurers the &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Myzrael\"&gt;Scroll of Myzrael&lt;/a&gt; and told them to use it where they first spoke to her, they were ordered to summon her and then defeat her before she reached full power, which was the way to deal with her according to Gerrig. Zaruk possessed the same knowledge as Gerrig Bonegrip, and provided Horde adventurers with the same scroll and gave them the same instructions as Skuerto to the Alliance ones.\nThe adventurers eventually summoned Myzrael and defeated the manipulative being and her &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Exile\"&gt;Prismatic Exile&lt;/a&gt;s, then took the &lt;a href=\"Eldritch%20Shackles\"&gt;Eldritch Shackles&lt;/a&gt; from her body and placed them on the shards, thus fully binding her once more, the consequent ill will towards the surface making her never want to leave her home again.\nCataclysm.\nAfter her defeat at the hands of mortal adventurers, Myzrael can be found in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, wandering back and forth in a small canyon just southeast of &lt;a href=\"Needlerock%20Chasm\"&gt;Needlerock Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. She's neutral, belongs to no faction, and offers different gossip texts to characters who have and have not completed her Arathi Highlands &lt;a href=\"Summoning%20the%20Princess\"&gt;quests&lt;/a&gt;. Judging by Myzrael's gossip text to those who completed her questline, it seems that defeat at the hand of the adventurers freed the elemental from the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Myzrael\"&gt;Echo of Myzrael&lt;/a&gt; can be found in the Arathi Highlands at Myzrael's old location."}

{"id": "297014", "revid": "5334352", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=297014", "title": "N'Zoth", "text": "N'Zoth (pronounced nuh-ZAWTH) is one of the four &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s that landed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, malefic beings that were sequestered by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s during Azeroth's primordial ages. Until the events of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth remained notoriously elusive and was largely a mystery, being the last Old God besides the deceased &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; that had still yet to be directly encountered by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nPrior to the Fourth War, very little was certain about N'Zoth \u2014 most beings on Azeroth did not even know its name, much less what it looked like. Scraps of obscure &lt;a href=\"Flavor%20lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt; claimed that the Old God had been imprisoned beneath the darkest depths of the ocean for millennia beyond counting. There were also whispers that N'Zoth desired nothing more than to twist what was once noble and pure to its own inscrutable ends. For years, most of what was \"known\" about this most insidious of beings consisted largely of speculation.\nAlthough considered the weakest of the four by &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth was responsible for the corruption of the black &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; Neltharion into &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, as well as that of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, turning them into the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, the co-creation of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and the restoration of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn , and following &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, N'Zoth resurfaced to bring about the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. He imbued Deathwing with untold amounts of power, while he was recovering and absorbing the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;'s energies from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. This destabilized the elemental realm and threw the Elements into turmoil, in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;. At N'Zoth's word, Deathwing exploded from Deepholm into Azeroth, breaking down the boundaries between the two realms, and igniting a chain reaction of natural disasters around the planet, collectively known as the Cataclysm.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; successfully took control of the &lt;a href=\"Highlands\"&gt;Highlands&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarves\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, establishing the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. On order of N'Zoth, Queen Azshara's naga invaded &lt;a href=\"Vash%27jir\"&gt;Vash'jir&lt;/a&gt; and attempted to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and his servants attempted to steal the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and his fire elementals assaulted &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in order to destroy the World Tree &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. N'Zoth struck at the world on all fronts, aiming to overwhelm the mortal factions and hoping that even if only one of these attacks succeeded, it would be enough to bring about the Hour of Twilight. During the final battle at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth sent his own minions, the &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt;, to aid the assault.\nThough the Hour of Twilight was averted, N'Zoth returned in \"\". His influence had spread through &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; through the order of the &lt;a href=\"Tidesages\"&gt;Tidesages&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; launched a major assault on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them to &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; as part of a scheme that led to the Old God being freed from the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;Last Prison&lt;/a&gt; and unleashed upon Azeroth once again. N'Zoth restored the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, and rose the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; from their ancient slumber beneath the desert sands. He launched &lt;a href=\"Assaults\"&gt;Assaults&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; in order to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, and corrupted the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Titan Keeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;. However, N'Zoth was ultimately destroyed by the Forge of Origination empowered with the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nN'Zoth served as one of the main antagonists (alongside &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;) in \"\".\nBiography.\nDuring the days of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth controlled a vast territory in the east of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, covering much of what would later become known as the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Countless ages ago, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zon%27ozz\"&gt;Warlord Zon'ozz&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers waged endless war in the name of N'Zoth against the forces of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; claims that in ages past, the God of the Deep lost a great battle to the &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;God of Seven Heads&lt;/a&gt; in the land that would later become known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. However, as was so often the case, even defeat ultimately worked in N'Zoth's favor.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;visitors&lt;/a&gt; from the future traveled to the time of the Black Empire to save &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; who was locked in a battle with &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt;. N'Zoth, speaking as the \"Knowing Presence\", recognized the player and made ominous predictions.\nN'Zoth was the first of the Old Gods to be defeated and sealed in an underground prison by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; armies after &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;'s death, in a location halfway between the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and the site where &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; was later built.\nWar of the Ancients.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; ended and the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; collapsed around &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, a small fish with strange red eyes seemed to be whispering to Azshara to 'let go' and give up, even as the waves destroyed her palace. Eventually, Azshara's arcane shield failed, and she and her court were swept into the sea. However, something seemed to keep the queen from drowning. The fish began speaking directly to Azshara, revealing itself to be possessed by N'Zoth. Offering Azshara visions of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; that it had ruled over in ages past, it offered to save her in exchange for becoming its servant. Azshara, ever guileful and charismatic, convinced the Old God that she would not be a servant, but become a queen to rule at its side. It could either accept the offer or potentially have no servants and be left with no way to free itself. N'Zoth reluctantly agreed, transforming her and the Highborne into &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncient times.\nWhen the roots of the growing World Tree &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently reached &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;'s prison, it allowed the Old God to first open the door into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. This then enabled the other Old Gods and N'Zoth to spread their corruption in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nMillennia later, Azeroth's mortal &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s defeated both C'Thun and Yogg-Saron. Shrouded in an ocean of fevered dreams among the bones of nameless horrors, N'Zoth remained untouched. It was certain that Azeroth's champions would eventually come for it, just as they had C'Thun and Yogg-Saron. It was not afraid, but sensed that a window of opportunity was quickly closing; the world was still recovering from its war against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; were consumed by their own struggles. The time to usher in the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; was now, and the herald of the apocalypse would be the corrupted Aspect &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, who was currently recovering in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. N'Zoth fed its own dark energy into Deathwing's heart, infusing the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; with great power but also making his form more unstable. N'Zoth commanded cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; to venture into Deepholm and bolt &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt; plates to Deathwing to prevent the dragon's body from tearing apart. Meanwhile, the Old God reached out elsewhere in the Elemental Plane and called on the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 the Old Gods' ancient servants \u2014 to prepare for war. Two of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 refused to serve the Old God, but &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; embraced N'Zoth's command. They relished the prospect of war, and N'Zoth promised to release them from their prisons and allow them to roam free on Azeroth once more. Once Deathwing was ready for war, he would burst out of Deepholm, tearing a rift between Azeroth and the Elemental Plane, and subsequently serve as an extension of N'Zoth's will by coordinating the elementals and Twilight's Hammer. N'Zoth made Deathwing believe that by doing so, he would be able to scour Azeroth of the other dragons and claim the world as his own. In truth, however, N'Zoth intended to dispose of Deathwing after using him to restore the Black Empire and shroud the world in shadow.\nBefore long, the time had come. On N'Zoth's word, Deathwing unleashed his rage and exploded from Deepholm into Azeroth, igniting the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; and causing great devastation across Azeroth. N'Zoth stoked the fire in Deathwing's veins, filling him with excruciating pain. While sporadic battles erupted between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing unleashed the Old Gods' minions on the world. Al'Akir assaulted &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to claim the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, another servant of N'Zoth \u2014 Queen Azshara \u2014 sent her naga forces to &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. Neptulon and his minions had defied N'Zoth's will, and for this they would suffer, but N'Zoth also demanded Neptulon's power to control the world's seas, which the naga could use to cut off all sea travel between Azeroth's continents. N'Zoth was confident that the Alliance and Horde would never be able to stop all of its servants, and if even one of the Old God's campaigns succeeded, it would usher in the Hour of Twilight. However, Azeroth's heroes soon arose to thwart the efforts of N'Zoth's minions in Deepholm, Uldum, and Vashj'ir. Meanwhile, Deathwing and the Twilight's Hammer summoned Ragnaros and his fire elementals to assault &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; since N'Zoth believed that burning Nordrassil would deal an irrecoverable blow to the world, but in the end Hyjal was saved by the combined efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth's champions, and the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nEventually, the tide of the war turned as Azeroth's defenders pushed back against the forces of the Old Gods. Heroes retrieved the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; from the past and took it to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, where the Dragon Aspects and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; began to empower it with the intention of using it to destroy Deathwing. Deathwing and his &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; and cultist minions unleashed their full fury on Wyrmrest, and N'Zoth sent its &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; minions to aid in the assault, led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zon%27ozz\"&gt;Warlord Zon'ozz&lt;/a&gt; like in ancient times. However, the Aspects managed to empower the Dragon Soul and unleashed it on Deathwing, forcing him to flee toward the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to escape back into Deepholm. Wyrmrest's defenders pursued him. N'Zoth sensed that its servant was on the verge of defeat and that its plans were about to unravel. In a final, desperate attempt to turn the tide, N'Zoth &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;infused Deathwing with more of its power than ever before&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end, Thrall unleashed the Dragon Soul and finally annihilated the corrupted Aspect. In that moment, N'Zoth's campaign to bring about the Hour of Twilight collapsed.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; claims that the God of the Deep writhes in its prison, breaking free ever so slowly. &lt;a href=\"Xavius%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; served N'Zoth, and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; theorized that Xavius and his ancient master delighted that Azeroth was focused on fighting the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe forces of both N'Zoth and Queen Azshara can be seen during the &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley%20storyline\"&gt;Stormsong Valley storyline&lt;/a&gt;. As Azshara sways the &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt; to their side, N'Zoth sends &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt the populace of Stormsong Valley into twisted &lt;a href=\"k%27thir\"&gt;k'thir&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; serving as the herald of their coming. A portion of N'Zoth itself is located under the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Crucible of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of Vengeance.\nIn accordance with a bargain between N'Zoth and &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, the latter guided Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, declared as the Opener, the Bringer of Truths, and the Torch That Lights the Way, into the Crucible of Storms with several powerful relics they had collected. Thus with their bargain fulfilled, N'Zoth frees Xal'atath, so that she may find her own way but instructed her to leave the blade she resided in behind so that it would serve N'Zoth's will. Turning its gaze towards the Bringer of Truths, N'Zoth declared that it had dreamed of their destiny, and that the hour was close at hand for that which had been sunken to rise, and that all that were sleeping would be awakened. N'Zoth then gave unto them &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;its gift&lt;/a&gt;, so that they could see all truths before them. Those with its gift are able to use it on all who have been blessed by the Old God, though through the use of perilous and painful ritual (Alliance) or the power of the loa &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt; (Horde), N'Zoth's gift could be cleansed from those who were granted it.\nLater, a group of adventurers entered the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Crucible of Storms&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim the relics and halt N'Zoth's plans. N'Zoth watched and whispered to the champions as they defeated its forces, including &lt;a href=\"Uu%27nat\"&gt;Uu'nat&lt;/a&gt;, who declared to his master with his dying breath that they were \"worthy\". Horde champions then discovered the empty blade that once held &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling the power that resonated within the blade, almost if as if the weapon spoke with another voice, these champions were compelled to deliver the artifact to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;their warchief&lt;/a&gt;. As they picked up the blade, N'Zoth declared: \"The fall of night reveals her true face. She will bring only ruin.\" The Alliance champions, on the other hand, were alerted to the Horde's possession of the blade.\nRise of Azshara.\nAfter Azshara was informed of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fleets heading towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth reached out to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, who commented on its imprisonment and told it not to worry. Though Azshara would be defeated, she was successful in breaking the chains binding N'Zoth after activating the titan device in the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;Last Prison&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;:Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The Old God subsequently rescued Azshara from being killed by &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Following its rescue of the naga queen, N'Zoth ominously declared: \"All eyes shall be opened.\"\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nThe events within the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt; have set the stage for the Old God N'Zoth's release from its titanwrought prison, and an ancient corruption has taken root across Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, the Sleeping City, has awakened. Under N'Zoth's command, the armies of the Black Empire threaten to engulf the world and reshape it according to their &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;master's vision&lt;/a&gt;. Nightmares dwell in &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;-shrouded heart of the ancient Black Empire. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth venture deep into the horrific realm to confront mad heralds and inscrutable horrors, and ultimately go eye-to-eyes with N'Zoth itself for one final confrontation against the Old God in a fateful battle for Azeroth's survival.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; launched an attack to claim the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth's minion Shith'rus the Manipulator snuck in with their forces as &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Prophet%20Tenhamen\"&gt;Sun Prophet Tenhamen&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their death, N'Zoth's appears in the mind of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; where N'Zoth subsequently called them its devoted chosen. As &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and the champion fought the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; to claim the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth once more reached out to the champion. The Old God remarked that the frenzied mantid swarm knew what was coming and that Azeroth's champion would be its herald. Soon after Magni discovered that an anomaly existed within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt; and set off to investigate, discovering that N'Zoth was seeking to gain control of the forge. In order help better combat N'Zoth, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; and the champion sought an object of pure corruption, a task that ended with Azeroth's champion acquiring &lt;a href=\"Ashjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;Ashjra'kamas, Shroud of Resolve&lt;/a&gt;. After a &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20N%27Zoth%23Horrific%20Visions\"&gt;Horrific Vision&lt;/a&gt; was defeated per Wrathion's request, Magni was stunned to hear N'Zoth's voice within the Chamber of Heart. Subsequently, the Old God attacked the chamber, opening a portal to &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; and releasing its forces into the facility. Magni fought against the Old God's minions alongside the other defenders of the chamber, but once it became clear that N'Zoth was about to overtake the facility, Ra turned to the adventurer and told them to save Azeroth, no matter the cost. The Highkeeper then charged at the portal to Ny'alotha and used a lightning attack to destroy it, but was pulled into the realm in the process. According to Magni, the Chamber of Heart and all of Azeroth would've been N'Zoth's for the taking had it not been for Ra's sacrifice.\nDetermined to save Ra and end the threat of N'Zoth, Magni called for Azeroth's Champions to venture into &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to all, N'Zoth was able to take advantage of the despair Ra-den long harbored and overwhelm any remnants of hope, causing the Highkeeper to do the Old God's bidding. As Azeroth's champion ventured into &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Inquisitor%20Xanesh\"&gt;Dark Inquisitor Xanesh&lt;/a&gt; torturing &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; for betraying N'Zoth. Upon Xanesh's defeat, Azshara revealed that she held Xal'atath and claimed that she would have driven the dagger into N'Zoth's heart herself had the Alliance and Horde not disrupted her plans. The naga then gave Xal'atath to Wrathion while warning him and the champions that if they failed to kill N'Zoth with their first blow, they would not survive to attempt another. Azshara subsequently departed from Ny'alotha while Wrathion and his allies ventured forth to put an end to the Black Empire. As Wrathion examined the black blade for treachery Azeroth's champions struck down N'Zoth's greatest servants, including the likes of &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ra-den%20the%20Despoiled\"&gt;Ra-den the Despoiled&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Il%27gynoth%2C%20Corruption%20Reborn\"&gt;Il'gynoth, Corruption Reborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the Black Blade, Wrathion stabbed the &lt;a href=\"Carapace%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;Carapace of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; which during the fight with the &lt;a href=\"Fury%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;Fury of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; helped adventurers regain their sanity by teleporting back to him. Following the destruction of the Carapace, the final battle against the Old God started. During the battle N'Zoth revealed its role in the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and how the former &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; conspired with Azshara while revealing that Sylvanas intended to unleash a that only it could save Azeroth from. To that end, N'Zoth called for Azeroth's champions to yield and serve. However, Azeroth's heroes refused to be swayed and N'Zoth's body (along with Ny'alotha) was destroyed when the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; fired the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;, upon it.\nQuotes.\nAn Unseen Presence whispers to the player when in &lt;a href=\"Deepcoil%20Tunnels\"&gt;Deepcoil Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shirakess%20Depository\"&gt;Shirakess Depository&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Cunning and intelligent, they serve their eldritch masters with fanatical loyalty and are known to be virtually unstoppable juggernauts. During times of war, the n'raqi serve as the commanders and taskmasters of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt;, turning the insane worshipers and chaotic forces into a capable military force. \nThe faceless ones were first seen serving a &lt;a href=\"forgotten%20one\"&gt;forgotten one&lt;/a&gt; in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; during the events of '. They made their first appearance in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" with the second expansion, ', and have since become one of the most common sightings in areas influenced by the Old Gods.\nHistory.\nWhen the Old Gods first embedded themselves into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they spread their corruptive influence across the landscape. Two distinct races arose from the organic matter seeping from the Old Gods' blighted forms: the n'raqi and the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;. As the physical manifestations of the Old Gods' will, both served their masters with fanatical loyalty. The n'raqi acted as ruthless taskmasters, employing the aqir as laborers to erect towering citadels and temple cities around their masters' colossal bulks. The greatest of these bastions were built around the Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;. This burgeoning civilization was located near the center of Azeroth's largest continent. As the holdings of Y'Shaarj and the other Old Gods spread across the world, it became known as the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Countless eons ago, the n'raqi waged endless wars against each other as part of the forces of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the Old Gods were sealed below the earth by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, many of the n'raqi were imprisoned alongside them.\nReawakening in Northrend.\nAmid the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, many of the kingdom's denizens tunneled underground to escape the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s minions. Yet some of them dug too deep, exposing the tendrils of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. Rousing its awareness, the Old God sent his n'raqi under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Volazj\"&gt;Herald Volazj&lt;/a&gt; against them, and the nerubians were caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place. The nerubians' misfortune costed them the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;war against the undead&lt;/a&gt;, and ultimately, their home.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nDuring the desperate flight of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; to defend the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his armies, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; were forced to make their way through the ancient, underground &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. At first, the invading &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army preyed only on the pockets of still living Nerubian resistance fighters and &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; that were left over from Arthas' last journey to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, as Anub'arak and Arthas journeyed ever deeper into these ruins, they found that the lower regions of the kingdom had become infested by \"ancient, horrid things\", as the dwarf leader &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20Flamebeard\"&gt;Baelgun&lt;/a&gt; had described them, released from the dark below by the earthquakes that were being caused by Illidan's sorcery. These beings appeared as strange, vaguely humanoid creatures, and were accompanied by massive tentacles that seemed to be a part of a single, monstrous entity which Anub'arak referred to as a \"&lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20One%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;forgotten one&lt;/a&gt;\". The crypt lord seemed to know of these creatures, but was startled to discover they truly existed and warned Arthas to \"\"Look to your defenses, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;! Fight as you've never fought before!\"\". The two champions of the Lich King and their Scourge forces managed to barely defeat the forgotten one, but as ever more n'raqi emerged from the deeps to stalk the undead army and the caverns began collapsing under the flailing of the massive tentacles, Arthas and Anub'arak were forced to flee from Azjol-Nerub. Eventually, Arthas made it out of fallen kingdom and was able to &lt;a href=\"A%20Symphony%20of%20Frost%20and%20Flame\"&gt;confront Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, but not until making it through the greatest peril he had yet faced.\nWar against the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; came under attack from a n'raqi that had been awakened by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; to take &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; with him. During the battle, Med'an intuitively wove together arcane and shamanic magic to defeat the ancient creature.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, multiple faceless ones appear, including &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Volazj\"&gt;Herald Volazj&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;' forces, and &lt;a href=\"Darkspeaker%20R%27khem\"&gt;Darkspeaker R'khem&lt;/a&gt;, a captive of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Saronite%20Mines\"&gt;Saronite Mines&lt;/a&gt;.

The goblins, however, believe him to be a deformed naga.\nSince the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yor%27sahj%20the%20Unsleeping\"&gt;Yor'sahj the Unsleeping&lt;/a&gt; has eagerly assisted &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, providing the Destroyer with the means to release more faceless ones from their prisons deep beneath the earth. Their numbers were endless and their power was beyond reckoning.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;assault&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zon%27ozz\"&gt;Warlord Zon'ozz&lt;/a&gt; and Yor'sahj appeared in the maws of &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Go%27rath\"&gt;Go'rath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Shu%27ma\"&gt;Shu'ma&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. They were ultimately killed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wardens\"&gt;Wardens&lt;/a&gt; have kept faceless ones imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. During the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, these n'raqi were set free as a result of the Legion's attacks on these areas.\nMore notably, however, the faceless appear within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the Nightmare Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, providing one of the many indications as to whom the Emerald Nightmare truly belongs. These n'raqi assist Xavius in his battle against the invading &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, both assaulting them ahead of his emergence, and keeping his enemies on their toes with their massive, Nightmare-enhanced size. However, even with the aid of these horrors, Xavius is unable to best the adventurers who assault him and is killed. Upon his death, the Nightmare dissipates, seemingly forever ending the Old Gods' grip on the realm.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFaceless ones are present in both &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, especially in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, faceless ones could be found overseeing the operations or acting as enforcers. In the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;Visions of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; there were many faceless ones in both &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nStandard faceless.\nN'raqi are vaguely humanoid creatures who, as the name implies, have no discernible faces insofar as other races recognize them. One arm is much larger than the other, grotesque and misshapen, while the other is little more than a prehensile tentacle.\nAquatic faceless.\nA type of underwater n'raqi that, unlike their brethren, have much bigger eyes and nautilus-like heads.\nFaceless spellcaster.\nA type of n'raqi caster that wears masks and has thinner tentacle arms than other types of n'raqi.\nC'Thraxxi.\n&lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi, or \"faceless generals\", are massive n'raqi warbringers, larger and more resilient than their lesser brethren.\nK'thir.\n&lt;a href=\"K%27thir\"&gt;K'thir&lt;/a&gt; are smaller faceless ones able to infiltrate mortal societies. They have hands with opposable thumbs instead of tentacles.\nCommunication.\nThe n'raqi speak the &lt;a href=\"Shath%27Yar\"&gt;Shath'Yar&lt;/a&gt;, the language of the Old Gods. Their communications are somehow translated directly into the minds of nearby players through telepathic whispers, as evidenced by several powerful n'raqi that were faced by adventurers. &lt;a href=\"Darkspeaker%20R%27khem\"&gt;Darkspeaker R'khem&lt;/a&gt; also communicates with other beings by projecting telepathic thoughts into their mind, together with a wave of soothing, euphoric feelings that are mixed with a sense of pain. After completing &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Tricks\"&gt;Mind Tricks&lt;/a&gt;, he disappears with a noise that is translated as laughter in the player's mind. &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20Lurker\"&gt;Faceless Lurker&lt;/a&gt;s sometimes utter \"Shur'nab... shur'nab... &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;!\" when assaulting their victims, which never appears to be accompanied by telepathic whispers, so it seems only powerful n'raqi can express themselves in this manner.\nIn the RPG.\nTales say they lived in Azjol-Nerub long before the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; came, dwelling too deep for the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s to hunt them. The strange faceless ones are ancient monsters long imprisoned beneath the ice and recently loosed again. Faceless ones have a long magical heritage. They draw upon their race's legacy of arcane spellcasting traditions to increase their power. Although faceless ones have a racially low intellect, they have a strong heritage of necromantic magic. A second passage into the has been discovered by the Scourge, and &lt;a href=\"Baelgun\"&gt;Baelgun&lt;/a&gt; knows the faceless ones will overpower even the undead and then be free to escape into Northrend proper, and so he vows to stop them.\nInspiration.\nThe faceless ones may be loosely based on the s, or \"mind flayers\", from \"\". Both illithids and n'raqi are evil races with an affinity for magic and telepathy, and they have both been described as slimy humanoids with \"almost octopus-like heads\". Both races also traditionally live underground and are mostly feared by land-dwellers. It is likely that both creatures are based on 's shared (which the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and their minions draw heavy inspiration from), or perhaps more accurately, the Cthulhi, the \"Star-Spawn\" of Cthulhu.\nSpeculation.\nThe faceless one mobs in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Kingdom\"&gt;Old Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; are actually called &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20One%20%28Ahn%27kahet%29\"&gt;Forgotten Ones&lt;/a&gt;, which may suggest a relation to the term &lt;a href=\"forgotten%20one\"&gt;forgotten one&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are perhaps the purest expression of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; that exists in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, and have vowed to bring peace and hope to all mortal civilizations and waylay the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. They are known to travel through dimensions, and are the sworn enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot all naaru necessarily have the same motives, and they have their own personalities and own goals, with &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, who was notably different from other naaru players have met, being the best example of this. As such, not all naaru are necessarily good from the player's perspective, for while Xe'ra believed that she was indeed doing good, that good was not necessarily good for everyone.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nIn the primordial era following the birth of the universe \u2014 a result of the clash between the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 shards of fractured Light occasionally gathered in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; and formed clouds of Light from which powerful beings emerged, among which were the benevolent naaru. When the naaru gazed out across the universe, they saw limitless possibilities and vowed to use their mastery over &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; magic to nurture life and hope throughout the cosmos. Although the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s were described as \"more extraordinary\" than the naaru, and presumably considerably more powerful than the average naaru, the naaru far outnumber the known titans of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Naaru\"&gt;prime naaru&lt;/a&gt; were the first naaru to be forged during the great ordering of the cosmos. &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; believed that the naaru's powers greatly resembled those of the moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; found in an ancient cosmology tome a passage indicating that the prime naaru may have been created by Elune during the great ordering of Light and Shadow.\nAs nurturing as they may be, the naaru are not passive pacifists either. In seeking goodness and harmony, they struggle against the servants of &lt;a href=\"Magic%23The%20cosmic%20forces\"&gt;cosmic forces&lt;/a&gt; who oppose the Light, being notably in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Disorder\"&gt;Disorder&lt;/a&gt;, as well as making sure &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; keeps its place.\nAccording to the prime naaru, &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, the Light and the Void have been at war since the beginning of the entire universe, before &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; itself, and she notably reacted with cold disgust to the idea of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; cooperating with the Void even against the Legion, as the Void sought to destroy or enslave everything in existence; she also declared that the two forces could not exist together. &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; herself briefly glimpsed the cosmic conflict between the Light and Void affecting millions of lives across countless worlds and planets. At least some of the naaru such as &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, however, recognize the Void's creatures as \"a necessary part of the universe\", but they must nevertheless be held in check by the Light. Xe'ra also refused to tell the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; that the naaru, like &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt;, were able to fall into a Void state, but &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; openly acknowledged it was a facet of the naaru condition, and furthermore stated that without the Void, the Light could not exist.\nWhile the naaru regarded them as \"horrors to be resisted\", the &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s and their servants, according to &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, regard the naaru as \"beloved brethren that lost the true path\" which will return to their embrace eventually.\nWhen it comes to facing Disorder, the naaru have been waging open war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, apparently sustaining heavy losses, with the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" described as the Light's largest remaining refuge, and despite &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; believing he had already defeated the Light, they were apparently the last major cosmic force openly opposing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; after the Pantheon's destruction.\nLong ago, the forces of the Light additionally assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; realm of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; in retaliation to an affront against them by &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;. The affront was the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, Denathrius' creations, infiltrating the forces of Light and being discovered. The location of the battlefield between the Light and the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr\"&gt;Venthyr&lt;/a&gt; is now a Light-scorched ruin known as the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;. The naaru &lt;a href=\"Z%27rali\"&gt;Z'rali&lt;/a&gt; was injured in the battle, captured by the \"unseen ones\", and held prisoner by the Venthyr.\nThe naaru are not always directly intervening either. Their plans might last millennia, with them indirectly reaching out to younger mortal races of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;cosmos&lt;/a&gt;, preparing them for when the time would come. They as such once bestowed the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt; to the fledgling &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. The crystal became the eredar's most sacred artifact, with them not knowing of its true origin.\nShepherding the draenei.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; came to the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; and began convincing the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; to join the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, one of the three eredar leader, prayed for help. The naaru appeared to him in visions, offering to take Velen and any other like-minded eredar to safety. Velen and his faction accepted, and the naaru came to rescue Velen and his followers with a &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; named the \"&lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". They thus began to call themselves &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, meaning \"the Exiled Ones\" in &lt;a href=\"eredun\"&gt;eredun&lt;/a&gt;. The \"Genedar\" then split into two different ships, the \"Genedar\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\". The draenei who boarded the \"Xenedar\" would become the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt;, and went their separate ways, with the former fleeing across the cosmos, and the latter openly striking back and fighting the Legion.\nDuring the draenei's journey, the enigmatic naaru race taught them the ways of the Light, though they already had a certain experience with it through Velen and &lt;a href=\"T%27uure\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt;. The naaru explained that there were other forces in the cosmos that would stand against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. One day the naaru would forge them into a single unstoppable &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. The naaru also bestowed a blessing, the &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, upon the draenei to signify their new connection with the Light, Velen's sigil being visible at all times, and to this day, all the draenei are able to tap into this power to heal themselves and others. Deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals.\nCommuning with humans.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, a number of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s began having faint dreams and visions of &lt;a href=\"angel\"&gt;angel&lt;/a&gt;ic forms thrumming with living light. They did not know it, but they had actually managed to commune with the naaru in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, and through this connection, the Holy Light was introduced to the early humans for the first time.\n&lt;a href=\"Mereldar\"&gt;Mereldar&lt;/a&gt; was the first of these prophets, receiving visions of holiness, protection, justice, retribution, and compassion. With others who had also reported seeing the visions, they codified and wrote down the wisdom of this higher power. The movement sparked widespread faith in the Light and became the predominant human religion, and centuries later the different Light-based traditions and belief systems were codified by &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s leaders into the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nRight before the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; received a vision from the naaru when he learned that &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; planned to invade and plunder other worlds in the cosmos. The vision convinced him that the Alliance had to send an expedition to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and save all those innumerable innocents.\nOutland.\nRight before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; began, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; reached out to the naaru independently, both seeking aid against the dark forces of the Burning Legion amassing on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; heard their pleas but the Army's battles with the Legion were costly and ceaseless, so they could not spare soldiers to protect Outland. Instead &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to help the people of Outland and arrived with &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; became a strategic battlefront in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru used the mighty fortress of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; to reach the shattered land. However, when the naaru set out from their stronghold, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; quickly raided the dimensional fortress and assumed control over its satellite structures. Though most of the naaru had already left the fortress, the blood elves succeeded in capturing the sole remaining guardian of Tempest Keep, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and transported it back to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a power source for the blood elves. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; order.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, leading the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; and later apparently joined by other naaru including &lt;a href=\"V%27eru\"&gt;V'eru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"G%27eras\"&gt;G'eras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Xi%27ri\"&gt;Xi'ri&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, its presence managing to keep the Legion at bay, and &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; journeyed with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; upon the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, crash-landing with them on the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nShortly before the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, an elder naaru (Xe'ra) appeared to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and told him that he was destined to become a hero of the Light battling against the Void.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, using the concentration of Light from the naaru of Shattrath, and the shared benedictions from the faithful, the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Light&lt;/a&gt; created holy artifacts of profound power to strike down the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; was able to purify and reignite the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; using the dying spark of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, restoring it as a fount of arcane and holy power, and thereby beginning the rebirth of the soul of an entire nation.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; and two other naaru, &lt;a href=\"M%27ori\"&gt;M'ori&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"K%27uri\"&gt;K'uri&lt;/a&gt;, were able to purify &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Bridenbrad\"&gt;Crusader Bridenbrad&lt;/a&gt;'s soul from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption, guaranteeing him \"paradise eternal\" in his afterlife after promising that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; does not abandon its champions.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nThe Dark Star worshipped by the was in fact the fallen naaru, . The sacrificed his life to purify K'ara and return it to the Light.\nIn , drained of its power and transformed it into the &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Decimatus\"&gt;Decimatus&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the core of the naaru prime &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;, was sent to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by High Exarch Turalyon and crashed off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. It was to be brought to Velen aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, as the last naaru in the line of Xe'ra, was the only one with the ability to unlock the core, but the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Exodar and killed O'ros to prevent that from happening. Light's Heart was then stored within a &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Class Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping, and was finally unlocked using the Tears of Elune.\nXe'ra later started communing with the order leader through Light's Heart and revealed that she was searching for her prophecized \"child of Light and Shadow\" destined to bring an end to the age of demons: &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Xe'ra then taught the order leader the story of Illidan, and revealed at the end that the goal was, in fact, not to prepare Light's Heart but to prepare the class leader, for Xe'ra wept over the death of Illidan at the hands of the then-adventurer and in her eyes, the class leader needed to redeem their self.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, priests across Azeroth worked together to transform the &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saraka%20the%20Lighteater\"&gt;Saraka the Lighteater&lt;/a&gt; back into the naaru &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;, and succeeded.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, a disembodied Xe'ra was rescued aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\". Returning her to the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", she was made whole again as &lt;a href=\"%3ALight%27s%20Heart\"&gt;:Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt; was returned to her. She however died shortly after, slain by Illidan as she attempted to forcefully fill him with the Light. Xe'ra had mentioned &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; to the Army of the Light, but they had never seen it in person.\nUpon landing on &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;, Velen reminisced about the naaru named &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; who stayed behind to fend off the demons in order to allow the draenei to flee Argus, thousands of years ago. L'ura was captured and imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; on the order of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, where she would gradually turn into darkened naaru. She was eventually slain, and her Void absorbed by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; was killed at the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, she was brought to Saa'ra at Netherlight Temple and, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, she was revived as an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; infused with the Light.\nWhile only a handful of years had passed on Azeroth since the events of \"Warlords of Draenor\", in the alternate universe several decades had passed. In the initial years after the Burning Legion was pushed off the planet and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was killed, the draenei and orcs lived together in peace. Eventually, however, more naaru arrived on Draenor and the draenei became fanatical. Led by the , the draenei formed the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; and began spreading the Light to the orcs whether they wanted it or not; while some went willingly, others had the Light forced upon them. The Lightbound and their naaru masters waged a war against the resisting orcs in the name of bringing them together under the Light, and the Light Mother granted &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; a vision of the Lightbound becoming an Army of the Light that would spread the Light across the universe.\nShadowlands.\nTwo naaru are found within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Z%27rali\"&gt;Z'rali&lt;/a&gt; is imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Sanguine%20Depths\"&gt;Sanguine Depths&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, and the dark naaru &lt;a href=\"Ti%27or\"&gt;Ti'or&lt;/a&gt; is imprisoned as a fighter in the &lt;a href=\"Theater%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Theater of Pain&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;. Z'rali was kept captive until being freed by the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Court of Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;, a rebellion of &lt;a href=\"Venthyr\"&gt;Venthyr&lt;/a&gt; against their Sire. After she was freed Z'rali was moved to &lt;a href=\"Dawnkeep\"&gt;Dawnkeep&lt;/a&gt; in the Ember Ward. She cannot return to her home because the other naaru would only consider her tainted by the touch of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, and so she remains in Revendreth to ensure that the Light is felt there, that justice is rendered, and that Death is made to know its place.\nBiology.\nNaaru are composed of scintillating holy energies, from clouds of fractured Light gathered in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, that may freely move around a central \"core\". Their sentience core can be detached from their main body and seems to house their mind, soul-equivalent, and knowledge as shown with Xe'ra and her &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaaru may leave a \"spark\" when they die, as in the case of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;. Just like &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, Naaru can normally only be killed within the realm of the Light itself, as if they died in the mortal realm their essence returns to the Light to reconstitute, so it is necessary to go to the realm of Light to destroy them definitively. However, some exceptionally powerful forces can intervene in the process. But it takes a significant influence as it\u2019s not something that casually happens.\nIt is unknown whether or not the naaru have separate genders. &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xi%27ri\"&gt;Xi'ri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; have all been described using the pronoun \"he,\" and &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; are referred to as female. However, the pronoun \"it\" has also been used. It is possible that the naaru are genderless, given that \"gender\" only exists in races that engage in sexual reproduction, and it is unknown if naaru do, though &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; was stated to be part of Xe'ra's lineage which means they do reproduce somehow.\nDark naaru.\nNaaru can die, but if their physical form is damaged, it may bleed their energy causing them to enter a darkened state in which they are weakened and produce void energies, becoming dark naaru (Dark Naaru) or darkened naaru. A naaru's darkened state is different than death. Their energy may take up to one thousand years to regenerate. It should be noted that some darkened naaru still appear to harbor altruistic intentions; however, their weakened state may be exploited for nefarious purposes, such as creating void minions and raising the undead. It is unknown if this cycle occurs naturally without an external catalyst. Examples of darkened naaru are &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"K%27ara\"&gt;K'ara&lt;/a&gt;. Thrice, darkened naaru have also been shown to transform further into &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt;s; though in all known occasions this was only when their light was forcibly drained by an outside party, so it does not seem to be a natural phenomenon and is normally extremely rare. The &lt;a href=\"ethereal\"&gt;ethereal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Locus-Walker\"&gt;Locus-Walker&lt;/a&gt; noted that the few cases of naaru falling into Void he knew of had occurred when mortals were involved, which he thought carried fascinating implications.\nPowers and technology.\nThe dimensional fortress &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the draenei dimensional ship/city the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, are examples of naaru technology.\nThe naaru have advanced knowledge of magic and access to otherworldly materials and reagents that have not been seen in Azeroth. The Mechanar, for example, employs naaru technology to create &lt;a href=\"manacell\"&gt;manacell&lt;/a&gt;s, objects which provide great amounts of power. The Tempest Keep has \"automated\" defenses, the ability to fly, the ability to travel through other dimensions such as the Twisting Nether or the Great Dark Beyond, and the ability to teleport itself and anything in it. For example, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" was able to transcend dimensions and warp the fabric of &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; itself, and even a &lt;a href=\"Shard%20of%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Shard of the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; retains some of its temporal powers.\nThe power levels and resilience of individual naaru appear to vary significantly, although most appear to be largely immortal and typically channel the Light's holy energies for offensive, defensive and healing purposes. The naaru provided the &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Gift of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; to the entire &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; race, enabling them to periodically heal themselves and their allies, and are able to temporarily bolster entire groups of people, such as with &lt;a href=\"A%27dal%27s%20Song%20of%20Battle\"&gt;A'dal's Song of Battle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"K%27iru%27s%20Song%20of%20Victory\"&gt;K'iru's Song of Victory&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; described &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;'s power as sufficient to destroy entire cities and level mountains. According to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who stated he learned more from the naaru in five months than he did in all his years in the libraries of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, A'dal and his &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; were able to drive the Legion away from &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, and A'dal was possibly \"the most powerful being\" the adventurer would ever face. He and two other naaru were able to teleport themselves to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and prevent the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; from raising the soul of &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Bridenbrad\"&gt;Crusader Bridenbrad&lt;/a&gt; by sending it directly into the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, when others such as &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; were only able to delay his fate, and some of the naaru also appear to have immense &lt;a href=\"resurrection\"&gt;resurrection&lt;/a&gt; capabilities, such as the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Naaru\"&gt;Prime Naaru&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, or lingering remnants of M'uru's Light able to bring back a fallen blood elf. &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;, who appeared to have prophetic abilities, were able to together revive &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; as a Light-infused undead.\nFrom abroad the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; was able to make &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; \"an eternal protector of creation\", bestowing upon him &lt;a href=\"immortality\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt;, and helped &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; share her \"pure, infinite love\" for her son &lt;a href=\"Arator%20the%20Redeemer\"&gt;Arator&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, filling her heart with joy so intensely that it hurt as she watched him reaching out to her with his hand. &lt;a href=\"T%27uure\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt; sacrifice was able to banish &lt;a href=\"Dimensius%20the%20All-Devouring\"&gt;Dimensius the All-Devouring&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Karkora\"&gt;Karkora&lt;/a&gt;, even its shard became one of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Artifacts\"&gt;Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; of Light in existence as &lt;a href=\"T%27uure%2C%20Beacon%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, able to heal wounds physical and mental, and inspire hope in times of overwhelming darkness. &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;'s spark was capable of purifying and permanently restoring the tainted &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and was able to instantaneously annihilate most of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s naval fleet in the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Defense of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;, and provided the final and ultimate blessing for the Alliance commander's &lt;a href=\"legendary\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; ring.\nDespite being one of the oldest and strongest of the naaru, described as far more powerful than A'dal in their first encounter and even able to help Illidan escape from the clutches of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Xe'ra was easily destroyed by Illidan. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Annihilator\"&gt;Fel Annihilator&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, despite being completely healed by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Holy%20Chime\"&gt;Holy Chime&lt;/a&gt; is a reward from .\nSpeculation.\nSpeculation existed saying that they are somehow related to certain gods, such as &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. This was further backed up by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Goddess%20Watch%20Over%20You\"&gt;Goddess Watch Over You&lt;/a&gt; who believes that &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; was created by Elune. The first strong evidence came when Elune's Tear was used to successfully unlock Light's Heart, which Velen had stated could only be unlocked by a Naaru descended from Xe'ra.\nDark or Light?\nSome players have expressed suspicion of the perceived perfection and altruism of the naaru. Some believe that the naaru have ulterior motives, or there is an undiscovered faction of \"dark\" naaru. \nAs &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; himself says,\n\"It is a facet of the naaru condition - without the void, the Light cannot exist.\"\nThis could be taken to mean that if these naaru are pure light and good, then there must be a polar opposite - that is, naaru or another race who are as much darkness and evil as the ones we have encountered so far are good and pure. After many years, in \"\", such a race was revealed to have been known to us all along: the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; were actually creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and the twilight magic they wielded was the polar opposite to the Light. \"Chronicle\" have also revealed the dualistic nature of the Void and Light: the universe was created through the conflict of these two forces, and indeed they are defined by their opposition to each other.\nM'uru, now a darkened naaru, is a boss in &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. It is not clear if he is now \"evil\" or simply a darkened naaru whose weakened state has been exploited by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;. After the raid gets him to 0%, he transforms into a &lt;a href=\"void%20god\"&gt;void god&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Entropius\"&gt;Entropius&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe confusion was later addressed by Blizzard.\nSince this time, the game's writing has somewhat contradicted the claim, as the alternate Velen described K'ara's darkened state as a 'stage' of the naaru life-cycle, suggesting that it is indeed a natural part of their life, and not an unnatural rarity as implied in the above Q&amp;A. Dark Naaru are also shown to be capable of returning to the Light; K'ure was nearly at the end of this process when last seen, and the alternate K'ara had the process accelerated to completion by the alternate Velen. A different take is that naaru do naturally, and regularly by their timescale, fall into a darkened state in a manner similar to a phoenix becoming an egg and return to the Light after a time. Injury can exacerbate the darkened state, requiring more time to return to the Light.\nIn relation to Ashbringer.\nSpeculation exists that &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; was crafted from part of a naaru, or is at least somehow related to the naaru.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Masters of sorcery, the naga were formerly &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, members of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s court during the age of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; caused by the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, they were transformed into naga by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; after Azshara pledged herself to his cause, dedicating her people to become his army and recreate the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth. Since their transformation, they haunted the &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth, building &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar%20Empire\"&gt;a great civilization&lt;/a&gt; on the ocean floor in the name of their queen.\nThey have since stayed out of major world affairs for over 10,000 years, until the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when they have been rising up to the surface for nefarious purposes. An expedition led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; notably answered the call of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, they joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; to confront the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, in order to further the plans of their dark masters. Many tribes of naga also appeared to invade the coasts and beaches of all continents, beginning a campaign against the land dwellers. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, N'Zoth ordered the naga to go to war against &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; of water, in order to become the masters of the seas.\nHistory.\nBirth of the naga.\nOver 10,000 years ago, &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was the domain of the large &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. She ruled from the capital city of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; with her loyal followers known as the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; who were the highest-ranking caste of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; nobility. These privileged nobles became obsessed with the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and abused its &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s until their activities caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the dark &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;. He promised the Highborne that he would remake the planet &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into a paradise, and that they would be rewarded with great power for serving him. At Sargeras' command, the Highborne created a portal in the Well in the hope that Sargeras would be able to enter Azeroth himself. The Highborne's efforts brought about the first invasion of the Burning Legion, but the ensuing &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; seemed to do the opposite of what Sargeras had promised. Demons poured from the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;queen's jeweled palace&lt;/a&gt; and laid waste to most of the city. Death and devastation followed the demonic army as it spread outward. The other night elves, together with many unlikely allies rallied in the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, put up a surprising defense, and managed to close the portal. This added magical stress was too great for the Well of Eternity, which imploded with disastrous consequences. As if struck by a giant hammer, the Well was driven downwards by the impact and collapsed in on itself until it was finally obliterated, &lt;a href=\"Rift%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;piercing&lt;/a&gt; the planet's molten core, and creating the raging &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the destruction wrought by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Azshara and her Highborne loyalists were gathered at her palace in Zin-Azshari. As the waters swallowed them into fathomless depths of the Maelstrom, Azshara's quick thinking saved them: she managed to make a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, swearing allegiance to it in order to survive. As soon as she agreed, Azshara became the first naga - a cursed and irrevocably warped scaly, serptentine, water-breathing creature. Her loyal servants transformed with her. The naga hearts became as black as the deepest ocean trenches, and hate enveloped their thoughts.\nOne of the most powerful among these twisted abominations was the queen's former handmaiden, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. Hidden from the world, Azshara, Vashj and her servants would quietly build the naga capital of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; and their new empire in the cold darkness at the bottom of the sea, beneath the swirling waters of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara herself expanded with hate and rage, becoming a massive monstrosity, reflecting the wickedness and malice that had always hidden within her core. With patience and cunning, they expanded their dominion over the oceans. They would rebuild their power and it would take over ten thousand years before the naga would reveal their existence to the surface world.\nTransformed into the monstrous naga, the former night elves found they were able to survive the ocean's depths. Even so, the naga knew they had little chance of reclaiming the lands that the Highborne had once dominated. Bitterly resentful at their enforced banishment to the sea, they resolved to bide their time until they could retake their rightful place in the surface world.\nCenturies before the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; a group of naga led by &lt;a href=\"Summoner%20Mepjila\"&gt;Summoner Mepjila&lt;/a&gt; would attack the temple of the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt; and slaughter his followers.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of dead naga was found by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nThe naga resurfaced in the time around the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. One of the \ufb01rst sightings of naga took place when &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; rescued the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20troll\"&gt;Darkspear troll&lt;/a&gt;s from a tribe of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s on a stormswept &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;isle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. The murlocs worshiped a creature they called &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Zar%27jira\"&gt;Zar'jira&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; contacted &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who was on Azeroth. Although Illidan had worked against the Legion's interests in the past, Kil'jaeden was willing to give Illidan another chance. If Illidan destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden promised to grant anything Illidan might desire. Accordingly, Illidan sought out new allies. He cast a powerful spell that reached the depths of the ocean, and a group of naga led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; responded, calling in some old &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; debts. One and all, they pledged themselves to Illidan. The naga did not come because of the history they shared with the former night elf, nor did they respect his demonic power. They came because the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s willed it and they sent them to make sure his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; succeeded so that it could spark a new war on Azeroth. If the former night elf became troublesome, they could simply command the naga to cut out his fel-corrupted heart. Their first act of loyalty was to facilitate Illidan's escape from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and bring him to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nLady Vashj bolstered her ranks with &lt;a href=\"snap%20dragon\"&gt;snap dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, and assisted Illidan with his mission on the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. They later took control of the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, so that Illidan could perform his ritual with to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and were in consequence pursued by the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, they managed to capture surviving &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; whom they locked up in the prisons of the ruined city, among them was &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, prince of the newly-dubbed &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, encountered &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, who offered her help to battle the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas agreed, but when the blood elves' human commander, &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, discovered this alliance, he denounced the blood elves. He believed naga were vile and inhuman, and the blood elves must also be treacherous for consorting with them. Garithos imprisoned Kael'thas and the rest of the blood elves and sentenced them to death. Before he could carry out this sentence, Lady Vashj helped them to escape. The two forces fought together and eventually joined &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother group of naga led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Darkscale\"&gt;Lady Darkscale&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; and while many were killed the Darkscale took prisoners for an unknown reason. Soon afterward, Lady Darkscale, &lt;a href=\"Scilla%20Murkshadow\"&gt;Scilla Murkshadow&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of their naga forces were slain by the combined might of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who were trying to find any survivor of the attack in order to determine what human force was attacking &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMore recently naga have begun to reappear around the coasts of the world, creating settlements on land, most noticeably in the ruins of their old cities in the region of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. It seems as though they are now followers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, as they have made alliances with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult and the corrupted &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s. They have claimed several stretches of coast on both continents, for example in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. They have significant numbers and pose a serious threat to anyone standing in their way.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Outland tribes&lt;/a&gt; of naga have begun draining the water of the &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; lakes and marshes with steam pumps. The pumps are all connected through underground drains to &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt;, where Vashj and her underlings reside, turning &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Lake\"&gt;Serpent Lake&lt;/a&gt; into a giant water sink for the rest of Zangarmarsh. Due to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling, the naga operating the steam vaults end up at war with the druids, at the orders of Lady Vashj. The plan was to take control of all the waters of Outland, and through them, its people. The sea witch was later killed and her forces defeated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s on behalf of the Cenarion Expedition.\nNaga attack at the coasts of the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Riplash\"&gt;Riplash&lt;/a&gt; naga had a fort in the &lt;a href=\"Riplash%20Ruins\"&gt;Riplash Ruins&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. From here, they were making ominous attempts at melting the polar ice caps in order to flood the world and create an entirely underwater empire for their revered empress, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. However, their plans did not come to fruition, as the simple greed of the &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s brought the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; to Northrend's shores, after they stole artifacts from a vrykul burial ground and disturbed the &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s of the dead. One of those kvaldir clans, the &lt;a href=\"Skadir\"&gt;Skadir&lt;/a&gt;, brought their longships to shore at the Riplash ruins, wiped out the naga (leaving only &lt;a href=\"Veehja\"&gt;Veehja&lt;/a&gt;), and took the ruins for themselves. They also began sacrificing the naga to awaken &lt;a href=\"Leviroth\"&gt;Leviroth&lt;/a&gt;, condemning their spirits not to know peace. When they ran out of naga, they began to take &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;.\nPearl of Pandaria.\nA &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt; who looks like (though is not stated to be) &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt;, ordered &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; to find the continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, believing it holds the future of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. However, Zhahara herself was obsessed with finding the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. To aid her, Zhahara enlisted the help of &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rumblefitz\"&gt;Rumblefitz&lt;/a&gt;. Zhahara's machination to obtain the Pearl of Pandaria led her into conflict with &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; which ended in Zhahara's demise.\nCataclysm.\nWhile the naga of &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; were loyal to &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, the naga ultimately report directly to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Azshara appeared in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; as a sea witch. Her master, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, commanded her to take the seas, both for revenge against &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt; for defying him and so that they could splinter the world's nations into isolated enclaves by halting sea travel.\nWhile exploring the &lt;a href=\"Naz%27jar%20Battlemaiden\"&gt;Naz'jar Battlemaiden&lt;/a&gt; quests in &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;, the nature of &lt;a href=\"Lestharia%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj's mother&lt;/a&gt; and her former stronghold were discovered, and above all the naga executed their plan to usurp &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;'s control of the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Neptulon was abducted by &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt; following the events of the naga invasion, and this abduction leaves the Abyssal Maw leaderless and Azshara very well placed as one of the most potent forces in Azeroth's oceans and perhaps beyond.\nLegion.\nThe remnants of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20Naga\"&gt;Illidan's Naga&lt;/a&gt; are led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20S%27theno\"&gt;Lady S'theno&lt;/a&gt; aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Queen Azshara sent a force led by &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Athissa\"&gt;Tidemistress Athissa&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. Azshara herself appeared before &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt; when Farondis tried to save an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; captured by the naga, she tried to convince him to kneel before her but Farondis fought Azshara off. The naga at the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Eye of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; summoned a creature known as the &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Wrath of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; after retrieving the Tidestone of Golganneth.\nNaga at &lt;a href=\"Azuregale%20Bay\"&gt;Azuregale Bay&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; were enslaving &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"merciless%20one\"&gt;merciless one&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegionfall.\nThe naga and sea giants at &lt;a href=\"Felrage%20Strand\"&gt;Felrage Strand&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; were corrupted by &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; and shared their encampment with members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, while enslaving soldiers from the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. Their leader &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ssathara\"&gt;Lady Ssathara&lt;/a&gt; made a pact with the demons and her followers went willingly, but unaware of the price they must pay. Despite the apparent oddity of naga serving the demons when Azshara and N'Zoth are opposed to the Legion, there are different groups of naga with different motivations, just like humans. Ssathara said that the demons provided greater power than Azshara could.\nMore naga were present in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Harjatan\"&gt;Harjatan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20Sassz%27ine\"&gt;Mistress Sassz'ine&lt;/a&gt;. They entered the tomb to secure the Tidestone of Golganneth from the adventurers, on Azshara's orders.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the naga were attacking the coastlines of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; they summoned the &lt;a href=\"Pride%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Pride of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; to destroy a levee. In &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, they were draining &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt;'s frog children to sate their magic addiction, attacking Horde forces at &lt;a href=\"Naz%27agal\"&gt;Naz'agal&lt;/a&gt;, and gathering &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; relics on the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Span\"&gt;Sundered Span&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; they seeked an ancient power at &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Gral\"&gt;Atal'Gral&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dreadpearl%20Shallows\"&gt;Dreadpearl Shallows&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; they were battling the &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s in the north.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the naga attacked both the Alliance and Horde on shores across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. After which both the Alliance and Horde investigated the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Crucible of Storms&lt;/a&gt;. The naga also had &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt; on their side, teaching them how to craft powerful &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons.\nThey dragged prisoners to &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance and Horde followed, when the sea parted by the use of the Tidestone of Golganneth, the local enemies of the naga allied with the Alliance and Horde. Queen Azshara served as the final boss of the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt; raid in Nazjatar.\nCulture.\nNaga are divided into castes, such as the warrior caste.\nNaga refer to land-dwelling races with various derogatory terms, including \"landwalker\", \"landling\", \"warmblood\", and \"softskin\".\nCustoms.\n&lt;a href=\"Turtle\"&gt;Turtle&lt;/a&gt;s are feared by the naga, who consider them bad luck and give them a wide berth on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nFaith.\nThe naga revere &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Skar%27this%20the%20Heretic\"&gt;Skar'this the Heretic&lt;/a&gt; instead worships the naga's enemy, &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;, something which he was imprisoned for. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodwash%20naga\"&gt;Bloodwash naga&lt;/a&gt; formerly worshipped Neptulon and lived in relative peace with the nearby &lt;a href=\"Rockpool%20tribe\"&gt;Rockpool&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, but recently the Bloodwash turned their back on him, choosing only to worship Azshara. They have littered their settlements with likenesses of Azshara carved out of seastone. They have also erected altars where they worship their god.\nCharacteristics and abilities.\nIn general, naga are scaled humanoids with the lower bodies of large serpents. Naga can breathe water or air, and some naga have recently emerged from the ocean's depths. Yet most naga have continued to dwell in the ocean's depths, beneath the site of the original &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs former &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, the naga's past abuse of the Well has not been without additional consequences. The Highborne were obsessed with the Well, and the naga have been exposed to the Well's residual magics for millennia. Consequently modern naga are &lt;a href=\"Magical%20addiction\"&gt;addicted&lt;/a&gt; to magic.\nNaga tend to be long-lived, much like the night elves, blood elves, and high elves. Some naga have even gained &lt;a href=\"immortality\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt; as part of their mutations. However, most immortal naga are women rather than men. Naga women are tall and slender, with fine scales and angular features, and often have at least four arms, though not all do. For some reason naga women have proven better than naga men at maintaining pre-&lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; memories and personalities. As a result, naga women are intellectually and magically superior to their male counterparts, and naga society is matriarchal. While males are more suited for melee combat, female naga are incredible sorcerers, commanding the power of water and ice at their fingertips.\nBigger and physically stronger than naga women, naga men are relatively bestial in appearance. A male naga's head resembles that of a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and he has a muscular humanoid torso. The scales that cover his body are larger and thicker than those that cover the body of a naga woman. &lt;a href=\"Naga%20lord\"&gt;Naga lord&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Naj%27entus\"&gt;High Warlord Naj'entus&lt;/a&gt; have stony arms and shells fused to their skin. This may be resultant of their mutations, or they may be a different subspecies altogether.\nAs naga, they no longer much resembled elves of any sort. The females have some vague similarities remaining, mostly in their slimmer, upper torsos and their faces, which retained the long, narrow design of night elves. Their arms ended in long, taloned fingers. The males had degenerated even more than the females, their heads low and reptilian, with teeth that jutted out from both the top and bottom of the long maw like a crocodile. Their eyes were deep set and narrow, and their crests and fins, which jutted as sharply as spears in places, were of a darker gold and brown shade. Their torsos were less in contrast to their serpentine lower bodies, being also scaled and segmented. Even their arms, massive compared to most creatures their size, were covered so.\nNaga biology includes an air bladder that helps with buoyancy while swimming. These bladders are used as part of an old tonic by &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; fishermen to move easily underwater.\nNaga wield scimitars and tridents.\nIt is often whispered in dark corners of naga hide \u2014 a material so fine, so exquisite to the touch that &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of sophisticated taste will spend any amount of moolah to get their hands on some. Their hides are described as being \"rubbery\" and somehow feeling artificial. Naga can shed their skin.\nReproduction.\nNaga hatch from eggs, which are somewhat translucent, with a single embryo visible within. Naga hatchlings inherit the curse of the naga and appear as small naga. Naga hatchlings like pool toys. &lt;a href=\"Spawning%20Grounds\"&gt;Spawning grounds&lt;/a&gt; such as the &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27elan%20Spawning%20Pool\"&gt;Vashj'elan Spawning Pool&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Hatchery%20%28Eternal%20Palace%29\"&gt;Hatchery&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt; are heavily protected.\nIn the RPG.\nNaga history.\nThe catastrophe known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; split the land apart to become the continents and islands as we now know them. Thousands perished, and the kaldorei lands were devastated. The Burning Legion was banished. The land around the destroyed Well of Eternity and most of Zin-Azshari blasted downward, to the bottom of the inrushing seas, to smash into the ocean \ufb02oor.\nThe Maelstrom formed above the ocean at this location, creating lasting testament to its history. The Maelstrom exists to this day. It is a large and violent magical storm that rages over the ocean. The Maelstrom whips the sea beneath it into an enormous whirlpool, the center of which is called the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Once caught in the whirlpool's currents, most creatures have no chance of escaping. Furthermore, under the waves is an impassable whirling wall of water surrounding the Eye.\nMany night elves, including Azshara, sank to the seafloor with their city. These Highborne survived. They were cursed and became the naga \u2014 serpentlike, water-breathing monstrosities. Their men and women diverged in appearance, physicality, and mindset. They lived at the bottom of the ocean, beneath the Maelstrom, for 10,000 years. Yet they did more than survive. The imploded Well of Eternity left behind residual energies, which twisted in the ocean depths near the naga's city. Over ten millennia these energies mutated the fallen Highborne, altering them even further to suit their new environment. The naga recast ruined Zin-Azshari into a new capital: Nazjatar. Ruling the naga was Azshara, now mutated into a terrible demigod.\nOver the time the naga likely tamed some native creatures (like &lt;a href=\"snap%20dragon\"&gt;snap dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt;s to use in warfare, studied arcane magic and clashed with the &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, whose capital &lt;a href=\"Mak%27aru\"&gt;Mak'aru&lt;/a&gt; is in the same neighborhood.\nNaga are sinister, ophidian humanoids that dwell beneath the ocean. Theirs is an ancient and mystical culture, for ten thousand years ago they were &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; who mutated into vengeful humanoid sea serpents. While many remain on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to attempt to reclaim the surface world, a large group followed the power-mad betrayer, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to claim the watery areas of the shattered land. In addition to their natural longevity, a number of naga develop mutations that increase their life spans even further. Some are immortal.\nAppearance.\nNaga only marginally resemble the noble race they once were. Their proud kaldorei visages are warped and twisted. Naga are avaricious and sadistic, and their millennia of aquatic banishment has only intensified their evil, power-hungry nature. The naga are part night elf, part serpent, and some have evolved bizarre oceanic mutations. The Well of Eternity's residual energies are unpredictable, and their mutative power manifests in different ways. In all naga, many of these mutations are simply cosmetic \u2014 soft spines running down their backs, or extra fins adorning their arms, for instance. Some naga, though, also possess mutations that have a more substantial effect. In this way, the race has developed an array of genetic variations and defenses, such as ink jets, tentacles, razor fins, venomous fangs, hardened barnacle carapaces and spined fists. Naga average 6 1/2 feet tall, and naga men are much bulkier than women.\nSexual dimorphism.\nThe most striking aspect of naga culture is the role that gender plays in their lives. Due to the ancient curse that transformed them into naga, males and females are physically and mentally different, and this difference affects their culture. The men are thickly built, with humanoid torsos merging into a serpent hind section. Their scales are large and thick, and their heads are reminiscent of dragons, showing little sign of their elven ancestry.\nNaga men are bestial and considered less intelligent than females, but are remarkably strong and tough, able to withstand a great deal of bodily injury. Naga women more resemble the kaldorei from whom they came, their faces fair, even beautiful. This unearthly splendor is ruined by their monstrous deformities \u2014 they often have multiple limbs (four to six arms). Females kept more of their Elven features and their intelligence.\nBecause of these traits, naga society is matriarchal. Naga see women as superior to men. Naga men don't chafe under these conditions; rather, they are happy to serve their beautiful (for naga) mistresses. While exceptions exist, naga men perform tasks requiring physical strength and stamina, while naga women take up intellectual pursuits. Naga women are natural spellcasters and rely on magic and poison to defeat their enemies. Men mine stone and coral for building, for example, while women draw the blueprints and create the strangely delicate frescoes that adorn Nazjatar's buildings. In military matters, men are warriors and guards, while women are generals and magi. &lt;a href=\"Myrmidon\"&gt;Naga Myrmidon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Naga%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;, for instance, are strong males and powerful melee fighters Some exceptions do exist, and male naga commanders are not completely unknown.\nUnique features.\nSome naga have unique features. For example, &lt;a href=\"Naga%20sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witches&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; have snakes instead of hair. Female naga with a nest of thin, twining snakes instead of hair allow the naga to see in all directions.\nA &lt;a href=\"naga%20anomaly\"&gt;naga anomaly&lt;/a&gt; is a naga that has mutated greater changes, some are barely recognizable as related to their cousins.\nCulture.\nSociety.\nAll naga revere their queen, the mighty Azshara. They have never had another queen, and Azshara has become a living &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; for the naga. Everything they do is according to her design \u2014 and she has had ten millennia to re\ufb01ne her plans. The civilization of the naga has extensive codes, laws, and ceremonies. Factions, some millennia old, work continuously in bids for power, seeking the blessings of their queen. She plots her revenge on the night elves, biding her time until the growing might of the naga can be brought to bear.\nNaga have finely worked robes that function as leather armor. They hunt large prey with tridents and scimitars. They are experienced in formation fighting, particularly in dealings with &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mur%27gul\"&gt;mur'gul&lt;/a&gt;. A warband will deploy male infantry to engage at moderate range with tridents, while the females cast spells. The men are willing to sacrifice themselves if ordered. Leaders will avoid heavy losses, but are otherwise open to small risks.\nFaith.\nOver the eons, queen Azshara, the most powerful arcanist of the ancient world, has grown in power and magni\ufb01cence. To the naga, she is a living demigod, and they venerate her. Her presence in Nazjatar is a powerful motivating force for the naga, and in their minds Azshara, Nazjatar, and the naga are inextricably linked \u2014 perhaps the same thing, in a way. Naga pay homage to their heritage and their queen. The beings they once worshipped as kaldorei \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are nothing but memories.\nLanguages.\nNaga typically speak their own language, &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt;, and most know &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. For various reasons, individual naga learn to speak with the creatures with which they interact. Some also learn the language of their heritage, &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaga relations.\nNaga are dangerous and avaricious, and most races are unaware of their existence. Naga play well with blood elves, trolls, and other dark, independent powers, but only the rarest naga joins the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe naga traveling with Illidan have a more educated view of Kalimdor's races than the naga who remained at the bottom of the sea or in one of the eastern outposts. These travelers hold the blood elves in high regard, as they are also evolved children of the Highborne, and they too fought with Illidan. The time spent together in battle made the two races respect and admire each other's skills.\nThe naga can either take or leave the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, creatures who care nothing for their own pasts. The &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; don't trust the naga, and the naga feel the same way in return. They feel that &lt;a href=\"divine\"&gt;divine&lt;/a&gt; magic practitioners are weak and without ambition. The naga are a neutral race for a very good reason: neither the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; nor the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; will welcome them. The Alliance elicits nothing but rage in the minds of the naga. Their former brethren, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, still thrive on the continent, and have not forgotten their grudges with the naga. Their blatant hatred of the night elves is only rivaled by the night elves' feelings for them. As night elf leaders &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; are highly respected within the Alliance, their hatred and distrust of the naga have spread to the other races. The races of the Horde are met with derisiveness from the naga; they would have no part of the Horde even if invited to join. The spiritual natures of these races are similar to the pandaren and furbolgs, and therefore worthy of similar disrespect. The naga consider the Horde to be nothing more than barbaric, weak-minded fools. They would sooner accept the night elves as masters than join the Horde. Even though the blood elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; are members of the Horde, there is no sign of diplomacy between the two powers; in addition to naga opinions, the Azerothian blood elves do not unilaterally accept the philosophy that Kael has adopted, and likely wish to avoid association with the naga. The naga seem to be hated by the Horde as they've assaulted their newfound friends, the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;. The naga's main rival for dominance of the ocean are &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;; these creatures hate naga and slay them on sight.\nNaga are dark creatures, evil and cunning. A naga might join forces with a being of another race in order to serve his own ends, however, much as Lady Vashj did with Illidan and his forces. Naga are selfish creatures, though, and think only of their own (and their race's) dominance. Their minds have little room for charity or kindness. A naga that renounced his evil ways would be a unique individual indeed. Some naga may be sent to the land on a mission, or they may be exiled who defy the naga queen. Few among the humanoid races are aware of the naga's history, so most encounters deal primarily with their strange countenance. Naga characters can use disguise or magic to avoid notice. Naga heroes are usually limited to a few mutations. Far from the power of Nazjatar, the powers of the flesh are less likely to be awakened in this way.\nCombat.\nThe naga have armies composed of various races. They have managed to enslave large numbers of &lt;a href=\"mur%27gul\"&gt;mur'gul&lt;/a&gt;; this aquatic race fears the naga's magical abilities. Mur'gul slaves are used as staging troops and cannon fodder, with artillery support from mighty &lt;a href=\"dragon%20turtle\"&gt;dragon turtle&lt;/a&gt;s. Naga males serve as shock troops; they deploy as infantry in close formations wielding scimitars, tridents, and nets while females stand back hurling spells at the enemy. Some few are &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20tides\"&gt;priestesses of the tides&lt;/a&gt;. Naga women act as both a source of support magic for their allies and as offensive ranged punishers. Males may have command over small numbers of troops but females will always be in overall command of any naga force. &lt;a href=\"Naga%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Naga Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;s, as their name implies, serve as protection for important individuals. Naga &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt;es are some of the most powerful champions the race has to offer. &lt;a href=\"Naga%20siren\"&gt;Siren&lt;/a&gt;s are more common but still deadly, using their magic to incapacitate foes so the naga &lt;a href=\"myrmidon\"&gt;myrmidon&lt;/a&gt;s can sweep in and finish them off.\nThe naga have a powerful military, though they have yet to truly make their presence felt in the world. So far, their efforts are limited to certain select engagements (such as against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during Illidan's attempt on the Frozen Throne) and various exploratory missions along Azeroth's coasts and other remote places. Rumors say that the naga are preparing for a major invasion of the land; they are now building their forces, securing strategic locations, claiming important items and information, and probing the defenses of the Alliance, Horde, Scourge, and their numerous other rivals. Whispers say that Azshara seeks to regain her position as queen of the land.\nNaga society is ancient and cunning, and their warriors are the same way. All naga enjoy using their aquatic natures against their foes, particularly against generals who have not fought naga. A naga commander attempts to maneuver his forces to meet the enemy on a battlefield with rivers, lakes, marshes or similar features; such bodies of water are no impediment to naga, but serve as barriers for land-based forces as well as hiding spots and roads for the naga forces.\nAs far as anyone knows, the only real naga armies that currently exist are beneath the waves, in Nazjatar and Vashj'ir, and in Outland, where a force of naga under Lady Vashj worked with Illidan until its defeat. Other, smaller groups are scattered across the world, where they investigate items and places of importance to the naga's mysterious purposes. These forces usually have a single leader \u2014 a powerful spellcaster (female) or warrior (male) \u2014 a dozen or so naga myrmidons, and a few naga sirens. They may have some mur'gul slaves to serve as expendable troops and do the dirty work, and some groups include a couple of &lt;a href=\"snap%20dragon\"&gt;snap dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"couatl\"&gt;couatl&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"tidal%20guardian\"&gt;tidal guardian&lt;/a&gt;s as support, depending on the nature of the mission. In addition to these groups, naga explorers travel out from the coasts and from naga bases, gathering information for their queen.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

These scaly denizens of the ocean have often been associated with the coming of prodigious storms, but few have actually seen them rise from the sea and lived to tell the tale.\nAttacks land and air units.\nHero names.\nAnna Kondra, &lt;a href=\"Scilla%20Murkshadow\"&gt;Scilla Murkshadow&lt;/a&gt;, Ursula Snakemane, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Venomtongue\"&gt;Lady Venomtongue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Serpentra\"&gt;Lady Serpentra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Darkscale\"&gt;Lady Darkscale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serena%20Scarscale\"&gt;Serena Scarscale&lt;/a&gt;, Asprah Serpus, &lt;a href=\"Venna%20Seastorm\"&gt;Venna Seastorm&lt;/a&gt;, Charib'dishal.\nInformation.\nThe Naga Sea Witch is an exceptionally powerful Neutral Hero. While she isn't a great melee fighter, the Sea Witch is useful for ranged assaults and staying back behind the melee units in battle. The Sea Witch is a great Hero and unit killer, mainly because of her Frost Arrows' slow effect, which prevents enemies from fleeing from battles as easily. By the time the other player realizes their hero is almost dead, it will be too late and they'll be too slow to run away. The Sea Witch is also great at delivering high damage to enemy Heroes or clumped units with her Forked Lightning skill. She should target one of the most powerful enemies first, to make sure it is hit by the lightning. She becomes even more effective for combat with the Mana Shield. Basically, the Sea Witch uses mana as hit points with this ability, allowing her Intelligence to act for her instead of Strength. With it, she can become at least partially decent for melee combat. Once the Sea Witch gets to level 6, she can effectively destroy enemy buildings with her Tornado skill. It can be stopped with a number of enemy spells, but most players won't act in time to stop the Naga from using her Tornado with maximum efficiency.\nSome good ideas for use of the Sea Witch's skill points, are the following: First try placing points in Forked Lightning for a good basic spell, followed by Frost Arrows or Mana Shield if you plan on having fewer damage absorbing units. You may find Mana Shield less useful in team games, because your allies will probably have at least one warrior Hero for damage absorption. You can also try to max out Frost Arrows for anti-hero uses. The benefit of this is that if you have your army still intact, the Sea Witch can chase the enemy hero and slow it while the rest of your forces catch up and surround it. The Naga Sea Witch is usually a good second Hero choice. Her Forked Lightning can instantly give a fair amount of damage to 3 enemy units, but Frost Arrows is also a good first support spell. Picking the Sea Witch first can, however, give certain advantages, as Frost Arrows makes her a good hero killer, and Mana Shield increases her life in a way. These spells can also be used to prevent enemies from doing as much to her as normal. If you see a fast hero or unit coming at your Naga, shoot it once with Frost Arrows and run away. The distance you cover just after that might be enough to get your Naga to safety.\nGive the Sea Witch speed boosting items such as Gloves of Haste and Boots of Speed that add to her quickness in and out of combat. When you want to cast Forked Lightning or Tornado, turn off Frost Arrows because they drain a lot of mana. This will often keep you from being able to cast Forked Lightning or Tornado, and can leave you in a tough spot.\nSpells and abilities.\norked Lightning.\nMake sure you are close enough to three units when casting Forked Lightning. Unlike Chain Lightning, the Naga must be within range for all three targets.\nFost Arrows (Autocast).\nThis ability is very useful for preventing enemy units or Heroes from running away. Combine with Forked Lightning to kill units that try to escape. Switch targets after firing to slow down multiple units at once.\nBecause it takes up a lot of her valuable mana, you may want to toggle Frost Arrows off during minor battles and have the Naga attack several different targets in large battles.\nMaa Shield.\nThis ability is useful to prevent the Naga Sea Witch from dying. If the enemy targets her, turn on Mana Shield. Be sure to turn it off when she is no longer under attack. You can use Mana Potions to keep the shield up longer.\nBefore you load up on mana potions to feed your mana shield, remember that until you have level 3 mana shield, Health Potions provide more damage recovery for your gold.\nornado (Ultimate).\nTornado does extreme damage to nearby buildings, light damage to buildings in the general vicinity, slows units by a large amount, and tosses nearby units and Heroes up into the air randomly. If you put a Tornado between two buildings, you can get a large damage rate split between them. Tornado is \"siege for free\" in that you can generally kill all of their towers with it.\nTornado brings units to minimum speed unless they are speed 350 or faster. There are only 2 or 3 such units in the game. Tornado also slows air units, unlike Earthquake.\nThe Tornado slow area is 60 (600 in-game). Tornado tosses units every 3 seconds in a 27.5 radius, and the toss lasts for 12 (6) seconds. Tornado cyclones a particular unit once every 22 seconds.\nThe Tornado's speed is 75. That means that Tornado more or less disables 4 units continuously. It can also toss Heroes and break channel spells potentially.\nTornado Counters\nThis spell must be maintained to get the full effect. If the Naga Sea Witch moves, the spell will not do its full damage. Force the Naga Sea Witch to move from her location. This will stop the Tornado."}

Once beautiful &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, a curse warped them into the naga. As they were permanently altered, so was the world \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; imploded and brought the surrounding land crashing to the seafloor. While the Well was destroyed, its power was not \u2014 it left behind residual energies that wrought changes on the newly-born naga. The mutations these energies bring do not manifest the same way in all naga; while they share many characteristics, each naga develops different mutations. Often these mutations are cosmetic: A naga might have soft spines sprouting from his shoulders or swirls of indigo in his skin. In some naga, the mutations prove useful: Some grow to monstrous size, while others are infused with spellcasting power. These mutations are fairly common among naga \u2014 indeed, many naga women are born with four arms.\nIn some naga, the residual power wreaks even greater changes. Some naga are barely recognizable as related to their cousins. They may grow enormous, unable to enter normal naga buildings. Often their powers are reminiscent of the sea creatures with which they dwell: Some sprout squidlike tentacles and can foil their enemies with clouds of ink; others develop urchinlike spines tipped with deadly poison. These are naga anomalies, and are some of the strangest creatures in a strange race.\nFew anomalies are alike; and as they grow and develop their powers, they diverge even more. Occasionally, their mutations prove fatal for them, but more often they prove fatal for their enemies. The arcane energy in the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; magnifies existing traits and grants additional powers that play to a creature\u2019s strengths or minimize its weaknesses; it doesn\u2019t often kill those close to it.\nNaga anomalies in the world.\nObviously, all naga anomalies are naga. Most feel a closer tie to naga culture and their queen &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; than other naga, seeing their mutations as proof that the naga are indeed destined to be the dominant race on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They serve willingly and well, and often their mutations provide unpredictable abilities that prove useful for far-flung missions or surprising the enemy on the battlefield. \nA naga anomaly\u2019s exact role varies by his mutations. Some excel at soaking up damage in the front lines, absorbing the enemy\u2019s attention to protect their more fragile compatriots. Others crush opponents with brute strength or a variety of natural weaponry. Some move with surpassing speed, striking and darting like piranhas that tear out throats and eviscerate torsos.\nThe naga\u2019s enemies fear naga anomalies, for they are wild cards \u2014 their allies know their capabilities, but their enemies rarely do. An enterprising member of the Explorers\u2019 League \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Hugh%20Deepstone\"&gt;Hugh Deepstone&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 specializes in strange and exotic creatures. The naga intrigue him especially, as they are all mutants, and naga anomalies hold great interest for him. Hugh started a catalogue of known naga anomalies, in order to keep track of their capabilities and share this information with the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;. No one has seen Hugh for several months, however, and the last anyone heard, his catalogue was up to three listings.\nOther naga feel positively toward anomalies. They also see them as signs of the naga's destiny \u2014 as the great mutations continue, perhaps one day all naga will be excellent at everything, becoming the perfect species. Naga anomalies are also useful allies, no matter what their abilities."}

Naga women are their race\u2019s spellcasters, and over the millennia they have developed a number of talents and techniques related to their art. Through intense study they learn to expand their repertoires to include other, unrelated spells. Their spells strike with the fury of the sea, whipping and crushing their opponents. Naga magi receive some military training as well.\nThey can speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Nerglish&lt;/a&gt;.\nMyth.\nThe Sirens were Greek demonesses who were birds with the heads of women (similar to the &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt;) granted with the power of illusion. In Spanish, \"sirena\" also refers to mermaids, who are much more similar to the naga siren (this reflects the Renaissance artistic tradition of painting the Sirens as Mermaids). They tempted sailors into drowning themselves or becoming their next meals. The most famous encounter with them is recorded in Homer's \"The Odyssey.\""}

Named for their leader, &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunreavers sought to have their people readmitted as members of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, a plight they were successful in. They also joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunreavers were eventually &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;expelled&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; some time after &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; came into power, and those remaining returned to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance equivalent of the Sunreavers is the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing their return to Quel'Thalas, Aethas and the Sunreavers began collaborating with the Thalassian &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;. Several members of the Sunreavers then took up arms in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;'s direct leadership. Aethas and the Sunreavers eventually rejoined the Kirin Tor during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nMany of the Sunreavers' present-day members were &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; citizens who had also lived and studied in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s banner at one point or another prior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, some having been members for over two thousand years (some of whom are said to have helped &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s originally discover &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;'s friendship with Dalaran was tested after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, during which the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; - also a member of the Kirin Tor's &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;ruling body&lt;/a&gt; - and the entire local elven populace were sentenced to mass executions in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeons%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Dungeons of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Though the elves escaped, prominent figures among them blamed the Kirin Tor for inaction, and accused them of doing nothing to avert an attempted massacre in their own city. Silvermoon's relations with Dalaran were further strained when the former joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, not all of the blood elves held these views, and indeed some sought to mend broken bridges. &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, a blood elf archmage on the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, worked to readmit his people into the Kirin Tor's ranks, knowing that a number of elves would welcome the chance to bear the Kirin Tor's mantle again. Under the banner of the Sunreavers, Aethas's followers, again answering to both Silvermoon and Dalaran, formally rejoined the Kirin Tor. Aethas's efforts even allowed the blood elves' Horde allies access to Dalaran, which began acting independently of faction politics. Aethas and the Sunreavers also had the support of &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and Archmage &lt;a href=\"Modera\"&gt;Modera&lt;/a&gt;, fellow members of the Six.\nThe Sunreavers' presence in the Kirin Tor was not without its critics. Silvermoon's &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, strongly opposed the notion of their own magi supporting Aethas and the Sunreavers, unwilling to look past the Third War. Rommath himself, a survivor of these events and a former Kirin Tor archmage, was vehemently opposed to Aethas's desire to have Silvermoon support Dalaran in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, or anything pertaining to the Kirin Tor's welfare. While more open to the possibility, even the regent lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, privately agreed with Rommath's disdain, though knew the Sunreavers would find support no matter what the official stance was. Lor'themar eventually accepted Aethas's proposal, commanding him to look after any &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; who would find themselves in Dalaran during the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; war.\nThe Sunreavers also found opposition from Rhonin's wife, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, an exile from Silvermoon who had made Dalaran her new home. She formed the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, a militant core of high elves, to act as a deterrent to any potential Horde uprising.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunreavers controlled &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Sunreaver's Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; district of Dalaran. The guards they employed were named &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Guardian%20Mage\"&gt;Sunreaver Guardian Mage&lt;/a&gt;s, and expelled &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who get too close to the Horde district. They also employed &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe presence of the Sunreavers in the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s ranks was opposed by a militant regiment of their &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; cousins, also of residence there, named the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;. This feud was largely fueled by its leader, &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, a high elf who disapproved of the blood elves, though Vereesa herself had no political sway in the city, while numerous members of &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;the six&lt;/a&gt; (including &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Modera\"&gt;Archmage Modera&lt;/a&gt;) vouched for the blood elves' readmission.\nThey came to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; with the Horde to fight the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, but they had a mission of their own, to regain their place as part of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, since most of them lived and studied in Dalaran before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The Sunreavers championed the Horde's cause within Dalaran, allowing them safe haven in the Sunreavers' own &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Sanctuary\"&gt;sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, and represented them during the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Pavilion\"&gt;Sunreaver Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Reaver%27s%20Run\"&gt;Sea Reaver's Run&lt;/a&gt;, the strait between Northrend and an island called &lt;a href=\"Hrothgar%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Hrothgar's Landing&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunreavers sailed their ships \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Crimson%20Dawn\"&gt;The Crimson Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Firehawk\"&gt;The Firehawk&lt;/a&gt;\" on these waters, while the Silver Covenant sailed \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Blade\"&gt;The Silver Blade&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Wavecrest\"&gt;The Wavecrest&lt;/a&gt;\". The ships fought the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; back from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;'s main shore and had to slay the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; they kept summoning, with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt; shattered the legendary blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunreavers under &lt;a href=\"Myralion%20Sunblaze\"&gt;Myralion Sunblaze&lt;/a&gt; vowed to restore it. Working closely with &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt;, Sunreaver agents gathered the necessary information required to put the blade's restoration into practice. The journey would take heroes to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;innermost sanctum&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt;, to the reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, culminating in a visit to the restored &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and an interaction with the leaders of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the blade of its taint.\nAt some point following the Northrend war, the Sunreavers' goal was a success: the blood elves were officially readmitted into the Kirin Tor's ranks, as their good work fighting the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; earned them that return.\nTides of War.\nThe organization made a reappearance shortly before the assault on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Theramore, sought the Kirin Tor's aid in defending her home against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Though bound by neutrality, the Kirin Tor agreed to send several representatives to act as a deterrent. &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; both recommended &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt; for the mission, a Sunreaver &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; of some repute.\nDuring the attack, however, Thalen was revealed as a spy for Garrosh Hellscream. He abandoned his post and instead allowed the Horde army to pass through; later, he was captured and imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, though freed by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Horde agents&lt;/a&gt;. Thalen was aware of the true scope of Garrosh's plans for &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, and had created for the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; that promptly annihilated it. He retreated to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; after the deed was done.\nThalen's treachery was a blow to the Sunreavers' credibility, who had only recently succeeded in their mission to carve out an equal place in the Kirin Tor's ranks. &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; did not believe the upper echelons of the Sunreavers were aware of Thalen's treachery, but the Kirin Tor leader was killed by the bomb shortly after the subject was raised. Aethas himself, agitated by the betrayal, maintained that he was unaware of Thalen's duplicity, and stated that he would make any amends that he could for it, ultimately supporting Jaina as the new leader of the Kirin Tor.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nWhile Azeroth was caught in the throes of Garrosh Hellscream's &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor, in spite of its divided populace, strived to remain a beacon of cross-faction cooperation. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; feared the Horde presence may be a threat, and requested that Jaina exile the Sunreavers; however, Jaina refused, citing the Sunreavers' status as productive members of the Kirin Tor for thousands of years. With the Sunreavers' continued presence in the city ensured, Varian approached the regent lord of Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and began talks for the blood elves to leave Garrosh's increasingly brutal Horde and rejoin the Alliance.\nGarrosh eventually became aware of this, and set a plot in motion to sabotage it. Enlisting &lt;a href=\"Fanlyr%20Silverthorn\"&gt;Fanlyr Silverthorn&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh ordered him to enter &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and steal an artifact named the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;, using a Sunreaver portal in order to circumvent Jaina's wards around the city. A Sunreaver agent provided this portal, albeit knowing the act could endanger the Sunreavers' neutrality. With the aid of Horde champions, the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; was stolen. Despite Fanlyr's attempts to cover their tracks, Jaina was able to discover evidence linking the theft of the Divine Bell to someone familiar with the Kirin Tor portal network, inferring them to be a Sunreaver. Jaina returned to Dalaran to confront Aethas directly.\nThough Aethas attempted to deter her, claiming he did nothing (a half truth; Aethas, struggling with his conflicting loyalties, became aware of it moments after it occurred, but was an accomplice through inaction rather than intent), Jaina rebuked him and called for the exile of the entire Sunreaver organization. Aethas challenged this, stating Dalaran was the Sunreavers' city too, and Jaina went about removing them &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;by force&lt;/a&gt; after imprisoning Aethas in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sunreavers, disorganized with their leader imprisoned, reacted differently to their predicament: Sunreaver civilians, mostly unaware of their predicament, were set upon by Silver Covenant agents who stripped them of their belongings and rounded them up; hostilities erupted closer to the surface, where Sunreaver combatants attempted to fight off the Silver Covenant enforcers; above ground, several militant Sunreaver magi and warriors held the center of the city, while others struck out and attempted to do battle with Jaina herself. Some Sunreavers simply surrendered, and were taken to the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and others (such as shopkeepers who refused to side with the Silver Covenant) were slain at their posts. Dalaran soon became a war zone, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; led a strike team into the city to rescue the Sunreavers. The grand magister fought his way through the city, striking out against the Alliance forces in an effort to locate Aethas and ensure the Sunreavers had a means of escape, be it by portal or &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt;. Though many were still imprisoned, others were rescued by Rommath, who also succeeded in breaking Aethas out of the Citadel and escaping the city.\nBack in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; oversaw portals funneling the escaped Sunreavers back to safety. Lor'themar ordered the Sunreavers' strength to be added to that of &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Rommath's own&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; leaders vowed to take their future into their own hands. Garrosh's ploy, which had focussed blame on the Sunreavers and, thanks to the purge, sabotaged Lor'themar's negotiations with Varian, ensured that the blood elves now had no way to leave his &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the conflict, the Sunreavers as a whole came to hold Garrosh (whose agents in their organization led to the purge to begin with) just as responsible for their removal from Dalaran as Jaina herself.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; rallied his forces to move against the newly-returned &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, former emperor of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, whose return heralded a dark future for the continent. With &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; focusing solely on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar aimed to remove the threat Lei Shen poses and to claim the emperor's weaponry for the blood elves' use, as leverage against Garrosh in the event of a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; uprising. To this end, the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; was formed: a Sunreaver-heavy alliance with support from the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt;, among others. Lor'themar himself presided over this coalition, though both &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; were also on hand. Players work closely with &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Captain%20Elsia\"&gt;Scout Captain Elsia&lt;/a&gt; throughout the various scenarios on the isle.\nLor'themar eventually confronted Jaina and publicly demanded the release of the Sunreavers imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; into his custody, who are being kept as prisoners of war. Jaina, leading the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, was also eager for a chance to recapture Aethas, whom she wanted brought before her alive.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAethas and several members of the Sunreavers assisted in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, fighting in &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Landing\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Landing&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Crimes.\nThough the status of the Sunreaver prisoners in the Violet Hold remains unclear, Jaina Proudmoore mentioned that she had recently negotiated with Lor'themar. The fate of the Divine Bell was also formally reiterated for the court at Garrosh Hellscream's trial, placing culpability for the theft on a Sunreaver agent working on Garrosh's orders, whose portal had allowed Horde members to steal the Bell.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Arcanist\"&gt;Sunreaver Arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s were seen as part of the Horde forces in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Grommashar\"&gt;Siege of Grommashar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s exalted with &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; have the option to hire Sunreaver guards for their garrison, provided they have a Level 3 Barracks.\nLegion.\nWhen Dalaran relocated above the &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, the Sunreaver's Sanctuary was patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Guardian\"&gt;Kirin Tor Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacked the city, the Sunreaver &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Guardian%20Mage\"&gt;mages&lt;/a&gt; were seen in the sanctuary, defending it.\nSince their expulsion from the Kirin Tor, the Sunreavers have endeavored to secure readmission. Aethas seizes a chance to make this a reality by tracking down the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, high blade of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider\"&gt;Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; line, and with its recovery hopes to reclaim the Sunreavers' place in the Kirin Tor. Aethas contacts his old friend Archmage Modera with this information, who passes it along to a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;notable fire mage&lt;/a&gt; working with &lt;a href=\"Alodi\"&gt;Alodi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;. A meeting is arranged, and Aethas reveals his intention to reclaim his place in the Kirin Tor in return for his aid in Felo'melorn's recovery. The mission is tied to the fate of &lt;a href=\"Lyandra%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Lyandra Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, a distant relative to Silvermoon's old king, Anasterian; she was called to undeath after falling in Icecrown, during an ill-fated quest to find the blade, believing it would legitimize her claim to the Sunstrider throne.\nFelo'melorn is successfully recovered, and Aethas returns to Dalaran to put his plea before the new &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;. With a unanimous vote - helped by Modera's endorsement, and the fact that the blade was given to the hero rather than one of Aethas' own Sunreavers - Aethas is welcomed back into Dalaran.\nThe Sunreavers followed their leader back into the Kirin Tor's ranks, but their presence in the conclave was once again threatened when one of their members turned to the Legion. Aethas and several Sunreavers then aid in re-powering Dalaran's defensive weapon atop the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt; by siphoning the power of &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, the dreadlord imprisoned inside the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nThe Sunreavers within &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Pavilion\"&gt;Sunreaver Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt; were among those to come &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;under attack&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Mage%20%28Death%20Rising%29\"&gt;Sunreaver mage&lt;/a&gt; opened a direct portal to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, connecting the pavilion with the Horde capital.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that while most of the Sunreavers remained with &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; as it moved, &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%27s%20Command\"&gt;Sunreaver's Command&lt;/a&gt; is still their outpost in Northrend. According to &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, while the Sunreavers may be back in the Kirin Tor, the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; are still watching them like hawks.\nFaction description.\n\"Traditionally barred from Dalaran, the Horde has been accepted into the city through the efforts of Archmage Aethas Sunreaver.
