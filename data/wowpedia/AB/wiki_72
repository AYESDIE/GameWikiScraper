Initially, the bronzes refused, but their decision was reversed when the brazen &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Caverns of Time. &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s heir, Anachronos, agreed to enlist the bronze dragonflight against the marauding qiraji.\nEven with the might of the dragons backing them, however, the sheer numbers of the qiraji and silithid proved overwhelming. And so Anachronos called upon the progeny of the remaining flights: &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, child of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green flight&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt;, child of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, child of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dragons and winged qiraji clashed in the cloudless sky above &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. It is rumored that the dragons flying above the ancient city from which the qiraji emerged saw something distressing there; something that hinted at a more ancient, terrifying presence behind the onslaught of the insect race. It was this revelation that spurred the dragons and Staghelm to hatch their final, desperate plan: to contain the qiraji within the city, to erect a barrier that would confine them until a more hopeful stratagem could be devised.\nThe final push to the city began. High above, the dragons were making short work of the insect soldiers. As one, the night elves and dragons formed a moving wall which pressed the qiraji back toward the city of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. But near the city gates, the tide turned, and it was all the combined forces could do to hold the line. To push any further would be impossible. Merithra, Caelestrasz, and Arygos decided to push into the city and hold the qiraji back long enough for Anachronos, Fandral, and the remaining druids and priestesses to create the magical barrier. And so the three dragons and their companions flew headlong into the qiraji legions, into the city where they hoped their sacrifice would not be in vain.\nOutside the gates, Fandral called upon the druids to focus their energies as Anachronos summoned the enchanted barricade. Beyond the gates, the three dragon progeny succumbed to the overwhelming forces as the qiraji surged forth. The barrier erected itself before their eyes, rock and stone and roots from beneath the sands emerging to create an impenetrable wall. Even the winged soldiers who attempted to fly over the barrier met with an invisible obstruction that they could not pass. The qiraji who remained outside the wall were quickly slain. The corpses of qiraji, night elves, and dragons littered the bloody sands.\nAnachronos motioned to a scarab scuttling below his feet. The creature froze, then flattened out, transforming into a metallic gong. Stones shifted into place near the wall, creating a dais where the gong was finally placed. The great dragon then proceeded to the severed limb of one of his fallen companions. He held the appendage and, after a series of incantations, the limb morphed into the shape of a scepter. The dragon told Fandral that should any mortal ever wish to pass the magical barrier and access the ancient city, they need only strike the scepter against the gong and the gates would open. He then handed the scepter to the Arch-Druid. Fandral looked down, his face twisting in contempt, still mourning his son's recent death.\nLord Staghelm, in a fit of rage and grief, shattered the Scepter of the Shifting Sands. Anachronos was taken aback as the Night Elf stormed off, damning Silithus, the Qiraj, and the dragons for his son's death. Disappointed, Anachronos took the four shards of the scepter and entrusted each shard to a member of the four flights, including himself. From the red he chose &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, from the blue he chose &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, and from the green, &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\n1000 years later, Anachronos was still guarding the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, and sought to finish the war with the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. Little did he know back then that all three scepter guardians, whether by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s or betrayal by those that would call them friend, would fall to tragedy. His agent, &lt;a href=\"Baristolth%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Baristolth of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, whom he blessed with immortality, sought a mortal champion to recombine the scepter and open the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. A transcript of the final events of the war as shown to Anachronos' chosen champion can be found in the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Pawn%20on%20the%20Eternal%20Board\"&gt;A Pawn on the Eternal Board&lt;/a&gt;.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; rescued and returned Nozdormu to the Caverns of Time, Anachronos alongside others bronze dragons were present observing their Aspect. Anachronos also thought that &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; had betrayed the flights by destroying the Sanctums.\nCataclysm.\nEver since the death of the Dragon Aspect &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the blue dragonflight has struggled with appointing a new leader. Its members are now torn between the two likeliest successors: &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, who champions reconciliation with other races; and &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, a scion of Malygos who believes that his kind should withdraw from the world and forge a new path. To end the constant debates and arguments, the flight has agreed to gather during the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an extraordinary celestial event in which Azeroth's two moons come into perfect alignment\u2014in the hopes that a new Aspect will be selected.\nYet a recent discovery by the bronze dragon Anachronos bodes ill for this impending ceremony. The timeless dragon has detected sinister magic at work around the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, the blue flight's frozen lair in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Along with this find, he has glimpsed a terrifying vision of Azeroth succumbing to flames. The link between this chilling portent and the blue dragons remains unclear, but Anachronos has called upon what some of his kind deem the \"short-lived\" races to investigate further. If a hero does not rise to the challenge and find the truth, Anachronos's dire vision of Azeroth's undoing could become reality. Bronze Dragonflight emissaries will be sent to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; capital cities of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to recruit those who are ready to &lt;a href=\"Dragonwrath%2C%20Tarecgosa%27s%20Rest\"&gt;undertake the challenge&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion Invasions.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, he defended the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sought to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har orc clans&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; saved from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. However, the shard of &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; in his possession was depleted of its energy and thus the Horde turned to the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to see if they would help them in their quest. Upon being approached by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde champion&lt;/a&gt;, Anachronos merely remarked that the time had come for their visit. Agreeing to aid the Horde in their quest, Anachronos had the shard of the Vision of Time empowered by defeating the echoes of &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the defeat of Hellscream's echo, Anachronos revealed that he sensed the threads of fate upon the Horde champion and proclaimed that they were worthy of what is to come next and that had there been any doubt he would have never allowed the shard to fall into the &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;wrong hands again&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nA projection of Anachronos appears in &lt;a href=\"Algeth%27ar%20Academy\"&gt;Algeth'ar Academy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Maxdormu\"&gt;Professor Maxdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s history lesson about the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAnachronos is a &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;.

Nozdormu knows exactly where and when he will perish, and as such, would need to appoint a successor to his sacred mission well in advance. The other Aspects would have less of a need for directly designated successors. That Anachronos has been named an heir implies that his mother is likely &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu's Prime Mate.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

She was tall and physically powerful, with purple hair and pale blue skin. Her most striking feature, however, was the facial scars she'd received from a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt;. She chose not to have the scars healed, instead proudly referring to them as the \"true mark of the soul\". What she lacked in beauty, she made up for in ferocity and her attitude towards others, with someone once describing her as having the shooting skills of &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the inspirational skills of a &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Thorns.\nAnaris was known as a war hero many times over, most recently during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, when she led a small army of Sentinels in retaking &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, allowing it to once again serve as a center of Ashenvale's Sentinel presence. However, she was never sent to fight elsewhere and had never been sent into Horde territory at all.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and many other Sentinels from &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; were sent to Ashenvale to serve under Anaris, with Delaryn as Windwood's second-in-command. Delaryn admired Anaris as a personal hero, but she and her fellow Sentinels soon discovered the commander's harsh attitude. She seemed to consider any Sentinels who had had duty in the comfort of Darnassus to be lesser compared to those who hadn't. Over the following days, Anaris subjected the Darnassus Sentinels to various humiliating tasks, putting them through practice as if they were fresh recruits and sending them to deliver trivial messages.\nWhen Horde &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s attacked Sentinel outposts throughout Ashenvale, Anaris was out on a training patrol with a dozen Sentinels. When Delaryn and &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt; caught up with them, they weren't even patrolling; Anaris was instead ordering the exhausted Sentinels to march in perfect synchronization. Moments later, &lt;a href=\"Rifen\"&gt;Rifen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lorash%20Sunbeam\"&gt;Lorash Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt; attacked the group, with Rifen dropping from the canopy to land on Anaris' back and stab her with twin daggers, killing her. Delaryn succeeded her as the commander of Ashenvale.\nShadowlands.\nAfter her death, her &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; ended up in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;'s incapacitation. While being imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Tremaculum\"&gt;Tremaculum&lt;/a&gt;, she was rescued by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt; aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, at the urging of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. Following her liberation, she came to reside in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nAfter being saved from the Maw in &lt;a href=\"From%20a%20Dark%20Place\"&gt;From a Dark Place&lt;/a&gt;, Anaris has this gossip:The war exacted a terrible toll on our people. More so than anyone else.It cannot go unanswered.I hope that you will stand with us when we finally have our vengeance.She has different dialogue for Horde players:I acknowledge that you saved me from that terrible, dark place.

His reign from &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt;, which lasted at least 2,800 years, was marked by several conflicts that threatened the continued existence of Quel'Thalas, ending with his death at the hands of the evil Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs decreed by his son and successor, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, Anasterian was to be the very last king of the high elves. Kael's own successor, the regent lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, has also upheld this, acknowledging Anasterian and Kael'thas as the last elves with a right to kingship over Quel'Thalas.\nBiography.\nThe great-grandson of &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, Anasterian came to power during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, when his people faced war with their ancient enemies, the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Anasterian was the monarch of Quel'Thalas when the sister blade of &lt;a href=\"%3AQuel%27Serrar\"&gt;:Quel'Serrar&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, was handed to the high elven king personally by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza%20the%20Life-Binder\"&gt;Alexstrasza the Life-Binder&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, Anasterian granted the mighty blade to &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt;, who would wield it for years to come.\nThe Troll Wars.\nReigning during the Troll Wars against the resurgent &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Anasterian saw that his people were hard-pressed to keep the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s at bay and were perilously close to defeat. Anasterian hit upon a radical idea: His scouts had reported that a human nation named &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; had recently formed to the south. One tribe had risen to dominance through the simple expedient of offering amnesty to the people it defeated. That such a strategy was new among humans was a testament not only to the youth of their race, but also to their willingness to gain strength via clear-sighted pragmatism.\nAlthough the humans had no spellcasters, Arathor had a sizeable population. Anasterian was certain there had to be humans with magical talent. They merely needed training in order to be useful in combat. He, therefore, dispatched ambassadors to the southlands with all speed.\nKing Thoradin of Arathor greeted the ambassadors with surprise and wary courtesy. He had been hearing rumors of the high elves' plight for months, but he had not suspected that the trolls posed a truly significant threat. The weary elves warned the king that the troll armies were vast. Should Quel'Thalas fall, the trolls would certainly besiege Arathor next.\nThe king was distrustful of magic, but he could not deny that the elves had a point. Further negotiations ensued until at last Anasterian and Thoradin had reached an agreement. Almost immediately, elven sorcerers arrived in Arathor and began to instruct a group of humans in the ways of magic. &lt;a href=\"One%20Hundred\"&gt;One hundred men&lt;/a&gt; were taught the very basics of the elves' magical secrets: no more than was absolutely necessary to combat the trolls.\nIn addition to these new spellcasters, Thoradin sent his armies to the battlefront. Together, the humans and high elves ultimately achieved victory over the trolls, who would never fully recover from their defeat. Assured that Quel'Thalas was saved from destruction, the elves made a pledge of loyalty and friendship to the nation of Arathor and to the bloodline of King Thoradin, a blood debt that King Anasterian would not be coerced into repaying until years later.\nAnasterian personally wielded the ancient family runeblade &lt;a href=\"%3AFelo%27melorn\"&gt;:Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; against the trolls, and it was said that a thousand Amani fell before its fury, spilling enough Amani blood to brim the walls of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft: Sylvanas.\nAnasterian held court with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Ranger General Lireesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and his chief adviser &lt;a href=\"Verath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Verath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; the day &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; escorted &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; to his presence. The king's ranger-general was sceptical of the human's reports of a swelling horde of monsters from another world, and Anasterian was hesitant to commit to an answer, but at Verath's urging the king named him an ambassador to the Alliance. Lireesa, his wife, accompanied him on the errand; both were slain in &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe king summoned the Windrunner children to &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; and informed them of their parents' deaths. Anasterian was sympathetic, but put little stock in Sylvanas' belief that the Horde had a hand in the deaths. Anasterian acquiesced to his new ranger-general's request to personally conduct an investigation into the killings, but considered the action unwise and held to the simplest explanation: that Amani trolls had caught the Windrunners unaware.\nSylvanas returned from Eastweald with proof\u2013an orcish arrow retrieved from her father's steed. Anasterian conferred with his ranger-general in a private solar and expressed gratitude for her loyal service. He then tossed the arrow into his burning fireplace, destroying the only evidence of the Horde's involvement. Sylvanas was aghast, but Anasterian swore her to secrecy and forbade any reprisals. In his view, the Windrunners had journeyed beyond the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s protection, and fallen in a war that was not their own\u2013a war Quel'Thalas would not involve itself in. To do so would only agitate and endanger the kingdom.\nThough appalled, Sylvanas agreed to her king's demand. Anasterian knew more of politics than she, and she knew that her parents would have obeyed the command, however wrong or unfair. Sylvanas determined to find justice in her own way and kept Anasterian's secret from all but her sisters.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Anasterian was largely unconcerned with the threat of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s rampaging through &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, considering it a problem that could not touch &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and thus not worth the high elves addressing. After &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; sent a request of help, Anasterian sent only a token army to &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;. After the orcs joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls (the Amani themselves ever-eager to see Quel'Thalas burn), he was approached by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to open his eyes to the threat. Still reluctant, the high elven king finally changed his tone when Alleria hurled an Amani head at his feet, which roused Anasterian to anger. Kicking it away and enraged at the trolls' nerve, the king ordered the high elven warriors and rangers to crush the Amani once and for all.\nKing Anasterian reluctantly joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, honor-bound to fulfill the pledge to the Arathi, of whom Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; was the last. Anasterian was forced to contribute more of Quel'Thalas's armies when the outer forests were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and despite the elves' desire to stay out of the war, their hand had been forced. The troll warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; aimed to hold Anasterian's decapitated head high so it could see its people's death, just before he devoured it whole.\nWhen the Horde invasion had been routed and the orcs had abandoned the battle in favor of besieging Lordaeron, Anasterian seized the opportunity to rid himself of the beleaguered Amani forever. The king dispatched magi and priests (among them high priestess &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;) to bolster the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;' ranks and hopefully wipe out the trolls for good.\nUltimately, the Horde was to fall, and placed into internment camps. With his blood debt paid and Lothar dead, Anasterian became an aloof member of the Alliance. The high elves came to realize that the increasingly strained Alliance needed them far more than they needed it, and after a period of mutual coldness between the humans and their elven allies, Anasterian resolved to officially secede his nation.\nIn the aftermath of the war, the high elves as a whole began to doubt the value of the Alliance. Humanity seemed to need the high elves, but had little to offer in return, especially now that a large portion of Alliance resources was allotted toward maintaining the internment camps. Anasterian had led efforts to drive the Amani trolls from Quel'Thalas while the main Alliance army went to besiege Blackrock Spire. He would later accuse the Alliance of abandoning his people, although not all high elves believed him. Even so, enough did to justify leaving the Alliance. \nAt last, Anasterian rescinded the high elves' allegiance to the Alliance. He stated that the humans' poor leadership had been directly responsible for the burned forests in the borderlands of Quel'Thalas. King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; argued that nothing of Quel'Thalas would have survived if not for the hundreds of valiant humans who gave their lives to defend it. Despite his attempts at reestablishing diplomatic relations, however, the elves opted to remain independent of the crumbling Alliance. Anasterian's secession sparked the domino effect that led to the Alliance of Lordaeron splintering almost completely: &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; followed Anasterian's example and removed themselves from the increasingly deteriorating Alliance.\nAnasterian's declining health continued to falter in the following years, and the aged king's public appearances grew less frequent. Nonetheless, he attended &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;'s ceremonial promotion to the rank of Ranger Lord, and wished him continued success.\nThird War.\nStill reigning over Quel'Thalas at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, despite his advanced age, Anasterian spared little thought for the plight of the humans in Lordaeron; true to the past, believing it to be a human issue than the high elves would not deign to trouble themselves with.\nAnasterian confronted the twisted prince, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, before the gates of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. The death's &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;undead onslaught&lt;/a&gt; had taken him from the freshly-destroyed ruins of his homeland of Lordaeron to the heart of Quel'Thalas. Arthas revealed the banshee form of Anasterian's ranger-general, Sylvanas Windrunner, but the king denounced the specter and declared Sylvanas had died a quel'dorei hero. He rejected Arthas' call to surrender, vowing that his people would never yield and Arthas would never defile his kingdom. When the Scourge breached Silvermoon City, Anasterian and the surviving elves gathered aboard their fleet and retreated to the island.\nAfter Arthas arrived on the shores of the Isle of Quel'Danas, he was met by the high king of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; himself. Anasterian swiftly went about destroying the path of frost that Arthas had created over the ocean, wreaking havoc upon it with his fiery magics and forcing the displaced undead into the ocean. He then proceeded to cut a swath of destruction through the undead hordes near the shore. Clad in his armor, &lt;a href=\"Lu%27minellia\"&gt;Lu'minellia&lt;/a&gt; and wielding Felo'melorn in conjunction with a powerful &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; crystal nestled atop his staff, Anasterian ferociously fought back the invaders, knowing this would likely be his last battle. His powerful casting was disrupted when Arthas charged the high elven king personally. \nBut even his unyielding will and extraordinary powers proved insufficient against the merciless &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. King Anasterian fought a valiant but ultimately hopeless battle against Arthas, the outcome of which the elves knew would decide the fate of them all; elves and Scourge alike turned to watch the duel between their rulers play out. Though both his formidable martial prowess and spellcasting proved an apt counter to the corrupted prince's dark powers, Anasterian's three millennia hindered him in his last, desperate battle to protect his people. The high elves' hopes were raised when despite the unfavorable odds, Anasterian managed to severely wound Arthas's necromantic steed, &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, by severing its forelegs, though the act only served to enrage the forcibly dismounted Arthas further. Warping behind the prince, Anasterian attempted to decapitate him but was caught in a blast of howling ice. Felo'melorn and Frostmourne clashed, the former shattered in two on collision. Arthas fought on and severed Anasterian's right leg, but Anasterian buried his broken blade deep in the prince's thigh. The elven king then fell under the weight of Frostmourne, which cut through the ancient elven blade and stole the soul of its owner.\nAnasterian's corpse was secured by the brothers &lt;a href=\"Solanar%20Bloodwrath\"&gt;Solanar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falon\"&gt;Falon&lt;/a&gt;, to save the king the fate of undeath. They brought him to a &lt;a href=\"The%20Bazaar\"&gt;reclaimed&lt;/a&gt; portion of Silvermoon. The fallen king was put upon a table in the tavern hall.\nIn the wake of the high elven kingdom's destruction, Anasterian's son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; returned home from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and proclaimed his people reborn as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, in honor of Anasterian and all of the elves who had perished. Kael'thas recovered his father's broken runeblade and later reforged it.\nAnasterian was cremated on a funeral pyre in the Bazaar after Prince Kael'thas had said his private farewells.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt; questline, after returning to &lt;a href=\"Myralion%20Sunblaze\"&gt;Myralion Sunblaze&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Caladis%20Brightspear\"&gt;Caladis Brightspear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt; replays the events of Quel'Delar's bestowal to the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, images of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt; and King Anasterian Sunstrider appear during the small scene, which shows Anasterian granting the blade to Thalorien.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn visions from the past during the Heritage of the Sin'dorei questline, a vision of Anasterian Sunstrider can be seen alongside &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Vandellor\"&gt;High Priest Vandellor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Liadrin\"&gt;High Priestess Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sun's Reach Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; before going to fight the invading Scourge. The vision then fought Arthas on the southern tip of Quel'Danas and fell.\nShadowlands.\nAs a victim of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Anasterian entered the Shadowlands a sundered soul. Its missing fragment, crystallized as \"The Golden King\", came into the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s possession after Frostmourne's shattering.\nLegacy.\nKing Anasterian is remembered as one of the blood elves' greatest heroes; his sacrifice is honored yearly in Quel'Thalas. To this day, the blood elves are known to charge into battle with the name of their fallen king upon their lips. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; described Anasterian's death as a huge blow to Quel'Thalas, writing that for many of her people, their hearts and hopes died with their beloved king.\nPrince Kael'thas decreed that King Anasterian would be the very last king of the high elves, and chose to style himself with various other titles instead. Despite Anasterian's decision to remove himself and Quel'Thalas from the Alliance, following the Scourge attack on Silvermoon, &lt;a href=\"Melaya%20Tassier\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vaeron%20Kormar\"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; the elves claimed that it was the humans who had abandoned \"them\" in their darkest hour, citing this to justify their eventual membership in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Anasterian had claimed that the Alliance had abandoned his people during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, although not all elves agreed with him. Anasterian's secession left bitter memories for the Alliance, who looked upon the surviving elves with wariness and distrust, and this time expressed no interest in fighting for Quel'Thalas. Anasterian's long reign would not be matched by his only son, whose own period of rule was cut short after his demise in the same place as his father: the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe designated regent lord of Quel'Thalas, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, now rules the elven homeland after the fall of its royal family. Lor'themar had reflected on the decisions made by Anasterian, and does not fault the elven king for them, acknowledging the burden of leadership he bore to be something one cannot simply be taught, only experienced.\nAbilities.\nAccording to ', he had the skills of a warrior and was still a powerful mage. He is shown in ', wearing plate armor. Along with his weapon of choice being the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Blood of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\" further expanded on his repertoire of abilities, portraying him as a remarkably swift combatant who favored &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; magic and protected himself using various magical flame shields. He also knew how to teleport.\nPersonality.\nAnasterian was a fiercely proud monarch who prioritized Quel'Thalas's interests above all else. Despite owing a blood debt to humanity for their part in the Troll Wars, Anasterian was hesitant to assist the humans against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; years later, seeing no threat to his own kingdom, and only truly dedicated resources to the conflict when his own people were threatened once more. When the Second War was done and his debt was paid, Anasterian saw no further use for the Alliance, criticizing its apparent failings during the war, and seceded his nation. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; was appalled by this and attempted to re-establish relations, arguing that nothing would remain of Quel'Thalas if not for the humans who had given their lives to defend it; but the high elf king was unmoved, and chose to keep his kingdom independent. In a twist of fate, Anasterian's death would be at the hands of Terenas's &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;own son&lt;/a&gt;. \nSurrounded by flatterers, Anasterian was wise enough to treasure those who spoke the truth to him. Anasterian never failed to acknowledge those who had fallen in defense of the people. However, he was known to dither on crucial decision-making, and, most damningly, mistook ignorance for protection - so long as Quel'Thalas did not involve itself in the world beyond, its problems would not become theirs.\nHe cared deeply for Kael'thas, his only son, who was left shattered and lost by his father's death.\nUltimately, Anasterian remains a divisive figure. Some argue that he was simply a pragmatist who did all he could for his kingdom and people, forging and ending alliances as a means to that end. Others consider him a self-centered leader and an ungrateful ally whose kingdom benefited from the very sacrifices he himself scorned.\nAppearance.\nKing Anasterian is described as a highly aged man, with long white hair and a pale complexion, his skin thin and his tone having long turned soft. However, his powerful voice still carried the unmistakable hints of his authority. He had piercing blue eyes that had not been diluted by the pangs of advanced age, though little else had been spared of his once slender and powerful body. His anger flaring, even at such an age, was fearsome to behold. In \"Reforged\", his eyes are golden.\nIn the RPG.\nBefore Kael left shattered Quel'Thalas, he managed to salvage the skull of his father, Anasterian, from the ruins of Quel'Thalas. The skull is among the artifacts that the red and green &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s thought would be needed to restore the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. \nSpeculation.\nThe description of his abilities points towards a fusion between a warrior and mage. As such, Anasterian may have been considered a &lt;a href=\"warmage\"&gt;warmage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"battle%20mage\"&gt;battle mage&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, during the war, Anaya's home city of &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt; was left in ruins, and Anaya was killed.\nAnaya's spirit was left to haunt the ruins of Ameth'Aran, while Cerellean hibernated in sorrow. Upon awakening and discovering Anaya haunting the ruins, Cerellean determined that it was necessary to destroy her spirit, but was too sentimental to do so himself. An agent in the employ of Cerellean Whiteclaw was sent to destroy her, ultimately freeing her.\nOnce Anaya's spirit was freed, her ghost visited Cerellean briefly, to reiterate her love for him, to quell his doubts, and to express her confidence that they would be truly reunited in their afterlife. It seems that Cerellean remained most sorrowful, at least for a time.\nAfter her spirit was freed, she was sent to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where she took on a &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%3Asoulshape\"&gt;:soulshape&lt;/a&gt;.

Considering that Anaya died in the aftermath of the battle at the Well of Eternity, it is possible that she could be a distant relative of the blood elf lieutenant, possibly an ancestor."}

A newly empowered crew of pirates was preying on Alliance vessels, and when the raiders captured a ship, they left no survivors. Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; led the search for the rogues, and after weeks of hunting, his small fleet cornered their ship a few miles off the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;' shores. The pirate crew seemed to be possessed, barely &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, but after a coordinated &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt; barrage, Proudmoore sent the \"Bellwether\", to the bottom of the ocean. The admiral sailed away, believing he had killed them all.\nIn truth, one had survived. The single person who swam away from the sunken \"Bellwether\" was a teenage boy, a young pirate recruit who had seen his crew descend into corruption and madness firsthand. He had joined them for profit, so watching his captain and shipmates succumb to uncontrollable bloodlust had been a truly horrific experience. He was compelled to retrieve these cutlasses from the ship's wreckage, but when he heard them whispering in his mind, he had the good sense to resist. He took the weapons and the treasure back to his crew's old lair and buried them deep underneath an isolated island not far from &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. He believed the riches were cursed, and so he left them behind. The weapons would remain buried for years until the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Admiral%20Eliza\"&gt;Admiral Eliza Goreblade&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; found the hidden treasure and the pair of cutlasses.

He was the patriarch of the powerful &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Salonar\"&gt;House of Salonar&lt;/a&gt;, and represented his noble family on the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; at the time of his death during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. His last act was saving the life of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was succeeded as grand magister by his apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nA renowned magus, Belo'vir, like &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt;, was active during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, he created the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Light\"&gt;Stone of Light&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Stone of Flame&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20Spark\"&gt;Stone of Spark&lt;/a&gt;, all three of which were imbued by the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was an old friend of &lt;a href=\"Vandellor\"&gt;High Priest Vandellor&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Liadrin's mentor. The pair often attended ceremonies of rank progression, and took amusement in Liadrin's interest in &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, though Belo'vir was more amused that his friend would encourage amorous behavior as Vandellor himself never had any interest in it. Liadrin thought the two behaved like an old married couple.\nBelo'vir was elected as the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; some time before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. He was constantly surrounded by magi, including his trusted colleagues Magister Rommath and &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;. Belo'vir and his apprentice, Rommath, sat on some of &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s highest councils, along with &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Ranger General Lireesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Verath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Chief Adviser Verath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. \nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion, Belo'vir presided over the defense of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ranger-general&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, was slain in combat with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. He did not submit to &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;'s demand to open Silvermoon's gates and attempted to protect the city from the prince's siege, though each of his strategies to counter the undead enemies proved mostly futile. When the tide began to turn against the elves, Belo'vir instructed &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to evacuate the civilians and children from Silvermoon and to transport the soldiers to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder Belo'vir's command, the elven armies amassed on the shores of Quel'Danas and prepared to meet the Scourge once more. Belo'vir also rallied troops from the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; and led them to battle, but he and his magi were unable to sufficiently damage Arthas's path of frost. During the fighting, Belo'vir was targeted by Arthas personally: Arthas severed the grand magister's arm with Frostmourne, cast him down, and left him for dead as the undead closed in on him.\nVandellor, who attempted to save him, was killed in the chaos, and Liadrin also rushed to the grand magister's aid. Belo'vir's last act was teleporting Liadrin to safety as the undead hordes converged on them. She was spared the sight of Belo'vir being viciously torn to pieces by the Scourge.\nHeritage of the blood elves.\nA vision of Grand Magister Belo'vir can be seen alongside &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Vandellor\"&gt;High Priest Vandellor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Liadrin\"&gt;High Priestess Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sun%27s%20Reach%20Sanctum\"&gt;Sun's Reach Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; as part of the recreation of the past when Quel'Thalas fell.\nShadowlands.\nAs a victim of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Belo'vir entered the Shadowlands a sundered soul. Its missing fragment, crystallized as \"The Grand Magister\", came into the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s possession after Frostmourne's shattering. "}

He is unique in that he must be &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;ed up in order to appear and be engaged.\nAbilities.\nGhaz'ranka is a single-phase encounter. \nSummoning Gahz'ranka.\nGahz'ranka is hidden in the waters off the shore at &lt;a href=\"Pagle%27s%20Pointe\"&gt;Pagle's Pointe&lt;/a&gt;. Summoning him requires a &lt;a href=\"Mudskunk%20Lure\"&gt;Mudskunk Lure&lt;/a&gt; and five &lt;a href=\"Zulian%20Mudskunk\"&gt;Zulian Mudskunk&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zulian%20Mudskunk\"&gt;Zulian Mudskunk&lt;/a&gt; are fished from \"Muddy Churning Water\" pools surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20the%20Blood%20God\"&gt;Altar of the Blood God&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. These pools require a minimum of 330 fishing skill to be fished from. Casts with no failure chance require 425 fishing skill. \nIn order to obtain access to the &lt;a href=\"Mudskunk%20Lure\"&gt;Mudskunk Lure&lt;/a&gt;, a player must complete an initial quest granted by &lt;a href=\"Nat%27s%20Measuring%20Tape\"&gt;Nat's Measuring Tape&lt;/a&gt;, looted in the abandoned camp at Pagle's Pointe. The tape must then be returned to &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle\"&gt;Nat Pagle&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Nat%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Nat's Landing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. After completing the quest a player may purchase these lures at any time from Nat.\nAlternatively, both items may be purchased from the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. This allows raid groups to forego fishing entirely, as neither item requires fishing skill to use.\nOnce both items are obtained, a player can use the lure near the water at Pagle's Point to summon Gahz'ranka will be summoned. The lure is instantly loaded and cast at the same time.\nNote that Gahz'ranka may only be summoned once per instance. Should the raid wipe, he will despawn and cannot be re-summoned until the instance resets.\nStrategy.\nStrategy A.\nClear all fish in the moat in the area you plan on fighting. It's best to fight in the water just below the camp, so there is enough room and people don't take fall damage when they're thrown. Tank him at the center of the moat because geyser does throw you out a bit and this will help you avoid hitting land and taking fall damage. All people must be within range of the Massive Geyser as it aggro reduces and he will kill your ranged DPS. No problem, just have the tank re-establish aggro each time. Hunters must melee as their minimum range is outside the geyser range, so he will end up killing them one by one. DPS until dead.\nStrategy B.\nWe do Gahz'ranka on land. There are a couple of small huts just above Gahz'ranka's spawn point. Clear them out and have all caster stay on the ladder to the entrance of a hut. There is what looks like a huge elephant horn that hangs above the entrance which will stop you from being tossed meters into the air and take fall damage, but only if you stand right under it. Don't go inside the hut (LoS issues). Have Gahz'ranka tanked with a second Tank (just like Drakkisath) - when MT 1 gets tossed into the air, aggro will change. At this point MT 2 picks up Gahz and starts to tank (when MT 1 lands, he waits for MT 2 being shot into the air). \nThis fight is not as easy as it sounds. As mentioned before, you should bring at least a full raid - even 2 missing people can be the key between victory and defeat. The aggro WILL change, so be prepared for cross healing. Also, it is a mana intensive fight, all casters should have mana potions, just in case.\nStrategy C.\nAnother take on the land strategy is to fight Gahz'ranka on Nat Pagle's Point; the small spot of land that lies across from Hakkar's temple where you summon the boss. The are no crocs on this section of land and the hill slopes from the upper path, allowing for access from above. Your raid may want to play it safe and clear out any pathing snakes or trolls in nearby huts.\nThe Main Tank should be positioned so that they are wedged into a corner of the Point, which is created by the hillside and a tree that borders one section of Nat Pagle's Point. Melee DPS and Off Tanks should position themselves either behind the boss or on the right side of the Main Tank, placing their backs to the hillside and keeping the Main Tank to their left. If melee stands too close to the water, they may aggro passing fish onto land. Also, when being thrown up into the air, the melee classes may be able to position themselves so that they land on the upper path, and minimize the fall damage. \nRanged DPS and healers should position themselves on the slope which leads down to the Point from the upper path. It's tempting to line the upper path and stand above the action below, however, if Gahz'ranka aggros on any of the ranged casters and cannot find a quick path to them, the monster may bug into Evade mode. Staying on the slope allows for a clear path to the raid targets for the boss, and reduces the chance of the boss evading, and therefore, healing back up to full health.\nAs long as the Tanks can maintain the positioning of the boss, keeping the aerial tosses limited to the melee classes, this becomes an easy fight.\nAchievement.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3\"&gt;patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, fishing up Gahz'ranka completed the fishing achievement &lt;a href=\"Deadliest%20Catch\"&gt;Deadliest Catch&lt;/a&gt;, which was previously required for the &lt;a href=\"Accomplished%20Angler\"&gt;Accomplished Angler&lt;/a&gt; achievement and the title Salty."}

From that pool the trolls summoned the huge &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt; Gahz'rilla, so fierce that even her scales crackle with energy. The trolls worshiped her as a deity, but the summoning of Gahz'rilla is a well-kept secret of the trolls.

Whatever the truth is, the Sandfury trolls have worshiped this monstrous hydra for thousands of years.

The process of summoning Gahz'rilla was written on &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Tablet\"&gt;Ancient Tablet&lt;/a&gt;s that dropped as &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe process involved traveling to &lt;a href=\"The%20Hinterlands\"&gt;The Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Sacred%20Mallet\"&gt;Sacred Mallet&lt;/a&gt; carried by who resides at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Altar of Zul&lt;/a&gt;. To transform the Sacred Mallet into the , one had to bring it to the very top of the Altar of &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Mallet of Zul'Farrak, Gahz'rilla's gong could then be rung. However, it was (and still is) wise to clear the area first, as Gahz'rilla can knock back players.\nAs of patch 3.0.8, Gahz'rilla no longer needs to be summoned. She is simply present at the location he used to appear upon being summoned. The Mallet of Zul'Farrak has since been turned into a &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; with fairly decent stats and rare skin.\nStrategy.\nAll mobs around the pool should be cleared first, as Gahz'rilla will occasionally launch players through the air which may cause them to land in a group of mobs. Gahz'rilla does not automatically aggro to the players when summoned, and knockback damage can be avoided by landing in the pool of water where she is summoned."}

I suppose I can trust you.\nNotes.\nAs of , it becomes somewhat more difficult to get the beer because the player can no longer walk back through the Dark Portal to get to Nethergarde Keep. First the player needs to return to Stormwind via one of the portals next to the Dark Portal. After that, the player has options:\n1) Simply walk all the way to Nethergarde Keep. The longest path, and the only one that's always available.\n2) If the player has a Flight Path or Hearthstone at the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, it can be used to significantly shorten the walk distance. Note that the flightpath at the Nethergarde Keep itself will not work due to phasing, and while the Hearthstone \"will\" work, it will drop the player in the present version of Blasted Lands in the middle of Ironmarch orcs - the player will need to go back to &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; to travel to the past and then return to Nethergarde Keep.\n3) Accept and speak to &lt;a href=\"Vanguard%20Battlemage\"&gt;Vanguard Battlemage&lt;/a&gt; to get teleported to &lt;a href=\"Shattershore\"&gt;Shattershore&lt;/a&gt; in the present version of Blasted Lands. From there, make your way to &lt;a href=\"Zidormi\"&gt;Zidormi&lt;/a&gt; to travel to the past. Only possible if said quest has not been completed yet."}

For a time, he, &lt;a href=\"Moorabi\"&gt;Moorabi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slad%27ran\"&gt;Slad'ran&lt;/a&gt; held &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, but they were later felled by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; turned to their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invaded the nation of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. The frost trolls did not come to the loa with implorations; they came with blades. As blood flowed from their murdered god, &lt;a href=\"Akali\"&gt;Akali&lt;/a&gt;, the high prophet Gal'darah and his betrayers claimed the loa's strength as their own.\"\nStrategy.\nGal'darah is pretty much a &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt; with a twist. He summons Spirit Rhinos that charge your party members, knocking them around for approximately 10 yards while dealing ~3000 damage. Gal'darah transforms into a rhino after two uses of his Whirling Slash ability, and after two uses of Impale, he will transform back into a troll.\nNormal form.\nThe tank should range-pull and then back firmly into the wall and stay there for the entire fight. During this phase, melee should be in back of the boss ready to move away from the Whirling Slash, while ranged and healer should stand behind the melee out of Whirling Slash range. During Whirling Slash everyone but the tank should move to safety\u2014the boss will keep aggro on the tank. The healer should focus all heals on the tank during Whirling Slash\u2014the others can do ranged DPS or bandage if needed. The tank should save all blocking and avoidance cooldowns for Whirling Slash. The boss can be &lt;a href=\"disarm\"&gt;disarm&lt;/a&gt;ed and dismantled on both normal and heroic and, if he is, the Whirling Slash will result in all misses/dodges/parrys/blocks against a tanking warrior, and minimal damage against bears.\nRhino form.\nAt the beginning of Rhino phase, all players should run toward the tank as quickly as possible and should constantly stay as close as they can to the tank even to the point of directly stacking on the tank with backs to the wall to prevent the knockback. Players that get knocked back should immediately run toward the tank to minimize their potential charge distance. This phase is especially challenging for healers that need to stand still to cast. The healer's highest priority should be to keep the tank up regardless of distance from the Rhino. Second priority is to move toward the tank. Third priority is the other players.\nAlternate strategy.\nStart the fight in the middle of the room, with other party members further out, and have the tank run far enough away during Whirling Slash to avoid the massive damage, while simultaneously circling around Gal'darah. This requires that the tank and healer be aware of each others position so as not to get out of range for heals. Random players will most likely get impaled and \"ride the horn\", possibly more that once, but if the tank is topped up, avoids most of the Whirling Slash damage, uses Enraged Regeneration, Lifeblood (if an herbalist), Last Stand, trinkets, etc, this will give the healer time to heal other group members and themselves before the return of Rhino form. Rinse and repeat until the boss is dead.\nHeroic.\nOn heroic, the damage is significantly increased from Gal'darah to the tank (around 8-10k melee plus DoTs) in rhino form, and from the Spirit Rhinos (~5k on leather/~8k on cloth). During phase 2, Gal'darah charges players; the further you are away the more damage taken.\nCasters should remain out of range of the knockbacks, but should move in closer to reduce charge damage.\nWipes happen primarily either from Whirling Slash on non-tank players during Troll phase or from charges on non-tank players during Rhino phase. The Rhino knockback is a special concern because it does damage while moving the healer out of range just before a big damage Charge. A very workable strategy is to corner/wall tank the boss using one of the two wall crotches located to the left and right of the boss at about 45 degree angles. The tank and the group can safely move to either wall cavity without aggroing.\nTanks will take a lot of damage during Rhino form, which is then amplified when he enrages for 10 seconds. It is ideal to have a hunter in the group to &lt;a href=\"Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;Tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt; each time Gal'darah enrages.\nStrategy for.\nThe boss may be defeated normally for this achievement, so long as players have the Eck Residue buff from . For strategy on getting the buff, see the entry.\nStrategy for.\nThe primary goal of this strategy is to keep DPS to a minimum while extending the encounter long enough for each party member to become impaled. The encounter is not a DPS race, and must be controlled through positioning and coordination. The trick to this achievement is the impales are only random for the first two, then afterward it's the third person closet to boss. Because of this, it forces the group to need a secondary tank because the main tank could possibly not be impaled the first two casts.\nRecommended group composition:\nFor example, a group could consist of a protection-specced Warrior, feral Druid with full tanking gear, an enhancement Shaman with full healing gear, an balance Druid with full healing gear, and a Holy Priest main healing.\nNormal form:\nGal'darah is pretty weak in troll form; however during Whirling Slash, all party members (including melee) except the main tank should stay away from him as much as possible to avoid any damage. The first tank just tanks the Troll form until he turns into a Rhino.\nRhino form:\nWhen Gal'darah transforms into a Rhino, everyone should line up with the healer between the tank unless it's the healer that needs the impale and the person they want impaled for the third and following casts of impale. That way, the right person gets impaled. The other two DPS and/or tank that isn't tanking should be greater then max range so if he knocks someone back, the order doesn't mess up. Once Gal'darah turns back into a Troll, get away from him as fast as possible if you are not tanking.\nTips:\nRemember that during this fight, you BARELY want to be damaging him; do not go DPS crazy AT ALL. Conserve mana, take it slow, and make sure it gets done right.\nTo ensure sure that your main tank gets impaled, have the main tank tanking until the off-tank gets hit by the impale, at which point the off-tank can taunt Gal'darah, and take over tanking until the main tank is impaled. Once your main tank is free again, he can taunt and tank the rest of the fight. The off-tank is then free to DPS, but being mindful to minimize the amount of damage while everyone takes a turn at being impaled."}

In response his mother left to bring her cousin to justice and left the twins in the care of their father. When Rhonin left to find his wife the twins were presumably in the care of &lt;a href=\"Jalia\"&gt;Jalia&lt;/a&gt;, who was like a grandmother and second mother to them.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;present&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;dangers&lt;/a&gt; were defeated, Galadin, along with his family, witnessed the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of Rhonin and Jaina's appointment to lead the Kirin Tor, Galadin, his brother, and mother were present during the funeral service held in honor of the Kirin Tor's former leader.\nIt was thinking of Galadin and his brother that prevented Vereesa from going through her initial plan of poisoning &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; and joining &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.

Honoring her promise Vereesa spent time with her children by playing with Dalaran fountain with them.\nWhen Vereesa was going to meet with her sisters Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Giramar and Galadin expressed interest at the thought of being together as a family. However, Galadin began to argue with Giramar, accusing Sylvanas of being evil and now leading the people who killed their father. Giramar argued that you should not call other people evil or else they will show you how evil they can be. Vereesa broke up the fighting by reminding the twins that they were brothers and had to be each others' best ally.\nSpeculation.\nSince the twins were born some time after the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, they are around 15 - 17 years old in ."}

Their founding leader, or &lt;a href=\"Khan\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt;, was Khan Veng, the fifth of the alleged offspring of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;. They are currently ruled by no definitive Khan. The Galak hold no alliance with their brother tribes, but have been known to act both hostile and passive towards members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLittle is truly known about the Galak, apart from the name of their founding Khan. While brother tribes like the &lt;a href=\"Magram\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gelkis\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt; remained in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; when the centaur split into five tribes, the Galak at some point migrated into the canyons of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe reason for this has not been verified. However, several causes are likely. It is possible that both Veng and Kolk held a temporary alliance between their tribes and migrated together into the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Only later would the Galak break away and make their way into Thousand Needles. Were this the case, then it is possible the Galak played the aggressor against the nomadic &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; prior to the founding of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. This theory would then account for the former Galak presence in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Galak maintained both a village and a camp in the canyon of Thousand Needles, &lt;a href=\"Splithoof%20Crag\"&gt;Splithoof Crag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20E%27thok\"&gt;Camp E'thok&lt;/a&gt;. Splithoof was the larger of the two, housing much of the tribe\u2019s population as well as their stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Splithoof%20Hold\"&gt;Splithoof Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The Galak guarded one of the few remaining artifacts dating to the time of the centaur\u2019s creation within their stronghold. The artifact is guarded both by physical strength and a magical flame which engulfed it. The only known way to douse this flame is with the water of a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nCamp E'thok was located in the northern portion of the canyon. With a Horde outpost nearby, the Galak were able to send assaults against caravans and traveling merchants. Further settlements were rumored to be found on the &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; plains, and sightings of Galak scouts were reported.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the Cataclysm, the Galak tribe has lost its prior settlements and has relocated to the &lt;a href=\"Splithoof%20Heights\"&gt;Splithoof Heights&lt;/a&gt;, where two Khans lord over the tribe. During the questing experience there it is revealed that the Galak have sworn allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Whrrrl\"&gt;Whrrrl&lt;/a&gt;, one of the lords of the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the Cataclysm, the Galak and other clans of centaur joined under the new &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;High Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThey can speak &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;."}

The encounter involves splitting the raid into two groups: one that aides the faction leaders at the beach while the second takes the towers to bring down Galakras. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; formed a close bond with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; during events in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and she and her &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20orc\"&gt;Dragonmaw orc&lt;/a&gt;s have pledged loyalty to Garrosh's cause. Riding atop the fearsome Galakras, a direct descendant of the cataclysmic progenitor of all dragonkind, Zaela oversees the naval defense of Orgrimmar.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"What better way to begin a war-themed wing than by storming enemy beach emplacements? We wanted the focus of this encounter to be on splitting your raid up to secure enemy towers and anti-air weaponry while holding off waves of attackers, and Galakras himself serves as more of a capstone on the experience.\"\nOverview.\nPlayers assault fortified towers as waves of Kor'kron troops rush forth to repel them, and Warlord Zaela circles overhead on her fearsome proto-drake, Galakras. Meanwhile, allied demolitionists work to breach the doors to the nearby guard towers, allowing a strike team to enter the tower and capture it. Once both towers have been captured, the anti-air guns atop each may be used to bring Galakras down to the ground for a final battle.\nAbilities.\nPrelude: Clear the Landing.\nThe naval ships cannot land while the beachfront is still fortified with cannons. Take out the cannons to secure the landing.\nPhase 1: Bring Her Down!\nWarlord Zaela sends her finest Dragonmaw soldiers to battle. Two guardians keep watch over the Towers above, protecting the Anti-Air turrets. Defeating these guardians will give players access to the Anti-Air Turrets. Two well-timed Anti-Air turret shots will send Galakras spiraling towards the ground.\nStrategy.\nPreparation.\nBefore the pull, the raid leader will need to assign a tower team to take control of both towers. 10-man groups will typically send one tank, one healer and two DPS to take the towers; groups with more players will need to send more healers and DPS as necessary. A general guideline to use is 40%-50% of the raid on tower duty, though this will vary with each specific raid team (some groups have reported success with sending all DPS to take the first tower while only leaving a tank and a handful of healers behind, with a \"standard-sized\" team then taking the second tower).\nSpeaking to the relevant faction leader will begin the encounter.\nPhase 1.\nHandling Ground Adds.\nMost of the abilities dealt by the adds will be handled in obvious ways (don\u2019t stand in the fire!). However, there are some general guidelines to follow:\nWhen a tower is about to open up, a mini-boss will spawn. Korgra the Snake will spawn with the southern tower, and simply needs to be nuked before she nukes the raid; players must however be careful to move away from the Dragonmaw Ebon Stalkers that she brings when they teleport behind raid members to avoid being one-shotted. High Enforcer Thranok will spawn with the northern tower, and needs to be faced away as he performs a cleave attack. Raid members need to get out of Skull Cracker range when Thranok uses this ability, as this another one-shot.\nAdds should be tanked and killed close to the NPCs (in particular, position them in Flamestrike/Blizzard), as the NPC's contribution to damage done is not insignificant.\nHandling Towers.\nOnce a tower opens up, a Kor\u2019kron Demolisher will spawn and fire projectiles at the tower. The Demolisher will need to be taken out urgently, as it will deal heavy damage to raid members in the tower (thus preventing them from doing their job).\nOnly once the Demolisher is down can the tower team proceed to take the tower. The team will need to fight their way to the top, where they will encounter a mini-boss (Lieutenant Krugruk on the southern tower, Master Cannoneer Dagryn on the northern tower). These mini-bosses are simple to deal with provided that players are quick to avoid their frontal cone attacks. Once the tower is cleared, one raid member can remain behind to use the Anti-Air Turret to kill the Dragonmaw Proto-Drakes flying above the raid.\nThe towers open up on a fixed schedule: the southern one will open 2 minutes into the encounter, and the northern run will open 2 minutes and 30 seconds after that.\nTransitioning into Phase 2.\nThe raid can only transition into Phase 2 once both towers are controlled by the raid. To transition, one raid member will need to enter each tower, and will need to simultaneously fire at Galakras (one turret alone is not sufficient, and neither is non-synchronized shooting with both turrets \u2013 both turrets must be fired at the same time). Doing so causes her to land and starts Phase 2.\nIt is important that these raid members only bring Galakras down once the ground is reasonably clear of adds, as bringing the boss down just after a new wave of adds spawns will result in an extremely problematic Phase 2.\nPhase 2.\nThe second phase is a simple burn phase with a soft enrage, reminiscent of the second phase of &lt;a href=\"Beth%27tilac\"&gt;Beth'tilac&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. The raid will need to expend all damage cooldowns (including &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt;) to kill Galakras before the stacking damage of Pulsing Flames becomes unhealable. As with Phase 1, the NPC's contribution towards damage done could mean the difference between a kill and a wipe, so Galakras should be positioned within range of the NPCs.\nThe main difficulty in this phase is handling Flames of Galakrond. The best way to handle this is for the tanks to face Galakras away, and for everyone else to stack up directly behind the boss in melee range, to allow AoE healing to benefit as many players as possible. When a player is targeted by a fireball, he merely has to step back and drop it a few yards behind the group. This will cause the fire balls to pass through as many raid members as possible, reducing the raid-wide damage that it deals when it hits the targeted player. The only caveat is the fire DoT that the ball applies to soakers; if the DoT stacks too high, players will simply need to run out of the group until their stacks expire, at which point they can safely return.\nTanks have a DoT of their own that they will need to handle through standard tank switching.\nSome players recommend having the melee on the boss, and the ranged be about 30 yards behind the melee. However, this makes healing more difficult, as it reduces the benefit of AoE healing, and it forces melee players to run back much farther to drop the fireball if they get targeted. The fireball does not seem to prefer non-melee, as other players have suggested.\nAchievement: The Immortal Vanguard.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Immortal%20Vanguard\"&gt;The Immortal Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; will, most likely, be earned on the raid's first kill of Galakras. The faction leaders are the only NPCs in any significant danger, and the encounter resets if they are not kept alive.\nTrivia.\nThis encounter is the first time &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; is seen without his signature armor, revealing his face.

He was a threat which five proto-dragons of varying colors united against. It is said that from him the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s created the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, but this is a rumor the Aspects actively encouraged so as to keep the truth about Galakrond a secret from the dragonflights so that no one would follow his path.\nHis size alone was greater than all of the Aspects combined, large enough that the only possible being Galakrond could be compared to was himself. His roar could be heard from miles around, and the flap of his wings generated powerful wind. As he continued to consume the life-energies of his fellow proto-dragons, Galakrond grew hideous mutations all over his body (such as limbs and even eyes) and his skin started to decay, almost as if he had become an undead like his victims. Galakrond was not always this large and he used to have a smoother, more streamlined appearance. His mutations were caused by cannibalizing on other proto-dragons, and as a by-product of his absorption of the proto-dragons' life essence, his vomited-up victims came back as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, called the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nGalakrond who once hunted with his fellow proto-dragons and was seen as benevolent suddenly changed and became terror that caused the other proto-dragons in prehistoric Azeroth to fear him. While the proto-dragons did not know what caused the change in Galakrond, &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; at least blames himself for Galakrond's actions and mutations, saying \"We never intended this path. Galakrond should never have journeyed in the direction he did, and we did not prevent it.\" Galakrond's mutations were caused by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; corrupting the waters which Galakrond drank from.\nOn a day when dozens gathered to hunt, Galakrond appeared and took their prey, terrifying them all. The blue-white proto-dragon &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; was curious as to why Galakrond would hunt in that area when he never had before, to which his new friend &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; responded that there was more food. Malygos, however, was quick to point out that the food was \"their\" food. In addition, Galakrond began to devour dozens of other &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, which was unthinkable to the others as they didn't practice cannibalism. However, the horror did not end there as it was revealed that those cannibalized by Galakrond rose as undead, called the &lt;a href=\"Not-living\"&gt;Not-living&lt;/a&gt;, enslaved to his will.\nAt Galakrond's command, the not-living hunted their living counterparts and infected those they bit. The proto-dragon &lt;a href=\"Coros\"&gt;Coros&lt;/a&gt; sought to emulate Galakrond believing that Galakrond would not devour those like him. To this end Coros would meet with Galakrond in secret and inform him of the time and place that &lt;a href=\"Talonixa\"&gt;Talonixa&lt;/a&gt;, the chosen alpha of the living proto-dragons, decided that the proto-dragon army would venture forth and attack Galakrond. Seemingly pleased with this information and the thought of the feast that he would have Galakrond flew off, seemingly sparing Coros and his fellow cohorts. However, as Coros and his band took off to the sky Galakrond returned and quickly devoured them all.\nDespite Talonixa learning of Coros's betrayal and striking at a different place and time, Galakrond was able to use not-living forces to lure the proto-dragon to him. Galakrond erupted from the ground when the army was in position and swiftly shattered it. After killing Talonixa, Galakrond was unable to devour the fast of the army due to the actions of Malygos, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;. As Malygos broke off to find &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, Galakrond ended up engaging in battle against the future aspects only to be driven off by Tyr after being stunned by his hammer.\nAn unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;mountain range to the north&lt;/a&gt; and that it was the perfect time to attack. After eating and gathering their strength Tyr and the others met up near Galakrond's slumbering place and would engage the behemoth in battle. During the course of the battle, Tyr's hammer and his &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; were knocked free from his person and as he reached out to grab the Spark, Galakrond's massive maw came within range and ended up claiming both the artifact and Tyr's hand. Pleased by his victory and being further mutated, Galakrond did not even notice when his enemies had left the battle.\nAfter regaining his senses Galakrond found himself unable to find prey as the living had become adept at hiding. With his hunger ever-growing Galakrond, in a move that stunned and surprised the future aspects, began to devour his own not-living as they were the only thing that would not hide from him. Despite his hunger, Galakrond was able to show restraint by keeping enough not-living to serve as a scouting force to hunt down his preferred prey: the living proto-dragons.\nWith Tyr out of commission from his wound, the proto-dragons had to battle Galakrond alone. Galakrond and his remaining not-living forces would eventually be attacked by the future Aspects, in what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle, Malygos would be able to lodge a boulder into Galakrond's throat; an action which not only saw Galakrond to focus his attention on dislodging it, instead of combating the others, but also forced him to release his hold on the remaining not-living who then began to attack one another. Despite his best efforts, the actions of Malygos's ice breaths would force the boulder to remain in the place and the boulder would ultimately be lodged further down his throat when Neltharion blasted a not-living into it, causing Galakrond to ultimately choke to death.\nWanting to keep the truth about Galakrond a secret in order to prevent others from following in his path, the aspects encouraged the rumor that the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s created them from Galakrond.\nAfter Galakrond's death, a fragment of his claw and of the boulder that killed him were recovered and placed in &lt;a href=\"Nal%20ks%27kol\"&gt;Nal ks'kol&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresent day.\nMore than 20,000 years later, a taunka named &lt;a href=\"Buniq\"&gt;Buniq&lt;/a&gt; was trying to prove herself worthy to her mate &lt;a href=\"Akiak\"&gt;Akiak&lt;/a&gt;. Akiak along with &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; found her corpse near the remains of Galakrond in Dragonblight. A bone fragment from his corpse was retrieved by Trag. He could see its potential and took it with him.\nSome time afterwards, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; put &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Necrolord%20Antiok\"&gt;Grand Necrolord Antiok&lt;/a&gt; in charge of an effort to raise Galakrond into &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. These plans were thwarted by adventurers who slew Antiok and ended his rituals.\nWhen Deathwing attacked Wyrmrest Temple for the second time, Galakrond's boneyard was used by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; as an assault point against &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing a meeting between the former aspects, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; discovered the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;--and later Tyr's hand--within Galakrond's skeleton. The artifact showed Kalecgos visions of the distant past, which caused him to learn the truth about Galakrond. As Kalec was rocked by these visions &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Galakrond's skeleton looking for a way to aid her love. Both Kalec and Jaina encounter the ghost of the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Buniq\"&gt;Buniq&lt;/a&gt; in their exploration's of Galakrond's skeleton (Jaina theorized her to be Tyr in disguise). After using the artifact to remind the other former aspects of their duties, Kalec thought he saw Tyr standing at &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Galakrond's Rest&lt;/a&gt;.\nGalakrond's bloodline continued into the present day, and his direct descendant &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt; was ridden by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeep within , a fresque depicting Galakrond's fall against the future Aspects can be found.\nGalakrond's corpse appears in the dungeon &lt;a href=\"Dawn%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Dawn of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt; as adventurers travel back in time to shortly after his defeat. Iridikron managed to take some of Galakrond's essence.\nIn Hearthstone.\nGalakrond is the central antagonist of the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", playing a similar role to &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; from \"&lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;Whispers of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;\". Galakrond appears as five different hero cards for each class representing the League of E.V.I.L., and a new mechanic, , directly upgrades him into a more powerful form. The hero cards representing him are as follows:\nWhen upgraded for the first time Galakrond becomes \" and when he's upgraded for the second time he becomes \".\nA \"Devastation\" is unleashed when playing when the hero already is Galakrond, the four devastations show Galakrond and his abilities:\nGalakrond is in the art of some class-specific cards in the \"Descent of Dragons\" set and \"\" adventure as well as an alternate skin in \"Battlegrounds\":\nSpeculation.\nMagic.\nWhen Galakrond started destroying the life essence of proto-dragons by consuming them, he underwent mutations. Eventually, he started to breathe a sickly green mist that Malygos described as \"slow death\" and reminded him \"much too much of that 'breathed' by the not-living.\" Those exposed to this mist became either lethargic as if their lives were slowly seeping out afterwards, or violent. \nThis ambiguity may be related to his multiple \"Hearthstone\" forms above."}

Seeking her love, &lt;a href=\"Akiak\"&gt;Akiak&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, came here and found her body as well as the skeleton of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. A nearby bone fragment from the &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;'s skull drew Trag's attention and felt its power.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; came to this massive boneyard and tried to raise Galakrond into undeath. However, they were eventually driven away by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;, before they could dig too deep.\nHour of Twilight.\nSeemingly abandoned by the undead since the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to halt the operation, the graveyard served as a rendezvous point with red drakes from Wyrmrest during the final events of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Asira%20Dawnslayer\"&gt;Asira Dawnslayer&lt;/a&gt;, Twilight agents ambushed &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;companions&lt;/a&gt; in order to stop them from reaching the temple.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nAfter a rather pointless meeting between the former &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; found himself drawn to Galakrond's Rest. He found an &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;artifact of an octagon shape&lt;/a&gt;, which was made of a metal he didn't recognize and surrounded by a lavender aura. Afraid that Galakrond would suddenly spring to life, Kalecgos returned to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; with the artifact.\nLater, he would return to get rid of the item, as it had tormented him with visions of prehistoric Azeroth and Galakrond. Kalecgos met Buniq, who said that some things should not remain buried. As she left, Kalecgos found a severed hand in the snow beneath Galakrond. It was grey and too large to be a human's, covered in the remains of a glove. An object which looked to be glass was held in the palm of the hand, and it fit into the artifact Kalecgos had found earlier perfectly.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was drawn into this location, after she thought she sensed Kalec calling her. At the bones, she found traces of the artifact's aura and the place where Kalec had dug the artifact. Soon, Buniq appeared and told Jaina about Kalec and a mysterious person arriving at the location. With newfound knowledge, Buniq departed, soon followed by Jaina returning to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce Kalec finished reliving the history of proto-dragons and Galakrond, the blue dragon met with the Aspects one more time at Wyrmrest, after which he flew away and believed that he saw &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; standing at Galakrond's Rest.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Galford\"&gt;Galford&lt;/a&gt; made a camp just above the resting place, seeking clues to help his order to claim &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;. Deeper in the area, he left his &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Sword\"&gt;broken sword&lt;/a&gt; among the bodies of many &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, and the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Buniq\"&gt;Buniq&lt;/a&gt; appeared when the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;paladin champion&lt;/a&gt; found it. She explained that Galford came here in quest of answers, and after his mind has been flooded by a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Spark of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, he then went to meet &lt;a href=\"Jotun\"&gt;Jotun&lt;/a&gt; who killed him in his madness."}

{"id": "395016", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=395016", "title": "Galell", "text": "Galell was the one-time apprentice of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, to whom he was very close. Surviving the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he eventually joined the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; order under Liadrin's leadership. He struggled greatly with his addiction to magic, recklessly overindulging in copious amounts of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy.\nHistory.\nAt some point, the young Galell accompanied his superior, Liadrin, and &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; in their mission to investigate a malfunctioning &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;. The group was ambushed and subdued by a raid of &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, who beat their captives (soon to include the ranger &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;) and brought them into a chamber for torture. Galell escaped his bindings and fought off several trolls in the confusion, landing his very first kill. He was safely warped from the danger by Dar'Khan Drathir. The experience was the beginning of a friendship between Galell and Lor'themar.\nThird War.\nGalell had grown into a fine priest over the years, though he, like most of the elves, was unprepared for what was about to befall on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. \nHe accompanied a ship of evacuated children during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion, ordered to sail away and take shelter with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Galell attempted to soothe the increasingly worried passengers, among them a young boy named &lt;a href=\"An%27dorvel\"&gt;An'dorvel&lt;/a&gt;. The ship was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and torn apart by &lt;a href=\"gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyles&lt;/a&gt;. Galell was assaulted by one such creature, who hurled him from the ship and across the water. Though Galell defeated his opponent, he could only watch helplessly as the ships sank, the screaming children still trapped beneath deck. He passed out from the horror and was thought dead by his comrades.\nGalell awoke to a very changed situation. He found himself in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, barely clinging to life. Almost ninety percent of the high elves had lost their lives in the massacre, among them the &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; had been defiled and the invaders had wrought a trail of destruction through the land. Lor'themar had taken over high elven leadership in the absence of the prince, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, who rushed back home from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to survey the carnage. Shaken to the core by the events that had transpired, Galell nonetheless mustered the strength to assist the prince in destroying the tainted well. He was also reunited with Liadrin and Lor'themar, the three enjoying a brief moment's peace. Though it took an effort to reestablish his connection with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, he succeeded and was a boon to the prince's team of volunteers. He was present to witness Kael's christening of the \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAftermath.\nGalell's life had not been easy in the years following the prince's departure. He had only infrequent contact with his old friends, and his innate addiction to the arcane manifested itself very strongly in the priest. He was a frequent patron of &lt;a href=\"Orovinn\"&gt;Orovinn&lt;/a&gt;, a shady elf who dealt in mana crystals. Galell was behind on his payments and threatened with violence should this remain the case. His relationship with the Light had also deteriorated; while Liadrin and many of the other priests had denounced it, Galell had simply found himself struggling to invoke it -- his brutal memories of the Scourge onslaught haunted him.\nGalell found a chance for a better life in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight order&lt;/a&gt;, founded by Liadrin herself. Galell was inducted into it by his old mentor, who believed that helping Galell find the Light again -- even if he had to force it to recognize him -- would do him some good.\nThe opposite proved to be the case. Dealing with &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; was difficult for many knights, and the experience hit Galell hard. His continued abuse of mana crystals, coupled with the creature's voice (which reminded him unduly of breaking glass and the screaming children), had Galell sink further into his addiction to magic. Galell used his payments in the order to acquire copious amounts of mana crystals from Orovinn, and recklessly overused them. He murdered his dealer and strung him up at the &lt;a href=\"Shepherd%27s%20Gate\"&gt;Shepherd's Gate&lt;/a&gt;, fleeing the scene with his coveted crystals.\nGalell fled to the old troll sacrificial chamber, which had become abandoned and worn down over the years; there, he used up his final crystals. His abuse of mana had warped him into a &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt;-like appearance, though still he craved more. He was confronted by Liadrin, who attempted to reason with the increasingly unstable Galell, though the priest lunged at his former mentor and attempted to kill her. Crazed and traumatized, Galell ranted and raved of his past experiences, until Liadrin finally dealt him a killer blow.\nGalell's death weighed heavily on Liadrin. It marked the first time she had questioned whether the Blood Knights' path was correct, and mourned for him deeply with Lor'themar.\nHeritage of the blood elves.\nA vision of Galell can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Astalor\"&gt;Magister Astalor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falon\"&gt;Falon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solanar\"&gt;Solanar&lt;/a&gt; in visions from the past during the Heritage of the Sin'dorei questline.\nPersonality.\nGalell was a kind and empathetic elf. He was enamored with Liadrin, though she always viewed him as more of a younger brother. He believed strongly in the bond of friendship he shared with Liadrin and Lor'themar, though unlike the other two, he never truly managed to face his demons: he was forever haunted by his experiences in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and succumbed to his addiction to magic without moderation. Part of why Liadrin founded the Blood Knights was to find balance in her lifestyle, something her apprentice would sadly never achieve. He had been traumatized during the Third War by imagining the screaming of the children aboard the three sinking ships meant to carry them to safety, and hearing Mu'ru, whose voice sometimes sounded like the screams of hundreds of children, and an apparently traumatic experience fighting off several trolls, slaughtering them, leaving pieces strewn across the ground, was what eventually finally unhinged him fully to the point he murdered Orovinn in cold blood and strung him up in front of the Shepherds Gate, only to have trouble remembering the event later. Before he was killed, he kept muttering, laughing hysterically, \"knock, knock knock, knocking at my door... Orovinn knocks no more...\"."}

He took leadership of Stromgarde following the ultimate demise of his father &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. After his death at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; seeking &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, he was resurrected on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and sought to obtain the sword for her. Around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, he declared himself king of a now undead-inhabited Stromgarde, but was ultimately slain by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nPrince Galen Trollbane was the only heir to Stromgarde's throne, as the only son of King &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, and was also the leader of the city's defenders. At some point during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he murdered his own father. Not long after the assassination of King Thoras, Stromgarde came under siege by forces of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist%20clan\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. The Syndicate and the Boulderfist ogres won several victories against the weakened kingdom and occupied most of its territory, including part of the capital city.\nGalen took the command of the forces of Stromgarde and desperately tried to retake the ruined kingdom. He personally took charge of guarding the &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Stromgarde%20Keep%29\"&gt;Trollbane family crypt&lt;/a&gt;, which safeguarded several ancient artifacts. After recognizing the vastly changed circumstances since his father's death, he agreed to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nA &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Zengu\"&gt;Zengu&lt;/a&gt; sought the sword &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, known as a legendary bane of trolls and heirloom of the Trollbane family, so that the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; could use it against the trolls of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. The sword had been sealed in Thoras Trollbane's tomb since his death and opening the tomb required several sigils that were guarded by Stromgarde's fiercest warriors. &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Trollbane\"&gt;The last of these sigils&lt;/a&gt; was guarded by Galen Trollbane himself. He was slain near &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; who subsequently claimed the sword.\nCataclysm.\nGalen Trollbane was later resurrected by the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Forsaken apothecaries&lt;/a&gt; under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and seemingly pledged his allegiance to her. Making camp at the aptly-named &lt;a href=\"Galen%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Galen's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, he learned from &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Alina\"&gt;Dark Ranger Alina&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Zengu\"&gt;Zengu&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated by Stromgarde troops when he attempted to leave &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; and the sigils and sword retaken. Galen himself then tasked Horde adventurers with reclaiming Trol'kalar, constantly remarking that he was doing everything for Sylvanas.\nLegion.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt; in hand, he abandoned Sylvanas and the Forsaken and rallied his undead citizens and soldiers. He declared himself the king of the ruined kingdom of Stromgarde, which he intended to rule independently from the Alliance and the Horde. He was soon targeted by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; death knights who wanted to raise his father as one of their &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;. Galen promised to open his father's tomb with Trol'kalar if the death knights cleared the last of the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; presence from Stromgarde, but turned against them because he didn't want to hand Stromgarde back to his father and to keep Thoras's murder a secret. Galen defended himself with Trol'kalar but was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Deathlord of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who then raised Thoras. Thoras revealed to the Deathlord that he already knew that it was his son who had murdered him.\nPersonality.\nFollowing his resurrection as a Forsaken, Galen became even more somber and reserved. Galen briefly mourned the death of his former cavalry leader &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Valorcall\"&gt;Lieutenant Valorcall&lt;/a&gt;, only to stop and state his former existence now means nothing to him.\nIn \"\", Galen's true color is revealed. He is ambitious, selfish and tends to use others to get what he wants before double crossing them when he no longer needs them. He murdered his own father, possibly in order to hasten his ascension as king. When he lost portions of Stromgarde to the Syndicate, ogres, and forest trolls, he allied with the Alliance to regain the lost territories and hold off Forsaken intrusions. After his death and resurrection, he allied with the Forsaken and ordered attacks on his own countrymen and the Alliance. He claimed that he saw himself merely as an instrument of the Banshee Queen's will and sought to use Trol'kalar solely for her benefit. When he finally gained Trol'kalar and Stromgarde, he broke off from the Forsaken and kept both for himself. When the Knights of the Ebon Blade wanted to retrieve Trol'kalar and his father, he tricked them into getting rid of the remaining forest troll infestation and once again tried to double cross them.\nIn the RPG.\nDuring his rule, Galen was a friendly and determined but also desperate lad, despite his hard-pressed effort to hold his city. The young man has a dark, brooding look about him. His eyes are sunken as if from a prolonged lack of sleep, and his skin is pale. He is dressed in expensive clothes with a silken cloak flowing behind him. He appears to be of noble blood and carries himself with sullen arrogance. A curved knife is sheathed at his belt.\nGalen still reels from the emotional shock of his father's assassination and has run himself ragged trying quickly to form patchwork alliances with other nobles. Not thinking clearly, Galen responds to any perceived insults recklessly, issuing immediate challenges to duel. If he becomes cornered in melee, Galen fights defensively until his bodyguards can come to his aid. Whenever Galen appears about to lose, he attempts to stop fighting, grudgingly issues an apology and offers some gold as compensation.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nThe Dark Lady watch over you...\nGossip.\nThe kingdom of Stromgarde is mine by birthright. With the legendary Trol'kalar in hand, none can dispute my rule. Not even &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;!"}

The land was wet and she rushed because she wanted to attend her grandfather &lt;a href=\"Otue\"&gt;Otue&lt;/a&gt;'s stories in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. She fell and broke the jug. From now on, she was always careful. When she showed her druidic abilities, she left &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to join the Circle. Later, a Cenarion Circle &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; took her as an apprentice. When &lt;a href=\"Master%20Thal%27darah\"&gt;Master Thal'darah&lt;/a&gt; gave word that he is looking for a new apprentice, Galena quickly joined him in &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Overlook\"&gt;Thal'darah Overlook&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the only tauren in the outpost.\nAt some point after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; and his friends arrived to the outpost. Galena quickly greeted them and became friends with Aram's dryad companion, &lt;a href=\"Taryndrella\"&gt;Taryndrella&lt;/a&gt;. As Aram wanted to severe the bond between him and the dryad, Thal'darah agreed and asked Galena to assist him in the ritual. She and Drella then harvested some &lt;a href=\"%3AWild%20Steelbloom\"&gt;:Wild Steelbloom&lt;/a&gt; for the ritual in which she assisted her master directly, which, however, went without success. Later, she noticed that Aram and Drella were gone. She used acorns and her druidic magic to learn their location. She magicked them in the north. Quickly grabbing stuff that she needed, the tauren told &lt;a href=\"Aiyell\"&gt;Aiyell&lt;/a&gt; that she would return shortly once she finds an item she had dropped in the woods."}

The champion of the Light then found the crushed corpse of the paladin and fought Jotun, who handed them the Spark of Tyr in a moment of lucidity. After the battle, Lanigosa promised to return Galford's remains. The paladin hero later brought the artifact back to Travard who learned with sadness of his brother's death."}

His ghost is located on the northwest coast of the island and is only visible while dead. He is one of several ghosts on the island. \nZazla's testimony of his past is difficult to piece together. Zazla was involved in a shipwreck and was taken captive. During his captivity, he was slated for execution but was saved by &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;. It was around his liberation that his captors died and he relished in their passing. It is assumed after this Zazla would work for the Faire in relative peace until his sudden death.\nSpeculations.\nIt could be worth speculating that Zazla died at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Rona%20Greenteeth\"&gt;Rona Greenteeth&lt;/a&gt;, whom happens to sell various foods that originate from her victims of various races. This is reinforced by the fact that Rona sells meat bearing reference to troll remains.\nIf Rona did not kill Zazla, then he possibly died at the hand of wildlife or some other means.\nIt could be theorized that Silas Darkmoon and his carnies killed Zazla's captors. This is a possibility because it is revealed in \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20Runs%20Thicker\"&gt;Blood Runs Thicker&lt;/a&gt;\" that Silas has no problem with using violence to protect his family of the Faire against those who threaten them. If Zazla's captors threatened to execute him for working with the Faire, then Silas and his carnies did whatever it took to protect one of their own.\nThe shipwreck that Zazla mentions could be any of the shipwrecks scattered around Darkmoon Island. The closest wreck is by his ghost off the west coast."}

Weaved entirely of metallic threads, the &lt;a href=\"cloak\"&gt;cloak&lt;/a&gt; was marked with &lt;a href=\"rune\"&gt;rune&lt;/a&gt;s similar to those from the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Disks of Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. Despite repeated requests from the high councils of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and Bael Modan, Zecker never presented himself or the cloak for inspection. Now, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; know why.\nWhen the cloak was closely examined after his disappearance, it was discovered that its properties were the result of ingenious construction rather than the blessings of the &lt;a href=\"titans\"&gt;titans&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves who once treated the cloak and Zecker with reverence immediately condemned both. Still, the cloak remains widely admired by &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s for its amazing array of protective properties, especially the weave of metallic threads that tighten and stiffen to absorb the force of blows. Tinkers have begun to attempt to reverse-engineer the cloak, finding Zecker's brilliance a difficult act to follow. A collective of tinkers in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; has begun to craft replicas of Zecker's Cloak, but they remain difficult to construct and expensive to purchase."}

Sceptics claim that the &lt;a href=\"cloak\"&gt;cloak&lt;/a&gt; isn\u2019t as ingenious as his other inventions, but the believers say he doesn\u2019t have the same workshop that he did in the past, and he works with the materials he has.\nWoven entirely of two-toned metal wires thinner than silk and highly polished, this cloak reflects everything around it when donned.

Six feet of polished wood bound in silver and gems, the staff could shoot a jet of flame on command and just as quickly snuff a roaring campfire. It could release a bolt of lightning or a peal of thunder. It allowed Zecker to walk through the air as though clouds were stone. The iron globe clutched next to the blade mounted at the staffs tip could glow as brightly as a star, shedding warmth and light, or it could absorb heat until the surrounding area was sheathed in ice.\nAfter Zecker's disappearance, his staff \u2014 now revealed as technological trickery \u2014 was purchased by a wealthy &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;. In a process that lasted two years, the elf slowly took apart the staff to learn its secrets. Shortly thereafter, he realized that he couldn't put it back together. While the elf continues his quest to reassemble the work of the master tinker, he has trained his apprentices to recreate some of the effects. These lesser staves, known as \"Zecker's Firestaves\", still have a variety of functions.\nUses.\nUsing the staff requires a knowledge of technology and the expenditure of liquid &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt;, as noted for each different function. One of the most innovative aspects of Zecker's \"staff of the elements\" is a system that holds charges of liquid phlogiston and feeds them to the stave's functions as needed. Zecker's Firestaves hold a maximum of six phlogiston charges."}

His father told him &lt;a href=\"Saurfang%20facts\"&gt;tales&lt;/a&gt; about Saurfang and how he could slaughter ten enemies with a single blow. Zekhan eventually joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s war effort.\nHe later became a companion of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; into his self-imposed exile; acting as one of the few Saurfang trusted during that time. He remained at the High Overlord's side until Saurfang's death, inspired to carry on his legacy. He later became a Horde &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nZekhan comes from a small jungle &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; on the shore of the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiege of Lordaeron.\nOn the eve of the battle, Zekhan found Saurfang atop the keep's walls, observing the camping &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces. Zekhan asked him for advice since this was to be his first battle and told him about his eagerness to die with honor and glory. Saurfang's only advice to him was not to die, and he added that there was no honor or glory in this war. The orc then went to meet the Alliance head on and alone, but Zekhan rushed to him and convinced him to live another day by returning &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh's&lt;/a&gt; necklace that Varok had left to burn on the walls. Varok took it, the same way he retrieved it from Dranosh's body, and returned back behind the walls just as the battle began.\nIn front of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, he charged, along with the rest of the Horde soldiers, inspired by Saurfang's battle cry, who took up the Horde banner and pushed forward.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAt the climax of the Siege of Lordaeron, Saurfang was captured by the Alliance and imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. He refused to go with the Horde when they broke into the prison, saying he would never return to the Horde as long as &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; ruled it. Some time later, Saurfang broke out of his cell via the sewers and traveled into &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where he ran into Zekhan. Knowing that Sylvanas would send assassins after him, Saurfang told Zekhan to watch the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Pass\"&gt;Redridge Pass&lt;/a&gt; for any sign of Horde agents and to warn him if there were. With that Saurfang continued into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt; and set up camp at &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Reed%20Farm\"&gt;Misty Reed Farm&lt;/a&gt;. Zekhan would later run into a Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who had trailed Saurfang alongside &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lyana\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lyana&lt;/a&gt; on Sylvanas's orders. After imploring them for to aid Saurfang, the adventurer can choose to aid Zekhan in his mission or refuse.\nThose who choose to aid Zekhan are informed that Lyana was sent to kill Saurfang and faced with this knowledge the two rush to Saurfang's side. Lyana accused Saurfang of turning his back on his duty and then conspiring with humans against Sylvanas. Zekhan and a Horde adventurer arrived and stood by Saurfang after all he had done for the Horde. When Lyana and her forces were killed, Saurfang told Zekhan and the adventurer to return to Orgrimmar and make it look like Saurfang escaped, to keep the adventurer in Sylvanas's favor, and so Zekhan could spread the word in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; that those who wish to restore the honor of the Horde must not give up hope. Promising his friends to see them again, Saurfang traveled further west into the swamp.\nThose who reject Zekhan's mission instead report to Sylvanas Windrunner, who after being informed of the situation remarks that she has special plans for Zekhan.\nRevolution.\nZekhan staunchly supported Saurfang in his revolution against Sylvanas. Residing outside of Saurfang's command center, he was present as the revolutionaries and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; secured the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;. Before the final battle against Sylvanas could commence, Saurfang recognized that the loyalist soldiers were also fellow brothers and sisters of the Horde. Unwilling to spill more Horde blood, Saurfang challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. As Saurfang and Sylvanas prepared to do battle, Zekhan approached to help, only to be stopped by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Zekhan, among the countless present, bore witness to the duel between Saurfang and Sylvanas. Where, upon gaining the upper hand, Saurfang was able to force Sylvanas into admitting that the Horde meant nothing to her. In a final act of treachery, Sylvanas killed Saurfang and abandoned the Horde. The remainder of Sylvanas's forces surrendered to the revolution and Alliance forces, reuniting the Horde. In the aftermath of Saurfang's death, Thrall, Zekhan, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; carried his body into the now open gates of Orgrimmar. \nAlong with most of the Horde, Zekhan attended Saurfang's funeral. Despite knowing that Saurfang's death was a possibility, it did not make accepting the loss any easier. The troll saw Saurfang as an inspiration, a symbol. Saurfang drove Zekhan to be better and stronger, like his father before him. Zekhan declared that it was time to live up their examples and to make them both proud. With that, he decided to visit the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; orphanage and recount stories of Saurfang to the orphans.\nZekhan appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Vision of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; where he is helping fellow shaman.\nShadows Rising.\nZekhan attended a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting where he served as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s page. The meeting was ultimately adjourned by Thrall due to the friction between the council members. In the aftermath, the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of death &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, sensing a threat against &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s life, guided Zekhan into saving her when he pushed him into a Zandalari servant who was carrying poison for Talanji. Zekhan quickly noticed the poison and helped to fend off the assassin. Then at the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Earthshrine\"&gt;Western Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;, he was telling children about it, when he was recalled to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;. With everyone being unaware of what Bwonsamdi had done, Zekhan was declared a hero with &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; going as far to declare that he had the reflexes of &lt;a href=\"Kimbul\"&gt;Kimbul&lt;/a&gt;. Soon afterward, the Horde Council empowered with him the critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her.\nThus, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;General Rakera&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt; accused him of being a &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spy&lt;/a&gt;, to which Zekhan admitted that he was. He stated that the Horde simply worried about Talanji as they want her friendship and won't be giving up on her. Talanji declared that they could have sent worse, noting privately to herself that they could have Thrall, whom she might never trust for his stubborn loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Though tempted to send Zekhan away, Talanji decided to give him a chance which proved beneficial when he later aided her against a second assassination attempt by a war band of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Talanji and Zanchuli Council discussed the threat, Bwonsamdi declared that he and Zekhan made quite a team, referred to him as little zappy boy, and thanked for him protecting his investment. After remarking that there was a sickness in the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;his own realm&lt;/a&gt;, he offered Zekhan a bargain; if Zekhan took a vision of death from him, then the troll would make sure that one thing would happen. After a moment of thought, Zekhan agreed and was informed that he must ensure that the Zandalari remain with the Horde, Talanji must sit on the council, and to make her see that this was the best for Zandalar, and even better best for Bwonsamdi. The loa then granted Zekhan a vision of how Varok Saurfang reunited with his &lt;a href=\"Dranosh\"&gt;loved&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Remda\"&gt;ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Zekhan reported the second assassination on Talanji to the Horde Council, Rokhan personally arrived to Dazar'alor in order to help Talanji against the Widow's Bite. Though Zekhan felt that he failed to get Talanji to call upon the Horde for aid, Bwonsamdi remarked to him that the Zanchuli Council and Bwonsamdi himself saw something powerful in him, while telling him not to give up. Soon after, he became caught off by the arrival of Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; who revealed that they had uncovered that the Widow's Bite were working together with the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. This motivated Talanji to call her forces for direct battle against the threat by ordering them into &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; as well call on the Horde for aid.\nZekhan decided to join the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; forces moving into Nazmir, where they discovered their enemies attempting to sacrifice children in order to weaken one of Bwonsamdi's shrines. Thanks to his courage, the children were saved, and due to their smaller amount of numbers, the loyalists and their new allies fell back. However, as the battle ended, the tar was lit and the flames engulfed Zekhan, his soul falling into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Bwonsamdi subsequently yanked him from the Maw and placed his soul back into his body. Once Zekhan awake, he realized that Bwonsamdi had sent him a false vision of death, and it was then that the loa revealed to Talanji and Zekhan about the Maw, how everyone was going there now, and it was taking all he had left just to keep as many &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s away from there that he could. The children he had rescued went on to call him the Light of Shoal'jai.\nDue to his injuries, Zekhan would be forced to remain in Dazar'alor, as the Horde and Zandalari ultimately defeated their enemies and saved Bwonsamdi. He soon joined the Horde in celebrating their victory and was pleased to learn that Talanji would be taking her place on the Horde Council. Talanji personally wished him farewell where he revealed that it was a pleasure to serve and that he hoped to meet her again. She then declared that when Zandalar was strong, she would personally come to Orgrimmar to visit him.\nExploring Azeroth.\nZekhan, joined by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and his animal companions, per the command of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; made the perilous journey across the lush and vivid reaches of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to learn the secrets of the realm and check on the Horde holdings, in order to assess the needs and statuses of the people, how the wounds from the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; were healing, and where there were still aches within the Horde. Zekhan later sent them word about what he learned: that war took from all and how he found hope in seeing their Horde brothers and sisters rebuilding their outposts and homes, the hope in the songs and stories booming from their hearths, and ultimately hope in the Horde's future in every corner of Kalimdor.\nFollowing this, Zekhan joined Rexxar in his farewell to &lt;a href=\"Huelo\"&gt;Huelo&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Zekhan, who served as &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s plus one, was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the ceremony, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; stood with them, and during the reception, he spoke with the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; brothers and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. He also briefly met with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;."}

Unfortunately by the time the witch doctors realized that &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; had been slowly cutting off from the loa, they were powerless to stop. In shame, Zen'tabra and the other witch doctors ignored &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s call to retreat and fled into the southern end of the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. That night Zen'tabra had a vision in which she was approached by the ancient raptor loa &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt; and transported to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. After being informed that Zalazane's mindless slaves were killing the beasts on the isles and hearing Gonk's request to save them, Zen'tabra and the other witch doctors began studying druidism. \nAfter successfully becoming druids, as learning in the Emerald Dream hurries the process along, Zen'tabra and her fellow druids tried to stay unnoticed by Zalazane, whose mind servants were able to kill a few of them. Despite these losses, they remained focused on keeping the isles alive until Vol'jin and the Darkspear returned to &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;reclaim their former home&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Vanira\"&gt;Vanira&lt;/a&gt;'s frog spies discovered Zen'tabra she was fought in her &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Matriarch\"&gt;tiger form&lt;/a&gt; and then recruited to join the attack on Zalazane by Horde adventurers. As Vol'jin began the battle, Zen'tabra brought the beasts of the isles to help the Horde forces. After aiding the Darkspear in proving their worth to &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, she aids in killing &lt;a href=\"Jun%27do%20the%20Traitor\"&gt;Jun'do the Traitor&lt;/a&gt; and heeds Vol'jin's warning that Zalazane is cunning and strong with the voodoo. After a fierce battle with Zalazane he flees. Zen'tabra changes into a bat to find him. After discovering it she informs Vol'jin and warns him that Zalazane was working some black magic. \nVol'jin, perhaps in an act of mercy for his former friend, offers Zalazane the chance to surrender, only for Zalazane to reveal that he has lured Vol'jin's strike force into a trap. Zalazane quickly gains control of the Darkspear warriors and forces them to fight Vol'jin and the rest of the Horde strike force. After seeing his trap fail Zalazane says that it doesn't matter as no living thing can make its way through his barrier and as such the Echo Isles will be his to rule forever. Zen'tabra then witnesses Bwonsamdi's appearance. Bwonsamdi tells Zalazane that the dead Darkspear are his domain, and then kills Zalazane. After Vol'jin mentions that it was a fitting end to one so foul Zen'tabra declares that her fate is now entwined with Vol'jin's.\nCataclysm.\nAfterwards, Zen'tabra was the messenger or among the messengers who successfully convinced the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; to accept the Darkspear tribe into their ranks. The only detail of this known is that Zen'tabra found the look on a &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; member's face amusing.\nZen'tabra now helps train new druid recruits on the Darkspear isle.\nLater, she was in Hyjal during the beginning of the assault on the Firelands at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; flying around in the form of a bat.\nEscalation.\nZen'tabra has been taken as a prisoner of war and is held captive at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;. She was later freed by agents of the . She is later relocated at the now troll taken &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, where she introduces the Alliance representative to Vol'jin.\nLegion.\nThe Cenarion Circle planned to move the bulk of its forces to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; the ancient forest where &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; taught &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, in order to combat the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, Zen'tabra, &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;druid hero&lt;/a&gt; opened a portal to the Emerald Dream at the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;, allowing their forces to move swiftly over vast distances.\nZen'tabra was later part of a small party led by Hamuul that also consisted of &lt;a href=\"Skylord%20Omnuron\"&gt;Skylord Omnuron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celestine%20of%20the%20Harvest\"&gt;Celestine of the Harvest&lt;/a&gt;. They traveled to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to investigate reports of a demonic presence in the area. Overwhelmed, they were soundly defeated and the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; was almost completely destroyed. The arrival of the druid hero and &lt;a href=\"Lyessa%20Bloomwatcher\"&gt;Lyessa Bloomwatcher&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to cleanse &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir%2C%20the%20Mother%20Tree\"&gt;G'Hanir, the Mother Tree&lt;/a&gt;, was their salvation, and the three druids were healed just in time to battle &lt;a href=\"Destromath\"&gt;Destromath&lt;/a&gt;. Destromath was defeated when the newly cleansed G'Hanir was used to summon many &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s to defeat him, and afterwards Zen'tabra stayed behind to ensure that Omnuron and &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;his forces&lt;/a&gt; could reestablish themselves on the mountain.\nShe was later part of the druids that communed with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; beneath Nordrassil.

The exact speed is not displayed, but appears to be 170% while flying. \nNotes.\nAlthough not as fast as a flying mount, it does have a few advantages. It is instant cast, and can be activated while falling. You cannot use spells or combat abilities, but mounts and items in your inventory can be activated without breaking flight even if they have a casting time. Quest and resource nodes can also be collected in the air, and enemy mobs without ranged abilities will ignore your presence as long as you are off the ground. It is especially convenient for fishing, as multiple pools can be quickly gone through without needing to find places to stand.\nIf an aggressive enemy switches you into combat, you will be \"dismounted\" (even if you are not taking damage) and will parachute to the ground.\nRather than for traveling, it is more of a specialized utility power to prevent fall damage and gather resources without interference from enemies, as well as changing flying mounts in mid-air. It cannot be activated during combat, so it is not an \"escape\" power like a &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe monk can still start a &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20Fire\"&gt;Cooking Fire&lt;/a&gt;; use &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; from a safe distance; use Guild Perks such as &lt;a href=\"Mobile%20Banking\"&gt;Mobile Banking&lt;/a&gt;; change their worn &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt;; and use items which are not specifically classified as &lt;a href=\"toy\"&gt;toy&lt;/a&gt;s, such as the &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Hearthstone\"&gt;Garrison Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Hearthstone\"&gt;Dalaran Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Coordination\"&gt;Cloak of Coordination&lt;/a&gt; (although a regular &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; seems to cancel the effect).\nThey can also use certain monk abilities and talents, such as &lt;a href=\"Soothing%20Mist\"&gt;Soothing Mist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Essence%20Font\"&gt;Essence Font&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fortifying%20Brew\"&gt;Fortifying Brew&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Elixirs\"&gt;Healing Elixirs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Peace\"&gt;Ring of Peace&lt;/a&gt;."}

It teleports the monk to the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Peak of Serenity&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Dawning%20Light\"&gt;The Dawning Light&lt;/a&gt; it instead teleports the monk to &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Five%20Dawns\"&gt;Temple of Five Dawns&lt;/a&gt;. However, a portal leading back to the Peak of Serenity is provided on the steps leading from the temple, halfway down on the southwest side.\nNotes.\nThis is the monk equivalent of and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt;. However, it has some uniquely different subtleties.\nThe obvious difference is that Zen Pilgrimage has a long cooldown, the less obvious distinction is that it is different from normal travel to the Peak of Serenity. \nAttempting to leave on foot to get to another area of Kun-Lai Summit teleports you back inside the building; the only way out is by using Zen Pilgrimage again or by another means of teleportation, such as a &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;. However, players with flying mounts can fly to the Peak of Serenity and are not subject to the same restrictions when leaving it.\nDespite the spell referring to \"your spirit\" and \"leaving your body behind\", this is a true teleport: you actually disappear at the former location and appear bodily at the Peak, and are not subject to any different game mechanics.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, which restores your exact location when teleporting you out of the dungeon (including placing you back on a flight path or mount, if any), Zen Pilgrimage does not save your location with such precision. It only saves information about the zone in which you were. When you return from the Peak, you are teleported to the nearest graveyard in the zone.\nSince &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2.0\"&gt;patch 5.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, there are portals to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; at the Peak, which can be taken if you get stuck and cannot teleport out by other means. Previously, it was possible for monks to become trapped at the Peak of Serenity, with &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Friend\"&gt;Summon Friend&lt;/a&gt; and the unstuck suicide feature simply teleporting them to either the Shrine of the Ox or the Peak graveyard. Players were however able to escape by queueing for a dungeon and Hearthstoning from there, or using a mage portal.\nFor some time, it was possible to use Zen Pilgrimage in such a way that, in practical terms, monks had a second Hearthstone much like shamans' &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Recall\"&gt;Astral Recall&lt;/a&gt;. Blizzard seemed to introduce a fix by causing the buff \"Zen Pilgrimage: Return\" to be removed if the monk left Peak of Serenity via any means other than using Zen Pilgrimage (which also causes the buff to be removed, once the player is returned). However, the February 28, 2014, hotfix has reverted this; monks can once again use Zen Pilgrimage as a kind of second hearthstone.\nThis spell cannot be used by &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; monks to leave their starting zone without first completing it. However, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; monks can use it to leave &lt;a href=\"Kezan%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The only way to get back is to use this spell's return function or a &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;. This spell cannot be used on &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Exile's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, either."}

Berating himself for not trusting &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;'s warnings, Zzeraku tried to seek out Tyrygosa's council on what to do next but as he roamed Azeroth, he was eventually captured by Zendarin Windrunner, who trapped him in &lt;a href=\"Balacgos%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Balacgos's Bane&lt;/a&gt;. Zendarin delivered the dragon to his mistress Sinthria. Sintharia, now calling herself &lt;a href=\"Sinestra\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, little by little fed the nether dragon to her newest creation, the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight of the Dragon.\nAs a child Zendarin dreamed of rising among the ranks of the high elves, and become a strong and powerful noble. Like his cousin Vereesa, he never did truly fit the mold of high elf society, but he still sought to accomplish these goals through honest means. When the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, Zendarin's hunger for magic caused him to embrace the technique of &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;mana draining&lt;/a&gt;. As a blood elf, he became focused on one thing: gain more magical power to satiate his addiction and also to strengthen himself so that he may take more power from others. Zendarin eventually gained a notorious reputation for his unseemly deeds.\nZendarin and a group of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; attacked Rom and his dwarven group who were interrogating a &lt;a href=\"skardyn\"&gt;skardyn&lt;/a&gt;. They fled after a roar of a dragon.\nZendarin unsuccessfully tried to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;'s twin sons, &lt;a href=\"Galadin\"&gt;Galadin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Giramar\"&gt;Giramar&lt;/a&gt;, because he thought the offspring of a high elf and a human wizard would be powerful. Zendarin despised humans, thinking them as little more than animals, and didn't have a much higher opinion of Vereesa (and likely also of &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;), who had married and had children with a human.\nThough Zendarin helped Sinestra create the twilight flight in the promise of being shown new sources of magical energy to sate his addiction, he had his own reasons for allying with her: he secretly wished to take control of &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt; as a magic source and his own personal &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and tried to do so with a final feeding to make him his slave. Sinestra had foreseen all however, and simply made Zendarin's betrayal a part of her plans, which resulted in his failure and escape from the hungry twilight dragon. Zendarin then sought to steal the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; (possibly as an alternate magic source having failed to take Dargonax, or as a secondary objective), the foul creation of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; that had been destroyed by Rhonin years earlier. He would have pulled it off if not for Vereesa's intervention, which resulted in the destruction of the Demon Soul - and of Zendarin himself - when the stolen staff of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; touched the artifact.\nSpeculation.\nAs a mage, he may have been a member of the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;."}

They housed their growing libraries and research laboratories in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, a towering spire raised by magic in the heart of the city.\nHowever, the constant and ungoverned use of magic began to tear the fabric of reality around the city and demons started to slip back into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, bringing with them conflict and misery and sowing considerable confusion and chaos within the streets of Dalaran. Most of these demonic encounters were isolated events, and the ruling Magocrats did what they could to keep such events hidden from the public.\nFearing that the peasants would revolt and that Strom would take action against them, the Magocrats turned to the only group they felt would understand their particular problem: the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon hearing the ruling &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; archmagi news of demonic activity in the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;thriving magocracy&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; quickly dispatched their mightiest wizards to the lands of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; in order to investigate and report. As a result, they informed the Magocrats that as long as they used magic, they would need to protect their people from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the elves and the Magocrats formed a secret order known as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, charged to fight a never-ending secret war against the Legion.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; became the chief center of learning for magicians throughout the land, the Magocrat lords founded the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;: a specialized sect charged with cataloging and researching every spell, artifact, and magic item known to mankind at the time. The Kirin Tor eventually replaced the Magocrats at the head of Dalaran."}

The Magram were once willing to befriend adventurers of the Horde and Alliance in exchange for doing evil acts towards the Gelkis clan, while under &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Jehn\"&gt;Khan Jehn&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership. &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Kammah\"&gt;Khan Kammah&lt;/a&gt; now leads the clan.\nThe Magram held no alliance with their brother tribes, until some time after having lost their lands to the demons.\nHistory.\nOriginally led by the Third Khan Magra, the Magram situated themselves against the mountain ranges of Desolace when the centaur divided into five tribes and have remained there ever since.\nBefore the death of Magra, he installed the idea that strength was essential and the tribe\u2019s survival depended on their fighting spirit. When their brother tribe of Gelkis centaur spoke out against this notion, arguing that Theradras always watches over the centaur and will keep the tribes safe and alive, an eternal feud between the two tribes was born.\nThe life-long pursuit of strength has carried on through the Khans of Magram to this day, turning them violent and determined. To solidify their title as the strongest the tribe still fights fiercely to weaken or destroy their brother clans, viewing the Kolkar as weak, the Gelkis as nothing more than a nuisance, and the &lt;a href=\"Maraudine\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt; as a formidable enemy.\nIt can be assumed that the Magram\u2019s culture has developed into revolving around strength worship above all else. When compared to the Gelkis, the Magram hold very primitive forms of speech and social structure. For example, their grasp of common is limited and the position of Khan would likely be sought through a death match of sorts.\n&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces sent by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; quickly discovered that the centaur were slaughtering their other tribes just as much as they were attacking outsiders. When they investigated further they met &lt;a href=\"Warug\"&gt;Warug&lt;/a&gt;, who told them of the origins of the centaur and Theradras's recent actions, how she had empowered the centaur because she feared the Horde would drive them to extinction. The Horde allied with Warug and the Magram, who held no loyalty to Theradras unlike the other clans, to suppress the other tribes. They then entered Maraudon and slew Theradras. Their victory halted the spreading corruption in Desolace and stopped the violent bloodlust in the centaur. With the Horde's blessing, the Magram became the leaders of the united centaur and led them to an age of tranquility. Yet none knew how long they would stay on the path of peace.\nCataclysm.\nThis changed when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and their demon master took their home, forcing them out to the north where they slaughtered the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20clan\"&gt;Kolkar clan&lt;/a&gt; and took their homes as their own. Since then they have become untrustful of outsiders and openly attack anyone that approaches their &lt;a href=\"Magram%20Territory\"&gt;new land&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe assault took it's toll on the Magram, many were killed, and those that survived are weak from hunger. They struggle to survive in the wasteland they took from the Kolkar. No longer able to provide for themselves, they have taken to stealing from others, such as the nearby &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey eventually join forces with the Kolkar and Gelkis, after being beaten in combat, in order to defeat the demons.\nSome time after the Cataclysm, the Magram and other clans of centaur joined under the new &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;High Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerritories.\nDesolace.\nSince its founding, the Magram tribe has not ventured past the borders of their native homeland. Situated in the southeast, within range of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Valley of Bones&lt;/a&gt;, lies the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20Village\"&gt;Magram Village&lt;/a&gt;. Patrols of &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Caster\"&gt;spell casters&lt;/a&gt; line the borders of their settlement, the many tents within housing their beast of a Khan, Jehn. Like the Kolkar, the Magram have domesticated &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s and utilize them for scouting purposes around the village.\nValley of Bones.\nSouthwest of the Magram Village is a great valley infested with undead known as the Valley of Bones. The ghosts of Magram ancestors roam here undisturbed among the two giant serpent skeletons that line the valley. It is believed that Magram and their necromancers may be creating a \"new\" scourge, and this makes them a potential danger to everyone.\nReputation.\nFaction description.\n\"These centaur have made their home in the eastern region of Desolace. Mortal enemies of the Gelkis Centaur.\"\nGaining reputation.\nReputation with the Magram Clan Centaur is gained by killing hostile mobs at &lt;a href=\"Shok%27Thokar\"&gt;Shok'Thokar&lt;/a&gt; and by completing the quest &lt;a href=\"Death%20to%20Agogridon\"&gt;Death to Agogridon&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter granting enough reputation to reach ranking with the faction.\nShould the player have already finished the quest before &lt;a href=\"Patch%208.0.1\"&gt;Patch 8.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, they can speak to &lt;a href=\"Karnum%20Marshweaver\"&gt;Karnum Marshweaver&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Karnum%27s%20Glade\"&gt;Karnum's Glade&lt;/a&gt; to receive the reputation reward.\nOld reputation.\nMagram vs. Gelkis.\nThe clashing cultural values of the Magram and Gelkis are the founding reason for their animosity towards one another, and it has only spiraled downwards since their initial disagreement. While the Magram only respect strength, the Gelkis respect nature and their birthmother Theradras, calling upon her protection and the power of earth to maintain their existence. The Magram view this as weak however, especially their trust in Theradras to protect the centaur tribes. \nThe Magram representative &lt;a href=\"Warug\"&gt;Warug&lt;/a&gt;, stationed at the base of the mountains on the eastern borders of Magram territory, recruits foreign aid to strike against the Gelkis and organizes strategic missions to weaken them. In order to be deemed worthy of fighting with the Magram, adventurers must gain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the tribe by slaying members of the Gelkis until they reach status with the Magram. Each kill gives 20 (22 with &lt;a href=\"Diplomacy\"&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/a&gt;) reputation to the &lt;a href=\"Magram\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt; faction and lowers the reputation of the &lt;a href=\"Gelkis\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt; by 100. Reputation with the Magram from kills caps at , or one point below . Reputation can be gained past this point by completing Magram quests.\nWarug also sends foreign assistance to combat the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maraudine\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt; clans.\nIn earlier builds, a player could become friendly or higher with both Centaur clans at the same time, by having someone else in a party kill a member of the Gelkis or Magram, which would cause the player to gain reputation with one Centaur clan, while not losing reputation with the other. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.2\"&gt;patch 2.2&lt;/a&gt; the player will gain and lose reputation regardless of who in the party actually does the killing.\nIn the RPG.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Outcast%20Necromancer\"&gt;Outcast Necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s are from the Magram clan."}

His reign was ended by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Outland\"&gt;took&lt;/a&gt; Magtheridon's throne at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; for himself. Deciding that Magtheridon would have a further part to play, Illidan had Magtheridon's body dragged to the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; where he imprisoned the pit lord, leaving him at the mercy of the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. A group of adventurers entered the depths of Hellfire Citadel, released the former Lord of Outland from his bonds, and finally destroyed him, taking &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Head\"&gt;his head&lt;/a&gt; as proof of their prowess.\nBiography.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nThe Burning Legion took full advantage of the open portals created by Ner'zhul, sending the mighty pit lord Magtheridon to seize the broken world in Kil'jaeden's name. With the clans in disarray, and most killed in the disaster, Magtheridon was quick to show his power, and rallied the surviving orcs under his pennant. The orcs were corrupted and became &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. He declared himself the ruler of the ruined world &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and ruled from the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the Temple of Karabor. Over the years, Magtheridon brought legions of demons to Outland through the four &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s which &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; shattered the world with, and his forces became very expansive. These forces included &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sayaad\"&gt;succubi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"felbeast\"&gt;felbeast&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s. He continued attacking the draenei and everything that opposed him.\nIt was almost twenty years after the cataclysm that &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; came to Outland, to escape &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan's vengeful master, and his wrath. Magtheridon found himself under attack by Illidan, Kael'thas' &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Vashj's army of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and even the elusive &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20tribe\"&gt;Ashtongue tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; led by the elder sage &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;. The group managed to shut down the &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s which supplied Magtheridon with reinforcements, and then laid siege to Magtheridon's &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The Pit Lord rallied his forces to defend himself, but the combined skills and armies of Illidan's forces crushed his resistances. Eventually, Illidan broke through and Magtheridon was defeated by the four generals. Magtheridon asked if Illidan had been sent by the Legion to test him but Illidan cackled in reply, saying that he had come to replace him.\nBefore \"\", it was commonly accepted that he had been killed by Illidan and his forces. However, new information revealed the truth:\n\"Many believed that Magtheridon had been slain in the attack.\" \"Though the pit lord was defeated, he apparently still serves some yet undiscovered purpose in the dark designs of the new lord of Outland...\"\nThe Burning Crusade.\nRecently it was discovered that after his defeat, Magtheridon was dragged all the way to Hellfire Peninsula and is locked up in a lair created for him underneath Hellfire Citadel, his blood being used to create fel orcs for Illidan Stormrage. It is interesting to note that his wardens are not fel orcs, but normal green-skinned orcs. It seems that Illidan is keeping Magtheridon alive for the sole reason of creating more fel orcs under his rule. While he is not an ally of Illidan, he remains a powerful tool.\nMagtheridon is the boss of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Lair\"&gt;his lair&lt;/a&gt;, his rumbling cries are heard throughout the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Strangely, he was purple in \"Warcraft III\", but now in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" he is green like most (if not all) pit lords.\nHis death was requested by &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the TCG.\nThe body parts of Magtheridon are said to hold tremendous, latent power. The &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Magtheridon\"&gt;Eye&lt;/a&gt;, when properly channeled, will bend fate toward the will of the user.\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nMagtheridon appears as a in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"Came from another world to invade Outland and bend it to his will\u2026 only to be overthrown by an elf from another world who invaded Outland and bent it to his will.\"\nHe also appears in two boss fights in , first as a bio-augmented version named in the story missions, then as of his \"Burning Crusade\" boss fight in the challenge missions.\nSome of Magtheridon's TCG artwork is also used for the Warlock minion and Warrior spell ."}

For years the Legion used Outland as a planar way station from which they could stage attacks on other worlds. They did these for various years, where they hunted down the remaining &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, enslaving some of them and rallied the surviving &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;turning them&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Magtheridon's Forces grew stong over the years thanks to the &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Gateway\"&gt;Dimensional Gateway&lt;/a&gt;s created by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, from which he summoned demons to mantain his brooding fortress.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; tried to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; had commanded him but failed, for his unsuccesful mission he fled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; into exile fearing for his masters wrath. His allies &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; followed him, at their reunion Illidan told them that they should ensure that &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s agents have been cleansed from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nIllidan's first action against Magtheridon's Forces was to seal the Dimensional Gateways, his &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; covered him in the process. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; aided by a group of draenei led by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, who pledged his alligance to Illidan if he helped him to defeat the pit lord, mantained the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; while Illidan closed the portals, aided by &lt;a href=\"Kael\"&gt;Kael&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;. When they were all closed Magtheridon's Forces where measurable as no reinforcements could arrive.\nMagtheridon was informed of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt; approach but was too confident that he would not be defeated and were just weaklings. The Black Temple was fortified by four orc encampments and many patrolling demons, besides towers that killed anyone who attempted to cross the doors. The draenei infiltrated and desactivated the doors from behind, then Kael and Illidan attacked for the front. Meanwhile, Vashj attacked by the aqueducts, destroying &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt;s and orcish ships. Illidan and Kael killed the &lt;a href=\"Butcher\"&gt;Butcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rend%20%28fel%20orc%29\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt;, while Vashj killed &lt;a href=\"Sagra%27nel\"&gt;Sagra'nel&lt;/a&gt;, then the two armies joined by a bridge and helped each other to kill &lt;a href=\"Maim%20%28fel%20orc%29\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nera%27thor\"&gt;Nera'thor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Master of Pain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20of%20Torment\"&gt;Mistress of Torment&lt;/a&gt;. The inner chambers oppened, the draenai desactivated the last towers and Illidan's forces attacked to Magtheridon and his lackeys. After a battle the pit lord was defeated, who couldn't believe his defeat, his defeat was mainly caused because he became complacent as he hadn't have a real enemy in many years and was taken by surprise by Illidan.\nAfter the defeat of Magtheridon's Forces, Illidan merged them into his own &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt;.

The first phase of the fight is a relatively simple &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt;, the second phase an interesting &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Channeler\"&gt;Hellfire Channeler&lt;/a&gt;s:\nNote that they are vulnerable to mind-numbing poison and Curse of Tongues\n&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Abyssal\"&gt;Burning Abyssal&lt;/a&gt;s: \nMagtheridon: \n&lt;a href=\"Manticron%20Cube\"&gt;Manticron Cube&lt;/a&gt;s:\nStrategy.\nComposition and setup.\nNo special buffs or gear are required, fire resistance in particular is *not* needed. Warlocks and hunters are handy for Infernal CC, but not needed.\nInitially, five Hellfire Channelers are distributed around the room, each next to a &lt;a href=\"Manticron%20Cube\"&gt;Manticron Cube&lt;/a&gt;. All mobs in the room have no aggro range, the fight is started by any harmful action.\nIt's best to have one tank and one healer assigned to each Channeler so that they can be tanked in their places and their shadow volleys do not overlap. If only four tanks are available, the first two Channelers can be tanked together. All other raid members start out at one Channeler, and then work their way (either clockwise or counter-clockwise) through the room.\nPhase 1.\nAfter the first attack on a Channeler, the raid has 120 seconds before Magtheridon becomes active. During that time, as many Channelers as possible must be killed, three must be dead at least when the boss enters the fight.\nAll Channeler casting should be interrupted as much as possible, the most dangerous being Dark Mending. After the first adds are dead, free healers should concentrate on the later tanks because they take more damage.\nThe Infernals should be banished, &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d, or simply tanked. Warlocks and Hunters can do this job - early on they're free to DPS, but when Infernals start to appear they can concentrate on them. Tanks whose Channeler is dead or not being dpsed down can pick up roaming Infernals (although they should be careful not to drag Channelers close to the current dps target, or they risk a Dark Mending).\nPhase 2.\nWhen Magtheridon breaks his banish, he starts to build threat only when he actually targets someone. Use aggro building moves or &lt;a href=\"misdirection\"&gt;misdirection&lt;/a&gt;, but not too early - let him target someone first. Besides killing any remaining Channeler(s) first and then nuking Magtheridon, the raid has to avoid Blast Nova by clicking on the cubes (see below). This is complicated by Quake, and in Phase 3 by Collapse.\nPhase 3.\nAt 30% Magtheridon shatters the walls of his lair, causing the roof to crash down. This deals 5250-6750 physical damage plus a 2 sec stun to every raid member. It's very bad if the start of phase 3 coincides with a Blast Nova. Therefore, DPS should stop at about 35%, wait until a Blast Nova is over, and then quickly bring him below 30%. For the remainder of the fight, the ceiling randomly caves in on players ('Collapse\"). Collapses kill everybody in an 8 yard radius of the spot of impact. There is a cave-in animation shortly preceding it so players are able to safely move out of the way.\nDamage from the initial shatter can be avoided by the usual means (&lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; etc.), but be careful to time these abilities correctly. The animation starts about 15\u201320 seconds before the raid actually takes damage.\nManticron Cubes.\nEvery 60 seconds Magtheridon starts to cast Blast Nova. About all wipes at Magtheridon happen because of an uninterrupted Blast Nova. In order to stop it, all five Manticron cubes must simultaneously be clicked (channeled) by players. Each cube should have one primary clicker assigned, with one backup if the primary clicker is disabled.\nDuring both Phases 2 and 3, Quake makes clicking the cubes more difficult. Since the cooldowns of Quake and Blast Nova are slightly different (50 and 60 sec), after three or four cycles, they happen at nearly the same time (fortunately Blast Wave cancels any active Quake), and then move out of sync again. It is important to know that each cube has a \"safe spot\". Standing up against the wall, directly behind the cube when facing into the middle of the room grants immunity to the knock-back from Earthquake. People standing there simply bounce in place.\nCube clicking should be done by the most reliable raid members, it's the single most important element of the fight. All other things being equal, it's possible to have the off-tanks from phase 1 do the clicking, because their DPS usually are the lowest, and they have higher HP and thus can keep the channel up for longer. It's desirable to keep channeling the cubes as long as possible, but staying alive is actually more important. Clickers should synchronize the release so that nobody takes unnecessary damage.\nMagtheridon's Lair at 80.\nEven at level 80 Magheridon can be expected to take a decent sized raid group. The channelers require a lot of DPS, or an interrupt heavy raid to kill by the 120 second mark. Level 80 raid composition should contain two tanks, at least two healers, and loaded on DPS that can interrupt. Also a good geared Paladin or Death Knight tank can solo Magtheridon.\nSoloing Magtheridon's Lair.\nAt level 90, soloing Magtheridon's Lair is rather simple even in a mix of uncommon, rare, and epic gear.\nFirstly, clear all the trash mobs as they will come to defend Magtheridon should you attack him.\nAttack the Channelers. For the next 120 seconds, you will be fighting the Channelers and their 5 summoned Abyssals. You should be able to kill all or most of them before the next phase begins.\nAfter 120 seconds, Magtheridon finally breaks free and joins the fight. It is quite a simple tank and spank fight. The Quakes and Blast Novas that he casts are little more than a nuisance at this level. The same is true for Collapses that occur once he reaches 30% health. \nThe whole instance can be done in 15 minutes or less.\nObjective of.\nKilling Magtheridon is required for , the last quest to obtain the &lt;a href=\"The%20Tempest%20Key\"&gt;The Tempest Key&lt;/a&gt;. Even though the key isn't needed to get into &lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Tempest%20Keep%29\"&gt;The Eye&lt;/a&gt; anymore, the quest is still there, and the regular rewards are still available. The title &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Champion of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; was given to players who completed the quest, up until the release of patch 3.0.\nQuotes.\nMagtheridon randomly utters these quotes as players progress through &lt;a href=\"The%20Blood%20Furnace\"&gt;The Blood Furnace&lt;/a&gt; instance, as well as his lair:\nIn addition during the fight:\nFirst Kills.\nSee for the first kills.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Moments before he died, Magtoor was visited by &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; who had redeemed him by sending him into the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. His body afterward disappears from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; forever. \nQuotes.\nWe spent so much of our lives in fight, memories of peaceful times grow evermore distant."}

She is wracked with agony over having to carry out the new orders given to her by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Loken commands the forces of Ulduar, but not all serve him willingly. The Maiden of Grief has been ordered to destroy any who try reclaiming the Halls of Stone. She mourns turning on former allies, but fulfills her orders with violent purpose. Even her sorrows have been forged into weapons.\"\nTactics.\nThis fight is not similar to &lt;a href=\"Maiden%20of%20Virtue\"&gt;Maiden of Virtue&lt;/a&gt; in Karazhan despite the same NPC model and incapacitate effects. The fight is a moving fight with heads up tactics needed.\nShe occasionally drops a big void zone (Storm of Grief) under herself and puts a magical debuff dealing shadow damage (Pillar of Woe). Everyone including the tank should move out of it to avoid the relatively significant damage incurred. On Heroic mode, the void zone does a lot more damage (as much as 5400 a tick on a plate wearer).\nShe also casts Shock of Sorrow, which deals 1750 to 2250 shadow damage, incapacitates all group members for 10 seconds. This ability has a 4 second cast time. If the healer is positioned near a void zone they can jump into it to avoid being incapacitated for the full duration. In the event this happens too quickly, PvP trinkets are able to clear the incapacitate. This is NOT an &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; dump. However, if someone clears Shock of Sorrow and the tank doesn't she will attack that person as an NPC's tendancy is to not break CC. If all members are incapacitated she will attack the person with the highest threat.\nStrategy.\nOn normal, the best strategy seems to be to have the casters stand in the middle of the room as the tank keeps her moving in a continuous circle around the outside perimeter.

{"id": "66390", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=66390", "title": "Maiden of Virtue", "text": "The Maiden of Virtue is a &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; boss in the &lt;a href=\"Guest%20Chambers\"&gt;Guest Chambers&lt;/a&gt; wing of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. The Maiden is optional; it is not necessary to kill her in order to reach other bosses. \nBiography.\n&lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s celebrations in Karazhan, like some of its activities, were so depraved that they caught the attention of the titanic watcher, The Maiden of Virtue. Infuriated, she tried to purify the places of their corruption, but failed.\nShe now remains motionless until her attention is caught by someone she thinks is Medivh, or as debauched as the latter. According to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;'s report, her judgmental abilities seem to have waned over time; it only takes a slight provocation for her to attack anyone, regardless of the person's morals.\nSome objects found near her seem to disagree with her name such as &lt;a href=\"Vest%20of%20Wanton%20Deeds\"&gt;Vest of Wanton Deeds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Barbed%20Choker%20of%20Discipline\"&gt;Barbed Choker of Discipline&lt;/a&gt;, and a pair of &lt;a href=\"Confiscated%20Manacles\"&gt;Confiscated Manacles&lt;/a&gt; whose provenance would be that of the victims of the Maiden, according to Shaw.\nIt is advisable not to disturb her, unless you are ready to harm her, before she does the same with you.\nStrategy.\nThe Maiden of Virtue does not have phases in her fight. She behaves the same from the start of the fight to the end. \nThe Maiden uses all her abilities at random, not on a strict timer. For example, when the Repentance cooldown is over, she does not always cast it immediately; it just means that it's \"possible\" for her to cast it. However, she does not cast Holy Fire while Repentance is active.\nWipes occur at this boss for mainly two reasons - either the tank dies while the healers are incapacitated from a Repentance, or too many raid members die from Holy Fire. A wipe is also possible due to poor positioning which leads to a chained Holy Wrath. Once these risks are managed correctly, this is a fairly easy fight.\nPositioning.\nCorrect positioning of the raid is the key here, healer positioning in particular. Ranged and healers should be far enough away from the Maiden to be outside of the Holy Ground attack. At the same time, the whole raid needs to be in range and sight of a dispeller and be spread out far enough to avoid chaining Holy Wrath. These requirements are easily matched with the following setup:\nThere are eight pillars around the room. Put one non-melee raid member at the outside wall in each gap between two pillars. Place the healers opposite of each other. Melee and tank can start wherever they like.\nTank her in the center of the room, right where she stands. After the pull, the raid members all move to their assigned gap between the pillars and take exactly one step up the stair leading to her. This puts the whole raid in &lt;a href=\"LoS\"&gt;LoS&lt;/a&gt;, healing and dispel range of each other, but far enough apart to prevent the Holy Wrath from hitting more than the melee group.\nInstead of standing between the pillars, it's just as good if the raid members stand with their backs to the pillars. Just synchronize so that everybody takes the left (or right) pillar, and no two people end up using the same one.\nRepentance.\nThere are several ways to survive Repentance:\nAll of these methods work well, and they work better in combination with each other.\nHoly Fire.\nHoly Fire will quickly kill its victim unless removed. It is imperative to deal with it.\nThe easiest method to deal with Holy Fire is to have &lt;a href=\"Grounding%20Totem\"&gt;Grounding Totem&lt;/a&gt;s up. With an alert Shaman and a little luck, this one totem can absorb all Holy Fires targeted at that group. With one shaman in each group, the fight actually becomes quite easy. Grounding totems have a limited range, so positions must be assigned carefully to make sure that everyone in the group is protected.\nHoly Fire is a Magic debuff, and thus can be removed by the following:\nHoly Fire can also be spell reflected.\nHealers and dispellers must be very alert to deal with Holy Fire. Every raid member needs to be topped off at all times, and Holy Fires must be dispelled as quickly as possible. This cannot be stressed enough, as it is the most important aspect of the fight: \"Dispel as quickly as possible.\" Unless someone would die, cancel the spell you're currently casting to dispel immediately, so you spend less time and mana healing Holy Fire victims. Some raids place two dedicated dispellers on opposite sides of the room.\nHoly Fire deals fire damage (not holy), thus &lt;a href=\"Major%20Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Major Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;s are useful.\nThis is the first fight since &lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt; where dispelling debuffs is critical. Priests and paladins that are new to this fight usually have some initial difficulty dispelling fast enough to avoid wipes. This is normal, so be patient. Once they have a little practice and figure it out, though, the Maiden is a fairly easy fight."}
