Located southeast of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, what is left of the time-worn statue rests atop cliffs on the tip of Azshara's southern point, overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nUndoubtedly an impressive site long ago, the statue now lies in ruins. Only the broken-off legs still stand, with various other parts scattered on the ground around them. Presumably, the rest has become buried, or sunk beneath the waves of the sea below. The ruins are inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"Spitelash\"&gt;Spitelash&lt;/a&gt; tribe of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Ravencrest Monument cannot be accessed by sea. Travelers seeking to visit the site must approach it from inland and cross a bridge.\nTrivia.\nThe Ravencrest statue is similar to one mentioned in the poem \"\" by Percy Bysshe Shelley. The poem itself is very similar to the original history of the night elves.\nSpeculation.\nA common theory is that the monument was raised in honor of Lord &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;, who led the mortal forces after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and countless other cities against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. However, the remains of the statue appear to depict a female &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; (though this may simply be due to model recycling), and based on its proximity to &lt;a href=\"Eldarath\"&gt;Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, a city which predates the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and was destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, it is quite possible that the monument also predates the War, and was raised in honor of some other notable night elf named Ravencrest. The monument's out-of-the-way location and state of disrepair also intimate that the subject is \"not\" Kur'talos. Ultimately, there is simply not enough information to confirm that the Ravencrest Monument refers to Kur'talos Ravencrest."}

Their headquarter is the &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, where outsiders are not really welcome, as making it out of here without a blade in the back or poison in the veins would be considered an accomplishment. The guild has been in conflict for years with the criminal organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Assassin's League joined the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, with their leader Lord Ravenholdt at the head of the rogue order.\nThey are a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;-orientated &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; that primarily serves during the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;Fangs of the Father&lt;/a&gt; questline. Prior to , the manor served as a low-level introduction to the rogue &lt;a href=\"Detect%20Traps\"&gt;Detect Traps&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nHistory.\nMany years before the events of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", members of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; stole the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20Nez%27ra\"&gt;Horns of Nez'ra&lt;/a&gt; from Ravenholdt.\nWith the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, Ravenholdt became entrenched in a battle with them for years, as what they lack in skill they make up for in numbers, making it impossible to kill them off fast enough to have any noticeable impact on their numbers. At some point, the guild accepted 's aid in routing out the Syndicate affliction, housing the base of operations out of &lt;a href=\"Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn time, Ravenholdt found that the best way to deal with the Syndicate was to pilfer their emblems, as once it is stolen, the shamed member is 'dealt' with internally. Consequently, they hired rogue adventurers to regularly steal emblems from their enemies across the region.\nAt some point, Ravenholdt took an interest in promising &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, who later received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Fahrad\"&gt;Grand Master Fahrad&lt;/a&gt; inviting them to begin on a career as a disciple of Lord Ravenholdt and member of the Assassin's League. Their first task was to find the hidden &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt; in the hills of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, and to bring them the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Seal of Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; attached to the letter. In the cave leading to the manor, the apprentice thieves had to perform the \"Rite of Cunning\" by checking which chests were trapped or not, and for those failing, they were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Milton%20Beats\"&gt;Milton Beats&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter being stolen by some thieves, whom he had eliminated by his assassins, Lord Jorach Ravenholdt summoned a promising rogue adventurer through their &lt;a href=\"rogue%20trainers\"&gt;rogue trainers&lt;/a&gt;, in order to retrieve his &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Azure%20Bag\"&gt;Sealed Azure Bag&lt;/a&gt; sold to some &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Shaman\"&gt;Timbermaw Shaman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. He then sent them to ask help from &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Xylem\"&gt;Archmage Xylem&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Xylem%27s%20Tower\"&gt;his tower&lt;/a&gt;, in order to remove the enchantment on the bag.\nAs his rogues needed to hone their lockpicking skills, Grand Master Fahrad asked adventurers to bring him &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Junkbox\"&gt;heavy junkboxes&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for some of the finest throwing knives known to roguekind.\nAfter he searched across continents and oceans, &lt;a href=\"Arantir\"&gt;Arantir&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20Nez%27ra\"&gt;horns&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Prince%20Nez%27ra\"&gt;Demon Prince Nez'ra&lt;/a&gt; were in possession of the Blackrock &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. He later instructed a rogue adventurer to kill any orcs they encountered, promising that their name would be known to Ravenholdt if they brought back the artifact.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; tasked &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Thunderwood\"&gt;Dirk Thunderwood&lt;/a&gt; to track down a new and extremely effective poison compound that could be crafted from the venom sacs of the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarf enlisted the services of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to bring him the venom sacs from &lt;a href=\"Kurinnaxx\"&gt;Kurinnaxx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Venoxis\"&gt;Venoxis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the lost five of its best field agents assigned on the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris&lt;/a&gt; case, Ravenholdt refused to assist &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; in his investigations on &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Fahrad\"&gt;Grand Master Rogue Fahrad&lt;/a&gt;, the Assassin's League stole &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;'s egg from the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; and brought it to Ravenholdt Manor. One of the infiltrators was killed during the mission, burned and nearly bitten in half by a red dragon. When &lt;a href=\"Mostrasz\"&gt;Mostrasz&lt;/a&gt; and a rogue adventurer arrived after following the tracks, the Ravenholdt agents were on high alert, and they had to sneak in the manor to avoid security. Inside they discovered that Wrathion eventually hatched and began operations to exterminate the remains of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the rogue champion stopped serving the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and began aiding Ravenholdt and the Black Prince.\nTheir first target was &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hiram%20Creed\"&gt;Lord Hiram Creed&lt;/a&gt;, a black dragonkin disguised as an affluent &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; noble who manipulated a group of Gilnean &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; named the &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, secretly infecting them with his own draconic blood. According to Fahrad, he lost many of his best agents to get this information, and none were able to infiltrate the city after their discovery. The rogue champion was thus sent to assassinate the &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Zazzo%20Twinklefingers\"&gt;Zazzo Twinklefingers&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir second target was &lt;a href=\"Nalice\"&gt;Nalice&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the representative of the black dragonflight at Wyrmrest Temple, their agents found her as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwyrm%20Cult\"&gt;Blackwyrm Cult&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Cellar\"&gt;caverns&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of Zazzo Twinklefingers, the rogue champion was sent to destroy her and to bring back a vial of her blood.\nAs his rogues needed to hone their lockpicking skills, &lt;a href=\"Winstone%20Wolfe\"&gt;Winstone Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to bring him &lt;a href=\"Heavy%20Junkbox\"&gt;heavy junkboxes&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for some of the finest throwing knives known to roguekind.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; attacked Ravenholdt Manor to kill Wrathion. During the battle, the manor was burned, while Wrathion managed to survive and kill their leader &lt;a href=\"Mostrasz\"&gt;Mostrasz&lt;/a&gt;, although many of the assassins were killed in the battle. After he rewarded the rogue champion with the legendary , Wrathion announced their final mission, to kill the last black dragon, the Grand Master Rogue himself. Despite Fahrad insisting that he was in control, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s' voices in his head forced him to attack the uncontrollable Black Prince, only to be killed by the rogue champion on the orders of Wrathion.\nFollowing their victory, Wrathion left the assassins of Ravenholdt behind to seek his destiny elsewhere, as he heard rumors of a new land \"&lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;beyond the mists of the sea&lt;/a&gt;\".\nMists of Pandaria.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the mage agent &lt;a href=\"Zazzo%20Twinklefingers\"&gt;Zazzo Twinklefingers&lt;/a&gt; could be seen investigating the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Pools of Purity&lt;/a&gt;'s magical waters with a &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon%20Agent\"&gt;Blacktalon Agent&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, his contacts among Ravenholdt told him that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; and a considerable &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; invasion force were converging toward Pandaria's southern shores.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, several members of the organization joined the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, with their leader &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; at the head of the rogue order. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Jorach Ravenholdt came into contact with a rogue hero by sending a &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Courier\"&gt;Ravenholdt Courier&lt;/a&gt; carrying a sealed letter, inviting them to join him alone and in complete discretion in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; through his contact &lt;a href=\"%22Red%22%20Jack%20Findle\"&gt;\"Red\" Jack Findle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20Goods\"&gt;Glorious Goods&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Chamber of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, he met the rogue hero alongside the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Council of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and invited them to take their seat as the final Shadow, and help them lead the Uncrowned in their war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Shadow&lt;/a&gt; sent his agents to recruit &lt;a href=\"Winstone%20Wolfe\"&gt;Winstone Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; at Ravenholdt Manor, so that he could continue the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; researches for the Uncrowned. For this mission, Lord Ravenholdt provided a sizeable sum of gold to entice Winstone Wolfe, and upon arriving, the rogues had to fight the wrathguard &lt;a href=\"Valitos\"&gt;Valitos&lt;/a&gt; who was attacking the manor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arantir\"&gt;Arantir&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt; where he fought the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s alongside the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacteristics.\nAs one of the elitist assassin organizations on Azeroth, Ravenholdt has been shown to work with other rogue organizations such as , &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalon&lt;/a&gt;, and other organizations through their contacts in the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;. Among them, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; is notably in contact with many &lt;a href=\"rogue%20trainer\"&gt;rogue trainer&lt;/a&gt;s across the world, being able to ask them for services if necessary.\nThe &lt;a href=\"%3AInsignia%20of%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;:Insignia of Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; is only given to those who have demonstrated mastery of the shadows, and killed in service to Ravenholdt. Their stores notably include enchanted garments, which are reserved for rogues of exceptional skill and loyalty. The Ravenholdt agents primarily wear dark-colored assassin outfits with masks, such as the &lt;a href=\"Assassination%20Armor\"&gt;Assassination Armor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"VanCleef%27s%20Battlegear%20set\"&gt;VanCleef's Battlegear set&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Deathmantle\"&gt;Deathmantle&lt;/a&gt; armor.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Assassins\"&gt;Ravenholdt Assassins&lt;/a&gt; are Lord Jorach Ravenholdt's personal guard, and are deployed from his manor whenever a \"special\" occasion demands it.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Kang\"&gt;Master Kang&lt;/a&gt; is responsible for teaching combat techniques, ways of assassination, and battle strategies to the Ravenholdt agents at the training ground. The dwarf brothers &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Thunderwood\"&gt;Dirk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Smudge%20Thunderwood\"&gt;Smudge Thunderwood&lt;/a&gt; are in charge of producing poisons for the organization's members. &lt;a href=\"Zan%20Shivsproket\"&gt;Zan Shivsproket&lt;/a&gt; is their specialty engineer and produces locks of adequate difficulty for the lowliest neophytes in the guild. &lt;a href=\"Laura%20Stern\"&gt;Laura Stern&lt;/a&gt; served as the recruiter for the Ravenholdt assassins in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Arantir\"&gt;Arantir&lt;/a&gt;, to deny Ravenholdt their artifacts would be to deny one's own existence.\nReputation.\nRavenholdt is arguably one of the most difficult &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; grinds in the game, and reaching was part of the criteria for the &lt;a href=\"Insane%20in%20the%20Membrane\"&gt;Insane in the Membrane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"feat%20of%20strength\"&gt;feat of strength&lt;/a&gt;.

Good locations for pickpocketing them are &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. In return you will receive &lt;a href=\"Dusksteel%20Throwing%20Knife\"&gt;Dusksteel Throwing Knife&lt;/a&gt; and 75 reputation with Ravenholdt (82.5 if you are human) and lose 75 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;.

Despite the heartache he felt when his brief affair with the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; came to an end, Arthas has remained remarkably committed to his roles as both the Prince of Lordaeron and as a holy paladin. He has a deep reverence for the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;holy Light&lt;/a&gt; and wants nothing more than to safeguard his beloved people from harm."}

He was trained as a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas also had a romantic relationship with the kind &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;sorceress&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Committed to the protection of his people, Arthas was determined to stop the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; spreading throughout Lordaeron.\nDespite his promising beginnings, Arthas became one of the most powerful and evil beings &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would ever know. Although he killed the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas was unable to stop the spread of the plague and resorted to increasingly desperate methods, such as purging the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Taking up the cursed &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas was able to defeat the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, but he lost his &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; in the process. Becoming a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, he led the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; in destroying &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas later made his way to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and merged with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuling as the Lich King for years afterward, Arthas had the &lt;a href=\"Pulsing%20Crystal\"&gt;last remnants of his humanity&lt;/a&gt; destroyed and was ultimately defeated in combat by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Cradled by the spirit of his father, Arthas Menethil died, leaving the mantle of the Lich King to be taken by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;a noble soul&lt;/a&gt; who would contain the power of the Scourge. Arthas' soul found no rest in &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;the afterlife&lt;/a&gt;, instead being forged &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;into a weapon&lt;/a&gt; in the schemes of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; that was spent until nothing was left.\nArthas first appeared as one of the main protagonists of ' and '. He also serves as the main antagonist in \"\".\nBiography.\nArthas: Rise of the Lich King.\nPrince Arthas Menethil was born to King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; and Queen &lt;a href=\"Lianne%20Menethil\"&gt;Lianne Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, four years before the start of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The young prince grew up in a time when the lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were ravaged by war, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was crumbling, and darker clouds still loomed on the horizon.\nAs a young child, Arthas became best friends with &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and often sparred with him, though Arthas was less experienced. He also watched as his future steed, &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, grew up. As a youth, Arthas was trained in combat by &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the brother of the dwarven king &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, and became an adept swordsman. At the same time he learned the ways of the Light under the tutelage of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;. He also developed an interest in &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; when she was staying in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; while on her way to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, where she would be studying. Some time later, Terenas arranged a political marriage for Arthas' sister &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Daval%20Prestor\"&gt;Daval Prestor&lt;/a&gt;. Calia was distraught by the decision and hoped Arthas would marry for love rather than politics.\nArthas was inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at the young age of 19. The ceremony was held in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and was attended by prominent figures such as &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and Jaina Proudmoore, whom Arthas had not seen since childhood. Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; led the initiation process, which included four of the five original paladins: Uther, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas was presented with the holy warhammer called &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Vengeance\"&gt;Light's Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; by Gavinrad and had the ceremonial silver plates placed upon his shoulders by Uther. While in Stormwind, Arthas visited the newly crowned king, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and sparred with him while recounting old memories. He also met the recently born prince, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who gripped his finger.\nArthas once visited &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and saw the famous &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; gladiator &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. He stayed in the keep during the night and &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha&lt;/a&gt; to Arthas' chamber to please him. However, Arthas only talked with her and he noticed that Taretha reminded him of Jaina Proudmoore, whom he had begun to fall in love with. Later on, he rode on Invincible only to have an accident which caused Invincible to suffer a mortal wound. Arthas had no other option than to kill his beloved steed in order to stop its suffering, an act which would haunt him for the rest of his life.\nArthas once stayed in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; so he could spend time with Jaina. During his visit, &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; organized a banquet for Arthas and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, who happened to be there at the same time. At the banquet, Arthas and Antonidas spoke of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' strange lethargy, Terenas's health, Stormwind, the young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and Arthas' relationship status. Kael'thas, who was also fond of Jaina, was upset when he saw Arthas kissing her.\nHaving grown into a strong, confident young man, Arthas was headstrong and somewhat arrogant, though none could dispute his bravery and tenacity. Arthas came to be considered one of the finest swordsmen in Lordaeron, and was famed for counterattacking and defeating the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; warbands of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; when they began raiding the settlements along the border of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater on, Arthas invited Jaina to Lordaeron to celebrate the festivals of &lt;a href=\"Noblegarden\"&gt;Noblegarden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;. During that time Arthas revealed that he was courting Jaina to the public. Eventually, however, Arthas began to question whether the two of them were ready to be together. Arthas abruptly ended the relationship so Jaina could focus on her magical studies in Dalaran and Arthas could focus on his commitments to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the trial of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas served as one of the four jurors. Like the other judges, he was shocked when Tirion admitted his guilt, which led the paladin to his &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt; and his exile.\nKnight of the Silver Hand.\nTroubles began to stir in Lordaeron. &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s broke free of their internment camps, and there was distressing news of a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; that had gripped the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas and Uther were sent to &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; to defend the town from orcish raids. The young prince defeated the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black drake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Searinox\"&gt;Searinox&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve its heart for the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Feranor%20Steeltoe\"&gt;Feranor Steeltoe&lt;/a&gt; to forge into an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Orb of Fire&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas used this magical item to help defeat the orcs and kill the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; leading the raids.\nPlague of Undeath.\nWeeks later a more vile threat arose in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Falric\"&gt;Captain Falric&lt;/a&gt; were sent to help Arthas, now 24 years old, investigate the strange disease. They fought against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; at an infested granary, then encountered the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and pursued him to &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nKel'Thuzad had already infected the stored grain in Andorhal and shipped it out to outlying villages. Before Arthas killed him, Kel'Thuzad spoke of &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; demon who led the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina and Arthas traveled north to confront him in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlong the way, Arthas and Jaina stopped at &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; where they hoped to rest. Instead, they were warned of an approaching army of undead. Arthas ordered Jaina to find &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and seek his aid while he remained behind to defend the town. To his horror, Arthas discovered that the plague was not merely a means of mass murder, but rather the means of turning innocent townsfolk into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures. Arthas' forces barely held out and were on the verge of defeat when Uther arrived with reinforcements and saved the village.\nWhile traveling to Stratholme, Arthas was met by the enigmatic prophet &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. He gave him the same advice he gave Terenas \u2014 to travel west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, as fighting the undead would speed up the delivery of Lordaeron to them. Arthas argued that his place was with his people, and vowed that he would not abandon them. Jaina suggested that the prophet might be right, but Arthas paid her no heed and continued to Stratholme.\nCulling of Stratholme.\nWhen he arrived at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas found that the grain had already been distributed. He knew the people of Stratholme would soon become undead, and ordered Uther and his knights to &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;purge&lt;/a&gt; the entire city. Horrified, Uther rebuked him by saying he would not follow such an order even if Arthas were already king. Proclaiming that Uther had committed treason, Arthas relieved him of his command and suspended his paladins from service. Several soldiers, such as &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Sir Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt;, left with Uther \u2014 as did Jaina \u2014 while those who remained loyal to Arthas joined him in slaughtering the infected citizens.\nAs Arthas began to slay the citizens of Stratholme, he was met by &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; himself, who was working to claim their souls. Arthas sought to destroy them before Mal'Ganis could reach them, and eventually demanded a final showdown with the dreadlord. Mal'Ganis slipped away, however, vowing to meet him in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas then set fire to Stratholme, and those fires burn to this day.\nNorthrend.\nArthas followed Mal'Ganis with a detachment of his troops. They arrived a month later in &lt;a href=\"Daggercap%20Bay\"&gt;Daggercap Bay&lt;/a&gt;. As they searched for a proper place to set up camp, Arthas' men came under gunfire before being recognized by the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;explorers' guild&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas was shocked to come upon his good friend and former mentor &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. At first, Muradin thought Arthas was leading a rescue party sent to save his men, who had been besieged by the undead as they searched for the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, but Arthas admitted it was mere coincidence. Together they destroyed the nearby undead camp, but there was still no sign of &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Muradin and Arthas continued their search for Frostmourne, an emissary from Lordaeron arrived in a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; and spoke to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Luc%20Valonforth\"&gt;Captain Luc Valonforth&lt;/a&gt;. He bore orders from Uther and Terenas, instructing Arthas and his men to return home. When Arthas returned to his base, the men had abandoned their posts and were making their way through the forest towards their ships. Arthas had no intention of leaving before Mal'Ganis was destroyed. With the help of some indigenous mercenaries, he managed to reach and burn his ships before his men got to them. When his men arrived, Arthas betrayed the mercenaries by accusing them of destroying the ships. To Muradin's disgust, they were promptly killed. Arthas told his men they had no means of going home, and the only way they were leaving Northrend was through victory.\nFrostmourne.\nArthas and his troops continued to press on to &lt;a href=\"Draktharon%20Keep\"&gt;Draktharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; in search of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. As he arrived, &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; appeared to him, and foretold his death. Arthas went to search for Frostmourne with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;, leaving his captain to defend the camp.\nUsing an ancient waygate Arthas, Muradin, and a small group of men traveled to the vicinity of the fabled runeblade. Arthas was soon confronted by &lt;a href=\"the%20Guardian\"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to keep him from Frostmourne, apparently for his own protection. The Guardian fell, and Arthas and Muradin claimed their prize. Muradin, reading an inscription, reported that the blade was cursed. He pleaded with Arthas to forget his desire for vengeance and lead his men home, but Arthas was adamant. Arthas asked the spirits of the cavern for the sword to be released from its icy prison, proclaiming that he would \"give anything or pay any price, if only they will help him save his people\". When the weapon broke free, Muradin was struck by a rogue shard of ice, rendering him unconscious. Arthas moved to help Muradin, but was dissuaded by the call of Frostmourne in his mind. Arthas discarded his holy warhammer, &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Vengeance\"&gt;Light's Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, then picked Frostmourne up and returned to his base, leaving Muradin for dead. With Frostmourne in hand, Arthas &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20%28WC3%29\"&gt;defeated&lt;/a&gt; Mal'Ganis's army, destroyed his base, and finally confronted the demon.\nMal'Ganis told him that the voice he was now hearing was that of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and asked what he was telling him. Arthas replied that voice was instructing him to destroy Mal'Ganis, much to the dreadlord's surprise. After slaying the dreadlord, Arthas fled into the frozen north, leaving his troops to fend for themselves. Arthas soon lost the last remnants of his sanity. Arthas was unaware that Mal'Ganis had survived their encounter.\nChampion of the Lich King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas became the first of the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. He was given a suit of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; armor, and slew nearly all of his own men before raising them as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Some among them, notably &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, were raised as death knights in Arthas' service.\nBetrayal.\nArthas returned to Lordaeron months later, and the kingdom rejoiced at the return of its champion. Flanked by &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas entered the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20chamber\"&gt;imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt; and knelt before the throne. After telling his father that he no longer needed to bear the weight of his crown, Arthas walked up to Terenas and ran Frostmourne through his heart. The king's &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20crown\"&gt;bloodied, broken crown&lt;/a&gt; remains lost to this day. As he drew Frostmourne, Arthas remembered the words of his old friend &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; describing his own father and king &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn\"&gt;Llane&lt;/a&gt; being stabbed in the heart.\nArthas then unleashed the Scourge upon the Capital City. He soon found &lt;a href=\"Vivian\"&gt;Vivian&lt;/a&gt;, wife of the fallen hero &lt;a href=\"Killoren\"&gt;Killoren&lt;/a&gt;. Sensing a conflict within Thassarian, Arthas ordered Thassarian to kill Vivian - his mother - in order to prove his loyalty.\nLeaving &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt; to oversee his forces in the city, Arthas ran to the &lt;a href=\"Balnir%20Farmstead\"&gt;Balnir Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;. There he used his necromantic powers to raise his faithful steed &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt; into undeath, allowing it to serve as his mount once again. \nA few days later, Arthas appeared in &lt;a href=\"Vandermar%20Village\"&gt;Vandermar Village&lt;/a&gt; at the bidding of his new master, the Lich King. There he met &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius the Darkener&lt;/a&gt;, a dreadlord like Mal'Ganis. Thinking that the dreadlord was Mal'Ganis out for revenge, Arthas immediately threatened him, only to discover that this dreadlord had come to congratulate Arthas for his efforts. When spoken to Arthas said he no longer felt remorse for any of his actions, though deep in his heart he knew this was a lie. Tichondrius explained that the sword was designed to steal souls, and that Arthas' own soul was the first one it had claimed.\nTichondrius tasked Arthas with gathering the members of the vile &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; that were hiding in Vandermar, learning that Kel'Thuzad had expected him, much to his surprise. They aided him with their magical abilities as he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; where he was to recover &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse. Arthas initially asked as to why they couldn't reanimate him on the spot, only to be informed by a cultist that a being like Kel'Thuzad required a powerful energy source. He confronted the paladin guarding the crypt, &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;, who had given Arthas his holy warhammer at his induction ceremony into the Silver Hand. After killing Gavinrad, he recovered the remains of the necromancer. This brought &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s ghost into being, and he secretly instructed Arthas not to trust the dreadlords. Arthas quietly contemplated this.\nKel'Thuzad's remains were badly decomposed and needed to be taken to the mystical Sunwell in Quel'Thalas to be revived. To ensure that the remains would survive the trip, Arthas was tasked with taking a &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20King%20Terenas\"&gt;special urn&lt;/a&gt; that was being held by the Knights of the Silver Hand. Arthas killed two paladins, &lt;a href=\"Ballador%20the%20Bright\"&gt;Ballador the Bright&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sage%20Truthbearer\"&gt;Sage Truthbearer&lt;/a&gt;, who both condemned Arthas' betrayal. He then faced &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that the urn held the ashes of his father, King Terenas. The two engaged in a duel with Uther initially having the upper hand, knocking Arthas down and sending Frostmourne flying from his hands. As Arthas awaited the killing blow, the sword seemed to find its own way into his hands and he was granted more power by the Lich King. The battle began to turn in Arthas' favor. Eventually, Uther, covered in blood from his wounds, fell to his knees and told Arthas he hoped there was a special place in hell waiting for him. Arthas replied that they would never know because he intended to live forever, then delivered the killing blow. He seized the urn and &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemed&lt;/a&gt; his father's remains by throwing them, which suddenly swarmed on him with the wind, choking him and burning his eyes. Arthas had the remains of Kel'Thuzad placed within the urn, and then began the long journey to Quel'Thalas.\nFall of Quel'Thalas.\nArthas met heavy resistance from the elves, rallied by &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Driving their forces before his undead army, he steadily pushed her people back in a swath of destruction towards Silvermoon, breaching the kingdom's two elfgates with ease. Sylvanas tried to warn the vast elven capital of the coming of the Scourge, but Arthas destroyed her camps and killed the Ranger-General. To make her pay for her perceived insolence towards him, Arthas corrupted her elven spirit, transforming it into a horrendous twisted form (a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;) and enslaving her to the will of the Lich King, forcing her to slay her own people.\nArthas and the marching armies of the Scourge annihilated Silvermoon, leaving it in ruins. On the road to the Sunwell, he fought &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt; and left him critically injured after severing his right arm. Arthas also faced &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the aged High King of Quel'Thalas, and killed him with minimal struggle. Arthas then used the Sunwell to bring Kel'Thuzad back as an undead &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nDestruction of Dalaran.\nAs the pair traveled to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad explained the full extent of the \"second invasion\" and the Lich King's plan. Arthas and Kel'Thuzad went to the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to destroy encampments of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; orcs who possessed a functional demon gate, which the lich would use to speak to the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. The Scourge destroyed the orcs to secure the portal for themselves. Archimonde instructed them to march to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and acquire the spellbook of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; so he could be summoned into Azeroth.\nDespite the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;'s valiant efforts to repel the invasion, the Scourge &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;fought through their magical defenses and fortifications&lt;/a&gt;, killed the Archmage &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; and claimed the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nArthas and his troops repelled the mages' vast counterattack as Kel'Thuzad began the lengthy summoning of the demon lord, reinforced by the Burning Legion's forces as the ritual progressed. Once Archimonde arrived, he proclaimed that the Lich King was of no further use to the Legion, and Tichondrius was placed in command of the Scourge. Arthas was left to wonder what would become of him and Kel'Thuzad, but the lich replied that all was going as the Lich King foresaw. The pair disappeared as Archimonde took his revenge on the city, destroying Dalaran with a single powerful ritual.\nInvasion of Kalimdor.\nArthas was next seen in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; on the Lich King's orders, joining the Legion's invasion not to aid them but to secretly undermine their efforts. From the shadows he influenced the Scourge, causing them to disobey their demon masters. This slowed the Legion's progress towards &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt; and sometimes even allowed the Legion's enemies to escape. When Arthas considered another way to more severely damage the Legion, he noticed &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; which the dreadlord had used to create &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and corrupt the surrounding forests. The death knight was aware that he could not destroy Tichondrius directly without attracting Archimonde's attention. When he discovered &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas realized that he could manipulate someone else to kill the dreadlord instead.\nArthas sensed Illidan's yearning for power and approached him in Felwood. He told the recently freed demon hunter how to claim the skull's powers as his own, whereupon he could destroy Tichondrius. Illidan agreed to his plan, and Arthas disappeared again, awaiting to be teleported by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nArthas remained on Kalimdor until after the Battle of Mount Hyjal, which resulted in the obliteration of the Legion forces. Following Archimonde's death, the allied forces launched a counterattack on the demonic remnants. Arthas only narrowly escaped the attack. He rallied as many of the Scourge as he could before retreating back home.\nReturn to Lordaeron.\nArchimonde left a trio of dreadlords behind in the ruined palace gardens of Lordaeron to ensure that the nation remained under control, and to watch over the cunning servitors of Ner'zhul. When the demon lord was defeated, however, they were not originally aware of it. This changed several months later, when Arthas returned to reclaim his throne. He threatened the dreadlords, who immediately fled, and then called Sylvanas and Kel'Thuzad to his side to stop a large group of human refugees, who were led by the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Halahk%20the%20Lifebringer\"&gt;Halahk the Lifebringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dagren%20the%20Orcslayer\"&gt;Dagren the Orcslayer&lt;/a&gt; as they tried to stall the Scourge so they could escape into the canyons, where the undead would have difficulty hunting them. However, during the climax of the battle, Arthas had a painful seizure, and felt the Lich King calling out to him. Despite his diminished powers, Arthas fought on until all the humans in the area were killed.\nLittle did Arthas know that the Lich King's power had dwindled to the point that Sylvanas was no longer under his control. In secret, she attended a meeting with the three dreadlords, who told her that the Lich King's power was waning, and so the time had come to claim her vengeance.\nAs Arthas returned to the capital city with Kel'Thuzad to discuss the threat, he was separated from Kel'Thuzad by the dreadlords, who attempted to kill him with several ghouls. Arthas killed the rogue undead and was forced to collect what loyalists he could find and fight his way through the dreadlords' forces, which included the powerful abomination &lt;a href=\"Bloodfeast%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Bloodfeast&lt;/a&gt;. As he arrived on the city's limits, he was saved by a cadre of banshees, who told him that Sylvanas had sent them to see him safely away. However, as they neared an empty spot in the forest, Arthas received another vision from the Lich King, who told him he'd been betrayed. Sylvanas then appeared and shot him with a paralyzing arrow, promising to torture him like he had done to her. Before she could start, Kel'Thuzad stepped in and chased her off with his forces.\nThe Lich King's mental cries pierced Arthas' mind - he was told to return to Northrend, for demonic forces (later revealed to be Illidan and the naga) were working to destroy the Frozen Throne and end the self-proclaimed king's reign. Immediately, Arthas prepared his fleet and set sail for Northrend, leaving Kel'Thuzad behind to watch over Lordaeron.\nEscape to Northrend.\nThree weeks later, Arthas landed upon the familiar coast of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and unexpectedly found himself being attacked by &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, hungry for vengeance at their kingdom's destruction. Arthas was unexpectedly saved by a large &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; who introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, the former king of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas warned that though the preliminary scouting force may have fallen, their main army would not be so easily defeated, before teleporting away to safety.\nArthas worried that Kael'thas was right and that they would never reach the Citadel before Illidan could. However, Anub'arak revealed that they could use the ancient tunnels of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; as a shortcut. With little choice, Arthas accepted the crypt lord's suggestion. While setting up a camp to fight to the passageway, Anub'arak suggested raiding the hoard of &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient blue dragon and servant of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and using whatever treasures the dragon had to strengthen themselves. Not only did they slay the dragon, but Arthas used what power he had left to raise Sapphiron into a powerful &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;.\nRace to the Frozen Throne.\nWhen he came to the doors of Azjol-Nerub, Arthas found himself being fired upon by dwarves, who revealed themselves to be followers of Muradin who had remained there when their leader was apparently killed. Now, they were led by Muradin's second in command, &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%20Flamebeard\"&gt;Baelgun Flamebeard&lt;/a&gt;. Leaving Sapphiron outside, Arthas battled through not only Baelgun's dwarves, but also the nerubian survivors, as he delved into the broken &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Spider Kingdom&lt;/a&gt;. Anub'arak's aid was invaluable, as he circumvented many traps which would have cut Arthas' stay fatally short.\nWhen Arthas faced off against Baelgun, the dwarf warned that the shifting earth had released an ancient evil from below the kingdom. As Arthas and Anub'arak delved deeper into the kingdom, that evil became apparent - the &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful, vicious race thought only to exist in legend. Arthas and Anub'arak even managed to defeat the incredibly powerful &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20One%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;forgotten one&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs they made their way to the Upper Kingdom, an earthquake collapsed part of the passage they were in, separating Anub'arak from Arthas. The young king had to rely upon his wits to see himself through several daunting booby traps before Anub'arak dug his way to Arthas. Once reunited, the crypt lord complimented the young death knight, saying he now understood why Ner'zhul had chosen him as his champion. As they climbed out of Azjol-Nerub, the Lich King contacted Arthas once again, and explained that he was losing his power because the Frozen Throne had been cracked and his energy was seeping from it. Ner'zhul replenished Arthas' powers, knowing he would need them in the coming battle.\nWhen they finally reached the surface, they immediately had to contend with Illidan's forces. Vashj's &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and Kael's blood elves were there to contest Arthas' minions at every turn. With Anub'arak's help, Arthas fought his way through their forces and magically activated the four &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Obelisk\"&gt;Icecrown Obelisk&lt;/a&gt;s around the glacier, opening the doors to the Frozen Throne. However, Illidan was waiting for him. Arthas warned him to leave Azeroth and never return.\nIn order to enter &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and take the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas fought &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in single combat at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich King triumphant.\nAfter a short but intense battle, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently left himself open and Arthas took advantage of it, slicing open the demon hunter's chest with Frostmourne. Illidan collapsed in the snow, as Arthas turned towards the doors of Icecrown. According to &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Lehner\"&gt;Matthias Lehner&lt;/a&gt;, the duel with Illidan was the only battle in which Arthas came close to dying, although Arthas was at the mercy of a killing blow during his battle with &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;. After his victory, Arthas took from Illidan the dagger &lt;a href=\"Stormfury%2C%20Black%20Blade%20of%20the%20Betrayer\"&gt;Stormfury, Black Blade of the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt; as a trophy.\nArthas entered the hollow glacier and beheld a winding pinnacle chained to the ice. As he strode up the stairs towards his destiny, the voices of those he had forsaken flooded through his mind. He heard &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; calling out to him, yet he ignored them, continuing his ascent. Finally, he reached the pinnacle and before him he saw an icy cask. Inside was a suit of armour, arranged as if seated on a massive throne. Now only one voice spoke to him - the rasping whisper of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;: \n\"Return the blade... complete the circle... release me from this prison!\"\nWith a great cry of strength, Arthas brought &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; to bear against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s icy prison and with a haunting scream, the ice that encased the Frozen Throne and the armour exploded, and shards of the ice scattered on the ground. With Ner'zhul's &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;helm&lt;/a&gt; at his feet, Arthas leaned forward, picked it up, and placed the unimaginably powerful artifact on his head. \n\"Now,\" they spoke together, \"we are one.\"\nLich King of the Scourge.\nFor years, Arthas dreamed and reflected on his past. Eventually he banished the last vestiges of his humanity, and consumed Ner'zhul's spirit to become the sole personality of the Lich King.\nAs the Lich King, Arthas instigated another Scourge invasion of Azeroth, provoking a counteroffensive in Northrend by the Alliance, the Horde, the Argent Crusade, and the Knights of the Ebon Blade. By doing so, he lured powerful heroes to Northrend and placed many challenges before them, seeking to weed out the weak and make the strong question their own morality. He planned to raise the world's greatest fighters as his new champions, and use them to spearhead attacks on their homelands, in a reflection of his own journey. \nWorld of Warcraft.\nA purple flowering plant, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%27%20Tears\"&gt;Arthas' Tears&lt;/a&gt;, was named after the dark prince. An alchemical elixir, the &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20Arthas\"&gt;Gift of Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, was also named after him.\nAn &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; who stands in the throne room of Lordaeron (and turns the ambient volume up) can hear an echo of Terenas's voice, confused by what Arthas was about to do.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Arthas was present within the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; wing of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, where adventurers accompanied him through the town as he killed its plagued population. They also had to protect the future Lich King from the agents of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who attempted to kill him and change the course of history.\nLater, adventurers could also see him in flashbacks on the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Shore%20%28Dragonblight%29\"&gt;Forgotten Shore&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Emissary\"&gt;Alliance Emissary&lt;/a&gt; arrived to order the troops of the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;1st Legion&lt;/a&gt; to return to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20Cavern\"&gt;Frostmourne Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, where he claimed the cursed runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Lehner\"&gt;Matthias Lehner&lt;/a&gt; (an anagram of \"Arthas Menethil\"), the adventurer could take on the role of Arthas in two critical moments of his history: When he turned on &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;his own men&lt;/a&gt; and raised them as the undead, and his epic duel with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nArthas' plan nearly succeeded when a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, led by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, assaulted Icecrown Citadel and ascended to the Frozen Throne. The Lich King froze Tirion in a block of ice, and once he was satisfied that the adventurers opposing him were \"the greatest fighting force\" on Azeroth, he killed them with a single mighty blow. Just as he was about to raise them into undeath, Tirion freed himself and destroyed &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. This released the souls inside, which attacked and immobilized the Lich King. The spirit of Terenas then resurrected the fallen heroes, who helped Tirion mortally wound Arthas. With Frostmourne destroyed and the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; out of reach, the Lich King returns to who he once was: Arthas Menethil. As he lay dying, comforted by the spirit of his father, Arthas asked if it was over, to which Terenas replied, \"At long last. No king rules forever, my son.\" Arthas said that he saw only darkness before him, with his eyes rolling back and his hand falling lifelessly to the ground.\nIn his last moments, Arthas saw the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Devos\"&gt;Devos&lt;/a&gt; arriving alongside his old teacher Uther to claim his soul. On Devos' urging, and in defiance of the laws of the Shadowlands, Uther subsequently cast Arthas' spirit into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the realm of eternal suffering.\nEdge of Night.\nAfter the Lich King's defeat, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; went to see the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. She found Arthas' discarded armor, but his body and the remnants of Frostmourne had already been removed. After committing suicide, Sylvanas's soul was sent to a realm of darkness where she encountered the tormented spirit of Arthas, who appeared in the form of a frightened child and ran to her for help, but then retreated in horror upon recognizing her. Sylvanas noted that if it wasn't for the fact that her own soul was being tortured at the same time, she might have felt the slightest amount of pity for him.\nShadowlands.\nThe Maw's ruler, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, eventually stored away what was left of Arthas' soul in the form of a soul crystal (identical in appearance to the shattered soul fragments of the people Arthas himself had killed with Frostmourne). In order to &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Dominate&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and turn him into his servant, the Jailer had the crystal infused into &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; created from Anduin's sword &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas' presence in the sword served as the source of Anduin's Domination, binding the young king to the Jailer's will. During a confrontation with the Dominated Anduin in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina sensed a \"familiar presence\" within Kingsmourne.\nAnduin was forced to follow the Jailer to the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and try to waylay the heroes of Azeroth, including Jaina, Uther, and Sylvanas. During the battle, the adventurers helped restore Anduin's willpower, allowing him to periodically manifest the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20a%20Fallen%20King\"&gt;Remnant of a Fallen King&lt;/a&gt; from the sword. Ultimately, however, Anduin was able to free himself from the Jailer's control and shatter Kingsmourne back into Shalamayne, freeing the remnant of Arthas: a faintly glowing flicker, consumed in the forges of the Jailer, with not even enough of a soul left to receive a proper judgment. Sylvanas stated that despite her hatred, she had become no better than her nemesis in her pursuit of vengeance and that she would have to answer for this, but that Arthas' own legacy was now at an end. She told the remnant \"May the last whisper of your name fade and be forgotten\", and the heroes looked on in silence as this last part of Arthas Menethil faded away forever.\nLegacy.\nCataclysm.\nArthas appears in &lt;a href=\"A%20Destiny%20of%20Flame%20and%20Sorrow%20%28quest%29\"&gt;A Destiny of Flame and Sorrow (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, a flashback quest in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; that allows the player to relive the first encounter between Arthas and Illidan.\nMists of Pandaria.\nArthas and Terenas briefly appear in &lt;a href=\"Gods%20and%20Monsters%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Gods and Monsters (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, a story told by &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; met at &lt;a href=\"Tidefury%20Cove\"&gt;Tidefury Cove&lt;/a&gt;, she remembered Arthas as an example of one of her failed love interests. Later on, &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; was able to persuade Jaina not to go through with her plan to kill the citizens of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; by pointing out that not only had Arthas used the same logic to justify the Culling of Stratholme but that he had been acting out of misguided compassion rather than hatred, which made what Jaina was planning to do even worse.\nLegion.\nWhen one of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; enters the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt;, reforged from the shards of Frostmourne, echoes of Ner'zhul and Arthas can be found within. When Arthas is defeated he says he sees only darkness, while Ner'zhul exclaims that his plans have been ruined.\nThroughout the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Frost\"&gt;frost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s wielding the Blades of the Fallen Prince will occasionally encounter &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Arthas\"&gt;Memories of Arthas&lt;/a&gt; that give them cryptic messages. While the memories don't refer to any one being by name, they imply that the darkness never dies and that while the death knights may believe they are free, they exist only by \"his\" will and do as \"he\" commands.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; goes to &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt; to rescue her daughter &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; from Gorak Tul, she is pulled into visions of Jaina's past. One of these visions is Jaina witnessing Arthas declare his intent to purge the city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; before its population can turn into the undead. Jaina then laments not stopping him, believing that if she had he never would have become the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and that he'd still be alive.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; expressed his belief to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde was forever shackled to the past, Anduin cited Arthas as an example of the Alliance's regrets.\nShadowlands.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the Lich King was meant to herald his coming and thus considered Arthas, along with his &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;successor&lt;/a&gt;, a failure due to his defiance of him. Upon learning this, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, his older sister, stated that while Arthas had made his own choices, his fate was \"shaped in part\" by the Jailer.\nArthas is encountered in Uther's memories first in the Culling of Stratholme as a paladin and also as a death knight when he kills Uther in Andorhal. Upon viewing these memories, Uther regrets the many things he said to Arthas, such as not listening to his doubts and anxieties when he first became a paladin and how he faced him at Andorhal not as a friend but as a foe. Uther realized in those moments that he failed Arthas, having not upheld the virtue of compassion. Upon learning of what Uther and Devos had done to Arthas, the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; realized that the former Lich King could've had a chance at redemption if he'd been brought to the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Uther was reunited with Jaina Proudmoore, the two shared their memories of Arthas, whom both had loved in their own ways, and Uther advised Jaina that she could choose to leave her painful memories of Arthas behind and instead carry her love forward with her so that it could lend her strength. After Arthas' soul faded away, Jaina told adventurers that she felt conflicted about him, as he always thought he acted in the name of justice even when committing atrocities, and that she was one of the few who could still remember the prince he'd been and not just the monster he became.\nPersonality.\nAs a human, Arthas was a man of action - brave, impulsive and straightforward. He was an inspiring leader, leading his men by example and more than once leading charges in his campaigns against the Plague. In conversations with others, he appeared witty and easy-going, yet able to hold true to his decisions and convince others to accept them. At the same time, Arthas was vindictive, quick to anger, and exceptionally arrogant, often being reprimanded by Uther for his hastiness (as at Stratholme) and even naming his horse \"Invincible\" as (it is implied) a symptom of his self-aggrandizement. He never took well to losing and had difficulty admitting his mistakes. He always sought the approval of others (such as his father) and often felt underappreciated. He could not stand the thought of others betraying his trust, going as far as making Jaina promise never to deny him anything.\nAfter he murdered his father, Arthas claimed he no longer felt remorse, shame, or pity, which may be explained by him losing his soul to Frostmourne. He became a ruthless and cynical person with a grim sense of humor, regularly mocking his enemies and gloating over their defeats or deaths (e.g. as he did with his former mentor Uther). This is perhaps most notable in his resurrection, control and torture of Sylvanas Windrunner\u2014specifically raising her as a banshee for him to toy with and force her to murder her own kind. Even as a death knight, though, Arthas felt as though the last remnants of his humanity were holding him back, and he still regularly thought of Jaina and his past life. He also still showed a degree of attachment to things he valued in life that echoed his humanity, most notably Invincible.\nBefore he awoke as the Lich King, Arthas extinguished the final spark of goodness that remained within him, and thereby gave Frostmourne the final piece of his soul. He also removed his heart and threw it into the beneath Icecrown. As the Lich King, he was cruel, merciless, and utterly lacking in any kind of humanity\u2014even when seeing his former love, Jaina, in the Halls of Reflection, he remained unmoved by her attempts to bring him back to the Light. He also retained his sense of arrogance, which more than once almost caused his demise (e.g. at the Wrathgate, where revealing himself exposed him to Putress's plague attacks), until it finally did, at the hands of the very adventurers he had brought to Northrend in the hopes of inevitably forcing them to serve him. Arthas may have regained a measure of humanity in his final moments, but only after Frostmourne was shattered and the souls it had stolen were released.\nAppearance.\nAs a paladin, Arthas was a tall, athletic handsome man with tanned skin, emerald green eyes, and long golden blonde hair. He mainly wore golden paladin armor with a blue cape and a lion symbol on his chest.\nAfter losing his soul and becoming a death knight his appearance changed dramatically, his face became deathly pale and skull-like, his previously green eyes were now a bright icy blue and his hair turned completely white.\nFriendships.\nArthas was friends with &lt;a href=\"Jarim%20Balnir\"&gt;Jarim Balnir&lt;/a&gt;, despite their differences in station. He was also close with his royal guards particularly Captain &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas met &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; when the Prince of Stormwind came to Lordaeron in the company of &lt;a href=\"Lothar\"&gt;Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and the pair would occasionally spar together. Arthas also became good friends with his mentors, &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muradin\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and Arthas were close friends for many years and eventually became lovers. Though Arthas abruptly ended their relationship when he decided he wasn't ready to marry yet, he was determined to remain friends with the sorceress. Arthas and Jaina would reignite their romance, but the events of the Third War got in the way, and it would change both of their lives forever, starting with the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;Culling of Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a death knight, Arthas seemed to enjoy conversations with his new allies, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;. He was not above expressing gratitude to Kel'Thuzad, and one of his final phrases before departing to Northrend was \"You have been a loyal friend\", something rarely heard from a dark lord addressing his minion.\nSubjects.\nArthas cared deeply for his people and sought their approval in return. He rarely let his title stand in the way and often treated commoners as near-equals. It was Arthas' empathy that would ultimately lead to his downfall, as he was driven to the edge by the sight of his people falling before the Scourge. Once Arthas was convinced the only way to save his homeland was to destroy Mal'Ganis, he became determined to accomplish that at any cost.\nAfter learning Frostmourne had stolen his soul, one of the first things Arthas reflects on is whether he truly saved his people by taking it up. With his mind twisted by Frostmourne's curse, Arthas comes to look upon the undead soldiers of the Scourge with affection, viewing them as his new subjects. He is described as feeling a form of sadness as he releases some badly damaged minions from his grip during the battles of Quel'Thalas, and he was outraged when &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; damaged his steed, &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; managed to usurp control over most of his warriors, Arthas realized that the undead were more like weapons or tools than subjects. That the loyal subjects he'd \"made\" would betray him came as a shock. Even so, the Lich King Arthas still seemed proud of his ability to \"stir the hearts\" of his \"people.\" At one point, the Lich King referred to his Scourge minions as his \"children\".\nKill count.\nArthas' personal kill count contains several characters in \"Warcraft\"'s lore, including the kings of three powerful nations. This list includes:\nAlternate timelines.\nIn an &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;alternate timeline&lt;/a&gt; visited by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, never became the Lich King. Instead, he married Jaina and became a father.\nIn the RPG.\nArthas wielded the &lt;a href=\"Plate%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Plate of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nLetters concerning Arthas.\n&lt;a href=\"Mimblis%20Evermorne\"&gt;Mimblis Evermorne&lt;/a&gt; was a fellow paladin of Uther Lightbringer. This letter was sent in the year 24.\nMimblis, Greetings, my friend. I hope the Light finds you well.\nThe young Arthas fills me with hope. He recently became a full paladin, and is nearly all I could hope for in a Knight of the Silver Hand. He is strong and powerful, with a devotion to his people that borders on zealousness. He's a fine paladin and will make a fine king when our beloved Terenas leaves us. Arthas has some growing to do, so I hope King Terenas will remain here for some time.\nThe only thing that bothers me about Arthas is that he has a disturbing quality in him. Sometimes, in training, I have seen him go a little far while sparring. He is so dedicating to winning the match that he forgets that it is only for training. He lacks control; I suppose it's a sense of ruthlessness that lies under his honorable exterior. I have full confidence that he will use this dedication to battle for his people, and I look forward to testing him. Once he really wets his sword, I can begin to teach him control. I don't want to rein his power just yet, until I can see what he's capable of.\nArthas loves his people very much. We recently visited some of the poorer villages outside of Lordaeron, giving healing to those in need. I wanted to test his healing powers, as well as see how he interacted with his people beyond the wealthy nobles in the city. He was full of pity for these people, weeping for a woman who had lost her leg in a wolf attack. After healing her pain, he set out on horseback, searching for the wolf. He slew three, bringing the pelts back to the woman to serve as her blankets. I was touched, but again, a little alarmed at his single-mindedness. She was grateful, and as we were there to serve the wounded and sick, our work was completed.\nHis relationship with Jaina Proudmoore is one I must watch. Lordaeron has never had a mage as a queen, but if she and Arthas wed, that's what we will be faced with. Perhaps it will be a good union of magic and politics, or at least bring the mages and paladins closer together. I will watch them carefully. A good thing about Jaina is that she will soften his hard edges. While she attacks her obstacles with a firm and unyielding mind, she is more diplomatic and cerebral in her approach, while Arthas may simply hammer on something until it disintegrates. They will make a strong union: he is the naked steel of a sword, and she is a fist in a velvet glove. I have confidence that they will receive public support, and I will lend them my support as well. I watch Arthas training on the field, and feel he can take on anything. He attacks with a single-mindedness that I know he will apply toward anything in life, be it physical confrontations or political. King Terenas has a good son. I have total confidence in Arthas. Yes, he has more to learn, but don't we all? He'll overcome his weaknesses and become a wise king, in time.\nLooking forward to our trip to Stratholme,\n\u2014 Uther\nTo King Magni Bronzebeard, Lord of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;,\nIt is my sad duty to bring you very grim news. I am certain you know of Muradin's mission here in Northrend to strike at the Scourge and discover useful artifacts. We fought together against the Scourge, and although I survived, Muradin fell to the undead and demons. I grieve for my brave friend and your valiant brother. Yet know that his heroic death was not in vain, for his life ensured my victory against the Lich King's minions \u2014 and my recovery of the ancient sword known as Frostmourne. I shall be returning to Lordaeron soon. With Frostmourne in hand, I come to reestablish order and bring forth a shining new age. Muradin's remaining clansmen here will take his body back to Ironforge. You cannot know how deep are my sympathies. I know that this letter offers small consolation, but I felt you should learn of Muradin's death as soon as possible. You have lost a brother, and I have lost a valued friend.\nMay the Light preserve our peoples,\n\u2014 Prince Arthas Menethil\nInspiration.\nArthas could be seen as a \"reverse\" version of . Frostmourne is comparable to /, Ner'zhul (or Kel'Thuzad) could be seen as roughly equivalent to (the wizard figure behind the king), and Uther shares his name with King Arthur's father. In contrast to Arthur, Arthas destroyed a Camelot-styled kingdom and built its opposite. In addition, Jaina is to Arthas what Guinevere was to Arthur and both have an older sister (Morgana for Arthur and Calia for Arthas) who can wield supernatural power.\nArthas also has many similarities with 's character and his sword . Both are rulers who betray their own lands, and both are cursed by their runeblades.\nOne of Arthas' major decisions in \"Warcraft III\" was very similar to one by , a Spanish conquistador, and before Cortes , a Umayyad Caliphate commander. When Uther convinced King Terenas II to send ships to Arthas' expedition in Northrend as a way to tell them to go back home to Lordaeron, Arthas decided to burn the ships to continue his campaign against Mal'Ganis. In real-life, due to half of his men protesting and wanting to go back to the mainland, Cortes decided to burn his ships until victory was achieved against the Aztecs. In turn, Cortes himself likely got the idea from Ziyad, who did it to deter cowardice among his forces while warring to conquer Cortes's own homeland Hispania (modern-day Spain) and make it Al-Andalus. However, unlike Cortes and Ziyad, Arthas hired mercenaries to assist him, framed them as doing it against his will and joined his men to kill them for it.\nArthas also draws parallels with . Anakin is another prominent example of the \"fallen hero\" archetype in modern fiction. Like Anakin, Arthas began his career as a promising knight sworn to altruism and justice, under the tutelage of an experienced warrior who attempted to instill these values in his pupil. Both men were eventually seduced by dark powers, and aided in the destruction of their orders and the killing of their mentors. Both began their descent to villainy with massacres (Arthas' Culling of Stratholme and Anakin either when he wiped out the Tusken Raider tribe that killed his mother or purged the Jedi Temple after becoming Darth Vader). Both ended their lives not as Darth Vader or the Lich King, but as Anakin Skywalker and Arthas Menethil, respectively. One key difference though was at the end of their lives; where as Vader redeemed himself and became Anakin by destroying his master to save his son Luke, Arthas had no such redemption given to him.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The nearby Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Agatha\"&gt;Agatha&lt;/a&gt; then resurrects the nearby fallen corpses as Forsaken, much to the disgust of Garrosh and &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt;. Arthura is next seen in &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; from where she takes the Horde adventurer to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken Forward Command&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.

When Lord Godfrey betrays and kills Sylvanas, Agatha and &lt;a href=\"Daschla\"&gt;Daschla&lt;/a&gt; are immediately willing to sacrifice themselves to bring her back, while Arthura was hesitantly pointing out that they would die in the act of resurrecting Sylvanas.

Artifacts also come with an extensive range of visual customization options.\nThere is an artifact for each class &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;, 36 in total, plus an additional one for \u00a0&lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt;. Obtaining each artifact involves a unique questline to seek out these powerful weapons.\nStoryline.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; experience, players set about acquiring the artifact for their character's current specialization. The artifacts represented a greater power than the heroes of Azeroth had ever wielded before, a power which was needed in order to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe process of acquiring an artifact is determined by the character's class and spec. A catch-up mechanism was added to reduce the time taken to earn artifact power for secondary specializations and alts.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%207.3.5\"&gt;Patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt; added the send-off for artifact weapons and as such ended the \"\" storyline, with the weapons having to be used in order to neutralize the sword &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; used to impale the world in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Some visual effects represented the instability that resulted from the send-off, with for example &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Power\"&gt;Artifact Power&lt;/a&gt; varying wildly.\nWith the release of &lt;a href=\"patch%208.0.1\"&gt;patch 8.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the artifact weapons can continue to be used as normal weapons, but all traits added to the weapon was \"burned away\", and disabled. The main artifact ability was also no longer usable, however, some were introduced as &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s to the class (such as &lt;a href=\"Wake%20of%20Ashes\"&gt;Wake of Ashes&lt;/a&gt;). Any relics added to the weapon would continue to increase the weapon's item level, but no longer offered any traits. &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Crucible\"&gt;Netherlight Crucible&lt;/a&gt; augments also ceased to benefit the weapon. All artifact traits were disabled as the final result of the artifact instability.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0.1\"&gt;patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the ability to &lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;transmog&lt;/a&gt; any artifact appearance for any &lt;a href=\"Specialization\"&gt;Specialization&lt;/a&gt; was made available, previously players were only able to while within its corresponding &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;. \nCustomization.\nArtifacts can be customized and powered up at &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;order halls&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Power\"&gt;artifact power&lt;/a&gt;, earned from adventuring, completing quests, beating dungeon bosses, winning PvP objectives, and so forth. Artifact power is used to unlock traits which increase the power of the weapon and the character.\nEach artifact has a unique \"trait tree\", a grid overlaid upon the outline of the weapon itself, resembling the old &lt;a href=\"Talents%20%28history%29\"&gt;talent trees&lt;/a&gt;. Players can spend artifact power to activate additional traits, moving along the tree; once a trait is activated, all connecting traits become unlocked. Many traits have multiple ranks. Majorly impactful traits are called golden traits.\nArtifacts also have Relic slots. Relics are artifact-only objects with a major impact on the overall power of the artifact, such as its basic damage and &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;. The relic system acts as a substitute for the upgrading of weapons seen in previous expansions; rather than switching to a new and more powerful weapon, the player slots a new and more powerful relic into their artifact.\nVisual.\nSeveral different looks are available for each artifact. These can be unlocked through various activities. One look for each artifact will only be available through PvP. Each look appears to come with unique flavor text, and background lore. Players are also able to unlock three additional colors of the various looks. In the case of Feral and Guardian &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, changing the look of the weapon also changes the look of the form to match. In addition, it is hard to obtain items for every specialization that unlocks an additional appearance (with 3 recolors unlockable).\nArtifacts can be transmogrified into other weapons, but other weapons cannot be transmogrified into artifacts."}

They used the color to denote their quality; this color was later reused when &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced. This caused a few interesting issues where some references to artifacts had not been removed. For instance, trying to mail an heirloom to a character on another account would return the error message, \"Artifacts can only be mailed to your own characters.\""}

Fragments can be turned in through special NPCs at the faction base in order to activate special features for the player's faction, such as sending powerful NPCs to attack the enemy, or activating special warlock gateways to instantly transport players between areas of Ashran. \nTurning in Artifact Fragments for these purposes is the aim of a number of repeatable quests, rewarding additional &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Points\"&gt;Honor Points&lt;/a&gt; and/or reputation. However, the main goal is to further the faction's progress within the current battle.\nWhile Artifact Fragments stack to 1,000, it may not be wise to hold onto them for too long. If the player dies they will lose half of all their current Artifact Fragments, with enemy players able to loot the lost Fragments from their corpses.

They have a major impact on the overall power of an artifact, increasing its &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; and, by extension, its damage and &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt;s. The artifact relic system acts as a substitute for the upgrading of weapons seen in other expansions; rather than switching to a new and more powerful weapon, the player slots a new and more powerful relic into their artifact.\nEach artifact has three relic slots, and each slot is a specific type. A relic can only be inserted into a slot that matches its type. As a result, different &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s are able to use different types of relics.\nDuring \"Legion\", a relic would also increase the rank of a minor &lt;a href=\"artifact%20trait\"&gt;artifact trait&lt;/a&gt; when slotted. This gave artifacts a small amount of customizability, and made different relics desirable for different playstyles or goals. Since artifact traits no longer function, there are now no differences among relics aside from their type and how much they increase the artifact's item level.\nTypes.\nThere are ten relic types:"}

Having broken into the vault of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, Xy'mox wishes to steal away and test the authenticity of the Sire's prized relics on the raid.\nThis 3-phase fight is a serious test of raid coordination and movement, which revolves around using the portals that Xy'mox spawns to dodge numerous deadly mechanics. The fight also requires quick response time from the tanks to avoid lethal overlaps with other abilities.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Not everyone in Castle Nathria is loyal to Sire Denathrius. Some simply saw an opportunity and exploited it to their own ends. Artificer Xy'mox has worked with Denathrius but is mostly concerned with getting the better end of the deal, which may require the end of Nathria's invaders.\"\nOverview.\nXy'mox creates wormholes players can travel between and removes Sire Denathrius' Relics from their display cases, unleashing their powers on players. \nAt 70% and 40% remaining health, Xy'mox will return active Relics to their display case and bring out another.\nStrategy.\nThis fight requires two tanks. Bloodlust should be saved for the 3rd phase which is the most dangerous. The fight is centered on the Dimensional Tear spell, placing a debuff on two players that, after 8 seconds, drops a portal between their two locations at their feet. The raid should always have 1 portal next to their raid and another far away from the raid to use to escape certain mechanics. \nThroughout the fight, tanks will be affected by Glyph of Destruction, causing the tank to explode after 8 seconds and cause about 15k damage to everyone in the raid. As the damage falls off with range, tanks will need to move as far away from the raid as possible. High-mobility tanks like &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"monks\"&gt;monks&lt;/a&gt; can move away with their own abilities, while &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s may need to use the portals to move far enough away in time to save the raid from massive damage. Ensure there are no DPS currently using the portals so that they do not take the full brunt of Glyph of Destruction. \nThe boss will periodically fire Rift Blasts at the raid, lines across the ground that shoot arcane damage at players who stood within them. Simply sidestep them. Healers will also need to watch out for Hyperlight Spark that deals damage to the raid that needs to be healed through. \nPhase 1.\nFor the first 30%, Xy'mox will create Fleeting Spirits, green ghosts that will fixiate on a non-tank player and rush towards them for 11 seconds. If a player does get hit by the ghost that is fixiated on them, they will be possessed and begin attacking the raid, forcing other players to deal damage to them to free them. Any targeted players can simply use the portal to step through to the other side of the room and kite the spirits until they despawn 11 seconds later. Note that players can touch ghosts that are not specifically targeting them without being possessed. This phase is not too difficult and mostly serves as an introduction to using the portals before the more difficult phases. \nNote that the spirits can potentially overlap with the tank's Glyph of Destruction. If this happens, the players targeted should try their best to kite the ghosts until the Glyph explodes, using things like &lt;a href=\"Stampeding%20Roar\"&gt;Stampeding Roar&lt;/a&gt;, then take the portal to avoid being 1-shot. Finally, the boss will also cast Soul Singe to deal light damage to the raid, simply heal through it. \nPhase 2.\nAt 70%, phase 2 begins. In place of the weak raid-wide Soul Singe, the boss will cast Withering Touch on random single players. This is a massive damage over time spell that can easily kill players, especially in addition to other sources of damage like the Hyperlight Spark and the Glyph of Destruction blast. Healers must focus-heal these players to keep them alive, and if there are multiple ones, it is prudent to call-out which healer is focusing which player to conserve mana. \nInstead of Fleeting Spirits, the boss will cast Root of Extinction. This places 4 Seed of Extinction that will explode with lethal damage in a 50-yard radius after 20 seconds. One can use abilities will carrying the seeds without dropping them. To deal with this ability, players must pick up a seed and drop it a safe distance away from the raid with their extra action button. To facilitate this, 1 portal should be on one end of the room and the other next to the raid. This will allow players to grab the seeds, place them away from the raid, and enter the portal with enough time to get out of the blast. \nTiming is key to this phase and it would be ideal to assign high-mobility DPS to carry the seeds while slower ones stay on the boss. Once again, overlap with Glyph of Destruction can be a problem here. To avoid the players running with the seeds from taking lethal damage, place a marker specifically in one back corner of the room where the seed-runners should drop the seeds, while the other back corner can safely be used by the tank to drop the Glyph blast while staying a safe distance away from all other players. \nPhase 3.\nAt 40%, the final phase begins. Withering Touch has been replaced by light ticking damage from the Aura of Dread. The sole other mechanic for this phase is the Edge of Annihilation, massive weapon that drops in the center of the room, creates a circle around itself, and creates a suction effect that pulls players inwards and increases in suction over time. After 10 seconds, the circle erupts around the weapon, killing anyone inside. \nThis phase can take some practice, as it requires perfect timing and portal placement in order to counter the Edge of Annihilation. The raid should place 1 portal up against a wall and another slightly off-center from the middle of the room. When the raid gets pulled in, they can stay inside until most of the timer has run out as they do not take any damage until the 10 second timer has finished. Once it is about to explode, they step into the portal to escape out of the circle. The timing is critical here, as leaving the portal too soon will result in the player being pulled back inside, but waiting too long will leave them not able to reach the portal in time. The only solution to this is practice and the ability to watch DBM timers closely. Once the players have mastered the use and timing of the portals, no one should die to this mechanic. \nThe final danger of this phase is the tank's Glyph of Destruction overlap, which is the most dangerous one of all 3 phases. When Xy'mox casts Glyph, tanks must rely on their own movement abilities to avoid the blast: "}

Founded by the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aisha\"&gt;Aisha&lt;/a&gt;, the company is a collection of entrepreneurs, artisans, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt;s who provide goods and services to crafters and gatherers in need across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They have a vast network of artisans and gatherers of all professions that can craft and obtain the highest quality goods, and their business connects those artisans and gatherers to the customers. According to &lt;a href=\"Haephesta\"&gt;Haephesta&lt;/a&gt;, the company is not just a business, they are an innovation on the market.\nIn , the agents and vendors met by the heroes are part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; branch of the organization.\nHistory.\nAfter years of listening to the woes of traders across the lands, always complaining that it is difficult to find reliable customers, the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aisha\"&gt;Aisha&lt;/a&gt; realized there was good and profit to be had in providing a service that connects crafters to their customers. For years, she traveled and recruited people to start up her business. One of them was the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Haephesta\"&gt;Haephesta&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to peddle her goods for years but couldn't find clients, ending up wandering the city for anyone who needed something, until she received an offer of the Artisan's Consortium.\nDragonflight.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; was announced, Aisha thought this was the perfect business opportunity to expand her company, and to capitalize on the wealthy &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Their &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and once they reached the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, their &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s began to setting up trading posts across the land. Aisha also thought of recruiting venturesome artisans who are willing to work where &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;s are yet to travel, in order to expand even further. Once they were allowed, they set up their camps in the &lt;a href=\"Artisan%27s%20Market\"&gt;Artisan's Market&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; and at &lt;a href=\"Forkriver%20Crossing\"&gt;Forkriver Crossing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Dothenos\"&gt;Dothenos&lt;/a&gt;, they quickly proved their business savvy.\nAt some point, the organization made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"quartermaster\"&gt;quartermaster&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Gladiator%27s%20Refuge%20%28Valdrakken%29\"&gt;Gladiator's Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, allowing combatants to obtain tokens in order to certify their crafting orders, or own crafted equipment, for use in battlegrounds and arenas.\nServices and rules.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, the Consortium deals in made-to-order products. Since there is no building and no surplus goods, while they are constantly expanding, they have a \"artisan-to-&lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; service\" to send the newly crafted items to their customers. Sometimes, the company's agents meet their favorite customers to get feedback on their latest orders and purchases. They are also willing to help the artisans on their journey to honing their specialization, and if they don't have one, they propose a series of questions based on personality in order to find the professions that would suit them best.\nBy speaking to one of their representatives, one can request made-to-order goods and equipment from their artisans, as long as they have the components for the crafting orders. Anything that their crafters can make on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; is available for request, and as they strive for high-quality service, they are looking to expand to other inventory. Artisans and crafters can help them fill these orders for incredible profits, but also build their clientele and fill personally-requested orders with high-quality goods for lucrative profits. When an order is accepted, its the Artisan's Consortium that contacts the crafter or the gatherer and asks them to prepare the necessary for the customer. If a customer likes the services of one of the craftsmen, they can consider sending them personal orders instead of trying their luck on the public market, or they can place an order with their &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to work with the Artisan's Consortium, the crafters and artisans have rules to follow. Firstly, they have to make sure they are a good representative of the company and must be courteous to their customers. Secondly, in order to be fair to the other crafters of the consortium, they can only fill a number of public orders per day. However, the company wants to be on top of customers' needs, so if an order is about to expire, they won't count that against the crafter's limit. The company is also in charge of updating the crafting stations with an updated list of everyone's crafting orders. As business partners, the Artisan's Consortium offers some professional equipment free of charge to their new associates. Their tailor &lt;a href=\"Mahra%20Treebender\"&gt;Mahra Treebender&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of preparing the outfits, asking many questions about everyone's measurements and preferences.\nBeyond their services, they also sell &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s, blueprints, &lt;a href=\"enchanting%20formulas\"&gt;enchanting formulas&lt;/a&gt;, and techniques in exchange for gold or &lt;a href=\"Artisan%27s%20Mettle\"&gt;Artisan's Mettle&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, they also trademarked the term \"Artisan Curios\", special items that can be used by adventurers during their journey, notably to answer puzzles with adventures or treasures waiting beyond, as sometimes a mystery can't be solved with sword or spell.\nReputation.\nUnlike the standard reputation requirements, the following levels are required:\nRewards.\n&lt;a href=\"Rabul\"&gt;Rabul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; is the quartermaster for the faction."}

The gallery is presumably the main center for the arts within Suramar, featuring stages and platforms for the public display of oratory, music, theater, and other forms of entertainment. \nFound in Suramar's lower section, the district is surrounded by several other suburban areas, including the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Commons\"&gt;Evermoon Commons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Starcaller%20Retreat\"&gt;Starcaller Retreat&lt;/a&gt; to the east and south, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Shimmershade%20Garden\"&gt;Shimmershade Garden&lt;/a&gt; to the north. The Artisan's Gallery is a major meeting place for Suramar's citizens, with large crowds frequenting the district often. Though it lies generally deep within the city proper, there is access to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt; from a small jetty in its southwest corner. \nSince the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the gallery has been heavily occupied by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, along with a large number of &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; security forces. As such, it has become a particularly hostile area for any rebel agents. In turn, it is a spot regularly frequented by individuals loyal to the regime of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, with many of her loyalists present throughout the district. \nHistory.\nThe large presence of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; led to the Artisan's Gallery remaining an especially dangerous location for &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; agents throughout the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;civil war in Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the gallery did receive some of the insurrection's attention; it was involved in a large propaganda campaign as notices in support of the rebellion were placed in public in prominent locations."}

He was one of four vile agents of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=\"Vartrus%20the%20Ancient\"&gt;Vartrus the Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, a tree spirit from &lt;a href=\"Irontree%20Woods\"&gt;Irontree Woods&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, wishes to see destroyed. Only a skilled &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; was able to find the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in their disguises and defeat them.\nArtorius was part of the hunter epic quest to obtain &lt;a href=\"Rhok%27delar%2C%20Longbow%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Keepers\"&gt;Rhok'delar, Longbow of the Ancient Keepers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lok%27delar%2C%20Stave%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Keepers\"&gt;Lok'delar, Stave of the Ancient Keepers&lt;/a&gt;. As with all of the demons, he must be killed by the hunter alone: no heals, pets, mid-fight buffs, etc. Each demon requires the hunter to find their weakness to a hunter skill. Artorius' specific weakness is to the poison of a hunter's &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt;. When affected by the sting, he gains a debuff called Stinging Trauma, doing massive amounts of damage. The key to this fight is to stay out of range of his demonic magic, which is able to mutate players into a demon, simultaneously dealing large amounts of damage to the hunter. \nStrategy.\nOnce you are ready, don't bother starting out with an &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt; or trap, you need to conserve as much mana as possible for &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt;s. (Note by Crescrendrek: This is not true. I still used a hunter's mark, immolation trap, aimed shot and serpent sting to start the battle, and I had 500 mana out of my 3500 (unbuffed) at the end, with no mana potions. I waited for my mana to recharge after using the mark and trap, though.)\nHave ALL your party members follow in front of you on their mounts to train ALL the mobs that you may run into. You will have to kite him from the top of Winterspring until near the town of Everlook. Spawning him at the lower end of his path minimizes the number of mobs on the adjoining hill.\nEvery 4\u20135 seconds, apply a new &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt; on him, it will stack damage. However, if you use nothing but serpent sting, he will reset. Use Arcane Shot Rank 1 to tap the demon as often as you can. This means you will be continually using jump shot, alternating between serpent sting and arcane shot.\nIf you are having difficulty doing the jump-shot, you can strafe the entire way. Start out facing south towards &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt;. You will occasionally have to alter your angle as you strafe so that you maintain &lt;a href=\"LOS\"&gt;LOS&lt;/a&gt;.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt; to kite him. You will keep running non-stop; using jumpshot will sometimes make you get out of range. If so, stop, turn around and serpent sting or arcane shot him.\nHe will run faster than you while going uphill, use &lt;a href=\"Concussive%20Shot\"&gt;Concussive Shot&lt;/a&gt; to slow him down. If you need to make a sharp turn or other path correction, concussive shot is useful for that as well.\nIf you stay outside of range the whole time, you will never get debuffed or ever need to use tranq shot. Just keep running and applying &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt;. If you get in the 30-yard range, don't despair; Demonic Doom is not instantly applied. You might still get away with a concussive shot. \"Do not\" use wing clip or other melee hits, this often causes him to evade bug. Avoid ever getting hit with the debuff, but if you do get his \"Demonic Doom\" debuff and don't have a restorative potion, the encounter is pretty much over. However, if you have a &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, you can immediately feign death (ending the attempt, but saving your skin) and have the cleanser cleanse while Artorius resets.\nIf the tactics above don't work for you, there is another way. Use two &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Shadow%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Shadow Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dampen%20Magic\"&gt;Dampen Magic&lt;/a&gt; (from a &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;), and tranquilizing shot. Let Artorious turn you into a demon when he is \"not\" frenzied. You can survive long enough to kill him, so long as you tranquilize him again right before your Demonic Doom wears off. You still have to kite him, but you don't have to worry so much about him catching up with you, and you will have time to fire auto-shots and kill him more quickly."}

Both of the hunters were mainly interested in seeing the outsiders' hunting skills.

He is most notorious for having unleashed the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; once more unto the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; by freeing them from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe Third War.\nOriginally a respected patriot of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and a royal archmage, Arugal eventually became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. He used to stay at &lt;a href=\"Valgan%27s%20Field\"&gt;Valgan's Field&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dalar%20Dawnweaver\"&gt;Dalar Dawnweaver&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a Kirin Tor mage later raised as a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;\u2014considers Arugal to have been a charlatan whose knowledge of spellcasting was so transparent that he was unworthy to even clean chamber pots in Dalaran. Indeed, Arugal used enchanted items to reinforce his weak magic.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Dalaran and most of its populace, Arugal returned to his homeland of Gilneas. When the Scourge reached the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; protecting Gilneas' northern border, Arugal was called by &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to help him find a way to protect his kingdom. Arugal told him about the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious race he had learned about, which could be summoned to help them. He warned Genn about the worgen's strength and ferocity, but the king decided to enlist their help. Using &lt;a href=\"Ur\"&gt;Ur&lt;/a&gt;'s research, Arugal summoned worgen to attack the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; that attempted to pass the wall. Though they were successful in killing the Scourge, they later turned their rage against the Gilnean soldiers, turning some of them into worgen. This started spreading the worgen curse all through Gilneas.\nSome worgen later sieged the keep of the noble &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt; above the small hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;, causing the keep to quickly fall into shadow and ruin. Driven mad with guilt, Arugal adopted the worgen as his children and retreated to the keep he named &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. He resided there serving the worgen leader &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;, protected by his massive pet &lt;a href=\"Fenrus\"&gt;Fenrus&lt;/a&gt; and haunted by the vengeful ghost of Baron Silverlaine.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nEventually, Arugal started his own &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;worgen cult&lt;/a&gt; by spreading the worgen curse to places like the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt; and Pyrewood and using his magic to keep the worgen under his control. Soon, he had worgen packs such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20pack\"&gt;Shadowfang pack&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Moonrage%20pack\"&gt;Moonrage pack&lt;/a&gt; to do his bidding.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Ashcrombe\"&gt;Sorcerer Ashcrombe&lt;/a&gt; to Shadowfang Keep to check Arugal's progress against the undead, ignorant to the fact that the archmage had now been driven mad. His activities eventually drew the ire of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and he was later assassinated by Horde adventurers.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAfter he was &lt;a href=\"Arugal%20Must%20Die\"&gt;defeated and beheaded&lt;/a&gt; by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Arugal's headless body was buried at the foot of the path leading up to his former stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; saw fit to bring him back as one of his puppets, so the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; princes &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Theraldis\"&gt;Theraldis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Atherann\"&gt;Atherann&lt;/a&gt; resurrected Arugal as a ghost in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and sent him to the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; to subvert the &lt;a href=\"trappers\"&gt;trapper&lt;/a&gt; communities.\nAs indicated by Theraldis' comments, Arugal was sent to &lt;a href=\"Solstice%20Village\"&gt;Solstice Village&lt;/a&gt; to convert the population into worgen, and later did the same in &lt;a href=\"Silverbrook\"&gt;Silverbrook&lt;/a&gt;. He then settled his base of operations in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Tower\"&gt;Shadowfang Tower&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmoon Isle&lt;/a&gt;, off the &lt;a href=\"Eastwind%20Shore\"&gt;Eastwind Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the populations of the trapper villages willingly joined the Wolfcult, while those who resisted were killed or (in the case of the workers of the &lt;a href=\"Hollowstone%20Mine\"&gt;Hollowstone Mine&lt;/a&gt;) cursed to undeath.\nHe seems to command the &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Bloodmoon pack&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s. He has three lieutenants: &lt;a href=\"Varlam\"&gt;Varlam&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; cultist atop a worg), &lt;a href=\"Selas\"&gt;Selas&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Goremaw\"&gt;Goremaw&lt;/a&gt; (a &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt; asked &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill them all, and Arugal was eventually put to a true end.\nCataclysm.\nArugal has been replaced by &lt;a href=\"Vincent%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; as the final boss of Shadowfang Keep.

During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, he was taken captive by the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. After the short-lived races freed him from his 1,000-year imprisonment Arygos openly sided with his father Malygos during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. Following the death of his father Arygos wanted to ensure that he was chosen to be the leader of the blue dragonflight and allied himself with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, but was later betrayed and killed by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nWhen Malygos was driven mad by the loss of his flight during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, he was so lost in his insanity that he abandoned the clutch of eggs that contained both Arygos and his sister, &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; discovered the untended clutch, as well as many others, and took it to &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the clutches were given to the red dragonflight to care for after they hatched. It was a rare example of cooperation among three separate flights with a common cause: care of the unhatched, helpless whelps when they emerged from the shell.\nWar of the Shifting Sands.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; started their &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;first invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; agreed to enlist the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; against the marauding qiraji with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Even with the might of the dragons backing them, however, the sheer numbers of the qiraji and silithid proved overwhelming. And so Anachronos called upon the progeny of the remaining flights, including Arygos of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nArygos, along with &lt;a href=\"Caelestrasz\"&gt;Caelestrasz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;, pushed the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; back into &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; to allow &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, and the night elves to create a magical barrier to hold in the qiraji. The three dragons and their companions flew headlong into the qiraji legions, into the city where they hoped their sacrifice would not be in vain. Though the magical barrier was created, the three dragons were lost within the walls, where they still remained for the next 1,000 years, in humanoid form, as prisoners of the Old God &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Andorgos\"&gt;Andorgos&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Kandrostrasz\"&gt;Kandrostrasz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vethsera\"&gt;Vethsera&lt;/a&gt;, later came to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; after sensing their enslaved brethren deep inside the qiraji city. However, they were unable to attempt to rescue their flight members without also falling prey to same spell which held Caelestrasz, Arygos, and Merithra as C'Thun's slaves. The three waited at the entrance of the temple hoping to find adventurers who would venture into the city to free their brethren, and provided the adventurers with powerful pieces of armor in return for bringing them specific items obtained from defeating C'Thun and his minions.\nArygos and the rest of the captive dragons were ultimately freed by the death of C'Thun.\nNexus Point.\nBy the time of the opening of the Dark Portal, Arygos had returned to the Nexus in Northrend. &lt;a href=\"Tyri\"&gt;Tyri&lt;/a&gt; pulled all of the damaged &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to the Nexus, as she had figured that the energy of the Nexus would stabilize them. &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, finally having enough of everyone trying to master his flight members, declared that they will gain the power of the Nexus then take over Azeroth. Tyri tried desperately to talk him down which almost succeeds till Arygos showed up and attacked the nether dragons, which kicked off a fight between the blue and the nether dragonflight. In the midst of the chaos, Malygos awakened from his slumber. In his insanity, Malygos misinterprets the nether dragons' arrogant proclamations of being the embodiment of the Nexus and absorbed them and their power. The dragon's Nether-warped physiology began to affect the Spell-Weaver himself, ultimately helping him regain some of his lost sanity.\nThe Nexus War.\nAfter recovering from his long depression, Malygos took note of the large number of mortal spellcasters running around Azeroth, recklessly using arcane magic. Thus he deemed the lesser races' use of magic as unacceptable, and he proceeded to declare war on all magic users. Arygos openly sided with his father Malygos during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, while Kalecgos - and Arygos' sister, Kirygosa - stood against him.\nIn Alexstrasza\u2019s opinion, Arygos was even more elitist than most of his flight. She suspected this had to do with the young blue's personal history during the Nexus War. Arygos\u2019s clutch sister Kirygosa had gone missing before the war ended. The unhappy but realistic conclusion was that the young blue, pregnant with her first eggs, had fallen in battle. And because she had always dared to stand up to Arygos, and had sided with those few blues who had turned against Malygos, there was an extra layer of tragedy in that it was likely she had been slain by a member of her own flight.\nA new Aspect of Magic.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;shattered&lt;/a&gt; the world, Alexstrasza, Ysera, their dragonflights, and the blue dragonflight came together at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; to try and figure out a way to fight against him. During the meeting, Arygos continuously accused Alexstrasza of meddling and causing his father's unnecessary death. Kalecgos defended Alexstrasza's position, but the argument quickly faded as the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Father\"&gt;Twilight Father&lt;/a&gt;, attacked Wyrmrest Temple.\nIn truth, Arygos wished to ensure his own succession as leader of the blue dragonflight, and had allied with Deathwing and the twilight dragonflight to assure this. The dragon also believed that with their aid he would have an army powerful enough to end those who had wronged him and his father, in particular he nursed a bitter hatred toward &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and the mortals who struck down Malygos. When Thrall later arrived at the Nexus, Arygos told his guards to simply kill him and the &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; that brought him there, but &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; intervened on Thrall's behalf. Arygos left the Nexus, secretly meeting with the Twilight Father at Wyrmrest Temple to discuss plans that would ensure his own position as the next Blue Aspect. However, the Twilight Father was angry that Arygos had not yet killed Thrall, whose death was vital to his plans.\nWhen it became clear that his flight's loyalties were torn between himself and Kalecgos, Arygos attempted to have him killed by the twilight dragonflight. The blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Tarecgosa\"&gt;Tarecgosa&lt;/a&gt; intervened, however, sacrificing herself to save him. To end the debates and arguments, the flight agreed to meet during the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; to choose a new Aspect. While Arygos preached of a future in which the dragonflight would continue to hoard the world's magic for themselves in order to survive the Cataclysm, Kalecgos felt that the blues should accept responsibility for the Nexus War and instead use magic responsibly for the good of all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As the Celestial Embrace occurred and the two moons crossed, Arygos flew into the sky above the Nexus and insisted that as Malygos's son, it was his birthright to become the new Aspect. However, the blue dragonflight instead chose Kalecgos, who was bathed in the light of the moons and transformed into the new Aspect of Magic. Arygos called them fools and departed to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the Twilight Father, the twilight dragonflight descending upon the other blues in his wake.\nThere, he met an alternate timeline version of , who had been brought by the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; to kill Thrall. Arygos believed that such an act would shake Kalecgos's faith and, hopefully, change the minds of the other blue dragons so that he could become the Aspect instead. Blackmoore agreed and mounted Arygos, only to plunge his sword into the back of the dragon's skull, killing him. The Twilight Father used the blood of Malygos's son to activate the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; and siphon the magic from the Nexus into the massive chromatic dragon &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to life.\nQuests.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, Arygos - in the form of a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; - offers the quest &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Qiraji%20Armaments%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Imperial Qiraji Armaments (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.

Before the corruption of the eredar, his name was Arzaal, which he took back after rejoining &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. He is the leader of a group of man'ari eredar rebels seeking redemption after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nArzaal was amongst the countless &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who loyally followed &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; in service to &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, under the promise of prosperity for their people. At some point after becoming a &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt;, he changed his name to Arzal'kal. Over time he grew horrified at the the bloodshed and ashes left in the Legion's wake, but continued to serve due to fearing his own death more than his sin. In the wake of the Legion's defeat during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Arzal'kal recognized that he couldn't undo his crimes and sought to prove that he was no longer a coward by openly fighting against the Legion in penitence. Seeking to speak with &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, and knowing that &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Hatuun\"&gt;Chieftain Hatuun&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;Argussian Reach&lt;/a&gt; had been in contact with the Prophet, he personally fought off several Legion ambushes by their side to win their trust.\nIn time, Hatuun called upon Velen to meet him on Argus, where he formally introduced the Prophet to Arzal'kal. The meeting itself started off on a bad note with Velen immediately shackling Arzal'kal in holy shackles and accused Hatuun of allying with the Legion. As Hatuun worked himself into a fury over the accusations, Arzal'kal pleaded for Velen to hear him out and declared that he wasn't there to fight. After a moment of contemplation, Velen agreed and learned of Arzal'kal's history, of his vow to no longer be guided by his own cowardice, to which Velen allowed him a chance to prove his words. Thus while Velen and Hatuun remained behind to converse, while adventurers were sent to help Arzal'kal obtain his proof.\nAfter explaining how the man'ari had grown desperate with the Legion's fall, with some grasping for power, others isolating themselves, and others forming cults awaiting the return of Sargeras, he explained that one &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; leader &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Nalridun\"&gt;Speaker Nalridun&lt;/a&gt;, who he had tried and failed to reason with, had seized an ancient relic that Kil'jaeden had kept until his death. Arzal'kal was of the firm opinion that the relic must be returned to Velen and called upon adventurers to meet with him at the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Naroua\"&gt;Grove of Naroua&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving Arzal'kal found himself questioned as to why the adventurer should trust him, to which he admitted that he didn't expect their trust but merely wished to prove that he could still help the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, not despite what he is but because of what he is. He then vowed that the Legion that made him into a monster would learn to fear him. Furthermore, when &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; champions recalled the corruption of the orcs, he revealed that Kil'jaeden had boasted of it often and frequently called the corruption of the orcs his \"masterpiece\". He further stated that there was no beauty in what was done, only a repetition of what Sargeras had done to them and that the orcs should have never pulled into the atrocities they committed. After acknowledging that he couldn't amend the damage that was done, he promised to fight to keep it from ever happening again.\nAfter killing Nalridun, the pair discovered that the relic was in fact the &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Star\"&gt;Brilliant Star&lt;/a&gt;, one of the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;. When questioned as to why he would willingly give the artifact back to the draenei, Arzal'kal proclaimed that he promised to return the shard for them and that while they never could mend what was broken, he could mend the crystal if nothing else. Upon receiving the shard, a stunned Velen declared that there were no words to express his gratitude. However, Arzal'kal countered that he didn't deserve gratitude and expressed his belief that he should have done it sooner. Reflecting on his own difficult choices at &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, Velen expressed understanding but further remarked that forgiveness is not easily given, as too many had suffered. However, Arzal'kal admitted that he didn't expect forgiveness, and admitted that he believed he couldn't be forgiven, not even in a thousand lifetimes, but vowed that if he could do some good, he would see it done. In response, Velen pointed out how others such as the orcs, &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; had proven stronger than their darkness and believed that there was a path forward. He further declared that there was much he wished to discuss with Arzal'kal, and those who believed as he did, to which agreed too and in the process reclaimed his birth name: Arzaal.\nAllies.\nArzaal has several allies on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; who follow him in his quest for redemption.

Ranged and healers should spread out some to mitigate the damage from Chain Lightning. Every so often, the boss will cast a spell called Static Cling which freezes everyone in place. The spell can't be interrupted, but it can be avoided by jumping just before he finishes casting it (you must be in the air at the time he finishes casting to avoid getting stuck). Players should keep an eye on his casting bar, as there is no other warning to indicate that he is casting (Deadly Boss Mods, however, warns you when he is casting it if you have the add-on installed). The debuff can be dispelled, but it can get expensive for the healers.\nEvery so often, the boss creates an Unstable Grounding Field on the ground (he'll yell \"Al'Akir, your servant calls for aid!\" whenever he starts casting). Anybody who is stuck to the ground with Static Cling should be dispelled at this time, and everyone must group up within the area. It's usually triangular in shape, with enough room for everyone to fit. After he finishes creating the field, he'll appear above the field and cast an AoE which will wipe out anybody unfortunate enough to not be under the boss. Damage the boss if you can during this, but your primary concern is to stay alive.\nRinse and repeat.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nTrivia.\nAsaad is voiced by &lt;a href=\"J.B.%20Blanc\"&gt;J.B.

It was his spellbook, called Krasus's Compendium. Containing all the spells he mastered, it lent us a much-needed advantage in the war.\nBefore Kael'thas and his forces laid siege to Kirin'Var, the compendium had been stolen from me by a rebellious apprentice intent on studying necromancy. The apprentice and his followers divided and studied the text in secret, locking themselves inside their houses in the southern part of town.\nProgress.\nHave you brought the book?\nCompletition.\n&lt;Archmage Vargoth's image seems to inspect the compendium.&gt;\nIt's a little worse for the wear, but considering the treatment it's been through, it's a miracle all of it survived.

Upon seeing Lemmy using the &lt;a href=\"Character%20Boost\"&gt;Character Boost&lt;/a&gt; to get to level 90, Krazzel attempts various schemes to get himself to level 100, all of which fail. After the last experiment involving a rocket results in Krazzel being sent back to level 1, a nearby mailbox spurts out a level 100 character boost offer. Before Krazzel can grab it, Renfield takes the contract and signs his own name, boosting himself to level 100 and leaving Krazzel behind.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhvDMTSJi5l8\"&gt;Meet Mischief \u2014 The New Warcraft Pet&lt;/a&gt;\", a video showcasing the &lt;a href=\"Mischief\"&gt;Mischief&lt;/a&gt; companion pet, Krazzel is seen wailing in anger as he looks down upon the townsfolk of a snowy village celebrating the &lt;a href=\"Feast%20of%20Winter%20Veil\"&gt;Feast of Winter Veil&lt;/a&gt;, which he despises. In particular, there is one villager he hates above all others \u2014 his nemesis, Lemmy. Using an enormous, dubious contraption, he plans to disintegrate all of the Winter Veil gifts in the town, but just after he presses the big red button and begins the countdown, he hears a knock on the door and uses his spyglass to see Lemmy standing in front of Krazzel's front door with a gift in hand. As he throws open the door, he finds that Lemmy is gone but has left the gift behind. Upon opening the gift, he finds that it contains a &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; kitten \"as dubious and maniacal as he\", but as he tearfully takes the cat into his arms he realizes that the anti-gift ray is still on. As it is too late to cancel the coutndown, Krazzel uses an escape pod and his vast knowledge of explosives to launch himself and his kitten up into the sky. As his lab goes up in fireworks, Krazzel and his cat look down upon the village joyfully celebrating the holiday, and as the pod flies away from the camera Krazzel warmly hugs his new companion."}

From atop the ghastly Ick, he can safely throw poison, explosives and dark magic at his enemies. From this vantage point, he has also learned dark secrets of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; that could topple the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBosstiary.\n\"Astride Ick, an unusually large zombie, the devious gnome Krick supervises undead labor in the Pit of Saron.\"\nStrategy.\nFor the most part, this is a fairly simple fight with a lot of movement. Focus on Ick as Krick cannot be directly targeted.\nFirst, make sure to clear out the other plague eruptors surrounding Krick and Ick, as they will periodically wander up to the boss area, which can cause a wipe if too many join the fight. When engaging Krick and Ick, Ick will stick to basic melee, while Krick will ride atop Ick's back, firing globs of poison that will land and create a field of poison, which continues to deal damage to anyone standing in it and lasts for around ten seconds. Thus, the tank must continue to drag Krick and Ick around to avoid the poison patches. Most of the time Krick will stick to firing off Toxic Waste. If not, any of the three abilities could be cast at random:\nKrick will target and have Ick attack a specific player including the tank. Said player must immediately run away, kiting Ick around the area taking care to not get cornered. Ick's attack power is increased, so do not get caught.\nIck will cast a poison nova, which is a point-blank &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; that deals extremely high damage (around 30k on Heroic) followed by a DoT ticking for 1500/6000 every three seconds. It only has an 18 yard range, so run away while he's winding up, as it's a five second cast. &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; works to negate the damage here, enabling them to keep DPSing or tanking without running away.\nIn this attack, Ick remains stationary while Krick continuously summons mines at every player's position for 18 seconds. Said mines explode after a few seconds, so keep moving.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He is a &lt;a href=\"nerubian%20vizier\"&gt;nerubian vizier&lt;/a&gt; under the command of &lt;a href=\"Anub%27Arak\"&gt;Anub'Arak&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 a powerful servant of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. His main objective is to guard the gate that leads further into the ancient city.\nBackground.\nKrik'thir was the guardian of the gates to Azjol-Nerub, but fell in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt; defending their home from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. As per his station, he was in possession of the key to the hidden empire. Krik'thir did his job well, even though he died and was raised to serve the Lich King, he managed to keep most of the empire closed off.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Krik'thir was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill him once again.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The gates of Azjol-Nerub stood unchallenged for centuries until the arrival of the Lich King. In mockery of Krik'thir's inability to protect his home, the nerubian was raised into undeath and forced to protect the very gates he failed to guard successfully in life.\"\nThe Event.\nThe boss is guarded by three groups of three spiders. The pulls are successive, meaning that once you pull the first group an event has started. Sometimes you can catch a break between groups to drink if you are able to kill them fast enough. There is no break before the boss is pulled. \nEach pull consists of a miniboss and two adds. In addition to the constant risk of Anub'ar Skirmishers and Web Wrap, each miniboss has a special ability: from left to right these are:\nLeft: A poison spit that hits targets in a cone; it is ideal for the tank to face this boss away from the party, but given the chaos of the fight this is not always possible. The group can eat the damage.\nMiddle: A blast of webs that hits targets in a cone and disorients everyone for about three seconds. Beware of drops in healing and aggro.\nRight: Attacks rapidly as through dual wielding with a Frenzy-style effect. Be prepared for massive incoming damage.\nSome groups have an Anub'ar Skirmisher, which will drop aggro during the fight and focus on a random party member, becoming immune to taunt and CC, so they should be killed first. Throughout these pulls a random party member will become encased in webbing which needs to be attacked in order to free them. It's helpful to have one party member keeping a lookout for this. A good way to handle this encounter is to start with the furthest left group and pull them back into the hall a bit, giving the mana-users time to drink when the second group aggroes.\nHeroic.\nThe event is similar to the regular run. The groups pull successively after the first group. The large mobs, Watcher Silthik, Watcher Gashra, and Watcher Narjil are immune to &lt;a href=\"shackle\"&gt;shackle&lt;/a&gt;, however the smaller spiders can be crowd controlled.\nSimilar to Normal, kill the Anub'ar Skirmishers first. In addition it is important that no one turn their back on this mob, as they can hit with &lt;a href=\"backstab\"&gt;backstab&lt;/a&gt; for over 10k even on players with plate armor."}

While &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was the acknowledged ruler of Theramore, Kristoff did the day-to-day administrative work. He was a forthright person with a high capacity for irritating minutiae, his organizational skills legendary.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Kristoff served as a clerk for &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Garithos\"&gt;Grand Marshal Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, and served as one of his advisors after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Kristoff and the other advisors strongly urged Garithos to reconsider his alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, believing them to be treacherous. By the time Kristoff was proven right and Garithos met his end at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, Kristoff had already left, probably to Theramore.\nKristoff believed that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was the only \"civilized\" orc and long voiced the fear that if Thrall were dead, the orcs would \"revert to form\" (they had gained a reputation among humans as mindless savages) and overrun Theramore. When Jaina decided to ally with Thrall against her own father, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin&lt;/a&gt;, Kristoff decided to take extraordinary action. To that end, he allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to set off a war between &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and Theramore in order to destroy the orcs. However, Zmodlor had also enthralled the orc &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt;, one of Thrall's chief warriors, and were setting the orcs and humans against one another. With Jaina absent, he ordered the reinforcement of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, knowing that the orcs would perceive it as a threatening gesture.\nWith the aid of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; who had banished Zmodlor centuries earlier, Jaina was able to return to Theramore and confronted Kristoff with his crimes. Infuriated by what Kristoff had done, Jaina lashed out with a bolt of lightning intended to exorcise Zmodlor's influence. The effort was successful, but Kristoff died shortly afterwards, his last words an apology for his actions."}

The stranger mistook him for the original Greatfather Winter, and told him to meet him at the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Airfield\"&gt;Ironforge Airfield&lt;/a&gt; right before midnight in order to get a special toy made by a tinker for tomorrow's presents giving. Eventually, as the stranger left, Fala told Krizz that the stranger spoke with Fritz the evening that he disappeared. Krizz realized that the mentioned tinker and Fritz is the same person and that something bad is about to happen. Krizz eventually asked &lt;a href=\"Metzen%20the%20Reindeer\"&gt;Metzen the Reindeer&lt;/a&gt; to carry them to the airport. As they arrived, Krizz immediately attacked the dwarves, successfully and freed professor Fizzlesprocket and other gnome captives. Fritz then retold his story. He was forced to create a giant robot with Greatfather's clothes. The robot would be used to \"took\" presents for delivery. However, in those gifts were treasures from the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Treasury\"&gt;Royal Treasury&lt;/a&gt; stolen by the dark irons. Thanks to Krizz, the plan was foiled.\nHe then turned to leave as pilots could took the gnomes home. As he was about to hop on Metzen, he told him that he was fired out of Booty Bay, because he did not want to help the client as it would result in murderers. Metzen seemed to like the goblin. Right then Fala revealed him that she knew he was not Greatfather as no Greathfather has goblin's ears and thanked him for saving her father. Fritz then invited Krizz for Winter Veil Eve dinner. He accepted and even carved the roast boar. \nEverything seemed all right - stolen presents were returned and children got their gifts. And the giant robot decorated the tree."}

Among the inmates of the Arcatraz are agents of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, demons of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and even servants of the mighty &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his followers took the Keep, he sent a warden and guards to the Arcatraz. Kael's &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, however, were corruptible and the prisoners have begun to break free...\nAs with the other &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; instances, every member of the group needs a flying mount (or flying form, if a druid) to reach the instance entrance. If you cannot fly you may be summoned by a Warlock instead; the minimum level to enter the instance is 65. One full run yields about 1800, and one full heroic run yields about 2500 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; serving as the strategic battlefront in the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru recently used Tempest Keep to reach the shattered land. However, when the naaru set out from their stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; quickly raided the dimensional fortress and assumed control over its satellite structures. Now, guided by some unknown purpose, Kael'thas manipulates the keep's otherworldly technologies, using them to harness the chaotic energies of the Netherstorm itself.\nArcatraz served as a prison for the most dangerous beings the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; came across in their travels. However, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; servant, &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Skyriss\"&gt;Harbinger Skyriss&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Mellichar\"&gt;Warden Mellichar&lt;/a&gt; and made him release many of the prisoners.\nLegion.\nSeveral years later, when the Legion attacked &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, some Legion prisoners escaped.\nAs the forces of Azeroth invaded the Legion's home base, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that the demons had gone to the Arcatraz to free &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Raalgar\"&gt;High Inquisitor Raalgar&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; who was immortal because of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Heart%20of%20Argus%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Fel Heart of Argus&lt;/a&gt;. The Fel Heart of Argus tied Raalgar to the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; of the world via &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Heartwell\"&gt;Argussian Heartwell&lt;/a&gt;s that led directly to the core of the planet. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Grand Artificer Romuul&lt;/a&gt; sent an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to the Arcatraz to stop Raalgar from being freed, but the inquisitor successfully returned to Argus.\nAlthough years had passed, the &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz%20Sentinel\"&gt;Arcatraz Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s were still active and fighting the Legion's presence. An &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Felshadow%20Seeker\"&gt;Felshadow Seeker&lt;/a&gt; commented that &lt;a href=\"Zereketh%20the%20Unbound\"&gt;Zereketh the Unbound&lt;/a&gt;'s Void magic still lingered as well.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The mighty &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; was created by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye. \""}

He was imbued by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; with mastery over the earth and forging. He notably created the subterranean chambers imprisoning the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt;, and is a guardian of the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;. Although believed dead for some time following an incursion by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt; into Uldaman, according to a note from &lt;a href=\"Spymaster\"&gt;Spymaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, Archaedas may have been \"merely disabled\".\nBackground.\nOrdering of Azeroth.\nArchaedas is one of the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s created by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to lead the titan-forged armies against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Archaedas was imbued with power by &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;. Together with &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, he battled and defeated &lt;a href=\"Therazane%20the%20Stonemother\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, he collapsed the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;i burrows leading them on the surface where they could be defeated. Archaedas constructed the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; to tend to Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough Archaedas, Khaz'goroth channeled his powers into the &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; to transform him into one of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLoken's betrayal.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; was corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; and had already indisposed most of the other Keepers, Archaedas and &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; fled with their friend &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt;, a giantess, as well as &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of the Storm Peaks. Archaedas and Tyr crafted a shield named &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt;. They gave Truthguard to a &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; champion who helped expose Loken's corruption. Archaedas and his allies would later steal the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from Ulduar and flee south.\nLoken sent two &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi after the group, and Tyr held them off, giving his life in the process. The vrykul stayed behind to honor him. Archaedas and the others traveled south to &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; and hid the Discs of Norgannon there. The earthen, fearing the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, asked to be put into hibernation until the day would come that a cure could be found. The mechagnomes, even knowing they were also cursed, volunteered to stay awake and keep watch over the earthen. Ironaya and Archaedas also entered hibernation within Uldaman's vaults.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter a long slumber, Archaedas was eventually awakened and disabled by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who had infiltrated the facility of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. After fiercely fighting, his weapons were left behind, whether out of fear or respect is a mystery. Among them are &lt;a href=\"The%20Rockpounder\"&gt;The Rockpounder&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stoneslayer\"&gt;Stoneslayer&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Archaedic%20Stone\"&gt;Archaedic Stone&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible that he may not have died during the fight and has simply been disabled.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Deep within Uldaman is a chamber containing one of the greatest treasures of the titans, created by &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; himself. However, thus far no explorers have managed to gain access to the relic, for any attempt at doing so activates the great watcher Archaedas, an immense guardian who easily dispatches treasure seekers through his powerful attacks and a veritable army of servants. Crafted from some of the oldest, strongest stone taken from Uldaman's depths, Archaedas is a foe as formidable as he is ancient.\"\nStrategy.\nGroup setup for the fight:\nThe last spot is best filled up by a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;. A party level of at least 40 is recommended, though the tank should (as always) be of higher level.\nIf you intend to &lt;a href=\"Farming\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; this boss with a high level character, note that the altars require at least 3 players channeling simultaneously in order to activate them (as of patch 3.0.8 this is no longer true; the altars can be opened by a single player).\nIf a &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; occurs and you fail to kill Archaedas, all his minions will return to their former positions and turn back to stone. So does the boss himself, so you have to redo everything again. \nArchaedas should be soloable by any well-equipped melee class from level 56 onwards. At level 60 he should be no problem, as long as the adds are dealt with quickly.\nThe strategies below are based on the original (level 47) Archaedas. Now that he has been lowered to level 40, following these should make the fight trivial; even a three-player party (tank, healer, DPS) at level 39-43 should have no problem dealing with him, as long as they know what they are doing.\nStage 1.\nArchaedas himself does not deal that much damage. A &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; should have no problem keeping the tank alive through the first stages of the fight.\nDuring the first stage, Archaedas will randomly awaken one of the small statues of the outer circle with a visible beam of light. These &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Guardian%20%28Uldaman%29\"&gt;Earthen Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s (~38, non-elite) have ~460\u00a0hp and must quickly be killed by the aforementioned damage dealer with backup from his support healer. The last spot player will help the tank get Archaedas' HP down. Usually when Archaedas' HP gets to 66%, he enters the second stage.\nStage 2.\nHe will now summon the 6 guards (non-elite) of the inner circle at once. Best method to deal with them is to &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"taunt\"&gt;taunt&lt;/a&gt; them and have them &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Explosion\"&gt;Arcane Exploded&lt;/a&gt; (if using mage) or &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;d (if using warlock; be aware that the priest must heal you frequently in this case) to death by the last spot player. If you don't have those classes, a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Barkskin\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hurricane\"&gt;Hurricane&lt;/a&gt; plus help from hunters with &lt;a href=\"Volley\"&gt;Volley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Multi-Shot\"&gt;Multi-Shot&lt;/a&gt; also works. To easily group up the mobs, have your healer and AoE classes stand at the center of the room and tank Archaedas off to the side. The 6 mobs will collapse on the healer at the same time, so AoE can start right away.\nHe will continue summoning mobs from the outer circle as well, deal with them as in the first stage. At the end of this stage (HP ~33%), the damage dealers should be at full mana. Archaedas will now enter the third stage.\nStage 3.\nThe boss summons two &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Vault%20Warder\"&gt;Vault Warder&lt;/a&gt;s, lvl 45 Elite) which will come running from the outside of the room. They should be taunted to attack the tank at once and all healing should focus on the tank once he has &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;. If you have them, Hunter and Warlock &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s can be used to offtank the warders. This ensures that the adds are tanked immediately, keeping them from getting a quick kill on your healer. It also spreads out the damage, which is useful if your healer is getting low on mana. \nThe elite golems despawn as Archaedas dies, so this third stage should be done as quickly as possible, which is why one wants the Mage at the beginning of the last stage. As soon as he is able to do so get the warrior to &lt;a href=\"Execute\"&gt;Execute&lt;/a&gt; Archaedas also. Burn Archaedas down fast, leaving the golems alone.\nAlternate fight location.\nFollow the above, just try this to make the fight a bit easier.\nHere's the strategy: the three fastest people stay downstairs and activate the pillar that wakes Archaedas. The other two members are upstairs in the room where you just killed the 4 golems. The three wake Archaedas, then run upstairs to join the other two in that room. Follow the strategy given in the above sections for the fight. One party member can take care of the non-elites that trickle in (easy one-shot kills for a mage). Killing him is possible with a party that is lower than you might think, provided that you have a good healer. Often a group can kill Archaedas before the elites even make it up to the fight.\n[WARNING!]\nThis alternate fight spot may not work anymore, as it causes the non-elites and elite adds to instantly spawn the moment he walks out of his room. Try at your own risk.\nAlternative Strategy (If a Less Functional Group is on Hand).\nThis actually has worked before, so don't sneeze at it \u2014 Archaedas himself is not the most difficult boss that you will ever see \u2014 in fact, he doesn't even require a true \"tank\" (Warrior, Paladin, Feral Druid). It is actually possible for a Beast Mastery specced hunter's pet to tank Archaedas, with the hunter healing with Mend Pet. While this certainly can be a mana drain, it frees up the other four group members to focus solely on the spawns after Archaedas drops down to 66%. It is a lot easier than it sounds, provided the Hunter has a good pet \u2014 the best part about this is that the other party members don't have to be as high, provided the hunter is around 47-48.\nAdditional Strategy (for high dps groups).\nArchaedas truly isn't that strong, and it's quite easy to beat him with a simple group. It has been done with a shaman, paladin and a druid. Rather than healing, the druid simply tanked him using Frenzied Regeneration near the start of the fight, while everyone focused fire on him. No time was wasted on anything else. Once he's defeated, all the others despawn instantly, so its an easy fight. I think that I did go into normal form and use Regrowth once, but that's it. Also the levels were me(44), shaman(41), pally (43). Also confirmed to be easy with a combat swords rogue(42), feral druid that healed(44), and a fury warrior that tanked(52).\nFirst make sure your group has enough DPS to focus Archaedas and finish him in under 1 min. If you decide to do this strategy make sure you tank waits to use AOE aggro generation abilities until Archaedas hits about 50% hp that way the adds don't aggro the squishy party members. If your group can't manage enough DPS to drop him into stage 2 before or just as he finishes summoning the add in stage 1, your tank will have a great deal of trouble at stage 3. Also, it is helpful to save your short cooldown abilities as you near the end of stage 2 so that as soon as stage 3 begins you can pop them to finish him off, this can help save the tank at the most painful part. Also, if Archaedas is below ~20% and your tank is about to die, don't panic, just keep your rezzer alive and blow all remaining cooldowns to finish him asap. It is fine if a group member dies as long as it wasn't your rezzer and Archaedas dies. Once he dies then you can laugh as everything else despawns without having to be killed.\nIn the RPG.\nArchaedas is one of the ancient servants of the titans, a giant of &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; crafted to guard the vault of Uldaman. To ensure he would always be vigilant, his creators sealed him in a stone shell that keeps him magically preserved in a timeless sleep. Any attempt to activate the keystone that opens the vault awakens him immediately. Should the creatures not speak the appropriate command words at once, Archaedas carries out his orders and destroys the invaders before returning to sleep once again. Sadly, the command words have been lost to the ages, so anyone who awakens him almost certainly finds himself engaged in battle. Archaedas stands 18 feet high and weighs 12,000 pounds. He can speak Dwarven and Titan fluently, but sees no need to do so except when commanding a statue to life. The stone cracks and shatters, and an immense giant with craggy features steps forth. It wears an ornate breastplate and wields a sword almost as tall as its frame, about the height of three sturdy humans.\nArchaedas strikes with his massive greatsword at whoever released him, throwing stones (usually fragments of the ruins of Uldaman) only at opponents who can fly or otherwise elude him. He targets what he considers to be the most dangerous foe, usually the one who dealt him the most damage. He calls on other stone guardians as often as possible."}

Unlike other professions, it cannot be learned until level 20. Upon learning archeology, player receives the ability &lt;a href=\"Survey\"&gt;Survey&lt;/a&gt;. There are twelve fields of research players can explore, each relating to a race in the game, such as troll, night elf, dwarf, and tol'vir. Using the surveying skill, players gather &lt;a href=\"Archaeology%20Fragment\"&gt;Archaeology Fragment&lt;/a&gt;s of one type (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Dwarf%20Archaeology%20Fragment\"&gt;Dwarf Archaeology Fragment&lt;/a&gt;) from &lt;a href=\"Archaeology%20Find\"&gt;Archaeology Find&lt;/a&gt;s of the same type. They can then solve the current stage of this race's research and will receive an item upon doing so. \nOfficial overview.\n\"Archaeologists search the world - and places beyond - for mysterious remnants of the past. Their digs unearth all manner of artifacts, and a persistent archaeologist will research commonplace historical items alongside rare and powerful relics.\n\"Artifacts provide invaluable insight into the history of the world, but some collectors are more than willing to assign a monetary value to them. After documenting finds in their journal, archaeologists can sell the items they retrieve to vendors and museum curators for extra money.\n\"Archaeology is a secondary profession - anyone can learn to investigate and assemble the ruins of the past, no matter how many other professions they've devoted themselves to.\n\"All archaeologists begin by surveying maps of Azeroth to find the locations of promising dig sites, and then investigating those sites on foot along with survey tools in an attempt to narrow down the location of the most precious historical fragments in that area. Different locations provide different types of historical artifacts - and different rewards.\n\"Archaeologists who hone their craft over time recover increasingly more valuable and rare items, and their knowledge about the world and past of Azeroth grows alongside their collection of relics.\"\nHow archaeology works.\nAs related by &lt;a href=\"Ghostcrawler\"&gt;Ghostcrawler&lt;/a&gt;:\nArchaeological dig sites.\nOnce Archaeology is trained, you can see dig sites on your continent map and your mini-map. There are always four dig sites per continent. These will not change until you dig all the fragments out of any one site.\nYour dig sites appear in level-appropriate zones. Players will not be able to survey in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; or any of the Cataclysm zones until they have reached the minimum level to enter those zones.\nSites are race-specific. You can usually discern the race by the location and name, and some race locations are only available on some continents. You need both a minimum character level and a minimum archaeology level to use some sites.\nThere is no competition for dig sites; each site is player-specific.\nSome dig sites in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; will have a gold-colored icon; these are sites containing more powerful, often elite mobs. These sites have a higher chance to contain &lt;a href=\"keystone\"&gt;keystone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Power\"&gt;Artifact Power&lt;/a&gt; but are otherwise identical to other dig sites.\nFinds and fragments.\nTo search a dig site, use the &lt;a href=\"Survey\"&gt;Survey&lt;/a&gt; ability. A will spawn, pointing in the approximate direction of a find; it looks like a telescope with a small flashing light on a pole next to it. The color of the light and the rate at which it flashes tell you how far you are from a find: red means you are far away, yellow means you are close, and green means you may be within 40 yards or so. The precise ranges for the different light colors vary depending on the site, with larges sites having longer ranges. When you loot your find, you'll get several fragments specific to a particular race, and may get a &lt;a href=\"keystone\"&gt;keystone&lt;/a&gt;. Each site yields only finds specific to one race. Note that unearthed archaeology finds will despawn if they aren't looted quickly enough, so be careful about surveying in combat. Also remember that if you are having some difficulty seeing your find, it will automatically show up on the &lt;a href=\"minimap\"&gt;minimap&lt;/a&gt;, just as &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s and minerals do with &lt;a href=\"Find%20Herbs\"&gt;Find Herbs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Find%20Minerals\"&gt;Find Minerals&lt;/a&gt;. Although each archaeology site can have six finds unearthed at a time, only one node is active at a time: once the first find is unearthed, the location of the second find is randomly selected, it is possible to unearth two or even six finds in a row at the exact same location. Once the third find is unearthed the dig site despawns and a new site spawns somewhere else on the continent.\nThere are two main strategies to surveying. The first strategy involves attempting to triangulate by moving around the outer edge of a dig site. However, due to the inaccuracy of the directional indicator (the find may be anywhere in a frontal cone of about 75 degrees) this will often prove to not provide sufficient information for locating finds. The farther away from the , the greater the area that can include the find. The second strategy involves some , heading in the general direction indicated and for approximate distance indicated and survey again from that position, to \"zero in\" on the artifacts, using geographical landmarks to help locate finds.\nBeing aware of the landscape can help locate finds as well. Consider that the fragments are not \"randomly\" placed. Spawn points were placed by designers who utilize their \"design aesthetics\" in placing them. Consider the landscape and proximity to geographic features and existing non-fragment ruins and animal bones when choosing a location to survey. This can speed up your location of fragments.\nThe fact that each digsite contains only a few nodes could allow gathering addons such as Gatherer or Gather Mate to aid in archaeology. Addons such as Archaeology Helper, S.A.L. and ArcheoTriangle aid in triangulation and orienteering.\nAs the spawn points are not random, try surveying on the spot after finding your first and second fragment. It is entirely possible for the next one to be within reach, and even to spawn in the exact same spot as the last one.\nArtifacts.\nWhen you get a new kind of fragment, you'll start a research project. You can only work on one artifact per race at a time. When you have enough fragments, click codice_1 to complete that artifact. You cannot waste excess fragments: if you have leftover fragments, they will just apply to the next project. You can accordingly save up to 200 fragments of one kind and solve several projects in a row.\nMost artifacts are common. These give a bit of lore or flavor text and an item you can sell for a small profit. You can estimate the value of the artifact by the number of fragments required to finish it.\nSome artifacts are rare, and make a blue or purple item. Many of these are toys, or for flavor, but some are actual weapons and armor. Weapons and armor are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20to%20Account\"&gt;bound to account&lt;/a&gt;, but will not scale like &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt;s do. Also, such artifacts can only be solved once per character.\nLevels.\nArchaeology uses the same leveling scheme as the other secondary &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s. Players begin as apprentices with zero skill points, and gain points by practicing archaeology skills.\nAt all levels, players receive one skill point for every successful collection of archaeology fragments, five skill points for creating a common artifact, and 15 skill points for completing a rare artifact. Previous to &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.3\"&gt;Patch 4.3&lt;/a&gt;, higher level archaeologists would get more fragements from each successful survey. However, in an &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.3.0%20%28undocumented%20changes%29\"&gt;undocumented change&lt;/a&gt;, the number of fragments per survey was increased to its current level of five to nine. As one may dig up to six times at a site, this yields potentially up to 54 fragments per site.\nAt all skill levels, the archaeologist may also discover a &lt;a href=\"keystone\"&gt;keystone&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"archaeology%20rewards\"&gt;archaeology rewards&lt;/a&gt; page give fuller details.\nMost artifacts are items, worth between and to a vendor. Occasionally and projects come up (see &lt;a href=\"archaeology%20rewards\"&gt;archaeology rewards&lt;/a&gt; for more information). Most of these rare items have merely cosmetic effects, but players can also construct non-combat pets and other highly desirable items. Players also get new titles upon reconstructing enough rare-quality artifacts: &lt;a href=\"I%20Had%20It%20in%20My%20Hand\"&gt;Assistant Professor&lt;/a&gt; for the first rare reconstructed item, &lt;a href=\"What%20was%20Briefly%20Yours%20is%20Now%20Mine\"&gt;Associate Professor&lt;/a&gt; for 10 rare reconstructed artifacts, and &lt;a href=\"It%20Belongs%20in%20a%20Museum%21\"&gt;Professor&lt;/a&gt; for 20 rare artifacts. (These titles correspond to tenure-track faculty ranks in North American universities.) \nArchaeology levels limit what kind of artifacts players can make. Players begin by collecting fragments for dwarf, night elf, and troll artifacts, as well as natural fossils, such as shells and fossilized ferns. At higher levels, players can research artifacts from different cultures, which will take them deeper into the lore. The higher-level archaeology racial project pages (e.g. orc or tol'vir) are not available to players until they have reached the appropriate level and have collected some fragments for a given type, though players can always see the greyed-out, untitled, and unclickable icons of not-yet-accessible cultures on the \"Races\" page of the archaeology journal. As soon as players hit the appropriate point level and make one successful dig at a new kind of site, that section of the journal is fully opened (i.e. a player can first see the draenei section of the archaeology journal upon hitting 300 archaeology and collect the first draenei archaeology fragments).\nZones and dig sites.\nArchaeology dig sites can be found all across Azeroth, as well as on alternate Draenor and Outland; there are no dig sites in the Shadowlands. There are four dig sites on each continent available at any one time. Dig sites are available based on player skill. However, compared to other gathering professions, there is no competition between players. Upon reaching a dig site, players will be able to collect their six finds before the dig site dries up and a new one is made available. Even if other players are searching at the site, the finds are individual to each player. \nRace descriptions.\nArchaeology categories added in ' and ' have unique descriptions of the race's background and culture, viewable in the in-game Archaeology interface. New Archaeology races added in \"\" onwards lack these descriptions; when viewed in the Archaeology interface, they instead simply display the description of whichever artifact the player is set to solve next for that race.\nAdditional fragments and useful vendor items.\nIf players wish to purchase specific racial fragments (E.g. &lt;a href=\"Crate%20of%20Tol%27vir%20Archaeology%20Fragments\"&gt;Crate of Tol'vir Archaeology Fragments&lt;/a&gt;), they can use &lt;a href=\"Restored%20Artifact\"&gt;Restored Artifact&lt;/a&gt;s that are acquired from crating common artifacts of Pandaria skill levels onwards. The crated artifacts are turned in at either the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Seat of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, or to and in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to crates, the vendors also sell lodestones that can teleport yourself to digsites and digsite randomization in Level 90+ zones, and &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20Notebook\"&gt;Explorer's Notebook&lt;/a&gt;, an item that grants the player &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Missions\"&gt;Garrison Missions&lt;/a&gt; that reward Draenor fragments (And a few give keystones).\nRewards.\nArchaeology was originally intended to allow advancement in &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20the%20Titans%20%28feature%29\"&gt;Path of the Titans (feature)&lt;/a&gt; system and may have awarded players with Ancient Glyph slots and recipes. At present, rewards include various non-combat items, mounts and &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; quality &lt;a href=\"Bind%20to%20Account\"&gt;Bind to Account&lt;/a&gt; gear. Players are able to piece together skeletal fragments to create a skeletal raptor mount, for example. In Cataclysm dungeons, players can also read ancient runes found in ruins and &lt;a href=\"Archaeology%20quests\"&gt;dungeons to give buffs to themselves&lt;/a&gt; and others.\nAll of the rare artifacts are listed here:\nThere are also achievements awarded as a result of leveling archaeology and finding rare finds:\nMacros.\nEasy access.\nThis simple macro puts both new skills on one button for your toolbar. Click to survey or hold a modifier key like shift and click to open your Archaeology skill book.\n codice_2\nSolve count and summary.\nThis macro shows how many finds players have come across. Open up the archaeology window and look at the results list before this macro will do anything useful.\n codice_3\nExample output:\n Dwarf: 9 (rare: 1 solved: 8)\n Draenei: 10 (rare: 2 solved: 16)\n Fossil: 13 (rare: 2 solved: 13)\n Night Elf: 9 (rare: 2 solved: 12)\n Nerubian: 4 (rare: 0 solved: 3)\nThe first number is the count is the amount of \"unique\" finds players have come across for that race, whether or not that find has been solved. The next number lists the quantity of rare finds, and the solved count lists the total number of artifacts solved for that race, including duplicates. If players have not had a duplicate find for a race, the unique count will be greater than the solved count for that race.\nDruid swift-shifting.\nThis macro allows druids to shift out of flight form and into travel form to survey a digsite when clicked, and switch back into swift flight form when right clicked. Simply remove the word \"swift\" from the macro if you do not have swift flight form.\n codice_4\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

When you solve an artifact you gain an actual item, as well as an entry in your \"Completed Artifacts\" archaeology tab.\n\"Common artifacts\" are (with &lt;a href=\"Canopic%20Jar\"&gt;one notable exception&lt;/a&gt;) quality items, indicating that there is no in-game use for them. These give you a little bit of lore or flavor text and an item you can sell for a small profit (presumably to a museum!). The profit increases as the value of the artifact increases. You can estimate this by the number of fragments needed to finish the artifact. You will only find cheaper artifacts at dig sites requiring little skill, but as the skill required to survey at the dig site increases, so does the general value of the common artifacts. You will not \"generally\" find a second copy of a common object until you have found all the common artifacts of that race, but exceptions abound.

The Dark Iron dwarves came to dwell in between the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, in the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nFossils.\n\"Fossils are the preserved remains of animals or plants from the ancient past. Typically the living tissues are replaced with minerals that preserve the form of the original organism.\"\nNight elf artifacts.\n\"The kaldorei are one of the most ancient races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. One of the darkest moments in their history occurred when the quel'dorei, or &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; - the highest caste of elven nobility - unleashed &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;dangerous magic&lt;/a&gt; that brought the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into the world and &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;resulted in countless deaths&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nTroll artifacts.\n\"The earliest known trolls belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, from which all other trolls are descended. The Zandalari were regarded as an overwatching &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; caste for all trolls and worked tirelessly to record and preserve troll society and traditions. Of the many tribes that split off from the Zandalari, the two most dominant were the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDraenei artifacts.\n\"The draenei were originally &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who fled from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and settled on the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, where they came into contact with the orcs. When the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; arrived, many draenei fled again, this time coming to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where they joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOrc artifacts.\n\"The orcs of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; originally inhabited the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the source of most of these ancient orcish artifacts. At first, orcs were a largely peaceful people, but they turned to outright barbarity under the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs arrived in Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and fought against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;wars&lt;/a&gt;. Another may be on the horizon.\"\nVrykul artifacts.\n\"The vrykul are a race of giant warriors native to the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. They have a close affinity with the sea and with native &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt;s. Many vrykul were absorbed into the vast armies of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nNerubian artifacts.\n\"The nerubians are descended from an ancient race known as the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, roughly half of which migrated far to the north after continual warfare with the trolls. There they founded a gigantic city-state below &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. The arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was brutally hard on the wicked nerubian race, with many of the spiderlike creatures converted to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and others driven deep into hiding.\"\nTol'vir artifacts.\n\"The tol'vir were originally stone constructs created by the &lt;a href=\"titans\"&gt;titans&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard the secrets of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. They possess feline lower bodies and heads as well as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; torsos. Like many other titan creations, the tol'vir succumbed to the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Three tribes exist in the present day: &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orsis%20tribe\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Choking%20Sands\"&gt;nearly wiped out&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt;. The latter tribe has allied with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; in order to regain the tol'vir's stone form.\"\nPandaren artifacts.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; are an enigmatic race native to the long-hidden continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Honorable and filled with a love of good company and food, the Pandaren have been content to live in seclusion, allowing their culture to flourish and thrive away from the influence of the outside world. While the Pandaren are predominantly a peace-loving race, their history is marked with turmoil and strife.\"\nMogu artifacts.\n\"The life-giving waters of the valley enabled a race of brutes to grow to enormous size, strength, and intelligence. These creatures were called the \"&lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt;\". Their culture was built on strength: warrior despots ruling via iron fist. Their monuments of stone, built to last, still stand to this day.\"\nMantid artifacts.\n\"The mantid empire predates the arrival of the Titans. This ancient civilization of highly intelligent insectoids is ruled by the mantid &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Empress&lt;/a&gt;, and is organized by caste. Mantid society revolves around &lt;a href=\"kypari%20tree\"&gt;kypari tree&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Kyparite\"&gt;amber&lt;/a&gt; produced from their sap.\nAchievements.\nNote: The Diggerest achievements progression only counts common artifacts when they are solved for the first time."}

Following Faol's death, Benedictus took charge of the Church and swore to continue the good work his mentor had begun so many years ago.\nJust after the death of &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin Ellerian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; gave Benedictus a task to find the key to Tiffin's locket. The quest would be finished a decade later as detailed below.\nThe fall of Lordaeron and the appearance of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; pushed Benedictus' conviction to the breaking point, and he was overcome with questions over why the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly abandoned &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, and the other good people of Lordaeron in their hour of greatest need.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBenedictus was located in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Square\"&gt;Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that he trained young priests and showed members of the Alliance the way of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccording to his follower, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Karl%20Philips\"&gt;Commander Karl Philips&lt;/a&gt;, Benedictus was kind and wise. He asked to pity the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; by granting them a swift death. Benedictus helped cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Eye%20of%20Paleth\"&gt;Cursed Eye of Paleth&lt;/a&gt; and asked Alliance heroes to kill &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorruption.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the sinister &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult spread throughout every major city on Azeroth to recruit others to their cause, particularly traumatized survivors of the Third War. The cultists learned of Benedictus' uncertainty and flocked to him under the guise of believers of the Holy Light in need of guidance. In truth, they slowly but surely whittled away at what was left of the archbishop's beliefs. Some spoke of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, a force that would never abandon its servants as the Light had. Benedictus had believed &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt; to be unholy and corruptive, but now he began to wonder if that was truly the case or if it was merely what he had been led to believe. This curiosity opened the way to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, who began to whisper in Benedictus' dreams and showed the Light as a force that tolerated only perfect order and obedience and served its mortal adherents when it needed to, not because of their faith.\nThe dreams continued for several nights, culminating in a vision of the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, which Benedictus saw not as the apocalyptic end of all things, but as a chance to break free from the Holy Light's tyranny and create a new world where he would be the master of his own destiny. He came to believe the Old Gods and the powers of the Void to be the natural state of the universe. Unlike the Light, which had brought only disappointment and heartache, the Void would never abandon or ignore its followers. Benedictus pledged his life to serving the Void and joined the Twilight's Hammer cult, becoming one of its most influential members, but publicly remained the head of the Church of the Holy Light and retained his ability to wield holy magic through sheer willpower. The position afforded him great power and the opportunity to recruit other disillusioned believers into the cult. The leader of the Twilight's Hammer, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, saw the recruitment of Benedictus as a triumph.\nCataclysm.\nSome time before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Benedictus appointed a priest named &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Cloak of Purity&lt;/a&gt;, which was stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;, last seen in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. Truthfully though, he just wanted to get rid of the angry priest.\nShortly before the Cataclysm, Benedictus led a memorial service for the victims of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in the Cathedral of Light.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; that heralded the Cataclysm, Benedictus protected the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20Square\"&gt;Cathedral Square&lt;/a&gt; from the raging elements. Once they were defeated, he announced that the district was under control.\nAfter the Cataclysm itself, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; descended on Stormwind and burned parts of the city to the ground, but shortly after vanished as quickly as he had appeared. His goal had not been to destroy the city, but rather to break its inhabitants so that they could be remade into his servants. Many of Stormwind's fearful citizens sought counsel from Archbishop Benedictus, unaware that he was secretly a member of the Twilight's Hammer, and he subtly guided them into the cult's embrace.\nBlood of Our Fathers.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Remembrance%20Day\"&gt;Remembrance Day&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; met with Archbishop Benedictus and &lt;a href=\"Baros%20Alexston\"&gt;Baros Alexston&lt;/a&gt;, who were discussing plans on repairing Stormwind City, which had been recovering from an attack by the Black Dragon Aspect, Deathwing. Much to Varian's annoyance, Baros does note that the extensive repairs to the city wouldn't be cheap. Later Varian was left with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and Benedictus, who tried to console and counsel him about his relationship with his son. Varian revealed his concerns that Anduin may not have the strength to lead the kingdom, especially in such perilous times. Both Jaina and Benedictus assured him that Anduin has a different strength to give to the world, and as a healer, he is attuned with the Light. Benedictus notes that the times have changed, and it is clear that they must change with them. The age when hearts like Lothar's were the only way to survive may be drawing to a close. The world seems to yearn for someone new. Benedictus offers both Varian and the prince a Remembrance Day gift, in which he offered to give it to him at a special location. Before departing, Benedictus assures Varian that he believes that Anduin will have the mettle and the makings of a good king, as all Wrynn kings have.\nVarian later arrived at the meeting place that Benedictus told him, Tiffin's grave at Stormwind City Cemetery. To his surprise, he was met not only with Archbishop Benedictus but his son Anduin as well. His excitement was soon extinguished though when he saw the shock in his son's face, which revealed that he had not expected to see him. Varian asked Benedictus if the surprise family reunion was his gift, to which Benedictus said that he also had another gift to give. Benedictus then drew a glittering silver key and placed it on Varian's palm. It was the key to Tiffin\u2019s locket, which had been lost many years ago. Benedictus felt now was as good a time to remind the two of more pleasant and fond memories. Varian was deeply moved by this gesture and thanked Benedictus for being a good man and friend. After which Benedictus departed to give the two royals privacy for their reunion, though his farewell to them seemed a bit odd to Varian. Their tender reunion was cut short by the arrival of a group of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; assassins that had followed them to the cemetery, intent on killing both king and prince. The pair fought back, with Anduin using the Light to bolster and protect his father. However, the last of the assassins managed to summon a massive &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; as he died, which eventually overcame Varian's defenses and nearly killed him. With his father dying, Anduin conjured a to protect them and dispelled the drakonid's defensive magic, allowing Varian to use the last of his strength to slay the beast. As Varian lay dying, he told Anduin that he loved him, that he was proud of him, and not to mourn him as this had always been his fate. Though &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; wanted to take Anduin to a more secure location, Anduin refused to leave his father. Praying to the Light, he infused his father\u2019s body with an influx of divine energy and saved his life.\nBenedictus was slightly shocked to see Varian when he arrived to give his Remembrance Day speech.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s death, Benedictus ascended to a position of leadership within the Twilight's Hammer. He cast off his old identity once and for all and assumed his true name: the Twilight Father.\nAfter capturing a pregnant &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt;, the sister of the new blue &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; candidate &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight Father made an effort to hound what remained of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Using his twilight drakes to attack and take over the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight Father successfully claimed the center of &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; as the cult's own. His agents succeeded in infecting a large amount of unhatched dragon eggs with a chromatic substance, hatching them as twisted abominations, but this effort was foiled when &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed himself to destroy the brood, the agents, and himself in an effort to save them from this pitiful fate. Regardless, the Twilight Father made the temple his base of operations and called upon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; for his new orders. In a conversation with Kirygosa, he displayed a highly pious attitude and a certain love for \"his children,\" referring to his nefarious cultist followers.\nThe Twilight Father had a massive chromatic dragon named &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; brought before the temple and went about finding a way to awaken it. While inactive, it was not \"deceased\" per se, though what exactly it would take to bring the five-headed creature out of its slumber remained elusive to the Twilight Father's captive. Shortly after, The Twilight Father was harshly berated by Neltharion after &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; managed to survive a twilight assault. Deathwing revealed that Thrall was predicted to kill Deathwing and that as such, the former warchief of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; must be eliminated without fail.\nThe Twilight Father later met with Arygos, the duplicitous blue Dragon Aspect candidate who had sold his sister (Kirygosa) to the cult prior to their hostile invasion into Northrend. It is revealed that Arygos had entered into an alliance with Neltharion, promising him the loyalty of the blue dragonflight after what would no doubt be Arygos' ascension to the Aspect of magic. Arygos later failed to do exactly that and was subsequently killed by the infinite agent &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Arygos' blood was used to awaken the sleeping Chromatus, who proceeded to utterly defeat the new blue dragon Aspect &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; even at a fraction of his potential power. The Twilight Father was elated at this, and informed Kirygosa that he planned to \"mate\" her with him, in order to create a more powerful brand of chromatic dragon from her clutch. Repulsed, Kirygosa successfully managed to escape the Twilight Cult's grasp, and the Twilight Father was once again chided by an enraged Deathwing for his carelessness.\nSoon after, Wyrmrest was besieged by the remaining dragonflights. The Twilight Father mounted Chromatus himself; the hulking creature now at its full power. Though they successfully pushed back the Dragon Aspects, a surprise ritual initiated by none other than Thrall resulted in the Aspects acquiring a number of powerful new abilities. Unable to counter them, Chromatus was cast down from the sky in a blaze of bright power; the Twilight Father in tow.\nIn a desperate bid for survival, the Twilight Father contacted Deathwing. After an initial tirade of abuse directed at the Father's failure, Deathwing composed his anger and instructed the Twilight Father to keep a low profile for a while. Neltharion used his dark magic to materialize Benedictus \u2014 highly grateful for his second chance \u2014 in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Bonds.\nChanging his identity exclusively to the Twilight Prophet, Benedictus was later responsible for the attack on &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during his quest to assist the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, because he prophesied Deathwing's defeat by the hands of Thrall. He had deemed the former warchief to be the final obstacle to the cult's plans and sent the newly-corrupted Archdruid of the Flame &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate him. Though unable to kill Thrall outright, Fandral instead shattered his bonds with the elements and rendered Thrall's soul little more than a husk; clashing and pure emotions all that remain within. However, this plan was short-lived, and with the help of Thrall's beloved &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; he was restored to his might. Fandral would also be killed shortly after while making his final stand in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragon Soul.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Farthing\"&gt;Bishop Farthing&lt;/a&gt;, some time later Archbishop Benedictus left Stormwind on an important mission to assist the Dragon Aspects at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The truth of this matter, however, was far more nefarious.\nFor years, Benedictus' wise guidance had been instrumental in seeing humanity through bleak times. Yet beneath his apparent benevolence lied the shocking truth that he had pledged himself to the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;eradication of all life on Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the agency of his dark master... &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;masters&lt;/a&gt;. He would later be found in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of Aspects&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; during the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was there that he made his final assault against Thrall, attempting to assassinate him personally, but was killed during the battle by Thrall's companions. When the adventurers returned to Stormwind after his death and informed Bishop Farthing that Benedictus was the Twilight Prophet and had betrayed the people of Stormwind, he put on a facade that he refused to believe it, telling them that he had heard another grim rumor about &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. He then told them to spread their lies elsewhere.\nLegion.\nThe Twilight Father's legacy would continue, for Farthing himself would succeed Benedictus as leader of the Twilight's Hammer some time later, known now as Twilight Deacon Farthing. When Farthing was betrayed and killed by the sentient dagger &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;, the blade claimed that the Twilight Father had not dared to wield it, for he knew the price of failure.\nQuotes.\nMy blessings go to you, &lt;class&gt;, and I pray they may guide and protect you during these times of trouble. Be vigilant, but remain hopeful for peace, for hope is our greatest weapon against the darkness.\nIn the RPG.\nThe current archbishop is a middle-aged man named Jarl, though following Church tradition he gave up his birth name when he was elected to this high position, and adopted a new, holy name.\nIn his youth, he was the younger son of a wealthy Lordaeron merchant and was raised to join the family business. He found religion instead, discovering the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; after meeting an old traveler one night and almost dying when a pack of mercenaries attacked them both. After recovering, Jarl petitioned to join the Church and was accepted immediately. The kindly Jarl was the student of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s religious leader, Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;. Jarl spent many years learning from his pious master. He rose quickly to the rank of senior priest and had charge of a large town in Lordaeron when the Scourge appeared. Jarl did his best to evacuate his parishioners and then joined them in their flight to Azeroth. The Church settled him in a town there but soon promoted him to Stormwind City instead. While there, he helped the Church of Light construct its most striking monument: the Cathedral of Light in Stormwind. He was being considered for promotion to bishop when Archbishop Faol died, and the council chose to elevate him to archbishop instead. The newly named Benedictus took charge of the Church and swore to continue the good work his mentor had begun so many years before.\nBenedictus is a soft-spoken man of average height and stocky build who looks more like a farmer than a religious leader. He still hates the Scourge for destroying his homeland and has vowed to direct the Church in destroying that threat forever. Despite his quiet ways, Jarl is surprisingly adept at politics \u2014 at least in avoiding confrontation and forming alliances \u2014 and he has managed to keep the three bishops in check since his elevation."}

During phase one Benedictus will summon three Purifying Light orbs, two of which Thrall will destroy with his chain lightning, leaving only one to avoid. When Benedictus summons the Wave of Virtue, all party members should move to the Water Shell Thrall creates regardless of where the wave is traveling in order to benefit from the bonus damage the shield provides.\nAt 60% Benedictus will cast Twilight Epiphany, signaling the start of his phase two. All of his ability mechanics remain the same, however Thrall will be unable to assist in weakening them. There will be three Corrupting Twilight orbs that must be dodged or destroyed by a ranged DPS and there will be no shield to hide under for the Wave of Twilight. However, as long as your healer is on top of dispelling Twilight Shear, the fight stays relatively low in damage if players dodge the attacks well."}

They watched as Infazzar turned &lt;a href=\"Cragtalon\"&gt;Cragtalon&lt;/a&gt; harpies into Feltalons. Infazzar sends them to attack the two while he makes his escape to the floating ship. \nAfter dealing with his minions, they give chase but are stuck as they can't fly to the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; above. Thisalee prays to &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;wild god&lt;/a&gt; sends her &lt;a href=\"Lunarwing%20Owl%20%28Azsuna%29\"&gt;Lunarwing owls&lt;/a&gt; to fly them above. Getting on top of the ship, they eliminated his minions before dealing with Infazzar himself. The demon fel dropping the corrupted idol to the ground. \nThisalee and the Archdruid return to the Dreamgrove with the idol and place it in its shine. All the druids, use their power to clean the idol. Grateful to what the Archdruid, Aviana rewards the him with a new flight form.\n&lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; utilized this form during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;."}

They were slightly more maneuverable than &lt;a href=\"Footman%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Footmen&lt;/a&gt;, but the cost was the lighter armor they had to wear. The ability to launch their deadly rain of missiles from a distance made them a force not to be discounted.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;Gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s were fond of using crossbows for their poaching operations.\nWhile also depicted using &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; are often associated with crossbow archers. For example, draenei &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s starts with a crossbow, draenei &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Marksman\"&gt;Shattered Sun Marksmen&lt;/a&gt; are crossbow users when their &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; counterpart uses bows instead, and members of the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; are also often seen using crossbows too.\nHigh elf and blood elf archers.\nOut of the mysterious forests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; came the elven archers to aid the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in its darkest hour. Descendants of the elder race of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, these sylvan woodsmen were unmatched in their use of the &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;. Unencumbered by helm or heavy armor, archers were keen of eye and fleet of foot. These &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; had long been embroiled in a bloody conflict with the hated &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; of Lordaeron and were swift to let loose a rain of arrows upon any foe, including those that attacked from the skies above.\nHigh elven archers were still there to help fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to attack their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\", trained at the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%23High%20elven%20barracks\"&gt;High Elven Barracks&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; also deployed archers to aid &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; during the events of \"\". They were trained at the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%23Blood%20elven%20barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the events of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" blood elven archers are mostly classified as &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDuring the events of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; deploy several times a new class of archers called the spellbows.\nNight elven archer.\nArchers compose the first rank of the Sentinel army. These brave warrior women are expert marksmen and use the concealing forests of Kalimdor to their advantage. Their lightning-quick ambushes are legendary, for few warriors can match the proud archers' speed and cunning. Like all night elf women, archers have the ability to Shadowmeld at night.\nDuring the events of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" night elven archers are mostly classified as &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; or bowmen.\nIn the RPG.\nMany night elves learn to use weapons before they can walk. Some show a natural talent for archery and hone that skill. These archers are excellent hunters, but, in wartime, become critical support troops, firing upon enemies to give allies a chance to regroup and attack. Night elf archers are particularly renowned for their ambushes, especially within their own forests. They can move silently among the trees and down opponents a hundred feet away without ever being seen. The typical archer is slender but strong, with a quiet grace and the ability to shift from motionless to eye-blurring speed in an instant. She carries her bow constantly and pays it more respect than most people.\nThe archer's specialty is ranged attack, and she will do everything possible to maintain her distance. Most night elf archers also use stealth, speed, and darkvision to full advantage. An archer might creep to a hiding place and wait there for hours to set the target at ease. Archers train both alone and in teams, and often concentrate fire on a single major target or on a small group standing close together. This allows them to take down tougher foes or clustered enemy commanders in a single volley.\nPandaren archer.\nIn the RPG.\nPandaren archers often rest just beyond the infantry, using long supple bambus bows capable of taking the eye out of an orc at hundreds of yards. Pandaren archers are equipped with their bows and a variety of arrows with varying heads (broad, leaf-shaped heads for unarmored infantry, sharp, piercing heads for heavily armored opponents, and unusual \"U\" or \"V\" shaped arrowheads for dealing maximum damage at close range); they often carry short curved swords similar to shaktani warblades. Pandaren archers are skilled at long-range marksmanship and sniping, although the size of their bows prohibits their use from concealment, for they are almost as tall as a standing pandaren."}

The ability to launch their deadly rain of missiles from a distance makes them a force not to be discounted.\nInformation.\nArchers, like all ranged units, are extremely useful in blocking off narrow passages (like bridges) by putting around six of them all in one place so that the oncoming enemy units will be instantly killed, unless said unit is a &lt;a href=\"Catapult%20%28WC1%20Orc%29\"&gt;Catapult&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Spearman%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Spearmen&lt;/a&gt;.

Their lightning quick ambushes are legendary - for few warriors can match the speed and cunning of the proud Archers. Like all &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt; women, Archers are able to Shadowmeld at night.\nInformation.\nThe basic ranged unit of the Night Elves, Archers are fairly popular mainly due to their cheap cost allowing them to be easily massed. Archers as a whole are fairly weak in team matches, because large numbers and collision size do not work well for allied units. Generally, Archers should be mounted on &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s, giving them more health and turning into an aerial unit to protect them from ground attacks.\nWhen on the ground and night falls, Archers benefit from Elune's Grace, reducing the damage taken from piercing attacks by 65% and spells/magic damage by 80%. This makes them powerful for creeping against camps that have mainly pierce and magic damage, as they will be able to take the incoming hits surprisingly well. Late-game, it simply protects them from being killed quickly by more powerful and advanced units."}

He eagerly joined the fallen &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; who promised them knowledge, power, and, most importantly, the answer to the question \"what is the one &lt;a href=\"Void%20lord\"&gt;underlying flaw&lt;/a&gt; of the universe?\", in exchange for loyalty. While most eredar, a knowledge-seeking race, joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; because of their thirst for knowledge, Archimonde joined Sargeras for power.\nHe loyally served his master and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years, though he was defeated during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; by the mortal armies. As Sargeras' right hand, he was heartless, brutal, cunning, and far-sighted, but also described as powerful, elegant, smooth, and intelligent. The colossal demon wielded limitless &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magics and primal strength to lay waste to any who would oppose his fiery will, and had destroyed countless worlds. In his heart of hearts, he sought to become a god and wield powers that rivaled those of Sargeras himself.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;War in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Archimonde returned to lead the Legion's invasion of &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;the alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; following Kil'jaeden's initial failed attempt to gain control over the orcs of that world. He was this time permanently killed in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; by the united armies of the draenei, orcs, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, led by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durotan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was the main antagonist of ', and the final antagonist of '. \nBiography.\nYouth.\nIn his youth, Archimonde was the apprentice to the skilled eredar &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt;, leader of an order of &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt; where he initially held the position of an &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;. There were rumors that Archimonde coveted his master's power and influence, but Thal'kiel himself dismissed these claims, for Archimonde had shown him nothing but devotion, having even gone to great lengths to create a custom-made crown for the eredar leader, taking the measurements for his head himself. At the time, Thal'kiel and Archimonde were among the most prominent proponents of \u2014 the study of skull shape as a means to determine intellectual aptitude \u2014 and Thal'kiel in particular was noted for having the archetypal sorcerer's skull, for which he was widely admired.\nHowever, when Thal'kiel began preparing to install himself as dictator of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; by summoning an army of powerful &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, Archimonde was the only one of the Wakeners to not be united behind their leader. Although he had no aversion to demons \u2014 in fact, he rather enjoyed them \u2014 Archimonde was highly ambitious and was eager to prove himself to the eredar's two leaders, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. The night prior to the Wakeners' planned coup, he snuck away and revealed his master's plans to the rulers or Argus and promised to bring them the traitor's head himself.\nArchimonde himself broke the magical wards hiding Thal'kiel's army and led a contingent of magi to storm the Wakeners' secret training grounds. The Wakeners were caught off guard and easily defeated, and the demons were quickly slaughtered when they found themselves leaderless. As Thal'kiel tried to summon in more reinforcements, Archimonde decapitated his former master with a single strike of his blade. After the battle, the Wakeners' bodies were burned and their writings destroyed, and Archimonde was hailed as a hero. Soon afterward, he commissioned one of Argus' finest jewelers to gild Thal'kiel's skull and then proudly displayed it in his domicile, ostensibly as a warning to the other eredar not to follow in Thal'kiel's footsteps, though in truth he had it adorned with metals that would enhance its magic-channeling abilities.\nIt's unknown exactly when in his life that it happened, but he was also a graduate from the &lt;a href=\"Conservatory%20of%20the%20Arcane\"&gt;Conservatory of the Arcane&lt;/a&gt;.\nTriumvirate.\nArchimonde would eventually rise to lead the eredar alongside Velen and Kil'jaeden. Archimonde became Master of the &lt;a href=\"Augari\"&gt;Augari&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"%3ASigil%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;:Sigil of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; was the Conservatory of the Arcane's highest honor. Only Archimonde's chosen could pursue this accolade. He had created trials specifically for this purpose, but the uninitiated could also participate.\nArchimonde was not known for his willingness to suffer indecision, he preferred to teach by rewarding frustration with more frustration\u2014punishment with more punishment. Absolute conviction was required to succeed under him. Archimonde expected greatness from his pupils. Only the most imaginative minds, the most adroit of intellects, could ever truly fathom the deepest reaches of their magic. He was an individual consumed by the pursuit of power. Only those who could match his lust would fare well under his tutelage.\nOver time, however, a demonic presence began to infiltrate Archimonde's mind, using Thal'kiel's adorned skull as a conduit. When he slept, Archimonde saw visions of entire civilizations being consumed by a glorious army, at the head of which was a dark god who whispered promises of unimaginable strength. Thus, Archimonde was the first to accept &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;' offer when the Dark Titan arrived on Argus.\nDemon of the Burning Legion.\nRoughly thirteen thousand years ago, the three rulers were contacted by Sargeras and offered the answer to the single most important question: \"what is the ultimate underlying flaw of the universe?\" in exchange for loyalty. The eredar, as a race thirsty for knowledge, accepted the offer, though Archimonde did so mostly for power, while Velen not only rejected it, but rebelled and fled Argus with his followers thanks to the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; to become the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Kil'jaeden then vowed that he would seek for them and destroy them. Archimonde was against Kil'jaeden's search of draenei, but did not take any action.\nArchimonde became Sargeras' military commander, triumphing on many worlds, and used his powerful will to drive the demonic masses to extreme violence and barbarism, drawing out and tempering the strength of all those who served beneath him. After the recruitment of the eredar, the ranks of Sargeras' &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; swelled with new demonic races. Among them were the monstrous &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;annihilan&lt;/a&gt;, or \"pit lords\", whom Archimonde empowered and conscripted to serve as living siege engines. Archimonde put &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20the%20Man%27ari\"&gt;the skull of his old master&lt;/a&gt;, Thal'kiel, to good use against the Legion's enemies, using it to exert his control over multitudes of demons to obliterate his opponents, though it has since passed between a handful of Sargeras' elite generals.\nThe War of the Ancients.\nSome three thousand years later, when &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s reckless magics began to attract the attention of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Archimonde, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; led the catastrophic, destructive invasion. With thousands of demonic servants in their wake, they poured through the portal beneath the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, and were let loose upon the ancient land of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 razing every structure and spilling the blood of every creature they came across. During the war, Archimonde succeeded in killing the Ancient &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most powerful of Azeroth's demigods, by snapping his neck. This event was one of the only times in recorded history where &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; opened her eyes.\nHowever, a young druid \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 gathered a small band of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and with the help of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;' woodland allies combined with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s mighty &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, managed to beat back the demonic hordes. Before the destruction, Archimonde caught &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and sadistically toyed with him - beating him to near-death. In the titanic battle, the portal became unstable and collapsed \u2014 sundering the world. This event banished Archimonde and his minions back into the burning pits of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Second Invasion.\nPreparations.\nArchimonde raged and brooded for ten thousand years in the dark recesses of the Twisting Nether as they planned for a new invasion as per Sargeras's will. Again, their target would be the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. His colleague, Kil'jaeden, found the means through &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and, eventually, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, on the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. With Mannoroth's sinister help, the chieftains of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish Hordes were corrupted, and a bloodlust came over them that swept them into a tumultuous frenzy that engulfed their world. The orcs were to be the harbinger of the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s return, destroying all they beheld so that none could oppose the Legion. However, after the exodus into Azeroth and Draenor's eventual destruction, the Horde was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of former &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;allies&lt;/a&gt;, and the orcs failed in their unholy mission.\nHowever, an old tool was found that could once again be put to use. Ner'zhul, the &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon Clan&lt;/a&gt;, was sent spiraling with his most faithful disciples into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; after attempting to find new worlds to control, and he was found by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, he was transformed into the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, an ethereal spirit that controlled the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, a force so mighty, that it was expected to succeed where the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had failed.\nThe Undead Scourge had exceeded their expectations.\nArchimonde was to command the Legion's invasion, but he needed the means of getting to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Due to his monumental power gain much more magic was needed to summon him, and he waited until finally he was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; the Summoner, who, after stealing the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with Arthas' assistance, began the lengthy summoning process. As he proceeded, the skies were split asunder, and mighty &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s were brought to aid the Scourge. Finally, it was completed, and Archimonde was brought into the world of Azeroth.\nInvasion in Lordaeron and Kalimdor.\nArchimonde first placed &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; in charge of the Scourge, saying that there was no longer any need of the Lich King. Unknown to him, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; had been well prepared for this in his greater plan.\nBefore starting the invasion, Archimonde made an example of what would happen to anyone who would resist the Legion. He picked the city &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and proceeded to destroy it single-handedly with his magic. Except the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20fountain\"&gt;fountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe invasion of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; continued unabated, the magics of Archimonde summoned hordes of demonic followers, including the diabolical Pit Lord, Mannoroth. Together, they plowed through the nations of Lordaeron, devastating all they beheld. However, Tichondrius soon found that the orcs were missing. The Legion followed them across the sea, where they found not only the orcs but also, the vile night elves who had banished them millennia before. Archimonde, Mannoroth, and Tichondrius came up with a plot to re-enslave the orcs and use them to destroy the night elves' demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. The plan was partially successful; Mannoroth corrupted &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; and drove them to slay Cenarius. However, Hellscream later broke free and sacrificed himself to destroy Mannoroth, thus severing the Legion's control over the orcs permanently.\nDespite Mannoroth's death, Archimonde had achieved what he wanted - the destruction of Cenarius. He launched the invasion of Kalimdor and openly confronted his night elf enemies. He even met &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, the insolent leader of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, who woke the ancient druids, and together, they battled the Legion once again.\nThe Defiler continued the invasion of Kalimdor ruthlessly, battling on many fronts, against the combined forces of the Alliance and Horde, as well as the Sentinels. Under Archimonde's orders, Tichondrius used The &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt the forests of Ashenvale, bringing many of the indigenous creatures into the Legion's fold. However, the Legion suffered a major setback when the rogue night elf &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; stole the Skull and used its powers to kill Tichondrius. Archimonde seemed to have little concern for this loss, and placed his most loyal Dreadlord, &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt; in joint command of the Scourge with &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few trustworthy liches.\nDefiler's End.\nArchimonde then proceeded with the original objective of the invasion. The demonlord launched a massive &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on the World Tree, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion believed Archimonde's goal was to draining the Tree's energies, which would drain the night elves of their source of power and immortality. However, Archimonde's target was actually to drain the second Well of Eternity to further his goal of gaining powers to rival those of Sargeras. But Tyrande and Malfurion had allied with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowtooth\"&gt;Shadowtooth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Trolls\"&gt;Dark Trolls&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barkskin%20tribe\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. Archimonde's ascent up &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; was agonizingly slow, being forced to destroy every successive base with the help of &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe bases, consisting of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, did slow his ascent \u2014 however, his cunning mind and monumental power enabled the Legion to destroy the bases one by one. First, he destroyed Jaina Proudmoore's base, then Thrall's base, and finally he reached the night elves' base which he destroyed easily with a wave of his hand. Archimonde smashed the magical gates guarding the World Tree and started climbing the Tree. He grew in size as he climbed, determined to destroy the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; and consume its energies. The &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; paid no attention to the seemingly harmless &lt;a href=\"wisps\"&gt;wisps&lt;/a&gt; gathering nearby.\nAs Archimonde attempted to rip the World Tree from the Well, energies arose as Malfurion raised the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and called out to the ancestral guardians of the forest. Thousands of wisps rose from the surrounding forests and amassed around Archimonde, detonating in a massive explosion that destroyed the demon lord and incinerated the forests and the World Tree itself. Nature herself would not allow his defilement to occur. While the World Tree would eventually heal itself in time, Archimonde was gone from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly his bones remained.\nThe Burning Crusade.\n&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt; went back to the climactic &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and assisted in the battle against Archimonde's undead armies. They held off the Defiler himself, buying time for Malfurion to slay him.\nAlternate Draenor.\nWhile Archimonde cared little for Kil'jaeden's vendetta against and the draenei, he sought in the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; an opportunity. Believing that the time for subtlety had passed, Archimonde took command of the Burning Legion's invasion of the planet. His approach was much more abrupt than Kil'jaeden's, and the demons invaded en masse, contrary to the main timeline.\nArchimonde was the final encounter of , having come to Draenor across time and space to ensure the Burning Legion invasion of Azeroth went according to plan. He was this time defeated by the united armies of the draenei, orcs, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, led by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and . With his last breath, he sent in a beam of green energy into the the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt;, reminding him of the pact he had made and causing the portal to crumble.\nA fragment of power from the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt; was retrieved from Archimonde's corpse, which disturbed Malfurion greatly when it was brought to him on Azeroth since the Rift should have been sealed away at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion thus headed back to the ancient, verdant forests of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the place of his tutelage, to seek guidance.\nLegion.\nMalorne was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, trapped in a recreation of his death at the hands of Archimonde during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; aided Malorne in defeating the figment of Archimonde and saving him from the Nightmare.\nAnother &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28echo%29\"&gt;echo&lt;/a&gt; appeared in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nPrior to joining the Legion, Archimonde was bold and had a gift for finding the strengths in those around him, filling them with confidence and courage. He was described as usually having sound judgment, but occasionally being susceptible to appeals to his vanity. Velen described him as instinctively impetuous. Archimonde viewed Velen's hesitancy in accepting Sargeras' offer as an obstacle to what he wanted, which had always been in the best interest of those they led.\nArchimonde was so brutal that he became known for killing even those who served him. Failure at any level was often punishable by death. Archimonde as a demon was heartless and brutal, but very cunning and far-sighted. While he seemed to be more forgiving of failures of the underlings that he couldn't replace, his brutal nature was enough of a motivation not to fail him.\nHe was described as a mad warlord consumed with fury and rage, Sargeras's fist.\nHowever, despite being the more hot-tempered of the two eredar leaders who sided with the Legion, Archimonde did not despise Velen and his followers in the same personal manner as Kil'jaeden and was puzzled by his deep-seated grudge against the Prophet.\nIn the RPG.\nHis ruthless and cunning personality quickly earned him station and power within the eredar ranks, until finally he was one of the first among them. He is described as one of the lieutenants and generals of Sargeras.\nArchimonde was appointed as the field commander of the Legion's forces, directing troop movements and overseeing military invasions. Kil'jaeden was charged with more covert operations and recruiting new races and minions into the Legion. Due to their positions, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and Archimonde each built their own hierarchy of demons that acted as if competitors. &lt;a href=\"Pit%20lords\"&gt;Pit lords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;s, and eminences served under Archimonde and the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlords&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"risen%20terror\"&gt;risen terror&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;s followed Kil'jaeden.\nAn &lt;a href=\"eredar%20warlock\"&gt;eredar warlock&lt;/a&gt; led a group of demons in the tunnels from the &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; leading to the second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and were draining its waters.

He has three main phases: Phase 1 dealing with his attempts to corrupt and scorch the land beneath the players' feet. Phase 2 has Archimonde summoning demons and assaulting the raiders' souls with shackles. Finally, Phase 3 involves him banishing players into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; while utilizing to summon &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s to strike the planet. &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and also join the battle, though their contributions are all fight mechanics and do not contribute any actual damage. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"One of the original &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who betrayed the draenei of Argus to take his place as the sinister hand of the dark titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Archimonde the Defiler commands the military might of the Burning Legion. He arrives in , reaching across space and time, to ensure that the invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; proceeds as planned, and that does not fail his Legion masters.\"\nDesigner note.\n\"We planted some seeds that this confrontation might be coming in the level-up quest experience. In the original timeline, &lt;a href=\"Kil%E2%80%99jaeden\"&gt;Kil\u2019jaeden&lt;/a&gt; was the broker behind Gul\u2019dan\u2019s dark deal with the Horde, but here\u2014thanks to Garrosh\u2019s interference\u2014he failed, and so Archimonde was entrusted with the task of finishing the job. There are a couple of nods to the old &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; encounter (Doomfire was mandatory), but Archimonde has learned a number of nasty new tricks since then. Although you have the greatest heroes of Azeroth and Draenor standing beside you in this battle, even they cannot aid you within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; itself. . . .\"\nOverview.\nArchimonde assaults players with the might of the Burning Legion, gaining new abilities each time his health is reduced by 15%, eventually summoning Rain of Chaos to destroy Draenor. When a player is launched into the air by Shadowfel Burst, their allies must catch them to avoid fatal damage. As Archimonde Desecrates the land, players must protect themselves with the Light of the Naaru. When Archimonde reaches 40% health remaining, he begins to cast Nether Banish, sending players to the Twisting Nether.\nAbilities.\nPhase 2: Hand of the Legion.\nWhen Archimonde reaches 70% health remaining, he calls on new powers to destroy his enemies.\nPhase 3: The Twisting Nether.\nWhen Archimonde reaches 40% health remaining, he calls on the Twisting Nether to destroy his enemies.\nPhase 3: The Twisting Nether.\nWhen Archimonde reaches 40% health remaining, he transcends. All of his enemies are drawn helplessly into the Twisting Nether, an endless, chaotic space from which few have ever returned...\nStrategy.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s are required for this fight, switching every time Archimonde casts Death Brand on his current tank. In Phase 3, one tank will always be banished into the void to tank the voidwalker, while the other will continue fighting outside as normal. Save &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; for the final phase. The group should have four &lt;a href=\"target%20marker\"&gt;target marker&lt;/a&gt;s: one for the melee and one for the ranged on either side of the Black Gate. The melee/tanks and the ranged group will move to their respective markers when Archimonde casts Allure of Flames.\nPhase 1.\nPhase 1 begins with Archimonde summoning a Doomfire Spirit--an immobile &lt;a href=\"felfire\"&gt;felfire&lt;/a&gt; orb that targets a single player at a time, and causes Doomfire to continuously spawn and move toward them until the spirit is killed. In addition, Archimonde will cast Death Brand on his current tank, causing a Hellfire Deathcaller to spawn and fixate on that tank, attacking them and causing increased shadow damage until it is killed. The &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; requirements for this fight can be steep and unforgiving, as leaving either of these &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s alive for too long can easily cause a wipe. The Doomfire Spirit, if left alive, will eventually spread too much felfire to dodge; the Deathcaller, if left alive, will continue stacking shadow damage onto the Branded target.\nArchimonde will then cast Allure of Flames, causing the spots of doomfire to jump into the air and down onto a random player, forcing players to move to the opposite side of the room. However, Archimonde will then use Shadowfel Burst to send one ranged player and anyone within 8 yards into the air. As they hit the ground, they take massive damage split among the players in the location they fell. Thus, while the ranged must stay spread out while moving away from Allure, they must also be ready to collapse back together to save the person being shot up from taking the full brunt of the damage or they will die. At 85%, the boss summons massive fel spires from the ground, similar to &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Lord%20Zakuun\"&gt;Fel Lord Zakuun&lt;/a&gt;, which cause unavoidable &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage but do not interrupt &lt;a href=\"line%20of%20sight\"&gt;line of sight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; will periodically shatter the spires, causing orbs of light to form around them, causing players who run into them to receive immunity from shadow damage and increased movement speed. Tanks should have this effect to reduce damage from the Deathcallers and move away from Allure faster. This buff lasts 30 seconds, so some of the other raid members can feel free to use the orbs if the tanks already have the buff. At 70% health, phase 1 ends and Yrel destroys the rest of the spires.\nPhase 2.\nIn phase 2, Archimonde will stop summoning Doomfire Spirits, though he continues summoning Hellfire Deathcallers. He will still cast Allure of Flames as well, requiring that players continue to move away from any Doomfire already summoned. Shackled Torment targets 3 random players and will do increased damage to them the longer they remain attached to their chains. Moving away 30 yards will break the chains, but cause strong raid-wide damage. Because of this, players should have their raid frames out and judge whether or not it is an appropriate time to break shackles, as breaking all shackles at once while people are at low health can cause a wipe. It can also help to have someone make call-outs when to break shackles. \nThis phase truly starts at 55% health, when Archimonde uses the Black Gate to summon additional demons. &lt;a href=\"Dreadstalker\"&gt;Dreadstalker&lt;/a&gt;s are fast-moving &lt;a href=\"felstalker\"&gt;felstalker&lt;/a&gt;s that run/teleport to random players and begin casting Consume Magic to damage and spell-interrupt anyone in 8 yards. They attack at random and cannot be tanked, so ranged players are encouraged to take them out quickly. Meanwhile, melee should deal with the &lt;a href=\"Felborne%20Overfiend\"&gt;Felborne Overfiend&lt;/a&gt;, a large green &lt;a href=\"overfiend\"&gt;overfiend&lt;/a&gt; that periodically casts Flames of Argus to damage the raid. This spell should be quickly interrupted as the overfiend is killed. The kill-order should be Deathcallers first, then overfiends, then dreadstalkers for ranged, and Archimonde last.\nPhase 3.\nFinally, Phase 3 begins at 40% health when pushes the demon minions back to the portal. Archimonde stops using Death Brand and casts Nether Banish, causing a large green circle to form around a tank which will send them and everyone within the circle to a platform of rock in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. On this rock is a &lt;a href=\"Shadowed%20Netherwalker\"&gt;Shadowed Netherwalker&lt;/a&gt; for the group to fight, as well as falling felfire. Lastly, a single void star--a small orb of void energy--will spawn and fixate on a random player in the void, exploding and sending the player off the platform to their death if they reach them. Non-fixated players can safely melee the star; they must destroy it as soon as possible. This last phase is critical as, if one tank dies in the nether, they cannot be &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt;ed.\nAs soon as the &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; dies, it will cast a spell that sends all players in melee range back outside, so ranged players should take note and be close enough when the time is right. While outside, Archimonde will summon Infernal Doombringers down from the sky. &lt;a href=\"Infernal\"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt;s will heal when close to each other and will start causing massive raid-wide damage if alive for long enough. Because of this, DPS will be taking a beating here, as infernals must be taunted by the DPS to keep them away from each other due to the other tank being in the void. Thus, DPS should remember to use any defensive cooldowns they have, as well as &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Tonic\"&gt;Healing Tonic&lt;/a&gt;s. The problem is that, as players spend more time in the void, they will gain stacks of Nether Corruption and take increased damage. Thus, a player should ideally not go in more than twice in a row. Groups must decide how to do this phase based on their party makeup, with classes with roots like &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s being important to slow both the stars in the void and the infernals outside.\nAn effective way to get as much damage on Archimonde as possible early on is to have \"all\" DPS besides hunters go into the nether in the first banish, kill the elemental fast enough to not have to worry about void stars, and once all DPS are outside, use bloodlust to hammer Archimonde with everything the raid has before the next banish. This phase is very difficult due to the outside DPS having to improvise and move around a lot to effectively separate and take down the infernals, and even a small mistake with the void stars can potentially cause a wipe. Staying calm and killing the adds as fast as possible is the key to winning the final phase.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The fight is a major &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;; even a single player's death can easily result in a wipe.\nPreparation.\nRaid Composition:\nEach raid member must acquire a from Tyrande Whisperwind in the camp. The tears expire after two hours, so remember to get new ones in time. All raid members should have one (three if possible) &lt;a href=\"Healthstones\"&gt;Healthstones&lt;/a&gt; and a few &lt;a href=\"Super%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Super Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt;s (even healers). Wearing extra Stamina gear is recommended for all raid members (a good idea is to use the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Naj%27entus\"&gt;High Warlord Naj'entus&lt;/a&gt; gear). No other special gear is required, the fire damage in this fight cannot be reduced with resistance. However, Fire &lt;a href=\"Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; potions do help.\nEverybody should turn off their vanity meters, and forget about them. Damage and healing done are of no interest - this fight is about individual player survival and nothing else. Think &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Aran\"&gt;Shade of Aran&lt;/a&gt;, but much worse.\nPositioning.\nThere are various approaches to positioning. As everybody needs to move around to avoid the Doomfires, a fixed order is hard to maintain. All players should keep the following in mind:\nIt's a good idea to give raid icons to decursers and to assign groups to them which stay inside their range. Prior to some patch Doomfire spread out in front of Archimonde only, therefore it was very good to tank him faced towards the mountain, and spread the raid in a semi-circle behind him. This is not true any more, therefore he can be tanked anywhere. The logs in the central area offer some protection from Doomfire, the flames cannot move through them, but still can circle around.\nSurvival.\nThe key to this fight is individual player survival. When learning the encounter, it's a good idea to focus exclusively on raid survival first. Soul Charges must be avoided at all costs, because usage of a Soul Charge usually leads to another player death (and thus to the next Soul Charge).\nDoomfire.\nRaid members must avoid to get Doomfire under all circumstances, avoiding it is more important than anything else. It may be possible to heal through a doomfire. The problem is that healers are very busy getting Feared, Air Bursted and avoiding Doomfires themselves, so there's not a lot of extra healing capacity available beyond keeping the tank up and healing through Air Burst damage.\nTherefore all players must keep a safe distance (best is about 20 yards) away from all doomfires. There's no excuse or justification - if doomfire gets anywhere close, everybody must run away. The only exception is the main tank, but it's still very important to leave the trail of fire as fast as possible. The targeting of doomfire is semi-random. It moves straight towards a raid member, but it may randomly change target (there are unverified claims that it likes to target players in the vicinity of its \"head\"). People should not run in circles, but rather in a straight line away from Archimonde.\nThis is probably the psychologically most difficult thing to learn in this fight, but remember - if there's a fire on one side of Archimonde, this means that there's no fire somewhere else. Smart players consider it to be a good thing that the fire is on their side, so that they can evade properly and make sure nobody dies, while the lesser members on the other side continue to DPS and heal.\nGrip of the Legion.\nThis curse must be dispelled as quickly as possible. Decursers must be spread out well over the raid. One difficult situation occurs when the curse hits a raid member who is running away from doomfire or air bursted (and therefore out of decurse range). All members of the raid should have &lt;a href=\"Purification%20Potion\"&gt;Purification Potion&lt;/a&gt;s to remove the curse in this event, though it often fails. A wipe may indeed be inevitable (Archimonde is one of the bosses who is never truly \"on farm\"), but generally all players on the same side of Archimonde should move as a group.\nFear.\nA frequent cause for wipes in this encounter are raid members feared into Doomfire. The main tank must stance dance to avoid the fear. Shamans should keep their &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt;s up. It's highly useful if everyone in the raid has a &lt;a href=\"PvP%20trinket\"&gt;PvP trinket&lt;/a&gt; which they can use when finding themselves running towards a Doomfire while feared. Some guilds actually require their members to obtain the trinket before being allowed to join this fight. Priests should keep &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt;s up on themselves. &lt;a href=\"Mass%20Dispel\"&gt;Mass Dispel&lt;/a&gt; can help too (but is rather mana intensive).\nWhen Druids lack other means to break fear and find themselves running towards a fire, they can drop &lt;a href=\"form\"&gt;form&lt;/a&gt;. This randomly changes their run direction.\nAir Burst.\nBesides healing through the damage, it's all about using the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20the%20Goddess\"&gt;Tears of the Goddess&lt;/a&gt; at the right time. About 30% of the wipes for new raids are caused by players using their Tears not at all or too late. Although they slow fall speed for only two seconds, they must not be used too late. A safe method is to wait until the highest point of the flight path is reached, then wait another three seconds, and then use the tears. This usually results in some falling damage because they expire before touching down, but nobody dies that way. It may be a good idea to do a few practise jumps from a cliff before the pull. Other means to slow falling (like &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt;) can be used too. These abilities use the &lt;a href=\"Global%20Cooldown\"&gt;Global Cooldown&lt;/a&gt;, while the tears do not. Mages can also use &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; when they're near the ground.\nPhase 2.\nAt 10% health, the following things happen:\nSince reaching Phase 2 is an automatic victory, the only thing the raid has to accomplish is to bring Archimonde down to 10% within 9 minutes. This means the raid has to deal 10% damage per minute, which is 500,000 damage in 60 seconds, or less than 10,000 DPS. Given 15 damage dealers, this means an average of 670 DPS per damage dealer, which is less than half of what players at this gear level should be able to sustain. Therefore, nobody should take any risk. Running away during the whole fight is perfectly ok (because it means that the people on the other side do their job unimpaired) - just don't die."}

It overlaps with the Great Dark Beyond.\u201d\n\u2022 July 24, 2014 \u2013 \u201cWhile normally imperceptible to mortals, the Twisting Nether bleeds into the physical realm. That\u2019s because Outland is truly devastated. Those seen in Outland are most likely other (far away) worlds that you see and not \u201clocal\u201d celestial bodies.\u201d\n\u2022 July 18, 2014 \u2013 \u201cRuling: \u201cDruids (in general) cannot speak in their animal forms.

Consorts were also given a measure of longevity.\u201d\n\u2022 July 10, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How does druid healing work lore-wise? Do they drain the life from nearby plants or the like enable to heal a wound?\u201d\n\u201cI think this was addressed in the War of the Ancients trilogy. Malfurion asked the grass to power his efforts, IIRC.\u201d\n\u2022 July 10, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So the other leaders supported the invasion as it was Garrosh who ordered it, but strongly disapprove of the use of Plague then?\u201d\n\u2022 July 10, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What\u2019s Baine/Vol\u2019jin/Lor\u2019themar\u2019s view on Sylvanas use of plague in Lordaeron?

Are Queen Mia and Princess Tess Greymane afflicted with the Worgen curse or not?\u201d\n\u201cWe do not have a ruling on this. However, I am doubtful that they are cursed.\u201d\n\u2022 July 9, 2014 \u2013 \u201cHello, had a question about warlocks, from where are they actually harnessing their power? From the Twisting Nether perhaps?\n\u201cNo, that\u2019d be magi, IIRC. They gain power by the destruction of another source (recall the undead warlock in original cinematic)\n\u201c@Loreology But Destro locks have a passive called Chaotic Energy, that says \u201cYou drain energy directly from the twisting nether.\u201d?\n\u201cHighly possible, I was just providing some info. I\u2019ll have to double check.\u201d\n\u2022 July 8, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Do Draenei have soft hooves, or hard hooves? Yes, this is a question.\u201d\n\u201cIIRC, the female Draenei silly refers to needing a blacksmith for her hooves.

Technically he still retains his flight\u2019s powers over Earth amiright?\u201d\n\u201cLast I heard, he\u2019s still mortal.\u201d\n\u2022 June 23, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Did Tyrande command the Cenarion Circle in the period where she was the sole rule of the night elves\u2026?\u201d\n\u201cNo she did not. Fandral was a primary contact during the time Malfurion was in the dream, IIRC.\u201d\n\u2022 June 23, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Does Tyrande rule the Cenarion Circle?\u201d\n\u201cDoubtful, since Metzen really wants that to remain a neutral faction (to keep Horde races in the group).\u201d\n\u2022 June 23, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So Sean, do Orcs have mates or husbands/wives because I\u2019ve seen them use both terms.\u201d\n\u201c\u2019life-mate\u2019 is the more traditional term amongst orcs.\u201d\n\u2022 June 22, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Old lore: Titans are gods. WCEnc: Titans not gods. UVG: Titans are gods. So are Titans back to being gods?\u201d\n\u201cThey are classified as \u2018metallic skinned gods\u2019 in my bible\u2026Would be funny if they punked down \u2018Old Gods\u2019 if they were only demigods.\u201d\n\u2022 June 21, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What happened to Gul\u2019dan\u2019s Shadow Orb?\u201d\n\u201cFrom the optional quest in War3x? Maiev may/may not have it.\u201d\n\u2022 June 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How old is a tauren canonically when they\u2019re an adult, middle aged and old?\u201d\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I have: Tauren reach \u201cold age\u201d ~ 95 and \u201cvenerable old age\u201d ~110.\u201d\n\u2022 June 2, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology has it ever been revealed how Deathwing found the Demon Soul before Day of the Dragon and where it was hidden?\u201d\n\u201cDeathwing remained obsessed about it and eventually tracked it down. No area specified from memory, but can dig if need be.\u201d\n\u2022 June 2, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Lore-wise, which Galakras fight is canon? Horde / Alliance / both?\u201d\n\u201cDeclaring one side or the other would rob the players of their effort. That\u2019s a lesson learned and something we try to avoid.\u201d\n\u2022 June 2, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology how old is Anduin Lothar during the First War\n\u201cLothar was born in Year -51. The First War began in Year 0 and \u201cended\u201d in Year 4.\u201d (Sean later goes on to say that Stormwind was on the run in the year 5 with heavy fighting continuing throughout the kingdom)\n\u2022 June 2, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are the Blood Elves doomed to eventual extinction sometime after WoW? All this war after losing 90% of their race\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you should ask your Draenei and gnome buddies. Their populations were hit hard and they\u2019re kicking.\u201d\n\u2022 June 2, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Would Mannoroth be considered a Warlock or a Warrior that simply uses Fel magic?\u201d\n\u201cMetzen has said \u201cPit lords mostly use melee attacks: they\u2019re big, beefy fighters // all fel energy spewing.\u201d Keep in mind that Sargeras gives his gifts unique to each person, so not all pit lords \nare the same.\u201d\n\u2022 June 1, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology This is confusing the UVG says the Gnomes joined after the Third War, but they were members before then, so should it be \u201crejoined?\u201d\u201d\n\u201cThey were in the Alliance before, but they didn\u2019t fight in the Third War, IIRC. Closed their doors due to a trogg invasion in their city. They \u201crejoined\u201d after they fled their home and stayed with the dwarves of Ironforge.\u201d\n\u2022 May 30, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So I gotta know, how are we supposed to be pronouncing this new faction, the \u201cSargerai\u201d\n\u201cFor Sargeras, the canonical pronunciation is: \u201cSAHR-gair-ahs\u201d.\u201d\n\u2022 May 30, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Wondering, are Draenei a different race than the original Eredar, or are they the same and just renamed?\u201d\n\u201cDraenei are still eredar. They just renamed themselves to distance themselves from their corrupted brethren.\u201d \n\u2022 May 28, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology I presume all race\u2019s blood aside from Draenei is red?\n\u201cOrcs were said to have \u201creddish-black\u201d blood peer Rise of the Horde. Only HEs (High Elves), Ogres, and Talbuk have been said to be red atm.\u201d\n\u2022 May 27, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology If the Halls of Origination was the Titan\u2019s reset method does this mean that sans them coming that threat is gone for now?\u201d\n\u201cAlgalon still watches over Azeroth per the WoW Special Edition Comic (he\u2019s narrating the events).\u201d\n\u2022 May 27, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Of the playable races, is there any that do not have red colored blood?\u201d\n\u201cThe Draenei have dark blue blood per Rise of the Horde.\u201d\n\u2022 May 22, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How could Jaina not be royalty if her father was the king of Kul Tiras?\u201d\n\u201cI did a search and Tides of Darkness only said he \u201cruled\u201d Kul Tiras.\u201d\n\u2022 May 22, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Even though she never uses the title, Jaina is still technically Princess of Kul Tiras, right?\u201d\n\u201cAccording to the lore (Arthas novel), she was a noble; not royalty.\u201d\n\u2022 May 22, 2014 \u2013 \u201cDoes Nerglish have a connection to the Old God and Faceless language?\u201d\n\u201cThe name of that language (Old God language) has yet to be determined.\u201d\n\u2022 May 22, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Do Naga speak Nerglish?\u201d\n\u201cNaga speak Nazja. Nerglish is the primary language of makrura, murlocs, and a few other aquatic races.\u201d\n\u2022 May 22, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Is Nerglish considered non-canon?\u201d\n\u201cNerglish is canonical. I mean just check out the Murky trailer.\u201d\n\u2022 May 20, 2014 \u2013 \u201cO Laras soranok agar\u2019nethal no shalas ve\u2019ran ardor.\u201d = \u201cO Light, bless your son on this joyous day\u201d For centuries, this was part of a song tht was performed during the Lordaeron king\u2019s coronation ceremony. Language is \u201cOld Tongue\u201d Old Tongue is the precursor to modern Common and bears only a slight resemblance to Common.\u201d\n\u2022 May 20, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What happened with the Sunreavers who were imprisoned in Violet Hold? Were they set free?\u201d\nThere\u2019s prolly lore that takes place \u201coff screen\u201d (esp. given VJ\u2019s letter to Jaina in War Crimes). Unofficial, tho. \n\u2022 May 18, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Can highborne use magic in Darnassus? This would be allowed on the basis of the current proposals, or not?\u201d\n\u201cThe formal admission of them into NElf society was mentioned in Wolfheart. It wasn\u2019t going to be an easy re-integration.\u201d\n\u2022 May 18, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Is Nemuraan alive?\u201d\n\u201cOpen question.\u201d\n\u2022 May 16, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology If a Shado-pan committed a crime, would they renounce their Shado-pan affiliation forever, or something else?\n\u201cThey would be dealt with by the order. I\u2019m guessing the punishment would have to fit the crime.\u201d\n\u2022 May 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are Mana Wyrms beasts or arcane creatures being created by Blood Elves?\n\u201cThe game classifies them as \u201cbeasts\u201d. I don\u2019t think the Bes were creating them off-hand, though. I\u2019ll have to check.\u201d\n\u2022 May 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So are the NE descended from trolls then?\u201d\n\u201c\u201dTribunal o\u2019 ages. Freya. Cenarius. All o\u2019 them confirm. This\u2019ll ruffle some feathers tae be sure.\u201d\uf04a\u201d\n\u2022 May 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Sean, please confirm that Orgrim met with Durotan while searching for Trolls in that section of ToD. It would fit!\u201d\n\u201cAfter his Oath Cry, Durotan sent a message to Doomhammer for a meeting despite the Frostwolf clan\u2019s exile. Orgrim heeded the summons of his childhood friend, risking much to meet with Durotan \nbehind enemy lines. Orgrim only took a small band of orcs with him.\u201d\n\u2022 May 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Wouldn\u2019t the Forsaken sense that there is a new Lich King?\u201d\n\u201cSylvanas sure did, as seen in the short story \u201cEdge of Night\u201d by Dave Kosak.\u201d\n\u2022 May 14, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology what are the alliance\u2019s \u2018holy crap!\u2019 statements? We all know what the Horde\u2019s is.\u201d\n\u201c\u201dBy the Light\u201d immediately comes to mind\u2026\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Earthmother or Earth Mother.\u201d\n\u201cEarth Mother.\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology does Broll Bearmantle have a relative that resides in Dolanar?\u201d\n\u201cOpen question, IIRC. The name is *really* similar, though.\u201d \n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Can ALL Elves see magical auras, or just Blood/High elves?\u201d\n\u201cSo far we\u2019ve seen a few that can do so (e.g. Valeera in the comic). No ruling that *all* can atm.\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Can we get a translation for: \u201cAnu\u2019dorini Talah, Ru shallora enudoril\u201d?\u201d\n\u201cAnu\u2019dorini talah.\u201d = \u201cLet my will be known.\u201d // \u201cRushallora enudoril.\u201d = \u201cI anoint these caretakers of the wild.\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology any news of who\u2019s running the Church of the Holy Light? Benedictus died almost a year ago.\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t officially chosen a new archbishop at this time.\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are Orcs going to get a new racial leader? The one they had kinda tried to blow up the world then skipped town/time.\u201d\n\u201cMethinks the new warchief has plenty of orc heroes to pull upon for wisdom.\u201d (I count three...maybe four, all but one old af)\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology When we quest in Deepholm &amp; try to kill angry earth elementals, are we destroying them b/c they\u2019re in their home dimension when they die?\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we see when we finally kill Ragnaros and Al\u2019Akir\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Alright, so Night Elves are completely diurnal now, yes or no?\u201d\n\u201cThe Wolfheart novel touched on this (p. 26, 111).\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology how do the Mag\u2019har feel about Garrosh? Has Aggra kept the in the loop?\u201d\n\u201cWell we knew how Aggra felt about him in The Shattering (p. 163). Doesn\u2019t mean other folks feel the same, though.\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201cAny chance we could have \u201cMok-thorin ka\u201d \u201cGor-dook\u201d and \u201cLok-regar no\u2019gall\u201d translated? (orcish)\n\u201c \u201cMok-thorin ka!\u201d = \u201cEngage the enemy!\u201d. That\u2019s the only one I have off hand.\u201d\n\u2022 May 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology how visible are Night Elf and/or Draenei irises.\n\u201cYes, night elves do have pupils in their eyes. They\u2019re just sometimes tough to see, depending on lighting (due to their glow).\u201d\n\u2022 May 9, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Blackmoore fought with the Frostwolf Clan and did Terenas know about it?\u201d\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t fight the clan. In Lord of the Clans, he happened upon the bodies of slain orcs. This is how he found Thrall.\u201d\n\u2022 May 9, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So if Blackmoore found Thrall in the year 0. Blackmoore fought for Stormwind?\u201d\n\u201cHe found Thrall in Year 0, yes. The reason orcs were that far north (First War era) at that time was detailed in a tweet I sent.\u201d\n\u2022 May 9, 2014 \u201c@Loreology Blackmoore fought during the Second War after he found Thrall?\u201d\n\u201cHe rose through the ranks (as stated in Lord of the Clans, p. 18). How the Frostwolves went north during the First War? The clan stealthily made their way to the Alterac Mountains, killing any \nwitnesses who would have alerted others.\u201d\n\u2022 May 9, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How tall are Worgen on average?\u201d\n\u201cOn average? Females about 8\u2019, and the same for males (when hunched over).\u201d\n\u2022 May 8, 2014 - \u201cThe Old Gods do not have gender. When referring to an Old God, use the gender-neutral pronoun \"it\", never \"he\" or \"she\".\u201d\n\u2022 May 8, 2014 \u2013 \u201cIs Ner\u2019zhul\u2019s spirit destroyed canonically or not?\u201d\n\u201cSo it seems per the Arthas novel (p. 307).\u201d\n\u2022 May 8, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How old is Jaina?\u201d\n\u201cJaina was born in the Year -3.\u201d\n\u2022 May 8, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Varian was younger than Arthas? So that makes Jaina older than Varian?\u201d\n\u201cVarian was born in Year -10 and Arthas in Year -4. It is currently Year 30.\u201d\n\u2022 May 7, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Does Tyrande know Broxigar in our timeline? Or did the War of the Ancients book happen in a different one?\u201d\n\u201cIndeed, otherwise the events of Stormrage would be weird (Thura and the axe especially).\u201d\n\u2022 May 6, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Never truly understood what Al\u2019Akir\u2019s deal was in Cataclysm. Did he team up with the Twilights or had his own agenda?\u201d\n\u201cHe was on Deathwing\u2019s payroll, similar to Ragnaros.\u201d\n\u2022 May 6, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So Chromie stuck around in the Well of Eternity dungeon after sending us home and chatted with the Night Elves?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying they have been in the same place at the same time once.\u201d\n\u2022 May 6, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Tyrande seems to know Chromie prior to War Crimes. Did I miss when they first met?\u201d\n\u201cWell, she did appear in that whole Well of Eternity dungeon.\u201d\n\u2022 May 6, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Is Malfurion the sole leader of the CC, or a high ranking member of the Cenarions? I assumed Cenarius would lead.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s an archdruid. It\u2019s the highest rank a druid can hold, awarded only by the Cenarion Circle. However, becoming an archdruid does not necessarily mean that one assumes the leadership of the Cenarion Circle.\u201d\n\u2022 May 6, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology I say this because for example Malfurion is CC member and also part of Darnassus society when he\u2019s not working in the circle.\u201d\n\u201cRight, which is a touchy subject atm. He co-rules the night elves, but is also a CC leader. What a conundrum, huh?\u201d\n\u2022 May 6, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Cenarion Circle Night Elves are Alliance/Darnassus affiliated too? Is the Cenarion Circle a nation or an organization?\u201d\n\u201cThe CC is a small organization that answers only to itself. They have nothing to do with creating or enforcing law.\u201d\n\u2022 May 6, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Did we ever learn what Yogg-saron (translated) said? \u201cUulwi ifis halas gag erh\u2019ong w\u2019ssh.\u201d \u201d\n\u201c \u201cThe shadow of my corpse will choke this land for all eternity.\u201d \u201c\n\u2022 May 5, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Roughly how many Draenei were there when they landed on Draenor and Rise of the Horde started?\u201d\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t been given solid numbers at the current time. What left Argus and what arrived on Draenor is an open question.\u201d\n\u2022 May 5, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Is there a lore reason for BK using steeds instead of hawkstriders?\u201d\n\u201cNo lore reason at this time, Perhaps personal preference?\u201d\n\u2022 May 1, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Isn\u2019t Belo\u2019vir dead?\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead, yes, but the family name lives on\u2026\u201d\n\u2022 May 1, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What\u2019s Belo\u2019vir\u2019s surname? If he was a Convoc. Member, he should have been a noble, I guess.\u201d\n\u201cThanks to Micky, we\u2019ve learned this character\u2019s surname: Salonar. Hints at it changing when HEs became Bes though.\u201d\n\u2022 April 30, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What does \u201cMa-no icta\u201d (WOW-TCG) mean in Draenei?\u201d\n\u201c \u201cMa-no icta!\u201d = \u201cDouble your efforts!\u201d \u201c\n\u2022 April 30, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What happened to the Kul Tiras Marine corpses at Tiragarde Keep? Were they picked up after the Siege of Orgrimmar? Burned before?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m fairly certain the corpses were cared for. Few like rotting corpses hanging around.\u201d\n\u2022 April 30, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are all female Night Elf sentinel groups still viable?\u201d\n\u201cThe current lore is that males have been allowed into the Sentinels. That said, some small groups might only have women.\u201d\n\u2022 April 29, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Since Malfurion leads the CC and is co-leader in Darnassus, does that mean he has more power than Tyrande in their society?\u201d\n\u201cOfficial ruling states they co-rule the night elf people. No mention of \u201cwho has more power than who\u201d at the moment.\u201d\n\u2022 April 29, 2014 - \u201c@Loreology Are Faerie Dragons predatory? I thought they ate berries (in Hyjal).\u201d\n\u201cBrightwing is *special*.\u201d\n\u2022 April 24, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology I need to know, what\u2019s the average height for orcs (both genders), Tauren (both genders) and mok\u2019nathal (both genders)\n\u201cMale Orcs? ~7\u2019. Female Orcs? 6-6.5\u2019. Male Tauren? 10\u2019. Female Tauren? 9\u2019. Again, these are averages.\u201d \n\u2022 April 24, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What name did Orcs have for their race? Were humans the first to call the race \u201cOrcs\u201d?\u201d\n\u201cAccording to Rise of the Horde, even the Orcs called themselves that name when Durotan was young.\u201d\n\u2022 April 23, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Ask CDev 2 mentioned Velen visiting Darnassus and suggesting things about Elune. Was that visit the Alliance summit of Wolfheart?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m guessing that was a diplomatic mission. Summits are big deals.\u201d\n\u2022 April 23, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So the reason Tyrande has a different hair color is because she dyed it?\u201d\n\u201cIIRC, I believe that is what they are going with, yes.\u201d\n\u2022 April 22, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What does \u201cTheia-shoush ahmen\u201d mean? (Cairne says it in WC3.\u201d\n\u201c \u201cTheia-shoush ahmen.\u201d = \u201cSo it will be.\u201d \u201c\n\u2022 April 21, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So now Kalecgos is going to be corrupted, seems to be a running theme with Jaina.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m sure her history is well known to Kalec.\u201d\n\u2022 April 16, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are the orcs still occupying UC post Garrosh? Unfortunately not a lot of clarification on what happened.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve officially said anything, but my two coppers is \u201cNo\u201d. That\u2019s up to TLPTB, but makes sense to me lore-wise.\u201d\n\u2022 April 16, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Is Gilneas still viable to visit the ruins or to make a mass in memory of the fallen? Or is it uninhabitable?\u201d\n\u201cThe plague still remained, so its future is an open question.\u201d\n\u2022 April 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Does Lor\u2019themar Theron have any living relatives?\u201d\n\u201cIIRC, we haven\u2019t specified any in the established lore at this time.\u201d\n\u2022 April 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What color is Tyrande\u2019s hair? It appears to have gone from blue to teal, but not sure what is current.\u201d\n\u201cA lady changes her hair color, but the canonical hair color is dark blue with streaks of silver.\u201d\n\u2022 April 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology \u201c\u201cPheta vi acahachi!\u201d= \u201cLight give me strength\u201d I thought the Draenei word for Light was sha but there\u2019s no sha in that phrase.\u201d\n\u201cTrue (like Sha\u2019tar &amp; Shattrah), but it might be a contextual thing. This one\u2019s a war cry and an appeal to the Holy Light.\u201d\n\u2022 April 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology In lore, was there a vote to bring Dalaran back to the Alliance like how Wolfheart had one for Gilneans but not in game?\u201d\n\u201cJaina had a hand in pledging Dalaran\u2019s loyalty to the Alliance. If there was a vote to accept her pledge, it was off screen.\u201d\n\u2022 April 15, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Concept art mentions that fel orcs\u2019 spines are #Savage piercings. Is this canon or does demon blood bring out the Gronn in you.\u201d\n\u201cIt was my understanding spikes are a fel orcish (the extreme level of fel corruption). Gul\u2019dan\u2019s? Part of his clothing.\u201d\n\u2022 April 14, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Can one moon eclipse the other, or is that not possible?\u201d\n\u201cIt is possible! This astrological event is known as \u201cThe Embrace\u201d and was detailed in the Twilight of the Aspects novel (p. 183).\u201d\n\u2022 April 14, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Do you know what Kronokai Kristor, Dyoniss Aka, Pheta vi acahachi, Kehla men Samir, solay lamaa kahl and Arkenon Porros mean?\u201d\n\u201c\u201dKrona ki cristorr!\u201d = \u201cThe Legion will fall!\u201d, \u201cDioniss aca.\u201d = \u201cSafe journey.\u201d, \u201cPheta vi acahachi!\u201d = \u201cLight give me strength!\u201d , \u201cArchenon poros.\u201d = \u201cGood fortune.\u201d\u201d\n\u2022 April 14, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology what does whatever Baine says when you click him mean?\u201d\n\u201c\u201cIsh-ne-alo por-ah.\u201d = \u201cMay the days ahead be guided by the elders of long ago.\u201d\u201d\n\u2022 April 14, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Why can\u2019t Worgen be paladins lore wise?\u201d\n\u201cIt does smack of a \u201cgame balance\u201d reasoning to me.\u201d\n\u2022 April 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology can\u2019t worgen talk in their worgen form?\u201d\n\u201cWorgen, yes. But that form was an altered form of \u201cPack Form\u201d.\u201d\n\u2022 April 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Can druids talk in their animal forms?\u201d\n\u201cAs we see with Broll Bearmantle in the comic, I believe the ruling is they cannot.\u201d\n\u2022 April 10, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology prior to the sunwell\u2019s destruction. Were the belf buildings all blue? Some suggest yes and no e.g. helf buildings in Outland.\u201d\n\u201cThe Sunwell manga showed the kingdom having red tints when it was created.\u201d\n\u2022 April 7, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology They fixed the arm of Kargath. Let\u2019s hope they soon fix the eye of Kilrogg too!\u201d\n\u201cMetzen ruled it\u2019s his left eye that was lost. The art should be good now.\u201d\n\u2022 April 7, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology If Velen\u2019s skin being alabaster is canon\u2026 why did War Crimes cover depict him as purple-skinned? Wasn\u2019t reviewed by you?\u201d\n\u201cIt was an art decision, IIRC. I was looped in too late in the process to really provide feedback.\u201d\n\u2022 April 7, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are Daelin\u2019s WCIII spells canon or was he lorewise just a warrior?\u201d\n\u201cNo ruling atm, but I\u2019ve got a feeling that this is a game thing. It\u2019s on the list.\u201d\n\u2022 April 7, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What\u2019s the orcish word for land/world/earth?\u201d\n\u201cThe only word I have on file is \u201cNagrand\u201d = \u201cLand of winds\u201d. No unique term is on hand at the moment.\u201d\n\u2022 April 7, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Does War Crimes assign a name to the conflict that recently happened (Fourth War, Garrosh\u2019s War, etc.)?\n\u201cThe events of the \u201cMists of Pandaria\u201d expansion were ruled to be \u201cThe Invasion of Pandaria\u201d (per the UVG).\u201d\n\u2022 April 5, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Would you consider the Night Elves attacking the Shatterspear Tribe an act of genocide.\u201d\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t consider it that way personally. That\u2019s just my two coppers.\u201d\n\u2022 April 4, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Belore is just a word for sun? Not any kind of god, magic force, etc\u2026 right?\u201d\n\u201cYep. \u201cBelore\u201d = \u201cSun\u201d in Thalassian.\u201d\n\u2022 April 3, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Who is the leader of the forsaken Deathstalkers, I\u2019ve heard rumors that it\u2019s Aleric Hawkins, but I can\u2019t find any proof.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s intentionally vague in-game. No hard lore ruling at the current time.\u201d\n\u2022 April 3, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology What does Y\u2019knath K\u2019th\u2019rygg k\u2019yi mrr\u2019ungha gr\u2019mula and Uulwi ifis halahs gag erh\u2019ongg w\u2019ssh mean?\n\u201cPleas confirm the spelling of the 1st? The second one: \u201cUulwi gag erh\u2019ongg w\u2019ssh = \u201cTheir shadow will choke the land for eternity.\u201d\n\u2022 April 2, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How come the Hellfire watchers in the Hellfire Ramparts can use the light?\u201d\n\u201cI believe that\u2019s just a game mechanic. Those fel orcs are juiced up to the max lore-wise.\u201d\n\u2022 March 31, 2014 \u2013 \u201cif Varian &amp;Anduin died who\u2019s the new king of stormwind? Seems like awfully dangerous lines of succession.\u201d\n\u201cUnspecified. I\u2019m guessing the House of Nobles would decide.\u201d\n\u2022 March 31, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Were the Wardens a sentinel team?\u201d\n\u201cAt first, volunteers from the Sisterhood of Elune made up the Watchers.\u201d\n\u2022 March 31, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Begs a question about if the Sentinels break into brigades or smaller units.\u201d\n\u201cOnly mention I know off the top of my head are the Shadowleaves from War3.\u201d\n\u2022 March 28, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Is the pronunciation of Nagrand Nag-gron\u2019d?\u201d\n\u201cNo official pronunciation AFAIK. I\u2019ve always heard it the way you spelled it out, though.\u201d\n\u2022 March 28, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How do you pronounce Dalaran? I\u2019ve heard it pronounced 20 different ways!\u201d\n\u201c\u201dDahl-ah-rahn\u201d is the canonical one.\u201d\n\u2022 March 27, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology were the children Alexstrasza had for the Old Horde aged artificially to make them big enough to ride?\u201d\n\u201cIIRC, some of the red dragons were pressed into service. The line from ToD p. 224, always makes me misty eyed.\u201d\n\u2022 March 27, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Do revolvers exist in Warcraft lore?\u201d\n\u201cThe RPG had a mention of a \u201crepeating Pistol\u201d, but that\u2019s now non-canonical. There\u2019s a repeating rifle in the game, though\u2026\u201d\n\u2022 March 27, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Do Tauren kiss each other?\u201d\n\u201cThey do indeed! One mention was in \u201cBleeding Sun\u201d (p. 41): \u201c\u2026and touched [the child\u2019s] forehead with his snout.\u201d\n\u2022 March 24, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Aiden Perenolde: alive or dead?\u201d\n\u201cMy bible currently states that this character is deceased.\u201d\n\u2022 March 24, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Were the Druids of the Fang able to transform into snakes before their trip to the Wailing Caverns?\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so, IIRC.\u201d\n\u2022 March 23, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How did Invincible get wings?\u201d\n\u201cMy guess? An ability the Lich King gave to his beloved mount after raising him into undeath.\u201d\n\u2022 March 23, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How big is Ironforge lore wise? In game it\u2019s just a small boring circle yet even Grim Batol which is ruined puts it to shame.\n\u201cLore-wise, it\u2019s immense. Game size tends is not accurate lore-wise.\u201d\n\u2022 March 23, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Did many ordinary (non-blackrock) shaman decide to switch to dark shamanism because of their loyalty to Garrosh?\u201d\n\u201cGarrosh was all about force. It\u2019d be a personal decision for each shaman, me thinks.\u201d\n\u2022 March 13, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Why exactly do Orcs need lumber? What do they use it for? Don\u2019t they need other resources from Ashenvale?\u201d\n\u201cWeapons, building materials\u2026 I mean, demolishers don\u2019t build themselves.\u201d\n\u2022 March 13, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology How is it that Trolls manage their resources better than the Orcs? Are their jungles better for living than Orgrimmar?\u201d\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because they\u2019ve been on Azeroth longer?\u201d\n\u2022 March 13, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology The blue Primal Mana is pure Arcane so what\u2019s the yellow colored Primal Nether?\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a game thing. Arcane magic is canonically white and/or violet in the lore.\u201d\n\u2022 March 12, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology So has Jaina made any attempt to contact Kul Tiras?\u201d\n\u201cNot at the current time. The whole events with her father may cause her some hesitation.\u201d\n\u2022 March 10, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology do the Forsaken follow Sylvanas out of blind loyalty or are they brain-washed?\u201d\n\u201cWell, each Forsaken member follows their queen for various reasons: fear, loyalty, nowhere else to go\u2026\u201d\n\u2022 March 10, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Do warlocks become physically weaker by using fel magic?\n\u201cIIRC, lore-wise, using fel magic is dangerous on many levels. Warlocks are just all ego: nothing else matters.\u201d\n\u2022 March 10, 2014 \u2013 \u201cLore from Chris Metzen and Micky Neilson! Alteraci (\u201calterackee\u201d), Lordaeronian, Stromic, Dalaranian, Stormwindian. BOOM.\u201d\n\u2022 March 9, 2014 \u2013 \u201cFel magic is created from destroying something else.\u201d\n\u2022 March 3, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Like Aegwynn to Medivh, is there a chance that Sargeras\u2019 soul transferred to Med\u2019an?\u201d\n\u201cSadly, no. When Medivh was killed, Sargeras\u2019 spirit was banished elsewhere. It\u2019s why we haven\u2019t seen him since that time.\u201d\n\u2022 March 3, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Is Davin from Cycle of Hatred still alive?\u201d\n\u201cI believe he\u2019s alive, but I\u2019d have to check with TLPTB if that is canonical.\u201d\n\u2022 February 28, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are High Elves still allowed access to the Sunwell, after everything went down in Dal/Isle of Thunder\n\u201cWell we know that Vereesa was met with \u201cnot so veiled\u201d hostility when she returned to QT during Cata\u2026 my thought is that there are \u201churt feelings\u201d over/after the purge.\u201d\n\u2022 February 27, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Reading Night of the Dragon I\u2019m wondering if the Skardyn were retconned? As they were replaced with troggs in wow.\u201d\n\u201cNot retconned lore-wise, but I believe it was a game-related thing.\u201d\n\u2022 February 27, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Can Sargeras be considered a God?\u201d\n\u201cThe titans rere referred to as \u201cmetallic-skinned gods\u201d in the old lore.\u201d\n\u2022 February 18, 2014 \u2013 \u201cWoW manual (p. 174): Nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race *died* within days.\u201d\n\u2022 February 18, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are there any female Earthen or Iron Dwarves?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019d assume so. Not seeing them in game may just be a model limitation.\u201d\n\u2022 February 18, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Are the aspects now as powerful as normal dragons, or ending the hour of twilight only stole their immortality?\u201d\n\u201cPreventing the Hour of Twilight made them mortal. Their powers are diminished, but still powerful.\u201d\n\u2022 February 17, 2014 \u2013 \u201c@Loreology Would the Scourge have captured mages and force them to serve as necromancers, or would they make them Undead mages?\u201d\n\u201cWilling mages would probably sign up (e.g. Cult of the Damned), but most folks are malleable in Undeath.\u201d"}

Your parameters can be called any valid Lua name.\nBelow is a simple function without arguments, followed by another function that calls on the first:\n function MyAddon_Mimic()\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"Hello World!\")\n end\n function MyAddon_Call()\n MyAddon_Mimic()\n end\nNow the same function with arguments (you can define any number of arguments):\n function MyAddon_Mimic(arg1)\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"Hello \" .. arg1)\n end\n function MyAddon_Call()\n MyAddon_Mimic(\"Buddy!\")\n end\nWhereas the first example would've simply printed \"Hello World!\" to the chat window, the second example will now print \"Hello Buddy!\" However, arg1 is a pretty non-discriptive argument name (and we only used one). Let's try something more interesting:\n function MyAddon_Mimic(who, send)\n local posX, posY = &lt;a href=\"API%20GetPlayerMapPosition\"&gt;GetPlayerMapPosition&lt;/a&gt;(who);\n if send==1 then\n DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(who .. \" is currently at location \" .. posX .. \",\" .. posY)\n end\n end\n function MyAddon_Call()\n MyAddon_Mimic(\"player\", 1)\n MyAddon_Mimic(\"party1\", 1)\n MyAddon_Mimic(\"party2\", 0)\n end\nHere, our little addon will now print the location of our player and our first party member, but while it will get the location of party member 2, it won't print it.\nUsing the argument '...' efficiently.\nWith patch 2.0 and the upgrade to lua 5.1, the '...' arg is much more powerful and less memory intensive than it was previously. Here's some handy tips on how to use this new functionality.\nHooking.\nPreviously, the ... arg would create a table 'args' if called. This allocated a table into memory, and thus became a source of garbage churn. A very common pitfall of this came from hooking:\n local f = somefunc\n somefunc = function(...)\n -- do some crap\n return f(unpack(args))\n end\nNow if this function is called often, or there are many hooks like this, there will be a significant hit on performance. With lua 5.1 we can do this hook with no memory wasted\n local f = somefunc\n somefunc = function(...)\n -- do some crap\n return f(...)\n end\nPost-hooks.\nThe new functionality also allows for a nice clean post hook to be made. In this example we need the first arg passed to the function, and we wish to maintain a full proper hook. That means every arg is passed to the hooked function, and every return from that is returned back from our function.\n local f = somefunc\n local ph = function(a1, ...)\n -- do something with a1\n return ...\n end\n somefunc = function(a1, ...)\n return ph(a1, f(a1, ...))\n end\nIterations.\nAs with hooking, iteration over arbitrary number of args would create a table and thus waste memory.

On &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt;, each race has its own funeral rites according to their culture and beliefs, whether by burials, cremations, mummifications, or other processes. Even after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, death is still an uncertainty to most citizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, as they didn't come to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and not everyone came back from the realm of the dead.\nPractices by races.\n&lt;a href=\"Ankoan\"&gt;Ankoan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnkoan believe the spirits of their ancestors continue to watch over them after death. To honor their dead, the ankoan place wooden burial shrines over their graves. However, the names of those who have died a dishonorable or cowardly death are purposefully forgotten.\n&lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;Arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn death, all arakkoa seek to join &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; in the skies above &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and thus cremation is vastly preferred to burial. Some have their ashes scattered high in the skies, others are collected in ornate urns and placed in crypts. While devotees of Rukhmar prefer cremation, the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; have taken to darker last rites.\n&lt;a href=\"Centaur\"&gt;Centaur&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt; believe that the spirits of dead centaur live with Ohn'ahra in the sky and run alongside her on the winds. When a mystic of Clan Ohn'ir dies, a sacred &lt;a href=\"ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt; known as a Child of Ohn'ahra carries their spirit to Windsong Rise, where they may become one with the wind and sky.\nIn Kalimdor, &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; is a combination of ancient centaur burial grounds, as well as a primal temple dedicated to the elemental earth.\n&lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the draenei dead were entombed within &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; and watched over by the &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; order. Since as far back as when they lived on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, souls of great &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; and draenei heroes have been installed in mechanical guardians called &lt;a href=\"vigilant\"&gt;vigilant&lt;/a&gt;s to aid their people after death.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen dragons near the end of their lives, they fly to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wastes\"&gt;Dragon Wastes&lt;/a&gt; in the center of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to die and enrich the land with their passing. The reason they fly specifically to the Dragonblight is &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;possibly&lt;/a&gt; because it is the site of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, where the Dragon Aspects were allegedly empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. Many choose to set their bodies close to the &lt;a href=\"Galakrond%27s%20Rest\"&gt;resting place&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, since he is (incorrectly) believed to have been the progenitor of dragons.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt;, there was a time dragons would be laid to rest in &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Ossuary\"&gt;Veiled Ossuary&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; claimed a small location there. Senegos was the last grave keeper after Neltharion's betrayal as the Dragon Isles were sealed away, and no one could be laid to rest there any longer. The peaceful passing of a blue dragon is seemly to be uniting with the &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard dwarves&lt;/a&gt; prefer to bury their dead, returning them to the ground that so benefits their race. They consider it both an honor and a repayment. Some dwarves seal their deceased in tombs, but those with a concern about the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; might prefer cremation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Clan\"&gt;Wildhammers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; honor their dead heroes in &lt;a href=\"Kirthaven\"&gt;Kirthaven&lt;/a&gt; before burying them with their &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s atop &lt;a href=\"Thunderstrike%20Mountain\"&gt;Thunderstrike Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;Gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIt is common tradition that when a gnoll dies, the members of his/her &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cannibalism\"&gt;devour the body&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nStatus is supreme in goblin society, which is reflected in their funeral practices; the higher the deceased's status, the larger and more extravagant the funeral. Tradition dictates that goblins be buried with their most valuable possessions so they can enjoy them at the &lt;a href=\"Everlasting%20Party\"&gt;Everlasting Party&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin afterlife. The reading of the list of assets that belonged to the deceased in life serves as the highlight of the event. All of this is performed in full view of the deceased's family and rivals in order to inspire feelings of jealousy.\nThe only thing more important than being buried with one's possessions is the burial gifts bequeathed to the dead by other goblins, which serve as a reflection of wealth and social standing and consist of everything from coins, pearls, furniture, and clothing to weapons, food, and alcohol. In at least some cases, the goblin can draft a list of burial gifts they demand from the attendees. Wealthy funeralgoers bring their gifts in chests or butler-pushed wheelbarrows that they then empty into the coffin (which can consist of a simple metal container hammered into a funerary shape).\nAfter the gifting ends, the attendees dance on top of the coffin to usher the deceased on to the Everlasting Party before lowering it into a hole at a burial site. Prominent goblins serve as pallbearers at the head of the coffin, while goblins contractually obligated to serve as pack mules carry the rear. The burial is followed by partying and feasting; it's common knowledge that a goblin funeral is nothing more than an excuse to throw a party with someone else footing the bill. As was the case with &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Donais\"&gt;Trade Prince Donais&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin can pick out the musicians and refreshments that will be present at their funeral.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMost humans follow the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, which includes burying the deceased in cemeteries. Following the end of wars, the Church organizes ceremonies for the fallen, taking care of preparing the bodies to be buried according to the traditions. It is tradition that a small memento be buried on top of a &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt;'s graveyard, beneath the shallow earth. The humans of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; have a tradition where they carefully remove weapons from a corpse before burial. They consider that a soul cannot rest if they carry the cause of their death with them forever. Since the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, some humans like &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; prefer to be cremated, as they don't want to be raised as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the most part, the humans of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; do not bury their dead, but rather send them to the sea. The tidesages use an ornate bell named a Dead Ringer that calls the souls of the recently deceased to them, and release them through the \"Ritual of Release\". The souls of the fallen are released into rivers that flow through the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; and out into the open sea. Legends say that as their spirits pass through the Shrine, they aid in the great blessing rituals that all Kul Tiran ships undergo. In that way, they never stop serving their people. Despite this, there is a &lt;a href=\"Barrowknoll%20Cemetery\"&gt;large cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, indicating that the region has a different tradition and does bury their dead.\n&lt;a href=\"Jinyu\"&gt;Jinyu&lt;/a&gt;.\nJinyu pray over heirlooms or tokens of their dead in order to properly lay them to rest, and move on.\n&lt;a href=\"Magnataur\"&gt;Magnataur&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dens%20of%20Dying\"&gt;Dens of Dying&lt;/a&gt; are a sacred place to the magnataur, where they go in their old age to die.\n&lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rituals for desecrating a fallen opponent are a well-established part of mogu culture. They also &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummify&lt;/a&gt; their dead.\nThe mogu view their dead as a collection of parts. Souls could be bound to stone for later use. Flesh and blood could be reforged to extend the lives of those loyal to the emperor. To be buried intact was a symbol of great power and respect. The &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of Emperors&lt;/a&gt; serves as the resting grounds for a hundred generations of warlords, kings, and emperors who once ruled &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nNight elf burial is done naturally, returning the deceased to nature. &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Priestesses&lt;/a&gt; begin by ritualistically cleansing the body in a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;, and they use nature and arcane magic to mend the body for a final viewing. The priestesses sing arias from their temples highlighting the deceased's life, after which the remains are placed on a flower-draped bier, carried to a grove, and placed on a patch of grass. A druid then spurs on the growth of plants around the corpse, creating a wide spectrum of colorful blooms which surround and then entirely encase the body. They believe that when the valiant die, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; sends them riding across the sky as stars. Upon death they turn into &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOgres use burial grounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBack before their corruption by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, orcs generally used to burn their dead on &lt;a href=\"Pyremaster\"&gt;funeral pyres&lt;/a&gt;. Being laid to rest in the ground was an odd concept to them, for they wanted their bodies to be given to fire, their ashes to air, to be consumed by water and earth, while their spirits would be then left free to join their ancestors. That old custom was gradually abandoned as the orcs fell to their bloodlust and rejected their old shamanistic ways. In present days some orcs are still being burned on funeral pyres, but others are now also laid to rest in &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Shadowmoon Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt; on Draenor contained many of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;'s dead.\n&lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\nA traditional pandaren funeral ceremony involves the lighting of the \"Incense of Life\", which not only has a pleasant smell, but also has restorative properties and can even help plants grow. The incense is made from strongly aromatic spices, which gives it its unique scent, as well as blue crab shells.\n&lt;a href=\"Taunka\"&gt;Taunka&lt;/a&gt;.\nTaunka bury their dead in burial grounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nTauren do not bury their dead, they prepare the body for its return to the elements by performing the traditional rites with a &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20Totem\"&gt;Funerary Totem&lt;/a&gt; and place it at their sacred grave sites. The most valiant tauren are laid to rest at the sacred burial ground of &lt;a href=\"Red%20Rocks\"&gt;Red Rocks&lt;/a&gt;. It is an honor bestowed upon the great warriors who helped found and defend &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and those who have given their lives for the greater good of their &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; have sacred burial grounds.\n&lt;a href=\"Tol%27vir\"&gt;Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;.\nTol'vir &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummify&lt;/a&gt; their dead.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhen a troll of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; dies, they get cremated on a ritual pyre and their ashes are stored within an urn. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s used to bury their dead in burial mounds but now they also cremate the dead. This tradition started after the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;Plague of corrupted blood&lt;/a&gt; broke out and the bodies were too polluted for proper burial. In time this practice turned to tradition among the majority of the Zandalari. Not all are cremated, however.

Though relatively non-aggressive, these lumbering behemoths are savagely efficient at dispatching their adversaries when provoked. They feed on other native swamp creatures, as well as any &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; unlucky enough to stray too close to the giants' beloved hideaways.\nOnce, the area now known as the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Mire\"&gt;Dead Mire&lt;/a&gt; served as the spawning grounds for the fungal giants. With the waters receding, it seems the changes are preventing the giants from sporing. If the trend continues, the giants may disappear entirely.\nRecently, the giants have come into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Sporeggar\"&gt;Sporeggar&lt;/a&gt;. Driven by starvation due to the continuous sapping of the marsh's resources by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, they have began to roam the &lt;a href=\"Spawning%20Glen\"&gt;Spawning Glen&lt;/a&gt;, preying on &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt; young. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; are looking for a peaceful solution to allow the two species to cohabitate in the marsh.\nThe bog lord variation is larger and hardier than regular bog giants.\nA number of fungal giants also appear in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. They appear to have been &lt;a href=\"colossi\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt; who were struck by a curse similar to the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, likely caused by the &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s. The other giants share no love for their fungal brethren.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, fungal giants started to appear from a small pool (beginning to form large mushrooms for unknown reasons) in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Forest\"&gt;Tainted Forest&lt;/a&gt;. They seem to have been corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;residual demonic powers&lt;/a&gt; left from the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology.\nFungal giants are not actually made of fungus. The fungal growth over their bodies is another organism living in symbiosis with the giant. Some, like the &lt;a href=\"Gloomshade%20Fungi\"&gt;Gloomshade Fungi&lt;/a&gt;, are at least considered fungi. Not that the Gloomshade Fungi are attacked by the passive &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20Giant%20%28Shadowmoon%20Valley%29\"&gt;Fungal Giant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThey have three hearts that look like s and their brains, \"complex fungal [structures]\", are described as \"soft, convoluted [masses] of fungi\" that exert centralized control over their bodies.\nLifespan.\nIt's unknown exactly how long they can live; however, &lt;a href=\"Hungarfen\"&gt;Hungarfen&lt;/a&gt; has been alive for millennia tending to a very special plant, known as the &lt;a href=\"Underspore\"&gt;Underspore&lt;/a&gt;."}

Four thick tentacles sway in the air as the creature lurches forward.\nFungal horrors make their lairs in dank, fungus-infested environs in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, posing a threat to all who enter their domains. They are often found in temperate marshes or underground. Though their tactics are straightforward and predictable, they can absorb a frightening amount of punishment before dropping. Fungal horrors do not speak.\nFungal horrors lurk wherever they can - under giant toadstools, in standing water, or behind whatever else is in their territory. A fungal horror prefers to attack from hiding, emitting a gurgling roar as it bears down on intruders. They pound and grab with their mighty tendrils until opposition is squished to a fine paste. Dimly intelligent, they grab and hurl objects - any objects - at foes that remain out of reach. Fungal horrors are fiercely territorial and attack any non-plants that enter their realms."}
