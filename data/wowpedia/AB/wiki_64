Many serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but others serve only themselves or can be impressed by a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; master. Only female sayaad are commonly seen, and are known as succubi (singular succubus). The males are named incubi (singular incubus). Sayaad can change their appearance between succubus and incubus form to match their master's preferences.\nSuccubus.\nSuccubi serve as intelligence agents and torturers for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Exemplifying the subtler side of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the cruel sayaadi temptresses revel in causing anguish and pain, and their murderous interrogations are the stuff of nightmares. Creatures of incredible mental powers, they can lull those of weak minds into their servitude. Succubi know much about love and slake their lust with coupling. They are described as devourers of souls, destroyers of hearts, dominators of minds, and tempters of men. Succubi have a tendency to keep detailed logs of their day-to-day activities. Their accounts are often lurid, almost always grotesque, and are typically written onto \"paper\" made from the skin of an enemy or a captive.\nMany &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s believed themselves strong enough to bind and command a sayaad, only to become the demon's next meal or being those commanded instead. Although they possess martial prowess, it is their illusionary charms that are their most potent weapon, as a single moment of hesitation is enough for the demon to seize the opportunity to enthrall its prey.\nFel succubi are a more powerful variant, with red skin, more elaborate, spiked armor, and wings and whips that drip with fel energy.\nIncubus.\nIncubi are much more rarely seen than succubi, but can be summoned by &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. There are several different rumors concerning incubi, all of which are perpetrated by the succubi themselves. A few of the most common rumors are:\nDuring her battle against demons in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; encountered a demon who mentioned incubi as part of the Legion's forces. \nWarcraft III creeps.\nSuccubi appeared as &lt;a href=\"creep\"&gt;creep&lt;/a&gt;s in missions and maps with the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tileset\"&gt;tileset&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a warlock minion.\nThe sayaad is the third &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;demon minion&lt;/a&gt; available to &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Sayaad\"&gt;Summon Sayaad&lt;/a&gt; spell. The spell randomly summons either an incubus or succubus unless the summoner choses to only summon one form or the other by customizing the Sayaad form at the barbershop.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Sultry%20Grimoire\"&gt;Sultry Grimoire&lt;/a&gt; drops from &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nA succubus is a stunningly beautiful woman. Her voluptuous form is squeezed into a tight leather bodice. Large bat wings unfurl from her back, and she lets out a short gasp as she cracks a small whip against her milky thigh. A succubus is pleasure and pain rolled into one deadly package. Like all demons, she enjoys bringing death and misery to the mortal races \u2014 but that doesn't mean she can't have fun with them first. Many warlocks choose a succubus as a fellow companion for their ability to manipulate those weak of will. It is not uncommon for a succubus in a mortal's servitude to fall uncontrollably in love with him or her; this occurrence is not always to the master's advantage, though, for a devoted succubus can be prone to fits of extreme jealousy, especially when her master deals with those of the opposite sex. A succubus usually tries to avoid direct confrontation, preferring instead to use her natural (and supernatural) charm to gain a creature's trust, then to lure her victim into a defenseless position. In open combat, a succubus is far from helpless, however. She is surprisingly agile, always attempting to feint or flank an opponent, thus allowing her to backstab with her lash of pain. Most warlocks tend to trust their succubus's natural instincts in combat. This trust comes as much from respect for her abilities as it does from the realization that a succubus may ignore an order she doesn\u2019t agree with anyway. This is especially true when an opponent threatens her master directly, as she may become reckless trying to save him.\nLanguages.\nAs members of the Burning Legion, succubi speak &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;, and most also speak Common. Common is a language known by most races who would summon these beings, those who summon them likely know Eredun as well.\nSpeculation.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Saga%20Issue%201\"&gt;Warcraft Saga Issue 1&lt;/a&gt;\", one of the demons that &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; is shown fighting before his corruption (see below) resembles a masculine sayaad and may have been intended to be an incubus. However, it bears little resemblance to the incubus model that was later added to \"World of Warcraft\", notably lacking wings and having differently shaped horns. It may simply have been intended as a &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, though this would mean that its inclusion in the comic was an error since the first satyrs weren't created until the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; much later in history."}

He asks two questions with multiple answers, after which he buffs you. The buffs are linked to which answers you choose; so if you desire, you can specify the buff reliably, see &lt;a href=\"Sayge%27s%20Fortunes\"&gt;Sayge's Fortunes&lt;/a&gt;. The buffs last for 2 hours, and the cooldown between receiving buffs is even longer.\nAfter you answer Sayge's questions and he has just buffed you, he asks you if you want a written fortune. You can turn Sayge down, but assuming you accept, you get a soulbound fortune cookie-like fortune item in your inventory (must have a free slot).

{"id": "18501", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18501", "title": "Sayge's Fortunes", "text": "After &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt; tells your fortune, you will receive a &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; depending on the answers you gave.\nGuide to answering Sayge.\nHere is a chart of the buffs with answers you need to give to get them.\nSayge presents scenarios, as follows:\nA. \"You have been tasked by your liege to guard his fields of corn from poachers and thieves. One night, on patrol, you stumble across a haggard man in thread-bare clothing stealing corn from the field. You quickly confront him, and he immediately begs for his life. He claims he is stealing corn to feed his family since the lord of the land - your liege - demands too much in taxes. Your liege is indeed known from his harsh taxes throughout the land. Make your choice.\"\nChoices:\n1. I slay the man on the spot as my liege would expect me to do, as he nothing more than a thief and a liar. (GO TO SCENARIO 'B')\n2. I turn over the man to my liege for punishment, as he has broken the law of the land and it is my sworn duty to enforce it. (GO TO SCENARIO 'C')\n3. I confiscate the corn he has stolen, warn him that stealing is a path toward doom and destruction, but I let him go to return to his family. (GO TO SCENARIO 'D')\n4. I allow the man to take enough corn to feed his family for a couple of days, encouraging him to leave the land. (GO TO SCENARIO 'E')\nScneario B.\n\"You are the sworn executioner for your liege. A man has been sent to you for execution as a traitor of the liege and your people. You know this individual as a close, virtuous friend who mysteriously vanished one day. You also know that the man's crimes for which he was convicted supposedly caused the deaths of many innocent civilians. Upon seeing you he begs for his life, claiming he was framed by a higher authority. Make your choice.\"\n1. (+10% Damage) I execute him as per my liege's instructions, and do it in such a manner that he suffers painfully before he dies as retribution for his crimes against my people. \n2. (+10% Magic Resistance) I execute him as per my liege's instructions, but doing so in as painless of a way as possible. Justice must be served, but I can show some compassion.\n3. (+10% Armor) I risk my own life and free him so that he may prove his innocence. If I can, I'll help him in any way. \nScenario C. \n\"You are on a diplomatic mission for your liege to a cruel country that is currently at war with your's. The war has been costly on both sides. Your mission is to secure a peace that is honorable to both peoples. At a diplomatic dinner, you overhear the ruler of the opposing land viciously insult your benevolent liege. You are fairly certain the ruler meant to say it out of your earshot, but nonetheless he has besmirched your liege's honor. Make your choice.\"\n1. (+1% Versatility) I not-so-quietly ignore the insult, hoping to instill a fear in the ruler that he may have gaffed. I then inform my liege of the insult when I return.\n2. (+10% Intellect) I confront the ruler on his malicious behavior, upholding my liege's honor at the risk of any future diplomacy.\n3. (+10% Magic Resistance) I quietly ignore the insult. I will not tell my liege, as I am to secure a peace at all costs. It's only an insult - not a declaration of war. \nScenario D. \n\"Your brother seeks to join the ranks of the prestigious military order you are already a part of. While you are sure of his commitment and loyalty, his talent and ability to perform the arduous tasks of the order is what you question. While you are not certain he will be able to rise to the challenge of the order - putting himself and others in dangers - you are certain that your word alone would allow him in or keep him out. Make your choice.\"\n1. (+10% Stamina) I would speak against my brother joining the order, rushing a permanent breach in our relationship. He would be a danger to himself and those around him, and that is too great a risk hoping he would improve over time. \n2. (+10% Strength) I would speak for my brother joining the order, potentially risking the safety of the order. I could help him with the order's regimens, and I'd have faith in his ability to adapt and learn.\n3. (+10% Agility) I would create some surreptitious means to keep my brother out of the order. I can keep him out without him being any bit wiser, thereby saving our familial bonds. \nScenario E.\n\"You alone have defeated a terrible beast that has been ravaging the countryside, taking its ear as a trophy. You later learn that your liege had offered a reward for the beast's death, and that a kind but destitute knight who you know is trying to support a family by meager means claims the beast's kill as his own. You have no real need for money yourself, but you know that the destitute knight is lying for his own personal gain. Make your choice.\"\n1. (+10% Intellect) I would show my liege the beast's ear and claim the beast's death as my own, taking the reward for my own use. It is wrong to claim a deed as your own that someone else in fact did.\n2. (+1% Versatility) I would show my liege the beast's ear and claim the beast's death as my own - after all, I did slay it. I would then offer some of the reward to the destitute knight to help his family.\n3. (+10% Armor) I would remain silent about the kill and allow the knight to claim the reward to aid his family.\nHere are the results based on the following answers:\n1. \"Slay the Man\" (+Damage, +Magic Resist, or +Armor)\n2. \"Turn him over to liege\" (+Versatility, +Intellect, or +Magic Resist)\n3. \"Confiscate the corn\" (+Stamina, +Strength, or +Agility)\n4. \"Let him go and have the corn\" (+Intellect, +Versatility, or +Armor)\nNotes.\nThe Dark Fortune buffs are removed upon entering the a raid instance or PvP instance. The cooldown on Sayge's ability grant a Dark Fortune to your character will not reset when this occurs, so plan accordingly.\nText of the Fortunes.\nWhen you answer Sayge's questions and receive the buff, you will receive a fortune item in your inventory with a random saying upon it. Most of these items are for flavor and humor only and can be safely discarded. A few of the items will start a quest if you right click on them.\nBelow is a list of the sayings found on each fortune. If the given item started a quest, it is noted here as well."}

While that quest is in your log, the NPCs will be friendly permitting you to proceed. If you drop the quest and leave the subzone, the NPCs will return to being angry with you. That is to say, the co-operation of these NPCs are sensitive to this quest in your log. Handy to know if you wish to drop a quest for space and think about picking it up again and are all 'Oh noes they hate me oh well won't bother picking up that chain'."}

They are found in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Firemane\"&gt;Firemane&lt;/a&gt; dragonkin.\nAll mobs specifically identified as scalebanes in WoW are large and heavily armored male dragonspawn, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Scalebane%20Lieutenant\"&gt;Scalebane Lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s, which are smaller and less armored.\nIn the RPG.\nScalebanes are the most elite and powerful of the dragonspawn, and they represent a small fraction of dragonspawn society. These are the leaders, the most powerful spellcasters, and the elders of the dragonspawn race. While scalebanes were &lt;a href=\"wyrmkin\"&gt;wyrmkin&lt;/a&gt; earlier in life, scalebanes are technically a different species, having been transformed by a complicated ritual similar to those undergone by dragons as they mature. Scalebanes are chosen from the best of the lesser ranks, those who demonstrate exceptional leadership as well as combat or magical abilities. While most scalebanes are intellectual, they still have large builds, powerfully built for combat, standing seven feet tall or just little under on average, and wear elaborate armor with dragon-crested helms that stand out from the rest their unit. Many scalebanes may also carry banners or other markings delineating their command. These banners represent their draconic patron or matron, such as &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;. \nScalebanes spend most of their time in combat commanding their units, but those with spellcaster abilities pepper their enemies with spells from a distance. If pressed, they fight fearlessly, but avoid melee combat because they know they are most effective in command positions. Scalebanes are clearly in control of a unit's movements and strategies. Scalebanes carry swords and shields, two-handed swords, or other impressive weapons, usually a greatsword. These weapons are always magical, retaining an enhancement and possibly an additional magical feature. A scalebane always has a secondary magic item: &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rod\"&gt;rod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt;, or another item used for the benefit of the entire squadron. They are considered the most adept followers of their &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; mentor and are looked on by other dragonspawn as &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s of the dragon's wisdom and prophets of the dragon's will. They are &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s, and sometimes &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s. Scalebanes are trained in the use of all martial weapons and all types of armor and shields.\nThey speak &lt;a href=\"Common\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;."}

Neltharion fashioned the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; as a secret training ground for the dracthyr, where at his command Azurathel would train the Obsidian Warders in their charge with defending the allies of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and protecting its strongholds. In a battle with &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, the titan relic that Neltharion used to control the wills of the dracthyr was destroyed. Though Raszageth was sealed away, Neltharion could no longer directly control the dracthyr without the relic and so deemed them a risk.\nAzurathel and his people were thus subsequently ordered to the creches beneath the Forbidden Reach by Neltharion, where they were sealed away by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; in magical stasis and watched over by his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. They remained there, abandoned and forgotten for nearly 20,000 years, awakened from their long slumber only when the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; returned to break &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; free, as an ancient, magical surge rippled through the Forbidden Reach, the dracthyr awoke, but from their long stasis their memories became a blur.\nThe Forbidden Reach.\nAs the dracthyr awakened, he found himself trapped in stasis until he was awakened by dracthyr adventures. After his awakening, he declared that they couldn't dwell on their broken memories, but had to move forward to assess and make a plan. Thus he directed the dracthyr with acquiring their gear, and healing their fellow dracthyr. As the group moved forward, they discovered &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Cindrethresh\"&gt;Scalecommander Cindrethresh&lt;/a&gt; and that the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Lapisagos\"&gt;Lapisagos&lt;/a&gt; intended to destroy them. Though Azurathel was uneasy at the task, due to believing that the dragons and dracthyr should fight side by side, Cindrethresh reassured him that as Lapisagos intended to destroy them, they had no other choice. After slaying their enemy, the dracthyr emerged from the ruins of their creche only to discover that their training grounds had become overgrown and realized that they'd been in stasis for a very, very, long time.\nUpon noticing that a crystal was outside the creche, he sent dracthyr to investigate, where they discovered that there were crystals in front of the other creches and that they were under attack. They quickly informed Azurathel, who declared that they must reach their allies. After this declaration, he and his allies were approached by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Vigil\"&gt;Adamant Vigil&lt;/a&gt; were no more. After discovering that the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; had invaded the &lt;a href=\"Stormsunder%20Crater\"&gt;Stormsunder Crater&lt;/a&gt; and were keeping the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Scales\"&gt;Ebon Scales&lt;/a&gt; trapped at their creche, Emberthal sent Azurathel, &lt;a href=\"Dervishian\"&gt;Dervishian&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to provide them aid. As the group headed out to rescue their allies, Azurathel directed his allies in thinning the numbers of the &lt;a href=\"Tarasek\"&gt;Tarasek&lt;/a&gt;, who had joined the Primalists, and destroy the elementals summoned by the Primalists. With their tasks complete, the trio were able to reach the Ebon Scales, where the dracthyr united and destroyed &lt;a href=\"Ekrazathal\"&gt;Ekrazathal&lt;/a&gt;. After this, &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;, demanded answers from Azurathel who told him that they would have to wait as they had to stop the Primalists.\nThe entire dracthyr army then gathered together as one and was soon joined by &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. The dracthyr and dragons then rallied to the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent the Primalist from freeing the Raszageth, an effort they would ultimately fail at. The group was forced to flee from Raszageth's fury, rallying to the safety of the ruins of the combined &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt; and Obsidian Warders creche. It was there that they were joined by &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, who declared that the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had to be warned of Raszageth's release. Thus, Azurathel and the Obsidian Waders decided to join with Wrathion, who would guide them to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Before they departed, Azurathel requested that Sarkareth and his Ebon Scales joined them; however, Sarkareth refused, renamed his group the Sundered Flame, and declared that they would claim their destiny by right. As he watched them depart, Azurathel reflected that their anger sent them down a dark path and feared the day he would meet Sarkareth as a rival on the field of battle. As they neared &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, he was impressed with its walls and declared that it would hold strong against a formidable adversary. As the dracthyr neared the city gates, they were approached by hostile guards. However, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; soon arrived and after a brief exchange allowed the group to enter the city. He and Wrathion then presented the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; invitation to visit the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nAzurathel and Wrathion then met with &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, where Wrathion declared that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; would be pleased that the Alliance had answered the call but would insist that conflict is not brought to their shores. Azurathel reminded them that the isles were home to the dracthyr as well and not a place to plunder. He then declared their intention to accompany the Alliance on their journey, while reflecting that it would take time to build trust between them. Turalyon admitted that as a fellow soldier, he perfectly understood his wariness.\nHe directed adventurers with delivering his orders to his &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dervishian\"&gt;Dervishian&lt;/a&gt;. As Azurathel and his Obsidian Warders arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, they were joined by Emberthal, who shared that Nozdormu had revealed to her the origins of the dracthyr, how Neltharion had put them to sleep, and that they had been in stasis for nearly twenty thousand years.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nHe and &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Cindrethresh\"&gt;Scalecommander Cindrethresh&lt;/a&gt; have a \"voiced\" conversation in &lt;a href=\"Weyrnrest\"&gt;Weyrnrest&lt;/a&gt;:\nNow that the storms have passed, we've got Primalists searching the island, pirates and rivals trying to grab all they can, and rebel dracthyr trying to force us off the island.\nLook, I appreciate that everyone needs a place to sleep and food to eat, but first, we need to make sure no one's going to get killed.

She was soon approached by a group of dracthyr led by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt;, which gave her the reinforcements she needed to combat Lapisagos. Though Azurathel was uneasy at the task, due to believing that the dragons and dracthyr should fight side by side, Cindrethresh reassured him that as Lapisagos intended to destroy them, they had no other choice. After slaying their enemy, the dracthyr emerged from the ruins of their creche only to discover that their training grounds had become overgrown and realized that they'd been in stasis for a very, very, long time.\nAfter helping &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; awakened dracthyr practice their abilities, she and her allies were approached by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the &lt;a href=\"Adamant%20Vigil\"&gt;Adamant Vigil&lt;/a&gt; were no more. Determined not to lose any more of their people, Emberthal directed Cindrethresh to lead dracthyr adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Caldera%20of%20the%20Menders\"&gt;Caldera of the Menders&lt;/a&gt; in order check on, and if need be rescue on the &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wings\"&gt;Healing Wings&lt;/a&gt;. As they flew towards the area, it was revealed that Cindrethresh was rather close with &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Viridia\"&gt;Scalecommander Viridia&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their arrival they were stunned to discover wounded members of the weyrn outside and that the creche itself had been overrun with bugs and toxic fumes. The pair then rushed into the creche in order to save anyone inside, only to fall victim to the fumes themselves, and ended up being saved by Viridia. While she remained behind to look after Viridia, she directed adventurers to thinning out the &lt;a href=\"scythid\"&gt;scythid&lt;/a&gt; in the area to ensure the safety of the dracthyr. After the Healing Winds were successfully saved and restored, she remained to help while the adventurers went on ahead.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Scales\"&gt;Ebon Scales&lt;/a&gt; were rescued, the entire dracthyr army gathered together as one and were soon joined by &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. The dracthyr and dragons then rallied to the &lt;a href=\"Froststone%20Vault\"&gt;Froststone Vault&lt;/a&gt; in order to prevent the Primalist from freeing the Raszageth, an effort they would ultimately fail at. The group was forced to flee from Raszageth's fury, rallying to the safety of the ruins of the combined Dark Talons and &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Warders\"&gt;Obsidian Warders&lt;/a&gt; creche. It was there that they were joined by &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, who declared that the kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; must be warned of Raszageth's release. Thus Cindrethresh and her Dark Talons decided to join with Ebyssian, who would guide them to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Before they departed, she requested that Viridia and the Healing Wings join them, however Viridia refused and declared that she would go to the mainland of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; in order to help those in need. As they arrived to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, she was impressed by its structure but confident that it would not be able to keep them out. As they neared the city gates, they were met by hostile guards. However &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; soon arrived and diffused the situation. She then guided Ebyssian and Cindrethresh to the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, where the Ebyssian presented the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; invitation to visit the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. \nDragonflight.\nCindrethresh, Ebyssian, Mayla, and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; met together soon after, where Ebyssian explained how the isles held great wonder and many perils and that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; would not abide conflict on their shores. Cindrethresh reminded that the isles were home to the dracthyr as well and that they intended to rediscover their past and lay claim to their future. She and Dark Talons were then formally invited into the Horde, to which the dracthyr accepted.\nAfter the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, Cindrethresh declared the Dark Talons would serve as their protection detail. While she discussed the mission logistics with Ebyssian and the Horde council, she directed adventurers with delivering her orders to her &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kodethi\"&gt;Kodethi&lt;/a&gt;. As Cindrethresh and her Dark Talons arrived at the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; near the port, they were joined by Emberthal, who shared that Nozdormu had revealed to her the origins of the dracthyr, how Neltharion had put them to sleep, and that they had been in stasis for nearly twenty thousand years.\nAfter arriving to the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Coast\"&gt;Wild Coast&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;, she directed adventures with culling the numbers of the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Primal Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt; in order to ensure that the expedition couldn't be ended before it truly began. As adventures departed to carry out their tasks, &lt;a href=\"Naleidea%20Rivergleam\"&gt;Naleidea Rivergleam&lt;/a&gt; directed the group with moving towards the &lt;a href=\"Wingrest%20Embassy\"&gt;Wingrest Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in order to meet with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. As they moved forward Cindrethresh, wanting a good fight, hoped the embassy was under attack. However her hopes for a fight were dashed and when adventures returned to her, she warned them that it was \"eat or be eaten in the Dragon Isles.\"\nSometime later, Cindrethresh made the journey to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, where she reunited with &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Azurathel&lt;/a&gt;, remarked that &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;'s absence was probably a good thing as he would most likely cause an incident, and expressed her desire to find where &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Viridia\"&gt;Viridia&lt;/a&gt; went. When questioned as to how she was adapting to the world, she admitted that she loved how the Horde turned out to be a collection of undisciplined misfits and outcasts all held together with a loose desire to be better people and honor, and found her &lt;a href=\"visage\"&gt;visage&lt;/a&gt; to be magical. She further reflected that Neltharion had earned his title as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and was terrified of what he might have asked them to do had he used them in the field.\nSome time after the death of &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, Cindrethresh and her fellow dracthyr returned to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. As part of the campaign to reclaim the area, she directed adventurers with striking various enemies within the isles, while also accepting gathered information from her Horde allies.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\n He and &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Azurathel\"&gt;Scalecommander Azurathel&lt;/a&gt; have a \"voiced\" conversation in &lt;a href=\"Weyrnrest\"&gt;Weyrnrest&lt;/a&gt;:\nI'm worried about Viridia.

Because of their long slumber, they could remember little besides that Neltharion was their creator.

Afterward, she travels to the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Observatory\"&gt;Obsidian Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, a place that had been of personal importance to Neltharion. While there, she and a dracthyr adventurer uncover records of Neltharion's plans to make the dracthyr to fight the Incarnates. When Emberthal sees that Neltharion had only made them as soldiers for war, she decides that is something the dracthyr must make peace with.\nSome time afterward, Emberthal heard that the blue dragonflight was in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;, and went to investigate alongside &lt;a href=\"Telash%20Greywing\"&gt;Telash Greywing&lt;/a&gt; given the dracthyr's history with the blue dragons. There they encountered &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, who explained that he and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; were not the servants of the blue flight, but rather their friends. Khadgar was unnerved by the dracthyr saying that the blue dragons had imprisoned them, and promised to investigate. Emberthal and Telash then traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Archives\"&gt;Azure Archives&lt;/a&gt; to learn about their captivity by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;'s arcane simulacrum, they uncovered Malygos's journals detailing how Neltharion had been beside himself and insisted the dracthyr had needed to be contained. Telash did not take the information well and ran further into the archives, insisting that Sindragosa was lying, while Emberthal stayed behind to speak to her and read more from Malygos's library.\nReturn to the Forbidden Reach.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, her storms around the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; vanished, opening the way for the dracthyr and their allies to return. Scalecommander Emberthal, who viewed the isle as the closet thing to a home the dracthyr had, was determined to claim it and had the support of &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, who tried to take on an advisory role for the Scalecommander. However, it was not a smooth partnership, with Emberthal making it clear that she was not pleased with Ebyssian's decision to hide from the rest of the world and frequently criticized Ebyssian as the pair worked together, even as he attempted to diffuse matters. With &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Damos\"&gt;Talon Damos&lt;/a&gt; as her second-in-command, and accompanied by adventurers, Emberthal lead a group of dracthyr further into Reach, while Ebyssian remained behind at &lt;a href=\"Morqut%20Village\"&gt;Morqut Village&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter reaching the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Atheneum\"&gt;Lost Atheneum&lt;/a&gt;, Emberthal instructed her people to secure it, as she investigated the ruins for any information. She privately admitted to adventurers that after everything that happened, everything the dracthyr have been through, she questioned if what she sought wasn't there. Her musings were cut off after Damos' called out to her, and she rushed out to check on him only to discover that he and the others had been slain by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt;. Amidst her grief, Ebyssian arrived and revealed that the Sundered Flame had begun attacking members of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"High%20Creche\"&gt;High Creche&lt;/a&gt;. As he offered comfort to Emberthal for her loss, she lashed out at him demanding to know how many black dragons he had lost, causing Ebyssian to remark that while he had never buried his own, he did help bury generations of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. A surprised Emberthal then realized that they had both lost many who were close to them. As the duo fought against the Sundered Flame, Emberthal tasked adventurers with pushing the Sundered Flame back, though she took no pleasure in it feeling that every dead dracthyr was a tragedy that should have been avoided. In time, the group discovered the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Adamanthia\"&gt;Adamanthia&lt;/a&gt; trapped in stasis, and discovered that &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; was not only responsible but had used her as a means to imprison and draw the essence of the black dragonflight from the dracthyr during their imprisonment. Though desiring to free her from her torment, Ebyssian advised caution and declared that they should learn more before attempting to destroy her oubliette.\nAfter discovering that Sarkareth was at &lt;a href=\"Dragonskull%20Island\"&gt;Dragonskull Island&lt;/a&gt;, Emberthal and Ebyssian once more had a clash of views, before Emberthal headed off to the island alone. Upon reaching the isle, Emberthal recalled how the island was a dark place, full of pain and failure, and recalled the last time she had been present was before she was a &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander\"&gt;Scalecommander&lt;/a&gt;. She subsequently ventured into the cave determined to find Sarkareth, where she encountered the risen dead of failed Scalecommanders and memoirs of Neltharion, before discovering Sarkareth surrounded by his Sundered Flame. Despite her desire to bring justice to her fallen allies, Emberthal could not bring herself to slaughter the other dracthyr, and so Sarkareth was able to escape. In the face of Sarkareth calling Emberthal a coward, Ebyssian countered it wasn't weakness that stayed her hand, but the strength in her compassion, conviction, and loyalty to her people, which should be an inspiration to them all. He then approached Emberthal and questioned what she would do if she followed Sarkareth, causing her to remark that she would extinguish him as she had been trained to do by Neltharion. In response, he remarked that the enemy was one of her own, as were the dracthyr that followed him, and that like her they were soldiers who had been conditioned to claim victory at any cost. Outraged, Emberthal asked how Ebyssian could presume to know them after he hid amongst the mortals while other dragons fought and died to protect the world. Ebyssian then acknowledged that she was right; he had turned away from the world, and he was just content to be \"Ebonhorn\" with &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; as his home. He admitted that while he should have done more, his shame as Neltharion's offspring prevented that, and that he had come to the Forbidden Reach to face that, only to find her. When Emberthal declared he must be disappointed, he rejected the notion by pointing out that she had defied his voice inside of her, that she chose compassion over violence, and declared that their family doesn't have to live in his shadow. He then vowed that they would help one another, as he promised to aid Emberthal in ensuring that Sarkareth would face justice for all he had done. \nIn the aftermath, she instructed adventurers to work with &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Viridia\"&gt;Scalecommander Viridia&lt;/a&gt; in building Morqut Village as a safe place for the dracthyr, the tuskarr, and their allies in the Reach.\nEmbers of Neltharion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Incarnates\"&gt;Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; opened the way into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; called upon Ebyssian, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to enter and deal with &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. While Sabellian and Wrathion immediately set off to the caverns, Ebyssian detoured and recruited Scalecommander Emberthal to their mission. Unwillingly to wait for Ebyssian and Emberthal to arrive, Sabellian and Wrathion ventured forth into the caverns, where they did battle with the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, lost a skirmish against Fyrakk, and made allies of the &lt;a href=\"Loamm%20Niffen\"&gt;Loamm Niffen&lt;/a&gt;. Thus when Ebyssian and Emberthal arrived, they found a safe haven in &lt;a href=\"Loamm\"&gt;Loamm&lt;/a&gt;, with Emberthal expressing her fascination at the fact an entire world existed below them. At the same time the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that they were hearing whispers from within the caverns and Sabellian shared that he had discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; were seeking a laboratory known as &lt;a href=\"Aberrus%2C%20the%20Shadowed%20Crucible\"&gt;Aberrus, the Shadowed Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, to which Emberthal realized securing it was &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt; goal.\nWhile Sabellian on dealing with Fyrakk and Wrathion hunting out information about Aberrus, Emberthal found herself reinforced by Ebyssian as she ventured to &lt;a href=\"Nal%20ks%27kol\"&gt;Nal ks'kol&lt;/a&gt;, a titan facility in the southeastern portion of Zaralek. After the pair were able to enter the vault, they discovered Sarkareth and the Sundered Flame had not only entered before them, but that Sarkareth had claimed &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt;, the artifact &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; used to control the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;. Though Sarkareth attempted to use the artifact to enslave all his kin, he was thwarted by adventurers, and the artifact was destroyed by Emberthal. In the aftermath, an outraged Sarkareth claimed that Neltharion called to them from Aberrus, which confused both Emberthal and brought worry from Ebyssian. Though Sarkareth was able to flee, Emberthal realized that he was going to Aberrus. In the aftermath, Emberthal decided to offer &lt;a href=\"Amythora\"&gt;Amythora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marithos\"&gt;Marithos&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Sundered Flame abandoned by Sarkareth, the chance to move forward and away from the Sundered Flame. As both realized that they had been used and betrayed by Sarkareth, they accepted her offer.\nUpon returning to Loamm and seeing if Sabellian and Wrathion had discovered a means to stop Fyrakk, Emberthal, and Ebyssian instead found themselves being questioned by the pair as to what treasures they had found. Unimpressed with their content, he questioned what was truly important and who was the rightful heir to a legacy of deceit, control, and fear. When Sabellian and Wrathion grew outraged at the destruction of the Oathbinder, Ebyssian called them out on their bickering, declared that Emberthal had done right for her people, and encouraged them to let go of the past, as their flight needed them here and now.\nIn time Emberthal arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Garrison\"&gt;Brimstone Garrison&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of stopping Sarkareth, however, he was unaware that a large force of &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;drakonids&lt;/a&gt; still loyal to the memory of &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, were present in Zaralek and had bent the knee to Sarkareth. Ebyssian having discovered this, sent adventurers to aid her. Emberthal welcomed their aid and fought against Sarkareth, during the fight she acknowledged that he had a right to follow the dark whispers if he desired to but requested that he not drag their people down with him, that he let them make their own choice. However, Sarkareth was unmoved and declared that Sundered Flame were his to use as he sought fit. After being beaten, Sarkareth retreated. Knowing that the time had come to assault Aberrus Ebyssian was able to rally Sabellian and the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Brood\"&gt;Obsidian Brood&lt;/a&gt; and Wrathion and the &lt;a href=\"Blacktalon\"&gt;Blacktalons&lt;/a&gt; for the assault and united them with Emberthal. Thus the black dragonflight fought against Sarkareth's within the &lt;a href=\"Brimstone%20Garrison\"&gt;Brimstone Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, defeating them, and forcing Sarkareth to retreat within the safety of Aberrus.\nAs Sabellian and Wrathion rushed off to prevent Sarkareth from gaining control of the lab, Emberthal made the decision to remain behind, as she had grown weary of fighting her own kin and voiced her own surprise that Ebyssian didn't join them. After a moment of silence, Ebyssian admitted that he felt that the two had to face this without him and that he hoped in their pursuit they would come to see that Neltharion's legacy is death and nothing more. Thus Emberthal invited Ebyssian to join her in finding dracthyr who have yet succumbed to that fate.\nIn the aftermath of Sarkareth's death, Emberthal was given the shards of Sarkareth's signet, at the best of Ebyssian who believed that she would appreciate the gesture., In the end, Ebyssian proved correct, as Emberthal made the decision to treat Sarkareth's corpse with respect, with the hope that his memory would be a lesson, for others to not follow the illusion of Neltharion's legacy, and vowed that it was time for the dracthyr to make their own path. Ebyssian then questioned where she hoped it would lead, causing the Scalecommander to admit that she hoped to lead far from the shadows of the past that have haunted them, to make them free to build a legacy of their own, and admitted that it was Ebyssian himself who had inspired herself to believe in such a future.\nIn turn, Sabellian and Wrathion both reflected on Neltharion's legacy as both the Earth-Warder and Deathwing, and each made the decision to step down, leaving Ebyssian to be the future Aspect and leader of the black dragonflight. Upon witnessing, Emberthal remarked that Ebyssian's days of hiding were truly over, while Ebyssian was deeply humbled and vowed that their trust and faith would guide his every step.\nFractures in Time.\nAfter Emberthal and &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; decided to unbind the ancient siphons that were extracting the black dragonflight essence from dracthyr and &lt;a href=\"Adamanthia\"&gt;Adamanthia&lt;/a&gt; from her imprisonment, Emberthal called upon Dracthyr adventures to aid them. However due to her long time in stasis, she lashed out against the trio only for the fighting to cease when she came to her senses. In the aftermath, Emberthal reflected on how the Dracthyr had reclaimed the black dragon essence taken from them and freed the one dragon who decided to help them over obeying Neltharion. She further expressed her hope that Adamanthia would decide to join them after she finished healing and planned on informing her of all that she missed on Azeroth during her imprisonment.\nFury Incarnate.\nWhile locating the repatriating independent bands of &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, Emberthal learned from &lt;a href=\"Amythora\"&gt;Amythora&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Sundered%20Flame\"&gt;Sundered Flame&lt;/a&gt; lived on and had captured &lt;a href=\"Marithos\"&gt;Marithos&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Lonely%20Falls\"&gt;Lonely Falls&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;. After Marithos was rescued, Emberthal directed her allies to approach &lt;a href=\"Quartermaster%20Doros\"&gt;Quartermaster Doros&lt;/a&gt; in the hope that he would cease the conflict. However, Doros refused and fought to the death under the banner of the Sundered Flame. Knowing that the Sundered Flame were not going to take Doros' death well and knowing how Marithos and Amythora were vulnerable, Emberthal declared that the perimeter had to be secured and the Sundered Flame kept away from. However, the group was discovered by the Sundered Flame, but before a battle could commence &lt;a href=\"Winglord%20Dezran\"&gt;Winglord Dezran&lt;/a&gt; arrived and was able to convince the Sundered Flame that they needed to become the Ebon Scales once more, with Emberthal serving as their Scalecommander, a position she accepted, while retaining Dezran as Winglord. With the Ebon Scales reborn, the dracthyr returned to Valdrakken where Emberthal pledged to work to bring the dracthyr together.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI shall seek answers after I have accounted for all of the dracthyr.\nThere is so much we do not know about our past... about our future...\nI intend to change that.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Li Li possesses the same wanderlust as her uncle, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; and traveling with him to numerous locales following Chen's involvement in &lt;a href=\"The%20Founding%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;The Founding of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Li Li is a novice martial artist with a frantic fighting style which led to her nickname, Wild Dog. After the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; protecting &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; dissipated, she joined Chen in exploring the new continent, making friends with &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. She aided her uncle in the &lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt; as he discovered the remaining members of the Stormstouts.\nIn-game, she is a quest giver and a tag-along NPC for a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds%20storyline\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds storyline&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWhen Li Li was born, her uncle Chen took an immediate liking to her. Chen often spoke to Li Li of his interests in the world outside &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt;. When Li Li was young, her mother &lt;a href=\"Xiu%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Xiu Li&lt;/a&gt; died in a fishing accident and Chen had already left the island, leaving Li Li's father &lt;a href=\"Chon%20Po%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chon Po&lt;/a&gt; to watch over her and her brother &lt;a href=\"Shisai%20Stormstout\"&gt;Shisai&lt;/a&gt; on his own. Li Li would often read letters from Chen during his adventures in the outside world. Chon Po did not approve of her wanderlust.\nWhen she was a little cub, she once spilled a pot of ink on a book called Book of the Turtle. She hid the book and spent three days fearing. In the end, it was revealed what she had done and Chon Po's punishment was to write the lyrics of Song of Liu Lang a thousand times. \nLi Li and her brother Shisai were students of &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt;, the Wandering Isle's most proficient martial artist.\nWhile still very young, Li Li defeated the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20the%20Elders\"&gt;Guardian of the Elders&lt;/a&gt; for the right to visit the graves of the Wandering Isle Stormstouts in the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20of%20Staves\"&gt;Wood of Staves&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the youngest pandaren to successfully do so.\nLi Li's Travel Journal 1-4.\nBecause of her wanderlust, she began writing a travel journal where she wanted to note all her explorations. So she began with observing the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Five%20Dawns\"&gt;Temple of Five Dawns&lt;/a&gt;, asking &lt;a href=\"Master%20Xi\"&gt;Master Xi&lt;/a&gt; questions and then following of &lt;a href=\"Shu\"&gt;Shu&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Wu-Song%20Village\"&gt;Wu-Song Village&lt;/a&gt; where she lost his trail. In the village she met &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt; who advised her how to find Shu. Li Li was not successful in finding him so she returned to the Temple, where she crossed with &lt;a href=\"Lun\"&gt;Lun&lt;/a&gt;, a cart driver, who was heading to &lt;a href=\"Dai-Lo%20Farmstead\"&gt;Dai-Lo Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;.\nShe convinced him to go with him to the Farmstead. She learned from Lun that &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; stole food and farmers did nothing. Because of this, Li Li ventured to &lt;a href=\"Singing%20Pools\"&gt;Singing Pools&lt;/a&gt; to catch the monkey thieves. Near the Pools, &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; was teaching cubs and gave Li Li the evil eye. Finally, she found the thieves playing in the magic pools, so they did not notice her when she sneaked past them. She found the stolen bags but to her surprise, she found two hozen babies in it. She left them but to get revenge, she hurled a stolen pumpkin to the Hozen and fled.\nHer next stop was &lt;a href=\"Pei-Wu%20Forest\"&gt;Pei-Wu Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the forbidden area in the Isle. She returned to Mandori Village\u200e, which is the home of Stormstouts. During the next night, she ventured to the banned forest and got followed by a Pei-Wu tiger. When the tiger attacked, Strongbo appeared and rescued Li Li. She was then brought home and as a punishment, Chon Po decided that Li Li will train under Strongbo's eyes in the Singing Pools. Before attending to training, Li Li ventured to one more location - the Wood of Staves, where she met &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Shaopai\"&gt;Elder Shaopai&lt;/a&gt; who gave her a worry stone. After this, she returned home to read Chen's letters and hoped for her own adventure beyond the Isle.\nPearl of Pandaria.\nAfter Li Li ruined a &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Festival\"&gt;Spirit Festival&lt;/a&gt; performance she was participating in by sleeping behind the curtains, she got into an argument with her father Chon Po about how the pandaren of the Wandering Isle had forgotten the lessons of &lt;a href=\"Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Liu Lang&lt;/a&gt;: that life was an adventure. Chon Po ordered Li Li to never again enter the island's library, but Li Li stormed off and ran away to find her Uncle Chen.\nLi Li arrived in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, which Chen had told her about in his letters as a place where many of his adventures had begun. In the Salty Sailor Tavern, a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; privateer recognized her as a pandaren and said he hadn't seen one since he met Chen Stormstout. Li Li bought the gnome drinks if he told her the tale; he was part of a crew that attacked a ship from Stormwind that Chen happened to be on. While Chen fought them all off, the gnome stole a small box from him which he still had. Li Li demanded the gnome hand it over to her, threatening to knock out his teeth and also promising to buy him another beer. As she turned to leave with her prize, Strongbo appeared and told her to return to the Wandering Isle. Li Li, having expected him, told a pair of goblin bruisers that he took her rocket mount. As Bo fought them off, Li Li ran off into the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; on her way to Stormwind and the ship Chen was on.\nThat night, Li Li sat in a small camp near some troll ruins and opened Chen's box. Inside was a small slip of paper reading \"&lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew\"&gt;Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;\". As she was wondering what that meant, Bo appeared having found her by the light of her fire. Bo told her they were going home immediately, but Li Li convinced him to at least try some of the tea she had brewed first. Bo agreed, but after one sip he fell unconscious from something Li Li had slipped in the drink.\nThe next day found Li Li in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, picking &lt;a href=\"Silverleaf\"&gt;Silverleaf&lt;/a&gt; when Bo caught up to her. Li Li said that nothing he did would convince her to go home. As they walked through the fields, she noted the smell of sulfur and fireworks. Focusing on Bo once again, she told him that she wasn't going home and so far hadn't been hiding from him either. What if she actively avoids him next time? What would he tell Chon Po? Li Li told him he'd have to return alone and ran off into &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Bo followed, telling her he'll accompany her until she realizes what a harsh and dangerous place &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; really is and begs him to return home. As the pair made their way to Stormwind, they were watched by the goblin &lt;a href=\"Rumblefitz\"&gt;Rumblefitz&lt;/a&gt;, the source of the smell Li Li had noticed earlier, and his ogre partner &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, Li Li was reading up on the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Bo made a joke that perhaps the Light could shine on Thunderbrew so they could leave, catching the attention of a nearby priest. He told them of the Thunderbrew ale and &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;, which was currently going on. While waiting for the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;, Li Li asked Bo why he was always so grumpy, especially whenever she talks about Chen. Bo told her that he and Chen used to be friends, but didn't continue on the subject. As they boarded the tram, Li Li smelled the same scent from earlier, the scent of sulfur and \"the stuff Granny &lt;a href=\"Mei\"&gt;Mei&lt;/a&gt; drinks to help her sleep.\" This time, Bo smelled it as well.\nOn the tram, Li Li was preoccupied by how fast they were going, though Bo was paying more attention to the scent. He found the source was Rumblefitz, and realized the goblin had been following them all day. Rumblefitz tossed a potion which caused an explosion, sending passengers flying and knocking Bo onto the car behind them. Li Li fought off Rumblefitz, knocking him off the car and onto the tracks. However, Bo told her they should have questioned him. Li Li wanted to know why it matters what he wanted, and Bo said this was just another reason the world was dangerous.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, Bo complained about how the carved out city was harming the earth elementals in the area. Li Li told him how the dwarves evolved from the &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;Earthen&lt;/a&gt;, created specifically to dig out the crust of Azeroth. Bo replied that the earth was in distress, and he could feel the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;pressure&lt;/a&gt; building. Li Li replied that that didn't mean it was the fault of the dwarves. The subject turned more lighthearted as the two of them found a group heading out to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; for Brewfest. Li Li decided that dwarves were suddenly her favorite people.\nAt Brewfest, the two of them ran into &lt;a href=\"Daran%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Daran Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt;, who was shocked at seeing pandaren and thought they were figments of his grandfather Grimbooze's imagination. He told them the story of how &lt;a href=\"Grimbooze%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Grimbooze Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt; and Chen once had a drinking contest that would be recognized as the original Brewfest. Daran told them that after that day, Chen had moved on to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; to find hops for his brews. The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; attacked Brewfest then as they always do, and Bo and Li Li aided in the defense of the kegs. Afterward, Daran gave Li Li her uncle's &lt;a href=\"Jug%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Cups\"&gt;Jug of a Thousand Cups&lt;/a&gt;, a magical drinking vessel capable of holding an endless amount of brew. &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; himself appeared then, saying that Chen helped him during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and any friend of Chen's was a friend of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Li Li requested transportation from Magni, and he provided them with a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; and two &lt;a href=\"ram\"&gt;ram&lt;/a&gt; mounts.\nLi Li wrote a letter to her father and sent it to the Wandering Isle as a magic-powered origami crane. As Li Li continued to want to know Bo's history with Chen, he told her the story; how Chen and Bo were great friends fated to duel to decide who was Geomaster, and Chen left the island the day of their fight. Li Li thought it was a stupid reason for Bo to hate her uncle. Their zeppelin flew over &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and Li Li told Bo a very brief summary of the story of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe goblin pilot told them that because of &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Co.\"&gt;Venture Co.&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Crag\"&gt;Windshear Crag&lt;/a&gt; was cleared out and therefore a nice open spot for them to land. Bo asked for an explanation, and upon finding out that they dealt in natural resources he declared goblins parasites and a disease. Having landed in Stonetalon, Bo used his shamanistic powers to communicate with the earth spirits and find a hidden valley in the north where the plants Chen had looked for grew. Li Li decided to have a race, and Bo's ram grew excited at the prospect, storming off at an incredible speed.\nHowever, the valley was seemingly empty, despite Bo sensing the plant there. &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20Orremin\"&gt;Keeper Orremin&lt;/a&gt;, along with two &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, appeared and declared that nature's gifts were elusive. Orremin told the two of them of his meeting with Chen, working with him to fight off goblins from the valley though in the process the rare &lt;a href=\"indellium\"&gt;indellium&lt;/a&gt; plants were largely destroyed. Orremin removed the illusion on the valley, revealing the hops and offering some to Bo and Li Li as friends of Chen. Orremin pointed them to &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; next, saying Chen was going there to reflect on the past.\nOn the road again, Li Li brewed the plants into a beer which she declared her very best work. Bo declined her offer, stating he doesn't drink, and so she saved a large amount in the Jug of a Thousand Cups to give Chen later. The two soon came across the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, where Li Li recounted a legend that once the ancient pandaren delivered a gift to the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; said to contain all the arcane magic the night elves would ever need. Li Li believed it could be found in Eldarath, but inside the temple, the pandaren-made chest she found was empty. Bo commented that that \"was\" the message the pandaren left the elves, all the arcane magic they would ever need... nothing. They didn't need arcane magic. He wondered what Li Li had been expecting, and she had hoped for a clue from her uncle.\nBo asked if she had seen enough by now, but Li Li was determined. She was hoping to find some clue to find Chen, but Bo got angry then, declaring their entire journey a waste of time. Li Li yelled at him that this entire journey he had been pessimistic despite all she tried to show him, all because Chen left him in a duel years ago that she was confident Bo would have lost anyway. Bo told Li Li that all Chen cared about was beer and his travels, not his friends or family, and Li Li ran out of the temple.\nIt was raining in Azshara now as Li Li begged Chen to come back. Someone called out her name, and a hopeful Li Li looked for her uncle - only to be kidnapped by the fel orc &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt;. She awoke on an unnamed island, and the naga &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; was demanding she reveal the location of &lt;a href=\"Wanyo\"&gt;Wanyo&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria%20%28item%29\"&gt;pearl&lt;/a&gt; he had. Li Li hadn't seen Wanyo since he went missing years ago, but Zhahara was convinced she knew where to find him. Li Li's magic was suppressed by one of Rumblefitz's potions, and she was helpless as Rahjak chained her up and left her with Blokk, giving her a telescope so she could see Bo die once he arrives to save her. Rahjak told Li Li she could stop the fight at any moment if only she revealed where Wanyo was. Li Li made a bet with Blokk, challenging him that the ogre couldn't drink her entire bottle of brew from Stonetalon. Unaware that the bottle was the endless Jug of a Thousand Cups, Blokk took up her challenge, as he began deciding it was the best drink he ever had.\nBo arrived at sunrise, fighting Rahjak to free Li Li. After they had fought for some time, Blokk finished off Li Li's brew and fell unconscious from all the alcohol he had consumed. Li Li stole the keys from him, running off to reach Bo. Rumblefitz tossed a potion at her, but Li Li reflected it back with her staff. The bottle shattered and the potion froze Rumblefitz into a statue. Zhahara caught Li Li again, demanding to find the pearl and when she once again said she didn't know where it was, Zhahara told her they'd watch Bo die together. However, at that moment a &lt;a href=\"X-53%20Touring%20Rocket\"&gt;X-53 Touring Rocket&lt;/a&gt; streaked across the sky, and Chen Stormstout arrived on the island.\nChen took over the fight from Bo after he had been mortally wounded, and Li Li gave her uncle an opening when she smashed one of Rumblefitz's potions in Zhahara's face. Chen took the moment to steal Rahjak's sword, tossing it into the naga and piercing her torso. Bo then got the finishing kill on Rahjak, stabbing him from behind with a broken fragment of his staff. Bo told Chen to take Li Li home, since he was dying and could not do it himself. Li Li began to cry and told Bo he was coming with them, but Bo said that she can't always have what she wants. Li Li said this was all her fault, if she had never left Bo would have never died. As Bo passed away watching the sunset, Li Li and Chen returned to the Wandering Isle on her uncle's rocket.\nChon Po was happy to see his daughter rather than angry that she had gone, and she told him about how Zhahara was looking for the missing Wanyo. Li Li asked her uncle if some day they would go and find &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Chen decided that would be a great adventure, but for now, he was just happy to be home.\nQuest for Pandaria.\nPart 1.\nOn the Wandering Isle, Li Li is found along with her uncle Chen telling stories to the cubs on the turtle, something that her father disapproved of greatly. The children preferred to listen to Chen's stories rather than hers which she repeated constantly. That night, Chen was invited over to have dinner with Chon Po's family. All was calm until Chen's adventures came up and an argument aroused between the two brothers. Chon Po spoke about how it was safe to remain here and Chen spoke about how there was nothing wrong in wanting to be an adventurer. They talked about Xiu Li Stormstout's death and how they were also dangers found on the very island, like the disappearance of Wanyo. They talked about Bo's death, which upset Li Li when her father stated that he'd be alive if he hadn't left. Chon Po also spoke with Chen outside of his fear that his daughter would have missed her brother's wedding, although Chen realized that Chon Po was actually verbalizing his frustration with Chen.\nAfter a night of torment, she got up and left for the Wood of Staves. The Guardian of the Elders let her pass since she defeated him long ago. Li Li approached the Stormstout shrine and knelt in front of it, telling her mother how much she missed her as she placed a small bouquet across the altar. She expressed how she couldn't stay on the island forever and wanted to leave at all costs. As she paid her final respects, she walked to the Strongbo's family shrine. She wished she could bring him back to life or tried to avoid what had happened. After leaving the wood in the early morning she went to see Chen in the small cottage he had settled into and told him about possibly having adventures together. Chen at first turned her down, saying that this home on the Wandering Isle was more of an adventure to him because he never had a home of his own.\nLeaving her uncle to wander, she returned to the Wood of Staves to sit on the edge of Shen-zin Su's shell and told him of how king Magni showed her around Ironforge. Then suddenly the turtle beneath her shifted violently and threw her onto her side. The reason was that Shen-zin Su had begun a coughing fit and pushed Wanyo out. The two of them returned back home and the elders had a meeting with him at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Five%20Dawns\"&gt;Temple of Five Dawns&lt;/a&gt;, which Li Li eavesdropped on. Wanyo told those gathered about the mystical artifact he'd gotten, which Chen observed to be a giant pearl. It had shown him where there were great fishing spots in the turtle. The night he disappeared, a dying murloc caught in his net had given it to him, and when Zhahara attacked immediately after, a large fish towed his boat to safety in front of Shen-zin Su, who swallowed the junk whole. That day, the pearl had instead shown him returning to town, so he had gotten ready to be coughed out. In the end, it was decided that until they could figure out what the pearl really was, it would be kept in the Great Library.\nThat very night, she quietly left the house and went to the library to see the pearl for herself. Holding it in her paws, she asked it what it would show her. It showed her a vision of Pandaria under the mists, and when she realized what it was, the vision ended. Recognizing it was her destiny to rediscover Pandaria, she took the pearl with her to be her guide. She returned home to pack for traveling and before she left, she wrote a letter for her father and uncle to find. Summoning her crane with her crane whistle, she took off for Dun Morogh.\nPart 2.\nLi Li made her way to Ironforge, but she couldn't have an audience with the king because he became a diamond. She didn't believe &lt;a href=\"Muradin\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; at first and &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; was angered by the fact that she was calling them liars. In the end, she left because she saw they were of no help. Li Li later went to the &lt;a href=\"Stonefire%20Tavern\"&gt;Stonefire Tavern&lt;/a&gt; where she was startled by her uncle's appearance. She told him about the pearl and the vision.\nLi Li look through the pearl and saw a &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Ramshackle wooden jetties and houses were arranged in a U shape around the bay&lt;/a&gt;. Chen and Li Li took the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; south to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. With the , Li Li barely knew of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; but Chen did. \nAfter reaching Booty Bay the two became acquainted with &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Catelyn the Blade&lt;/a&gt;, where she and Li Li bounded over difficulties with their respective fathers. However, it didn't long for the pandaren to realize that Catelyn had stolen the Pearl of Pandaria. After confronting Catelyn and her crew a fight broke out between the forces before the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; made both parties enter to an alliance against the pirates and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Koslov\"&gt;Captain Koslov&lt;/a&gt;. While losing reinforcements would come in the form of Catelyn's father &lt;a href=\"Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt;, who brought other mages of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; with him.\nWith the pirates soundly beaten and Koslov fleeing the battlefield, Chen, Li Li, and Catelyn thanked her father for saving them. After mending her relationship with her father, Catelyn returned the pearl to the pandaren. Furthermore, as a thanks for aiding them against the Bloodsails Catelyn offered to bring them to &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;, an offer that the two pandaren accepted.\nPart 3.\nAfter landing in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; the pair made their way towards &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;. After arriving in the city the pair noticed &lt;a href=\"King%20Phaoris\"&gt;King Phaoris&lt;/a&gt; reading charges against prisoners, survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset tribe&lt;/a&gt;, and declaring that sentencing would be passed after the High Council had finished discussing it. During this time the two learned about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Felyae\"&gt;Felyae&lt;/a&gt;, who also witnessed the event.\nThe pair would later overhead &lt;a href=\"Menrim\"&gt;Menrim&lt;/a&gt; pleading for the lives of the Neferset prisoners to be spared. As Menrim departed from the King and High Council Chen quietly commended him for having the courage to advocate mercy towards who wronged the tol'vir. In response, Menrim thanked him and then offered to host the pandaren, while they remained in the city. As they dined with Menrim he revealed that he once belonged to the Neferset tribe told of them how the other Neferset threw their lot in with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; in order to remove the Curse of Flesh. He also informed that his own brother, &lt;a href=\"Bathet\"&gt;Bathet&lt;/a&gt;, is one of the prisoners at Ramkahen.\nLi Li would later learn that her uncle had visited Bathet in prisoner in order in order to see what could drive somebody to make the choice that the tol'vir did. While talking with Li Li Chen learned that Menrim worked with priests to maintain the titan devices and thus barely saw Bathet. As such Li Li theorized that Bathet came to resent his brother and ultimately joined Deathwing in order to have a place to belong too. Hearing this, Chen decided to come clean to Menrim about visiting his brother and suggested that he apologize in order to make for any negative fillings Bathet may hold towards him. \nLater on, the pandaren witnessed the sentencing of the Neferset prisoners, where King Phaoris allowed them the chance to speak in order for the citizens of Ramkahen to understand why King and Council came to their decision on their sentence. Chen was struck by how Bathet regretted nothing and voiced that he was with his true brothers and both pandaren left to find Menrim once the death penalty was announced. However, after meeting Menrim exploded on Chen for having the gall to demand that he apologize to someone who should be thanking him for trying to save his life.\nAfter witnessed of the prisoners both Pandaren desired to leave the city, with Li Li wondering why the Pearl would even direct them to the place. However, the pair were stopped by Menrim where the tol'vir apologized for exploding at Chen and explained that he tried to apologize to Bathet but his brother just blamed him and that he himself became so angry in turn. As they talked Menrim eventually began weeping why wondering how everything had come to this.\nMenrim then talked the pandaren for trying to help and gave them his family boat, as he wished them luck in finding what they sought. In turn, Chen wished him peace and both pandaren later began to write a letter home after everything they have witnessed.\nPart 4.\nWhile traveling to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; a storm forced Li Li over the boat and separated her from her uncle. Luckily she soon rescued by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and came into the care of the druid &lt;a href=\"Lintharel\"&gt;Lintharel&lt;/a&gt;. Li Li was surprised to learn that a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; ship was nearby when informed as such by the ship's captain &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Heller\"&gt;Marco Heller&lt;/a&gt;, who was trying to determine if she was Horde spy or simply unlucky. Li Li was able to convince the captain that she wasn't a spy and captain consented to let her remain on board but warned she might have to fight if came down to it.\nOnce she felt well enough to walk around, Li Li preceded to ask anyone if they had seen the tol'vir boat and became dejected when she learned no one had. She also grew concerned about why the Horde and Alliance were present off the coast of Tanaris, in neutral waters. During this time she also began to bond with members of the crew like, Lintharel, &lt;a href=\"Atropa\"&gt;Atropa&lt;/a&gt; and the dwarven siblings &lt;a href=\"Trialin\"&gt;Trialin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baenan\"&gt;Baenan&lt;/a&gt;. While playing poking she learned that recent events had made the Alliance concerned about Horde presence outside of their territory, with Baenan remarking that the Horde was too close to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. \nLi Li later learned that both captains had agreed to send a diplomat to each vessel, to which Baenan offered his services and Captain Heller agreed. Li Li then requested if the \"&lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Warchief's Fist&lt;/a&gt;\" had mentioned anything about another pandaren, but Heller replied that they had not but she was free to ask the Horde diplomat if they had. However Li Li didn't have to ask for as soon as &lt;a href=\"Nita\"&gt;Nita&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde diplomat, saw her she became quickly certain that Chen had been picked up by the Horde. However, as they passed her on the way to have a secure place to talk for negotiations, Li Li noticed the captain sent her an unkind glare.\nLi Li witnessed that Nita was in chains as Captain Heller announced that the tauren had attacked him and his officers when in truth he had taken her prisoner because he wanted to ensure that the Horde leave for &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. When learning that the Horde was demanding their surrender and that not complying would see Baenan die, Heller declared that if Baenan's life was forfeit then so too was Nita's. A confrontation erupted as Lintharel spoke in Nita's defense. With Li Li and Trialin aiding Lintharel, Nita was freed. Yet Heller was able to take advantage of the \"Warchief's Fist\" exploding to ram his sword through Lintharel, but found himself killed by Atropa before he could deal the death blow.\nSoon after the \"Elwynn\" sank into the sea with Baenan, Trialin, Lintharel, Atropa, and Nita moving towards land and Chen and Li Li returning on their quest to reach Pandaria. While at sea Li Li would receive a letter from her father expressing how proud he was of her and that he loved her- which ended in Li Li expressing a wish to be &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;. However their quest came to an end when the pandaren finally landed on Pandaria and while Li Li was excited all their friends could now come with them since the mists had departed, Chen quickly realized that \"everyone\" could now come to the continent.\nLi Li's Travel Journal 5.\nAfter landing in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the Chen and Li Li wandered through the forest and stumbled upon the saurok who were terrorizing the region around the Serpent's Heart. After arriving to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Jade%20Serpent\"&gt;Temple of the Jade Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Sage%20Rain-Zhu\"&gt;Elder Sage Rain-Zhu&lt;/a&gt; gave them a tour around the temple's areas for helping to fend off the saurok and returning stolen jade that was being used for &lt;a href=\"Yu%27lon\"&gt;Yu'lon&lt;/a&gt;'s statue. Before leaving, Li Li gave him the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria%20%28item%29\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and she rode on a cloud serpent for a while. For three weeks the two were wandering in the forests before entering the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLi Li accompanies her uncle &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; to Pandaria. Though she complains how Chen's easy-going nature slows them down, Li Li is always eager to lend Chen a hand in his tasks and her curious nature causes her to explore on her own while Chen is away. When the Temple of the Jade Serpent was attacked by saurok. Chen, alongside Li Li, arrived to the temple and helped the local pandaren by driving back enemy &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt;'s forces, defeating their leader and returning stolen jade. All Chen asked in return was a serpent ride for Li Li. After these events, they moved on to the Valley of the Four Winds.\nChen is particularly involved in the beginning quests of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, where he is visiting Pandaria for the first time with his niece, Li Li, his distant family's brewery, &lt;a href=\"Stormstout%20Brewery\"&gt;Stormstout Brewery&lt;/a&gt; as well as the dungeon encompassing the building. Other than exploring Pandaria, Chen's goal appears to be to reestablish contact with the Pandaria Stormstout branch, having been separated when &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; stopped returning to the mainland. As he and Li Li are visiting farms in the valley they met a pandaren called &lt;a href=\"Mudmug\"&gt;Mudmug&lt;/a&gt;, from whom they learned about the Stormstout Brewery. Chen visits the brewery but found &lt;a href=\"Uncle%20Gao\"&gt;Uncle Gao&lt;/a&gt; who seems to be jealous of Stormstouts. After having defeated the enemies in the brewery, Chen returned to Li Li and Mudmug and set out to &lt;a href=\"Halfhill\"&gt;Halfhill&lt;/a&gt;, from where the trio and an adventurer created a new ale. After this, Chen declared Mudmug to be his \"beer brother\" and headed towards the Stormstout Brewery. However, the brewery was filled by alementals and &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;. After clearing the entrance, Chen himself headed into the brewery.\nAt the very conclusion of the Valley of the Four Winds storyline, the Shado-Pan face the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Mantid\"&gt;Mantid&lt;/a&gt; who break through the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;. When all hope seemed lost, it was Chen Stormstout who saved the day. Chen was instrumental in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Stoneplow\"&gt;Stoneplow&lt;/a&gt; village. Alongside Mudmug and his niece Li Li, Chen had successfully rallied not only the scattered pandaren population of the Valley of the Four Winds, but also managed to unite, albeit temporarily, a group of Night Elf Sentinel Castaways with a cadre of Tauren Sunwalkers to cooperate and work together to defend Stoneplow Village from the invasion of the Mantid. This marked the first time Alliance and Horde forces had fought together side by side for a common cause since the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. \nChen and Li Li are also present during the &lt;a href=\"Wanderer%27s%20Festival\"&gt;Wanderer's Festival&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Beach\"&gt;Turtle Beach&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; after Li Li found its location during one of her adventures.\nLi Li can be seen paying her respects at the grave of &lt;a href=\"Evie%20Stormstout\"&gt;Evie Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; along with Chen, &lt;a href=\"Big%20Dan%20Stormstout\"&gt;Big Dan Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mama%20Stormstout\"&gt;Mama Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Han%20Stormstout\"&gt;Han Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;.\nLi Li's Travel Journal 6 - 11.\nAfter clearing the mess in the brewery, Gao informed Chen and Li Li about other Stormstouts who had gone to fight the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; behind the Great Wall. He also showed them the shrines of &lt;a href=\"Mab%20Stormstout\"&gt;Mab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liao%20Stormstout\"&gt;Liao&lt;/a&gt; behind the brewery and told them about &lt;a href=\"Stoneplow\"&gt;Stoneplow&lt;/a&gt;, the birthplace of Liu Lang. After repelling the mantid invasion, Chen and Gao spent some time brewing new ales and Li Li used it to go to explore &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; where she wanted to find the spot where Liu Lang had set off from atop Shen-zin Su. After days, she crossed path with an angler &lt;a href=\"Ryshan\"&gt;Ryshan&lt;/a&gt; who told her that the place is near the &lt;a href=\"Anglers%20Wharf\"&gt;Anglers Wharf&lt;/a&gt;. He took Li Li to the village by a boat and they were accompanied by a &lt;a href=\"bandicoon\"&gt;bandicoon&lt;/a&gt; that Li Li named after her brother Shisai. The anglers wanted to impress Li Li and told her about the best fishing stories. She also learned about the Celestial &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;. The next day, &lt;a href=\"Shin%20Whispercloud\"&gt;Shin Whispercloud&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the village to collect fishes. Li Li learned from him about the &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; and immediately wanted to visit the mountainous place. Knowing where to look for the leaving spot of Liu Lang, she helped to load fishes up and hopped on Shin's balloon with &lt;a href=\"Shisai%20%28bandicoon%29\"&gt;Shisai&lt;/a&gt; in her bag.\nWhile in Kun-Lai, she wished she could speak with the jinyu, but she could not because of a bad situation on the ground. Shin noticed the changes of Shisai's behavior, and he explained that it is because of the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Sha of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;. Shin directed the balloon to the house of his pal, &lt;a href=\"Courageous%20Yon\"&gt;Courageous Yon&lt;/a&gt; who tamed her pet. After this the two noticed that the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20August%20Celestials\"&gt;Gate of the August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; is now open. After she entered the vale, she joined to &lt;a href=\"Buwei\"&gt;Buwei&lt;/a&gt; and his son &lt;a href=\"Little%20Fu\"&gt;Little Fu&lt;/a&gt; who lost their home because of a yaungol attack and now were heading to &lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;Mistfall Village&lt;/a&gt;. Li Li noticed that Shisai cheered them up and after they got to the village, she left her pet with Fu and she continued to explore the vale, however, she was soon found by &lt;a href=\"Messenger%20Fishtail%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Messenger Fishtail\u200e&lt;/a&gt; whom Chen Stormstout had sent to bring her to the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Shado-pan monk &lt;a href=\"Min\"&gt;Min&lt;/a&gt; escorted her through the wall only to be attacked by mantid in the place where they were supposed to meet Chen. Min commanded her to climb down from the wall. Li Li did so but could not return because one of the mantid slashed the rope. She resolved to go to Dread Wastes and find her uncle there. While there, she felt fear but kept finding &lt;a href=\"Sunset%20Brewgarden\"&gt;Sunset Brewgarden&lt;/a&gt;. At long last, she found the village and her uncle with rest of the Stormstouts inside.\nShadows of the Horde.\nWhile Chen had largely settled into life on Pandaria, splitting time between helping the &lt;a href=\"Chiang%20sisters\"&gt;Chiang sisters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Binan%20Village\"&gt;Binan Village&lt;/a&gt; or working at the Stormstout Brewery, Li Li largely desired to continue her own adventures across the continent. One day while training the cubs at Binan Village on how to fight, &lt;a href=\"Keng-na\"&gt;Keng-na&lt;/a&gt;, one of her students, screamed in terror at finding &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; at the river bank and rushed off to inform Chen of his discovery. While Chen spent his time at the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, Li Li decided to continue her adventure by traveling to &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt;. In route to her destination, she encountered the &lt;a href=\"Stoneraker%20brothers\"&gt;Stoneraker brothers&lt;/a&gt; and helped them with their &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving them after being unimpressed with them offering her kisses as a reward.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s came to attack the village, Li Li reluctantly helped protect the villagers while serving under the command of her uncle Chen, who had arrived at the village earlier with &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt;, despite wishing to stay and fight the Zandalari. She was sent with the village's refugees to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. Then, as both Chen and Yalia made their way towards the Shado-Pan Monastery, Li Li was sent to the Stormstout Brewery along with several pandaren.\nShe had come to be known as the \"Wild Dog\" to the residents of Kun-Lai Summit during these events.\nTimeless Isle.\nLi Li can be found overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Court\"&gt;Celestial Court&lt;/a&gt; with Chen on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nLi Li is with her uncle Chen at the &lt;a href=\"Peak%20of%20Serenity\"&gt;Peak of Serenity&lt;/a&gt;, the monastery of the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attacks. She and Chen help the children that Chen was teaching flee to safety. After the Peak is destroyed, Li Li returns with Chen and the survivors to the Wandering Isle, where the surviving Masters form the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, when the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;new Grand Master&lt;/a&gt; of the Order chooses to pursue the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of handblades crafted by the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; weaponsmith &lt;a href=\"Irmaat\"&gt;Irmaat&lt;/a&gt;, as the weapons to wield against the Legion, Li Li assists the Grand Master by revealing that she had heard a story from a &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; about the legend of Irmaat.\nLi Li accompanies the Grand Master to &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, where they have an audience with &lt;a href=\"King%20Phaoris\"&gt;King Phaoris&lt;/a&gt;. Phaoris directs the Grand Master to a rogue elemental called &lt;a href=\"Nader\"&gt;Nader&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahmtul\"&gt;Ruins of Ahmtul&lt;/a&gt;, Irmaat's home city, which had been buried under the sand when &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; overloaded the Fists with raw elemental energies. The Grand Master claims an elemental stone from Nader's remains, powerful enough to take the bearer into &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; itself. The Grand Master and Li Li use the stone to enter Skywall, where they battle the &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Typhinius\"&gt;Typhinius&lt;/a&gt; in order to claim the Fists, before returning to the Wandering Isle.\nChen and Li Li later enter a competition held by &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; to gain &lt;a href=\"The%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;The Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;. They battle &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer of the Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; for it. However the pair are defeated and the Farseer would go on to claim The Fist of Ra-den.\nLi Li participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;, along with her &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;uncle Chen&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nUpon hearing word that &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s set their sights on the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, Chen and his niece Li Li were among those who came to defend the Vale. To their shock, they discovered that the mogu had overtaken the plains of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. Chen deduced that the mogu saw the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Lotus\"&gt;Golden Lotus&lt;/a&gt;'s focus on &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; as a perfect time to strike the Vale. Thus seeking to stop them, Chen, Li Li, and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Azeroth's champion&lt;/a&gt; mounted &lt;a href=\"Chen%27s%20Kite\"&gt;Chen's Kite&lt;/a&gt; in order to scout their numbers. However, during their mission, the three came under fire and were forced to the ground, and Chen was injured and the kite reduced to a big ball of flames. With his head hurting from his injuries, Chen declared that the only solution would be for his allies to bring the abandoned brew caravan and save the brew. Chen was confident that not only would this bring him back to full strength, but it would do wonder for the morale of those fighting in the Vale. To that end, the &lt;a href=\"yak\"&gt;yak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mobi\"&gt;Mobi&lt;/a&gt; was rescued from the mogu who had conquered the &lt;a href=\"Chow%20Farmstead\"&gt;Chow Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; and used to deliver the brew to Chen.\nWhile Chen focused on the brew, Li Li called upon her allies to strike against the mogu in the hopes of thinning out their numbers to make their escape easier. As apart of this, she also tasked them with taking out the mogu commanders in the hopes that it would slow down and distract the mogu armies. With the mogu thinned, Chen, Li Li, and the Azeroth's champion used the yak to head back to the safety of the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20August%20Celestials\"&gt;Gate of the August Celestials&lt;/a&gt;. Determined to further thin the mogu ranks before they invaded the Vale, Li Li used the brew as a weapon against them, much to her uncle's melancholy. Deciding to look on the bright side, Chen happily noted that they were fewer mogu to contend with. Knowing that they did all they could, the group headed off to &lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;Mistfall Village&lt;/a&gt; in order to inform the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt; of what they were up against.\nIn the aftermath, the Stormstouts came to reside in Mistfall Village where they appear to be aiding &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of the vale.\nQuests.\nLi Li is to be following Chen Stormstout around at the beginning of adventurers' trips in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, generally annoyed at his slow pace.\nDevelopment.\nThe character of Li Li was created during the development of the graphic novel \"&lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", which was originally conceived long before \"\" and was originally meant to serve as a travel guide to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and a way to explore pandaren culture. Li Li specifically originated from a brainstorming session between &lt;a href=\"Micky%20Neilson\"&gt;Micky Neilson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Samwise%20Didier\"&gt;Samwise Didier&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;, who together came up with the idea of an optimistic young pandaren who would serve as the channel that the book's readers see the world through. Li Li being a child created a very different viewpoint, and her lack of biases and prejudices ended up tying into one of the book's central themes of tolerance and acceptance for other cultures and beliefs. Li Li's character developed from there, and was later picked up by &lt;a href=\"Team%202\"&gt;Team 2&lt;/a&gt; when plans were made to create a \"World of Warcraft\" expansion featuring &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeilson discussed some details about the development of Li Li during an interview with &lt;a href=\"Blizzplanet\"&gt;Blizzplanet&lt;/a&gt;:\nAge.\nDuring the development of \"Pearl of Pandaria\", Micky Neilson imagined Li Li as being around the age of a tween (10-12 years old). He modeled some of her behavior and dialogue after his own daughter (who was at the time 9 years old) and admitted that she may come across as slightly younger in the book as a result.\nLater, Neilson and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Stackpole\"&gt;Mike Stackpole&lt;/a&gt; added:\n&lt;a href=\"Canon\"&gt;Canon&lt;/a&gt;ically, Li Li was around 10 or 12 years old during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, making her around 23-25 in .\nQuotes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSome days I feel like I could take on an entire army. But three armies at once?\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Once, his dad told him he could go to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; as soon as he separates good and bad potatoes. Instead he went out with his friends. Heading to Stormwind they decided to go fishing.\nWhile fishing along the shore with his two friends &lt;a href=\"Jimmy%20Blackridge\"&gt;Jimmy Blackridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bram%20Woodring\"&gt;Bram Woodring&lt;/a&gt;, he and his friends were abducted and found themselves unwilling crew members for the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;.

He was killed by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas%23Battle%20of%20Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Battle for&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLord of His Pack.\nAs a teenager, Liam often disagreed with his father and had quarrels with him, particularly over seceding from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and constructing the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; began to overtake &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, causing the nation to plead for aid from Gilneas, Liam rebuked his father for not sending any help to their fellow kingdom. A slightly drunken Genn \u2014 furious that his own son would question him \u2014 threw his goblet of wine across the floor, insisted that the wall would protect Gilneas from the undead, and stated that he would not risk the lives of any Gilneans by sending them to fight the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, just as his &lt;a href=\"Archibald%20Greymane\"&gt;own father&lt;/a&gt; wouldn't have. Liam accused Genn of always trying to emulate his father and that there were other ways to consider, but Genn replied that it was a prince's duty to strive to be like his father. Liam retorted that he thought it was a prince's duty to one day be a great king. The prince then took his leave, knowing that the argument was lost.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; began, Liam watched alongside Genn, Archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, and a guard captain from atop the Greymane Wall as a massive sea of the Scourge assaulted it in waves. Liam told his father that he should have listened to him. Genn \u2014 angered that his son would question him again, this time in public while he was trying to instill courage in the wall's defenders \u2014 brusquely told his son that now was not the time.\nThe Fall of Gilneas.\nYears later, when the invading &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; began to beset the Greymane Wall, Liam was ordered by his father to oversee the defenses of the wall. Yet with the swelling ranks of the Forsaken and the recent &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; invasion of Gilneas City, he was presumably forced to abandon his post and was ordered to secure &lt;a href=\"Merchant%20Square\"&gt;Merchant Square&lt;/a&gt;, which he helped defend with the aid of a Gilnean &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. After the squares were lost to the worgen, Liam met with his father and the former rebel &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Court\"&gt;Greymane Court&lt;/a&gt;. Darius told Genn that some would have to remain behind to distract the worgen in order to allow the rest of the Gilneans to evacuate from the city. Liam wished to stay behind with the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; and protect the city, but Crowley retorted that it would be better for Liam to accompany Genn, since they couldn't afford to have the king wondering if his son was alive or not.\nShortly after Darius decided to stay behind in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Dawn%20Cathedral\"&gt;Light's Dawn Cathedral&lt;/a&gt; and make a last stand against the worgen, Darius' daughter &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; met with Genn and Liam. She had received word that her father was free, but Liam told her about the choice Darius made. Lorna pulled out her gun and took aim at Genn, cursing at him and believing this was his idea of revenge after the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20Rebellion\"&gt;Northgate Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. Liam restrained her, and a hysterical Lorna demanded she be let go to die with her father before she began to cry in Liam's arms.\nLiam and his father escaped with the other Gilnean refugees to the village of &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;. With all that had transpired, Gilneas was now faced with a terrible truth: their mighty wall could not hold back the dead much longer. Despite all that happened, Liam still believed in his father, despite Genn's doubts. Liam believed Genn could be a great leader once again if he could only regain his confidence in himself. Liam later observed the effects of &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;' elixir on the worgen.\nLiam started drinking to drown his regrets of being unable to prevent the loss of Gilneas City, but when the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, he and his men fought back. Liam was overjoyed to reunite the adventurer from Gilneas City, even though the hero had now been transformed into a worgen. While Liam was heading towards the main Forsaken army, the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; occurred and drowned the land near Duskhaven. Liam assisted in rescuing drowning Gilnean soldiers and helped evacuate the village. He then traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormglen%20Village\"&gt;Stormglen&lt;/a&gt; with the other evacuees, but along the way his stagecoach was attacked by &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. With the help of the adventurer, Liam rescued crash survivors from the &lt;a href=\"Hailwood%20Marsh\"&gt;nearby marsh&lt;/a&gt; and dealt with the ogres by tricking their leader, the &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Koroth%20the%20Hillbreaker\"&gt;Koroth the Hillbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, into attacking the Forsaken.\nSome days later, Genn told his son the truth about how the curse spread and revealed to him that he was bitten. Liam was fine with the revelations, leading to a reconciliation between him and his father.\nAfter the Gilneans united due to the efforts of his father and &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, Liam sobered up and prepared to lead a counter attack against the Forsaken invaders. After holding a passionate speech, he lead his men in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Battle of Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, helping to reclaim the city's districts before meeting up with his father and Lord Crowley to confront the Forsaken's leader, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. During the ensuing battle, Liam was killed by Sylvanas when he took a poisoned arrow intended for Genn. He died in his father's arms, secure in the knowledge that the city had been retaken. After the battle, the Gilneans learned that Sylvanas was planning to loose the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt; on Gilneas, leaving Genn with the choice of pursuing vengeance by striking at the Banshee Queen or evacuating his people. As much as he wished to exact vengeance, the king felt he had to honor his son's memory and thus traveled to the holy burial ground of &lt;a href=\"Aderic%27s%20Repose\"&gt;Aderic's Repose&lt;/a&gt; along with Krennan, Darius, and Lorna. There, they laid Liam to rest alongside other patriots and heroes of Gilneas.\nLegacy.\nAfter Liam's death, Genn continued to be haunted by the memory of his son, particularly the quarrels they had and the sight of the prince's dying body after the Battle of Gilneas City. During the exodus to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Genn nearly drowned while saving his &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;remaining&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; from the sinking \"&lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Radiance\"&gt;Elune's Radiance&lt;/a&gt;\", but was saved by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; captain &lt;a href=\"Talar%20Oaktalon\"&gt;Talar Oaktalon&lt;/a&gt;. After later awakening, Genn told Talar that he had been dreaming of Liam and that while there would be times when his child's death would hit him like a stone thrown at his chest, he could take comfort and pride in knowing that his son had been a wiser man than him.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, Genn stole the magical &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt; from Sylvanas to prevent her from enslaving &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed it, referencing Liam's death by saying \"You took my son's future, and now I've taken yours\".\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", Genn makes reference to avenging Liam when the Gilnean forces are sent to flank &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s rebellion. He ultimately is outraged to find Sylvanas has escaped yet again, denying him justice. Liam's death is relived by his sister, &lt;a href=\"Tess%20Greymane\"&gt;Tess Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, during the worgen heritage armor questline. In a vision granted to her by &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, of what she could have changed as a worgen, Tess is unable to prevent her brother's death, leading to her falling into an enraged state before being defeated and calmed by the worgen hero assisting her. She forlornly realizes that she couldn't have saved Liam either, before coming to terms with her reasons for seeking out the Curse.\nQuests.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Gilneas city&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn Hailwood Marsh:\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWe need you, &lt;name&gt;! There are worgen everywhere!\nIt is not safe out here, &lt;name&gt;. Seek shelter before it's too late.\nI failed to defend my people in Gilneas City. It seems the fates have given me a second chance, &lt;name&gt;. I will not fail again!"}

Either rely on any or none of these facilities being available and get at worst case a native minimap icon with a right-click menu.\nTable structures (yes confusing):\nLocale System.\nNotes on the locale integration.\nYes, the locale system does load all the reverse lookup tables for all available locale libraries.\nThe reason is that all strings for the current locale and for english are already taking memory\nfor all the locale libraries (and for the current locale even if the locale libs didnt exist),\nand its by far more effiecnt to just keep the reverse lookup tables which only hold string\nreferences anyway. Some applications are hitting the reverse lookup constantly and necessarily,\nup to 100s of times a frame, and allows a very fast non-memory churn way of doign this. Also this\nallows features which are faster here, closer to the metal, than emulating and separatly tracking\nthem per app or use, and for the integration of multiple lib and app locale systems with one call.\nThis is very little code all the way around for what you get, and far less code on the use side.\nOnly the final locale system collection is per instance, the rest of the tables and management\nis global. Some forms up lookups are regretibly wrapped and stuck on the Lua side, but watching\nthe meters its really about as tight as you could expect and still very fast.\nLib issue awareness and mitigation.\nYes for each lib a reference is held that theroetically should be transient per use. In practice\nfor normal applications the non babble instances usually have a local refernce held per file anyway\nwhich will lock that app to its data generated by the latest version loaded at the time the file\nwas run, and... its holding a reference to the table. This library initalizes locale by design\nafter all addons libs have loaded and checks attempts load on demand for what left, before holding\na reference, which should guarentee a reference to the latest version. Apps that use this library\nalso will by design be guarenteed coherency at player_login and any event there after, if they use \na libkarma instance for event management, or if they follow the pattern in libkarma by initalizing\naddon_loaded step and player_login step on each event before their own code. LibStub holds\nreferences as well for all other libs including babble. Its far more efficent to have a reference\nto some parts of the lookup chain rather than asking LibStub over and over."}

He made the young shaman his second-in-command. They joined with Grommash Hellscream and his Warsong clan, and they launched a campaign to free the orc prisoners from their internment camps. The &lt;a href=\"Lethargy%20of%20the%20Orcs\"&gt;lethargy&lt;/a&gt; that made the orcs submissive began to fade before the raw energy of Thrall's sense of purpose, and with each toppled camp, the new Horde grew bigger and stronger.\nOrgrim Doomhammer fell in battle while liberating &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;one of those camps&lt;/a&gt;, and with his last breath, he declared that Thrall should carry on as the new &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde. Thrall took up Doomhammer's &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;eponymous weapon&lt;/a&gt;, his armor, and his responsibilities, and he sought to dismantle the whole system of internment in one fell swoop. Orgrim's death took a heavy toll on &lt;a href=\"Gor%27mul\"&gt;Gor'mul&lt;/a&gt;, who then wandered alone and lost for years without direction or hope until his brethren came back to settle Hammerfall.\nThe Horde marched on Aedelas Blackmoore's fortress, &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, now protected by a group of &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Thrall offered to parley peacefully. Aedelas responded by executing &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall's childhood friend. Enraged, Thrall and the Horde stormed the keep, and in a bloody battle, Thrall personally struck down Aedelas.\nWith Durnholde conquered and the knights defeated, the administration of the internment camps ended instantly. The new Horde had little trouble liberating the rest of the smaller, more isolated camps across Lordaeron. Thrall did not use his numbers to wage wars against Lordaeron itself. Instead, he took his people across the Eastern Kingdoms in search of a place they could call home.\nThe Alliance splinters.\nThe destruction of the internment camps proved to be the tipping point for many among the Alliance of Lordaeron. The high elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; were the first to leave the Alliance. The human nations of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; soon followed. Gilneas built the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; as a way to defend itself without military pacts with the Alliance.\nSeveral kingdoms made it known that they had no intention of letting the Alliance collapse. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; all reaffirmed their commitment to unity to whatever trials would come.\nBy virtue of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Internment%20Act\"&gt;Alliance Internment Act&lt;/a&gt;, the troops of the Alliance tried to capture the fugitive orcs, offering them to spare their lives if they willingly surrendered. The orcs refused."}

Prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, they typically gave significant bonuses to a single spell rather than a general stat bonus of ranged weapons; for instance, they might reduce the cost of &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Light%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Holy Light (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; or increase the damage done by &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Storm\"&gt;Divine Storm&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis functionality was changed in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; in preparation for \"\".

On &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they are usually bound to the iron will of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, they mainly wield frost magic and &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; spells. Typically appearing as large, floating, skeletal figures wrapped in long robes, they are often found in high-ranking positions within the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike many other forms of undead, a lich's soul is not imperfectly attached to its body; instead, liches bind their souls to special containers known as &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylacteries&lt;/a&gt;, which then allows them to generate a physical form. This is why lich bodies look nothing like their former mortal selves, and also why one has to destroy a lich's phylactery to truly kill them; as long as a lich's phylactery and soul are allowed to remain intact, the being can never truly die and will always be able to regenerate their corporeal body.\nJust like there are &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt;s, there are also archliches. So far &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amal%27thazad\"&gt;Amal'thazad&lt;/a&gt; are the only known archliches.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nMaldraxxus is the birthplace of necromantic magic and home to the forces that were called upon by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; is lead by necromancers and liches, and are constantly innovating and advancing the art of necromancy with new incantations and formulae as well as more resilient phylacteries.\nThe Third War.\nWhile on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; who would later become the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, commanded a number of orcish &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and spellwielding &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, when &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; captured these &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s after that world's destruction, they were transformed into twisted, spectral aberrations of their former selves. These newly born liches possessed tremendous magical powers, yet their immortal, undead bodies were bound to the iron will of Ner'zhul. As payment for their undying loyalty to Ner'zhul, the Lich King granted them control over the furious elements of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the liches wield frost magic along with their own considerable &lt;a href=\"Necromancer\"&gt;necromantic&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nIt is possible for mortals to become liches even without the aid of higher powers such as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, was reanimated as a lich by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; using the power of the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. It appears, however, that the power of the individual being raised as a lich is directly proportional to the amount of power required to bring them back. For instance, Kel'Thuzad, being an extremely powerful individual, required a nexus of powerful &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley-energies&lt;/a&gt; in order to be reanimated.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; of the Burning Legion at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and the weakening of the Lich King's hold over the Scourge, a few liches, such as &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Splinterspine\"&gt;Ras Splinterspine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fell\"&gt;Morbent Fell&lt;/a&gt;, chose to serve the Legion and sided with the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Civil%20War%20in%20the%20Plaguelands\"&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nJust prior to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; fought against a large Scourge army somewhere in Lordaeron. Among them were several lesser liches.\nThere are &lt;a href=\"troll%20lich\"&gt;troll lich&lt;/a&gt;es in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, liches are scheming skeletal sorcerers who use &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to fuel their potent magic and practice their craft in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; had been manipulated by her new Baron, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn was in service to &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, causing a civil war within Maldraxxus and helping an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Troll%20lich\"&gt;Troll lich&lt;/a&gt;es in service to &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; attempted to both invade &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and then later fight &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; in order to release their master.\nIn the RPG.\nA lich is a powerful &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; who possesses tremendous magical power. During his mortal life as the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; commanded a number of orcish &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and even some of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;. When these wicked sorcerers were captured by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of Draenor, they were transformed into twisted aberrations of their former selves. Ner'zhul became the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; at this time. The sorcerers' new, undead bodies, though immortal, were bound to the iron will of Ner'zhul. Since the liches showed unswerving loyalty to their master, Ner'zhul granted them control over the furious elements of the cold north. Now, the liches wield frost magic along with their own considerable necromantic spells.\n\"Lich\" is an acquired template in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;World of Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;.\nService to the Scourge.\nLiches are among the most powerful spellcasters and allies of the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, serving their master with evil intent and great power. Often, they command armies as generals, surrogates for the Lich King himself. They are deeply entwined with the cold power of the grave. As a rule, these creatures are power-hungry, devious, and vicious. They utilize their great intellect and dark powers not only to serve the Lich King, but also to defeat each other in subtle political machinations, gaining strength and renown from each opponent's death. A lich resembles a skeleton with a chill blue glow emanating from within its bones. Liches often dress in flowing robes. These creatures are fond of pageantry and deception; they will often dress in the robes of a king or priest and expect their followers to call them by powerful-sounding names. Sometimes, they claim extraordinary powers granted directly from Ner'zhul himself, acting as though Ner'zhul were a god and they were his chosen priests or prophets. Instead of walking on the ground as mortals do, liches float above it on frosty mist. A lich floats from 6 -12 inches above the ground. Liches cannot trigger pressure plates or similar traps, nor do they leave footprints. Most difficult terrain does not inhibit liches, and they can cross calm water and other liquids with this ability. This movement is otherwise similar to normal movement, so liches can still fall down pits, for instance.\nTypically, the Lich King elevates only &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s to lichdom, but rumors speak of the occasional &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; who also attains this status. Some tales imply that a spellcaster with enough personal and magical strength can willingly turn himself into a lich, but these reports are unsubstantiated. Some powerful necromancers can temporarily transform themselves into a lich.\nRogue liches.\nThe rogue liches walk &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; with no intention of raising an army as when they were under the command of the Legion. Even a single undead draws attention; putting together a large group will surely get the local populace upset. Instead, these liches harbor a single, driving goal; revenge. They seek out those who helped bring about their downfall, first destroying all that they held dear and then bringing ultimate retribution upon the target.\nHuman liches.\n&lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; necromancers are the most likely candidates for liches. Chilling mist billows from this skeletal figure. It floats in a cloud of mist, and black robes flow from its evil form. These liches are evil, cunning, and loyal to the Lich King. They serve as generals of armies and as advisors to other powerful members of the Scourge. These liches are somewhat inexperienced and probably new to undead existence, but they are filled with power and arrogance. Liches prefer to have hordes of undead minions surrounding them. These lesser undead creatures protect the lich while he casts spells from a distance. Liches have no qualms about fleeing if the situation warrants.\nNotes and trivia.\nShadowlands quotes.\nThese apply to most liches in the Shadowlands. &lt;a href=\"Balmedar\"&gt;Balmedar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; have unique quotes."}

Their names are randomly chosen from one of four options\u2014Fel'endae, Mal'endra, Rathborne, and Thultain\u2014meaning that there are often multiple liches with the same name in each stage of the scenario. Which lich uses which name differs in each playthrough on the quest; for example, in one playthrough the player might encounter three Fel'endaes and two Rathbornes, while in another they might see six Mal'endras, three Rathbornes, and two Fel'endaes. Furthermore, they can spawn with one of two models, either unarmored or armored.\nIn the quest's second stage, two named liches can be seen overseeing the battle at the house's southern entrance from behind a barricade atop a flight of stairs. Two more guard the stairs leading up to &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Ninadar\"&gt;Baroness Ninadar&lt;/a&gt;.

The player has to kill the two crystal guardians for the quest's fifth stage.

Yet, when these wicked sorcerers were captured by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; after the destruction of Draenor, they were transformed into twisted aberrations of their former selves. These Liches possessed tremendous magical powers, yet their immortal, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; bodies were bound to the iron will of Ner'zhul. Since the Liches showed unswerving loyalty to their master, Ner'zhul granted them control over the furious elements of the cold north. Now, Liches wield frost magic along with their own considerable necromantic spells.\nHero names.\nOrdin Frostbane, &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Splinterspine\"&gt;Ras Splinterspine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fell\"&gt;Morbent Fell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Araj%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Araj the Summoner&lt;/a&gt;, Kali'naj Dethknell, Rak Coldskull, Din Frostfire, &lt;a href=\"Calis%20Wraithson\"&gt;Calis Wraithson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Venim%20Iceblade\"&gt;Venim Iceblade&lt;/a&gt;, Naze the Eternal, &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt;, Coldreaver, Cho'Nammoth, Kryptikk Soulslayer, Alandil Lieng.\nInformation.\nThe Lich is the Undead's only ranged Hero and is powerful in both offense and support. Generally professional Undead players will use him as their second Hero, because a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; provides better versatility early game compared to a Lich. \nFrost Nova is a powerful spell that also serves as the Lich's killing spell. It deals two hits; a single spell hit, followed by splash damage to nearby units. Liches should always use this spell when possible, as it deals a significant amount of damage at level 3. All struck units also suffer from a temporary frost effect. This skill should take first priority. Professional Undead players often combine Frost Nova with Death Coil, making a deadly combo against living units.\nFrost Armor is one of the strongest support skills in game, as it provides the targeted unit with a massive amount of armor. Frost Armor's bonuses stack with others like Inner Fire, meaning that units can become incredibly resistant to attacks. In addition to this, Frost Armor weakens melee units - any that attack a unit benefiting from Frost Armor are given a temporary frost effect. It should take second priority.\nDark Ritual is a fairly insignificant skill, but experienced players may prioritize it over Frost Armor because it allows the Lich to cast Frost Nova more often on enemies.\nDeath and Decay is a powerful spell which a targeted area-of-effect channeled spell. All units and buildings in the area will lose 4% of their health every second. If not interrupted, the spell essentially destroys anything in the targeted area. Liches should be well protected before casting this spell, as they become sitting ducks. \nSpells and abilities.\nFrost ova.\nPeople pick the Lich just for the Frost Nova ability. It is a very powerful ability that is up there with &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. Frost Nova can take a chunk out of enemy units and destroy low hit point units such as ranged units and spell casters. The second benefit of Frost Nova is that it causes a frost effect so it's great to use when they are trying to run away.\nUse Mana Potions to cast Frost Nova more often. Use &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Ritual\"&gt;Dark Ritual&lt;/a&gt; so you can get more Mana to cast Frost Nova.\nrost Armor (Autocast).\nFrost Armor is useful for protecting allied Heroes and the Lich Itself. You can also cast Frost Armor on powerful units such as &lt;a href=\"Abomination%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and Bears to allow them to last longer. Focus Frost Armor on high-priority units to increase their chances of survival.\nFrost reduces movement by 50% and attack speed by 25%, making it particularly useful against melee users.\nDispel.\nDark itual.\nDark Ritual is rarely used but very powerful because it can make the Lich have almost unlimited Mana for &lt;a href=\"%23Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt;. It's best to use Dark Ritual on Skeletons, since they can be easily replaced. If the enemy tries targeting your units and you can't save them, you can use Dark Ritual on them to deny them the experience.\neath And Decay (Ultimate).\nNotes: Trees are not affected by the damaging effect of Death and Decay, but instead killed instantly.\nDeath and Decay is extremely useful in any situation. It deals damage based on the health of struck units, not a static numerical value. It is also capable of damaging units with Spell Immunity or otherwise protected by them such as Anti-Magic Shell. Like Blizzard however, Death and Decay will damage your units so make sure none of your units are over the area it is cast on.\nIt is particularly useful against players attempting to play defensively, as it has enough range to avoid retaliation from their towers. \nDeath and Decay can be used to clear away trees.\nThis spell must be maintained to get the full effect. If the spell is interrupted, it will not reach its full power. The caster must not move while casting. Attack the Lich and force him to move which will cancel Death and Decay."}

Initially trapped within the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King eventually betrayed Kil'jaeden and merged with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. At the climax of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war for Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas the Lich King was defeated by Highlord &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;. After the destruction of Frostmourne and the death of Arthas, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; became the new Lich King in order to keep the undead Scourge in check. Bolvar was later defeated by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; who also destroyed the Helm of Domination, making the position of Lich King come to an end.\nThe Lich King Arthas was the titular antagonist of \"\".\nBiography.\nBirth of the Lich King.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; had the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt; craft both the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, powerful artifacts which would end up in the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen Ner'zhul attempted to escape &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, he was immediately apprehended by the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Kil'jaeden tore the old &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;'s body apart, but kept his spirit intact and aware. Ner'zhul begged for death, but Kil'jaeden said he still had a purpose to serve. He offered Ner'zhul one last chance to serve the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; or face eternal torment. When the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; recklessly agreed, Kil'jaeden encased his spirit in a block of diamond-hard ice from the distant reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Encased within the frozen cask and warped by the demon lord's chaotic powers, Ner'zhul felt his consciousness expand ten thousand-fold and he became a spectral being of unfathomable power: the Lich King. The new being was sent to Azeroth with the Helm of Domination and Frostmourne merged with his icy tomb.\nFormation of the Scourge.\nThe Lich King was sent to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, landing in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; where the ice that encased him formed into the shape of a &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;throne&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he would begin the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and in the process weaken the world in preparation for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. This new army would not fall victim to the petty infighting that had caused the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s to fail in conquering Azeroth earlier. Sent to watch over him were the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s, led by &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; himself. Within the Frozen Throne, the Lich King experimented with his psychic powers and enslaved the local indigenous life forms. The plague of undeath that came from the Frozen Throne transformed each of them into his undead servants. Thus, using his psychic and necromantic powers, he was able to conquer much of Northrend. As he devoured more and more souls, he only grew in power as the individual undead under his control gave him \"much needed nourishment\". Thus, his powers began growing at an exponential rate; a fact that the dreadlords were well aware of.\nThe Lich King entered a war with the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, whose ancient inhabitants were immune to his plague of undeath. The 10-year conflict known as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt; ultimately ended with the Lich King's first major triumph (while the nerubians were immune to the plague, their corpses could still be reanimated). The Lich King was impressed by his enemy, however, and adopted nerubian architecture for his own, as a testament to the spider lords' tenacity and age.\nHaving by now established control over most of Northrend, the dreadlords urged Ner'zhul to proceed with the agreed-upon plan to prepare the world for the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich King then used his telepathy to reach out into Azeroth and summon any dark soul that would hear his call, focusing on masters of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and a prominent member of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, answered his call. Kel'Thuzad was soon ensnared by the Lich King, faithfully serving him as the first of a \"&lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;\"; a cult that would worship the Lich King as a god and be taught necromancy to better aid their undead armies.\nKel'Thuzad and the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; were instructed to begin paving the way, but Ner'zhul, ever mindful of Kil'jaeden's schemes, secretly sought a way out of his prison...\nScourge of Lordaeron.\nAfter preparing for many long months, Kel'Thuzad and his Cult of the Damned finally struck the first blow by releasing the plague upon &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; along with captain &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; began Lordaeron's search for answers on the new threat. Lordaeron's northernmost settlements were consumed utterly.\nAs the ranks of the undead swept across Lordaeron, King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt;'s only son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, took up the fight against the undead. As was the Lich King's intention all along, Arthas succeeded in killing Kel'Thuzad, but even so, the undead ranks swelled with every soldier that fell defending the land. Frustrated and stymied by the seemingly unstoppable enemy, Arthas took increasingly extreme steps to drive them out. He eventually ordered the &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;slaughter&lt;/a&gt; of everyone in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, to prevent Mal'Ganis from adding its citizens (most of which had contracted the plague) to his army of the dead. Arthas failed to trap Mal'Ganis, who escaped to Northrend. Arthas's comrades warned him that he was losing his hold on his humanity.\nArthas's fear and resolve proved to be his ultimate undoing. He tracked the plague's source to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, intending to end its threat forever by killing its supposed leader Mal'Ganis. He stumbled across his long-time friend, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, brother to the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;, and the dwarf led him to a legendary weapon they hoped would help them combat the Scourge. Instead, Prince Arthas himself fell prey to the Lich King's tremendous power. Believing that it would help him save his people, Arthas took up the cursed runeblade, &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Though the sword did grant him great power, the cost was high: Muradin lay dead (or so Arthas believed), and Arthas began to lose his soul, transformed into the first and greatest of the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Arthas finally exacted revenge upon Mal'Ganis, removing one of the Lich King's more dangerous jailers and completing the unholy transformation. With his soul cast aside and his sanity shattered, Arthas led the Scourge against his own kingdom \u2014 Lordaeron. Arthas started with the murder of his own father, King Terenas, and crushed Lordaeron with his newfound unholy strength.\nPath of the Damned.\nWith Arthas as his champion, Ner'zhul spread the plague throughout Lordaeron. What remained of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; struck back, but even the mighty &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; fell to the death knight's power. On orders from Tichondrius, Arthas took the Scourge north, to the &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, to resurrect the Summoner of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Kel'Thuzad. The high elves never stood a chance, and their capital, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, was ravaged \u2014 their millennia-aged &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; was warped and used to resurrect Kel'Thuzad as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, both masters were appeased: the Lich King's most loyal worshiper was returned, and the Summoner was unleashed.\nHaving progressed too far into the Legion's plan (and guarded too closely by Tichondrius) to back out now, Ner'zhul's minions laid siege to Dalaran, reclaiming a &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;spellbook&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, which contained the incantations needed for Kel'Thuzad to summon Archimonde.\nFinally, Archimonde was summoned outside Dalaran, and he immediately gave control of the Scourge to Tichondrius and the Dreadlords. But the Lich King was not done yet. Archimonde may have removed Ner'zhul's control over the undead, but in his eagerness for vengeance against the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, he forgot to return the Frozen Throne to Kil'jaeden. Thus, the Lich King remained at large. In fact, it seems the Lich King had already anticipated the later defeat of both Archimonde and the Burning Legion on Azeroth - Kel'thuzad revealed to Arthas (who was rather baffled by how the Scourge's leadership changed so quickly) that the Lich King had foreseen the demotion and that Arthas could still have a part to play in his \"grand design\".\nDuring the Legion's invasion of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was released from his barrow prison after ten thousand years of captivity. Realizing Illidan's addiction to magic, and having utilized the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; himself years earlier, the Lich King dispatched Arthas to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. There, Arthas covertly told Illidan about the powers of the Skull of Gul'dan. Unable to resist such power, Illidan took up the skull and harnessed its vast energies. By doing so, Illidan developed demonic features and vastly magnified power. Illidan, exactly as the Lich King had planned, then proceeded to kill Tichondrius and liberate &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithout Tichondrius's support team, Archimonde's overconfident ascent of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; led to the unexpected: his annihilation.\nThe Lich King watched the events of Hyjal and when Kil'jaeden reached out to him to continue the war, he refused the demon lord.\nLegacy of the Damned.\nBristling with power and free to roam the world once more, Illidan set out to find his own place in the great scheme of things. However, Kil'jaeden confronted Illidan and made him an offer he could not refuse. Kil'jaeden was angered by Archimonde's defeat at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, but he had greater concerns than vengeance. Sensing that his creation, the Lich King, was out of his control, Kil'jaeden ordered Illidan to destroy Ner'zhul and put an end to the undead Scourge once and for all. In exchange, Illidan would receive untold power and a true place amongst the remaining lords of the Burning Legion.\nIllidan agreed and immediately set out to destroy the Frozen Throne, the icy crystal cask in which the Lich King's spirit resided. Illidan knew that he would need a mighty artifact to destroy the Frozen Throne. Using the knowledge he had gained from Gul'dan's memories, Illidan decided to seek out the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and claim the &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Dark Titan&lt;/a&gt;'s remains. Using his vast, demonic powers, he lured the serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; from their dark undersea lairs. Led by the cunning witch &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; the naga helped Illidan reach the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where Sargeras's tomb was rumored to be located. There he found the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrough the undead, the Lich King then noticed the naga and Lady Vashj in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. At first he did not understand their presence there, but as Illidan later appeared in the city, he understood that Kil'jaeden must have recruited Illidan to destroy him. He was reminded of his own weakness, so he sent his Scourge to Dalaran as well. Strengthened by the city's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley energy lines&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan used the Eye to cast a destructive spell against the Lich King's citadel of Icecrown in distant Northrend. Illidan's attack shattered the Lich King's defenses and ruptured the very roof of the world. The Lich King had no defense against this spell, and he would have been forever vanquished that day. But at the final moment, Illidan's destructive spell was stopped when his brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; intervened, sensing that the spell was causing great damage to the world.\nCivil war in the Plaguelands.\nNow that Ner'zhul had openly defied the will of the Legion, he knew that the wrath of Kil'jaeden and his demonic lackeys would be fierce - and at the worst possible time, Ner'zhul was losing his magical power. When he had pushed &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; from the throne, he had caused a crack within the icy cask. Illidan's spell had caused this crack to worsen and now the Lich King's powers were rapidly seeping out like blood from an open wound. Half-way across Azeroth, residing over the unholy remains of his father's kingdom, Arthas was losing power as well \u2014 his powers came directly from the Frozen Throne, through his blade Frostmourne, and his hold over the undead was also slipping. \nNer'zhul knew that his time was short. Imprisoned within the Frozen Throne, he suspected (correctly) that Kil'jaeden would send his agents to destroy him. Desperate to save himself, he called his greatest mortal servant to his side: the death knight King Arthas.\nThough his powers were drained by the Lich King's weakness, Arthas had been involved in a civil war in Lordaeron. Half of the standing undead forces, led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;, had been freed by the Lich King's sudden loss of influence and resented what they had become. Also, another group of undead was still under the control of the Legion's remaining commanders: the three dreadlords &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas, called by the Lich King, was forced to leave the Scourge in the hands of his lieutenant, Kel'Thuzad, as the war escalated throughout the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nUltimately, Sylvanas and her rebel undead (known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;) claimed the ruined capital city of Lordaeron as their own. Consuming the old sewers beneath the wrecked &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken vowed to defeat the Scourge and drive Kel'Thuzad and his minions from the land. The Lich King was powerless to stop them.\nWeakened, but determined to save his master, Arthas reached Northrend only to find Illidan's naga and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; waiting for him. He and his nerubian allies (in the form of &lt;a href=\"crypt%20fiend\"&gt;crypt fiend&lt;/a&gt;s led by the fallen &lt;a href=\"spiderlord\"&gt;spiderlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;) raced against Illidan's forces to reach the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt; and defend the Frozen Throne.\nThe Lich King triumphant.\nArthas, with Anub'arak's help, &lt;a href=\"A%20Symphony%20of%20Frost%20and%20Flame\"&gt;battled&lt;/a&gt; his way through their forces until faced with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas fought with his father's reforged runeblade, &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;. Flamestrike clashed against Frostmourne, but in the end Arthas forced Kael'thas to flee, leaving the path open. He then proceeded to magically activate the four &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20obelisk\"&gt;Icecrown obelisk&lt;/a&gt;s around the glacier, opening the doors to the Frozen Throne.\nHowever, Illidan was waiting for him. Arthas warned Illidan to leave Azeroth and never return. Illidan replied that he had promised Kil'jaeden to destroy the Frozen Throne, which Arthas coldly countered that he will never succeed. After a short but intense battle, Illidan inadvertently left himself open and Arthas quickly took advantage of it, slicing open the demon hunter's chest. Illidan collapsed, grievously wounded. Arthas then turned towards the open doors of Icecrown, leaving Illidan on the ground instead of finishing him.\nArthas entered the hollow glacier and beheld a winding pinnacle chained to the ice. As he strode up the stairs towards his destiny, the voices of those he had forsaken flooded through his mind. First, he heard again Uther warning him \"If we allow our passions to turn to bloodlust, then we will become as vile as the orcs.\" Then he heard again more angry remarks from Uther and Muradin, as well as his own responses to them, yet he ignored them, continuing his ascent. Finally, he reached the pinnacle and before him he saw an icy cask, within which was &lt;a href=\"Plate%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;a suit of armor&lt;/a&gt;, arranged as if seated on a massive throne. Now only two voices spoke to him: Medivh's previous warning to Jaina and the rasping whisper of Ner\u2019zhul:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Your young prince&lt;/a&gt; will find only death in the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;cold north&lt;/a&gt;.\" \n\"Return the &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;blade&lt;/a&gt;... complete the circle... release me from this &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt;!\"\nWith a great cry of strength, Arthas brought the might of Frostmourne to bear against the Lich King's icy prison and with a haunting scream, the Frozen Throne exploded, and shards of the crystal scattered on the ground. With Ner'zhul's &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;thorny helm&lt;/a&gt; at his feet, Arthas leaned forward, picked it up and then placed the unimaginably powerful artifact on his head. \n\"\"Now\",\" they spoke in unison, \"\"we are one\"!\"\nIn that moment, just as he always planned, Ner'zhul's soul fused with Arthas' into a single mighty being. And thus one of the most powerful entities on Azeroth was born.\nInterlude.\nAfter the merger, he was still telepathically in contact with his minions. One year later, Arthas was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan\"&gt;Dar'Khan&lt;/a&gt; and told about the remaining powers of the Sunwell somewhere in Lordaeron. He responded that dragons would be drawn to the energy. He also ordered the lich &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; to remain on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and expand the Scourge's influence. In Year 25, he gave commands to Kel'Thuzad and also he developed a fascination with the notion of Light-wielding warriors who invoked their powers without the need for a moral code, and instructed his pawn &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; to entrap &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s and raise them as undead.\nThe Lich King sat dormant for several years while storms raged across Northrend and his minions constructed &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; around the Frozen Throne. While the Lich King dreamt, the various personas in his mind - the death knight Arthas Menethil, the orc shaman Ner'zhul, and &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Lehner\"&gt;Matthias Lehner&lt;/a&gt;, the personification of the remnants of Arthas's humanity - fought for influence and control over the entity.\nMatthias tried to reason with Arthas, but Arthas silenced him by running him through with Frostmourne. Ner'zhul was delighted by this, declaring that he and Arthas were now free to merge into a single glorious being. Arthas rejected this offer, stating that once he had the power of the Lich King, no one would tell him what to do again. He impaled the stunned Ner'zhul with Frostmourne, becoming the dominant personality of the Lich King and ending the dream.\nIn his quiet meditation, the part of the Lich King that was Arthas began to reflect on the events of his life, on the path that had taken him so far from the young boy who who had been his father's pride and joy. In the midst of his reflections, Arthas sensed a bitter and ancient presence locked within the nearby ice, and with this realization came the name &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAwakening.\nWhen the Lich King awakened, he removed his own heart, believing that anything that made him at all mortal made him weak.\nAfterwards, he journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Sindragosa's Fall&lt;/a&gt; where he raised the ancient dragon &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;, the first consort to &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, as a frost wyrm, then watched his massive undead army prepare for war. His final desecration of Sindragosa was to tear the spirits of her lost &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20whelp\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; into undeath in front of her skeletal form, as a final affront to the great dragon, and then ordered her to lead the &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood\"&gt;Frostbrood&lt;/a&gt; into war.\nWhile he was sleeping, his &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s trained in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. After he awoke, he ordered the march on &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; because of the thousand heroes of the Alliance buried there. He wanted to raise them and claim those lands for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich King also saw fit to bring &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; back, so his &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; resurrected him as a &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacking Horde and Alliance.\nThe capitals of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; began receiving mysterious packages with infected grain. As their citizens ate grain from the infected packages, they were turned into bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s if not treated by members of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. With all the major capitals thrown into chaos, necropoleis appeared around the world, triggering a second Scourge war. Adventurers from both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fought back the disease and the advancing Scourge armies. Outraged by this treachery, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; with his fellow Horde leaders, and King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; planned an invasion on Northrend to deal with the Lich King once and for all.\nThe final straw occurred when the Lich King directly attacked the capitals of the Horde and the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; were attacked by large Scourge armies consisting of &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Stormwind%29\"&gt;Battles for Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; were won by the brave adventurers and their leaders once more, thus forming the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese attacks were intended to lure powerful heroes to Northrend, where the Lich King sought to corrupt them and use them against their own people, in a reflection of Arthas's own journey.\nFall of the Scarlet Enclave.\nNot content to just lure the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth into his service, the Lich King decided to remove the anti-Scourge presence within the &lt;a href=\"plaguelands\"&gt;plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, he created a new order of death knights led by &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. Accompanied by two &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20Battle-maiden\"&gt;Val'kyr Battle-maiden&lt;/a&gt;s when atop , and by &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Prince Keleseth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Prince Valanar&lt;/a&gt; later, he commanded his forces and successfully forced the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, with the survivors becoming the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; and heading to Northrend.\nDuring the battle, the Lich King sensed &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;an old enemy&lt;/a&gt; he destroyed long ago, but he was content to ignore that at the time.\nBattle for Light's Hope Chapel.\nEmpowered by the destruction of the Scarlet Crusade, the Scourge prepared to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;attack Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the odds, the Argent Dawn won against the army of damned, largely thanks to the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. The spirit of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, the original Ashbringer, appeared to speak with his defeated son Darion. The Lich King then took to the field himself, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%27%20Soul%20Shard\"&gt;sealing away&lt;/a&gt; Alexandros's soul.\nRealizing how he had been betrayed, Darion attacks the Lich King, only to be swatted aside. Fordring comes forward in preparation to battle the Lich King. The Lich King incapacitates him, stating that sacrificing a small army of death knights was a small price to pay to draw Tirion out of hiding. Lord &lt;a href=\"Maxwell%20Tyrosus\"&gt;Maxwell Tyrosus&lt;/a&gt; gives the order to attack, and while the remaining Defenders of the Light charge the Lich King, they are easily blasted away.\nHaving heard from the Lich King himself of why he would throw away Darion and the death knights under his command, Darion uses Arthas's focus on Tirion against him and throws the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; to Fordring. The combination of Fordring's own faith and the holy ground of Light's Hope cleanses the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, restoring the sword to its original glory. With this new power, Tirion escapes the Lich King's spell and strikes him with the holy sword.\nStunned by this turn of events, the Lich King retreats after promising that the next time he meets Fordring, it will not be on holy ground.\nThis battle led to the creation of two of the Lich King's greatest enemies: Tirion Fordring's &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; (a combination of the Argent Dawn and Silver Hand) and Darion Mograine's &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; (an order of death knights who broke free from the Lich King's control).\nLegends: Fate.\nThe Lich King gained the control of the undead tauren &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and spoke to him, commanding him to kill tauren &lt;a href=\"Sulamm\"&gt;Sulamm&lt;/a&gt; and later &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, but Trag successfully refused.\nTrag made his way into Icecrown Citadel and confronted the Lich King, but hesitated when he sensed that they shared some inner link. The Lich King explained that dark magic which reanimated Trag came from the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Orb of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, and said, \"part of what I am comes from what was the spirit of its creator\". Trag cursed Ner'zhul's name, but the Lich King said, \"Ner'zhul is no more. He is consumed. There is only Arthas now... Arthas, whom you shall serve for all eternity.\" When Trag resisted, Arthas used his magic to dominate him. Trag was equipped as a death knight and ordered to slay a group of &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; he had assisted earlier in his journey. With great difficulty, Trag managed to fight the Lich King's control. Turning on his new master, Trag struck Arthas's breastplate with his axe. Though the armor magically repaired itself, the Lich King was outraged by the tauren's audacity. He blasted Trag out of the citadel and sent him flying through the air. Though Trag's body was broken by the fall, the essence of the orb soon reconstructed him, and he no longer heard the Lich King's voice in his mind.\nAngrathar the Wrathgate.\nMembers of the Horde and the Alliance fighting at the siege for &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; formed a temporary alliance, focusing their attacks on the Scourge instead of each other. With the dragonflights providing aerial support, both factions made a daring attack on the gate, seizing control from the Scourge. There, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Saurfang the Younger&lt;/a&gt; taunted the Lich King to fight his own battles instead of sending his minions. The Lich King entered the battle and quickly slew Saurfang the Younger. Before Bolvar and the Lich King could trade blows, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; and the creator of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;, betrayed the Horde and unleashed his plague on the combatants below. The plague killed most of the Alliance, Horde, and Scourge forces at the Wrath Gate indiscriminately, including Bolvar Fordragon. The Lich King was injured and forced to retreat. This betrayal and the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; that followed ended upwards of seven years of cold war between the Horde and the Alliance.\nTirion's gambit.\nTirion discovered that Arthas's &lt;a href=\"Pulsing%20Crystal\"&gt;frozen heart&lt;/a&gt; had been retrieved from the beneath Icecrown Citadel and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;. Suspecting the heart might contain some remnant of Arthas's humanity, Tirion disguised himself as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; and went to see it for himself. The Lich King arrived and saw through Tirion's disguise, but the paladin - having concluded that the heart contained only &lt;a href=\"Matthias%20Lehner\"&gt;shadows of the past&lt;/a&gt; - destroyed the disembodied organ with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. The resultant explosion killed &lt;a href=\"High%20Invoker%20Basaleph\"&gt;High Invoker Basaleph&lt;/a&gt;, knocked Tirion unconscious and injured the Lich King. &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; fought off the remaining cultists and took Tirion to safety before the Lich King recovered.\nFall of the Lich King.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; ended with the death of &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak%20%28Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader%20tactics%29\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, struck an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; was born, a combination of opposing orders for a common purpose: the final assault against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and the eventual fall of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nIcecrown Citadel: The Frozen Halls.\nAfter intelligence spoke of an opening directly to the Lich King's private chambers, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; led adventurers from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; led adventurers from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt;. While Jaina hoped to find a little trace of Arthas left in the Lich King, Sylvanas planned to simply sneak past all of the Lich King's defenses while he was preoccupied with the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; invasion and claim her revenge. Once inside they discovered that the Lich King had left Frostmourne unattended within the Halls of Reflection. Both Jaina and Sylvanas attempted to speak with the spirits of the blade in an attempt to find the Lich King's weakness, and both were met by the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Uther warned that the Lich King could see what Frostmourne saw and was on his way. Uther finally told them that any trace of Arthas was simply a fading presence inside the Lich King's mind, and that to destroy him, he must be slain at the place where Arthas merged with Ner'zhul, at the top of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Uther revealed that after the Lich King is slain, someone must take his place - without a master to keep them in check, the vast armies of the Scourge would indiscriminately swarm across Azeroth.\nWhen the Lich King arrived in the hall, he banished Uther's soul back into Frostmourne and called his loyal captains &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the intruders. He returned to his private chambers, followed by Sylvanas and Jaina. Once the adventurers defeated the captains, their respective leaders, unable to do any meaningful harm to the Lich King, ordered them to flee. Seemingly trapped, they made a final stand before their respective gunships, \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skybreaker\"&gt;The Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\", arrived to carry them to safety.\nOne king falls, another rises.\nChampions of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, stormed &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;defeated the Lich King's mightiest servants&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Atop the spire&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King encased Tirion in a block of ice, forcing him to watch helplessly as his champions battled the Lich King and his minions.\nEventually, the Lich King effortlessly killed all the adventurers with a single devastating attack. The Lich King revealed that he had been waiting for Tirion's assault all along, knowing that he would bring with him Azeroth's greatest heroes, who could then be killed and resurrected as powerful masters of the Scourge. Every obstacle he had laid before them was merely part of his test. Now certain Tirion's champions were \"the greatest fighting force this world has ever known\", the Lich King began to raise the fallen heroes. Fordring, calling for a final blessing from the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, managed to break free and shatter Frostmourne with his own sword, &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. The spirits who had been trapped within Frostmourne attacked their former jailer and suspended him in the air. The spirit of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; resurrected Fordring's champions, who were then able to finish off the immobilized Lich King. \nTerenas's spirit held Arthas in his arms as he died, then informed Tirion that the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; must always have a master to control them before he vanished in the wind. Tirion picked up the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt; and prepared to take on the burden of becoming the new Lich King when he was stopped by the voice of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. The undead paladin sat upon the Frozen Throne, having been horribly burned by dragonfire and tortured by Arthas. Bolvar said that he no longer had any place in the world of the living, while Tirion still had duties to perform. As his final act of service, Bolvar would take the powers of the Lich King within himself, imprisoning the master of the Scourge once more and keeping the undead legions in check. Tirion reluctantly placed the crown of the Lich King on Bolvar's head. As the ice of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; began to envelop him, Bolvar - now the new Lich King - told Tirion to tell the world that the Lich King was dead, and as Bolvar's voice gained the characteristic echo of the Lich King, he added that Bolvar Fordragon died with him.\nAftermath.\nThe transition wasn't easy for Bolvar, and he doesn't have control over the Scourge and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; forces operating in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas's visit.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; eventually visited the Frozen Throne to confirm for herself that Arthas was dead. Upon discovering that Bolvar was now the new Lich King, she became enraged, as she feared this \"puppet king\" might one day use his new, inexhaustible power to twist the world to his own ends. She slammed her fist into the frozen casket around Bolvar, feeling this a defeat more than a victory. A crack began to form from her attack.\nWarlords of Draenor.\n&lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; where he directs &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;commanders&lt;/a&gt; to gather knowledge from within &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Burial%20Grounds\"&gt;Shadowmoon Burial Grounds&lt;/a&gt; about the shadowy magic used to raise undead before becoming the Lich King. He states that the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and its powers are still a mystery to the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and that he ultimately hopes to find a way to free &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; from his fate as the Lich King.\nLegion.\nSeveral years before the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lyandra%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Lyandra Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Icecrown to locate &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; and was killed by the remaining Scourge within the citadel. When a mage adventurer arrives on request of &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; to locate Lyandra and Felo'melorn, Bolvar states that the mage can try to take the sword, but if they fail they too will join the Scourge.\nThe Lich King and the Knights of the Ebon Blade come to an agreement: the death knights will serve as the arm for his vengeance against the Legion, and in return, he will keep the Scourge contained in Northrend and help the death knights locate powerful weapons to combat the demonic invasion. Bolvar directs death knights to &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;Apocalypse&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Maw of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, but is heavily involved in the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt;. Calling a champion of the death knights to Icecrown, he has the champion gather the shards of Frostmourne, defeat tortured souls that remained within the shards and reforge them into two new blades. As one final test, the champion must enter the blades and quell the darkness inside. Within the shards of Frostmourne, echoes of Ner'zhul and Arthas can be found with Ner'zhul tempting Arthas to take up Frostmourne.\nOnce the three &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s are obtained, Bolvar brings the death knights to the Frozen Throne and bestows his blessing upon them. Under Bolvar's orders, the Ebon Blade are to follow the artifact wielders' orders as if they were his own.\nThe Lich King exclaims that the greatest heroes of Azeroth have gathered to face the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Of course heroes that stand alone against this threat will not save &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; for salvation will come at a price that the living could not pay. He thought of planning to recreate the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; for their own to stand against the Legion. The first among them is &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen general of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Followed by &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; upon the cliffs of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt; in the fallen kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, for his prowess strength in battle was without rival and shall be even more powerful in undeath. Then &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Whitemane\"&gt;High Inquisitor Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; to his knowledge was a priest whose personal tragedy forged an intense connection with the Light and her zealous power of will is necessary to strengthen the bond of the Four. Yet, there was one who needed to be appointed for the crucial role: someone to lead. Without a leader, there will be no unity among the Four. The Deathlord, Darion, and the three horsemen travel to &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; to recover the body of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; who had &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore%20%28quest%29\"&gt;recently fell in action&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"We%20Meet%20at%20Light%27s%20Hope\"&gt;brought to the tomb underneath the chapel&lt;/a&gt;. In the end they failed and with Darion's sacrifice he opened a &lt;a href=\"Death%20Gate\"&gt;Death Gate&lt;/a&gt; back to . The Lich King has decided that fate of the deeds of his &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; come to fruition for he has sacrificed more for the Ebon Blade than any other. The Four Horsemen were assembled with Darion leading them.\nLegionfall.\nThe Deathlord returned to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to claim &lt;a href=\"Rimefang%27s%20Harness\"&gt;Rimefang's Harness&lt;/a&gt;, but the Lich King explained that invading vrykul were trying to use it to bind &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s to their will. He ordered the Deathlord to slay them in his name.\nAtop of &lt;a href=\"Acherus\"&gt;Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, he tells the Deathlord that the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; showed him many things that he could not comprehend. In a vision he saw thousands of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; marching to the far reaches of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in search of a great power. Every time he reached out through the cold tendrils of endless ice, he sensed nothing. He then tells the Deathlord to go to the end reaches of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to be shown of what he saw. Once there, he described it as the undead swarming across an icy shelf, seeking a prize coveted by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;: the bones of a dragon most ancient, and powerful beyond reckoning. Yet all that remains here is the sea, and he doesn't sense any trace of undead in the area. Curious, he told the Deathlord to go seek out the dragons that reside at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trizormu\"&gt;Trizormu&lt;/a&gt;. After strangulating the dragon, &lt;a href=\"Tariolstrasz\"&gt;Tariolstrasz&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; hurls the Deathlord out of Wyrmrest. The Lich King then says that dragonflight knows something, for they kept secrets within the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. He proclaimed to the Deathlord either spare the dragons, or slay them. If you do kill them all, he mentions to you that you are empty inside just like him.\nThe red dragon named &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz\"&gt;Kyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt; fell doing battle with \"a great corruption\" on an &lt;a href=\"The%20Lost%20Glacier\"&gt;iceberg to the north&lt;/a&gt;. The Lich King tells the Deathlord to find it and consume this life essence, blight it, and raise it into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. He comments when the Deathlord arrives at the Lost Glacier that their supplies have likely frozen. Interestingly enough, he senses feral undead buried in the ice and declares it is time to test the Deathlord's will. He warns that that should the Deathlord fail to survive, that he shall claim Acherus for while Arthas may &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Ebon%20Hold\"&gt;have sought revenge on the citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar has other plans. Upon arriving at &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz%27%20Rest\"&gt;Kyranastrasz' Rest&lt;/a&gt;, the Deathlord approached the corpse of the ancient dragon on the hilltop and . They then raised it and claimed it as their own.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the late Warchief of the Horde, sought to find out who it was that had told him on his deathbed to name &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; the new warchief. He had come to believe it was not the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; that did so but, in fact, something darker and stronger. Vol'jin, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, and a Horde adventurer traveled to the Frozen Throne to confront the Lich King about it. The Lich King told Vol'jin that he was not responsible and that Sylvanas was upsetting the balance of life and death. Furthermore, the Lich King informed Vol'jin that he had been altered more than he realized and that as neither undead nor damned he did not belong in the Frozen Throne. The Lich King sent &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s after them, forcing them to flee.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Bolvar raised a &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;generation&lt;/a&gt; of death knights as his champions. He formally told these death knights that it was their burden and privilege to defend Azeroth while being forced to endure the scorn of the ignorant. He then ordered them to speak with &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and use his death gate to travel to the land of the living in order to choose their destiny.\nShadowlands.\nWhile serving as Lich King, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; was approached by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Though the two initially did battle, Sylvanas gained an upper hand; eventually managing to subdue the Lich King and chain him down using her magic. Declaring him unworthy of the crown he bore, she removed the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and shattered it; destroying the veil between Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the helmet destroyed, the position of Lich King came to an end; leaving Bolvar with a fraction of the powers he once wielded as well as the Scourge going rampant and invading Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; proceeded to take control of the now leaderless Scourge. Rescued by &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; and brought back to , Bolvar became the Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to spearhead the campaign against Sylvanas and her ally, &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jailer later revealed that the Lich King was meant to herald his coming and thus considered Ner'zhul, Arthas, and Bolvar failures due to their defiance of him.\nThe pieces of the Helm of Domination retained some of their power and continued to play a role in the events in the Shadowlands, but were ultimately reforged into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. In connection to the reforging, Sylvanas stated that a Lich King would never again reign in Icecrown.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20a%20Fallen%20King\"&gt;Remnant of a Fallen King&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the Lich King was fought during the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnemies.\nKil'jaeden.\nWhen Ner'zhul attempted to escape Draenor, he was immediately apprehended by the demon lord Kil'jaeden, who enacted the blood pact that Ner'zhul had sworn many years earlier. Kil'jaeden ravaged and destroyed his body, but kept his spirit alive and encased it in a block of ice from the Twisting Nether. &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was transformed into the Lich King. Though Ner'zhul and his undead Scourge were bound to the will of the Burning Legion, the Lich King constantly strove to free himself and gain vengeance upon the demons for dismembering his body and damning him so completely. Shortly before the Battle of Mount Hyjal, Ner'zhul engineered the downfall of the Legion by having his lieutenant, Arthas Menethil, alert the demon hunter Illidan Stormrage to the presence of the Legion in Felwood. Illidan's attack on the demons there brought about the death of Tichondrius and the destruction of the Skull of Gul'dan, which greatly weakened the Legion and made it possible for the Alliance, Horde, and night elf forces to stop Archimonde during the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Such a move inspired Kil'jaeden to incredible heights of anger, and it was the demon's turn to lust after vengeance. Now that Ner'zhul had openly defied the will of the Legion, he knew that the wrath of Kil'jaeden and his demonic lackeys would be fierce. Thus, Kil'jaeden was one of the Lich King's most hated enemies.\nSylvanas Windrunner.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Banshee Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the Lich King\u2019s most hated enemies. After defeating her as a mortal &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; and raising her into a mindless slave to his will, Sylvanas was able to break free from his dominion and subsequently founded the Forsaken. With the death of the Lich King on their main agenda, the Forsaken oversaw the production of a master plague capable of bringing the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to its knees. Sylvanas herself was not present to see the vengeance of the Forsaken wrought by the plague, though the Lich King whispered Sylvanas' name moments before the deployment. She would later infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; with several of her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, and come face to face with the individual - and &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;the blade&lt;/a&gt; - that took her life. After a titanic struggle followed by a narrow escape, Sylvanas was forced to face her inability to defeat Arthas, and contemplated whether even an army of her allies could either.\nMany years later, after having viewed her own actions after the death of Arthas, Sylvanas came to understand that for all the hatred she held, for all the times she hunted for him, she became no better than him due to her own selfish decisions made.\nKael'thas Sunstrider.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, the scion of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, felt the brunt of Arthas's fury both directly and indirectly. Kael'thas was on icy terms with Arthas Menethil even before his dark ascension; Kael'thas harboring resentment towards Arthas's relationship with the object of his affection, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. After Arthas slaughtered his way through Quel'Thalas, murdered &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael's father&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the high elven &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas rushed to his homeland and dubbed the survivors \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;\" - stronger for being broken and filled with purpose - that purpose being to see Arthas fall. Kael made numerous attempts to annihilate the Lich King's champion after joining forces with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, even reforging &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt; to counter &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was unable to defeat his arch-nemesis, and fled to the shattered world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas would ultimately &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;not outlive&lt;/a&gt; his hated enemy, who at that point had merged with Ner'zhul on the Frozen Throne.\nTirion Fordring.\n&lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; was another of the Lich King's most hated enemies. As the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, whose sole purpose is to fight the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion defies everything that the Lich King stands for and thus the Lich King sees Tirion as his arch-nemesis. Tirion has disrupted many of the Lich King's plans and the two have confronted each other multiple times. Tirion views the Lich King as the most evil being &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; has had to face and vows to strike him down, while the Lich King intends to make Tirion, and those close to him, suffer more than anything and watch everything he cherishes fall.\nAdventurers.\nThe Lich King had a rather interesting relationship with the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who fought in the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; war. Rather than see the adventurers as a complete nuisance, he realized that the adventurers had much potential and intended to draw out that potential. As such, he constantly threw many of his strongest minions against the adventurers, seeking to test their abilities and their resolve. During their betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Drakuru\"&gt;Drakuru&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King was amused rather than angered by their defeat of his servant. Finally, during the raid on his fortress of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King revealed his true intentions: to kill the adventurers and raise them as his undead minions, giving him the strongest fighting force in the world. This backfires on him, however, since it is the adventurers and Tirion Fordring who manage to defeat him in the end.\nNames and titles.\nThe Lich King has had many titles over the years of his reign, including but not limited to:\nMemorable quotes.\nWrath of the Lich King trailer.\n\"It's begun.\"\n\"Young heroes... I was once like you. You have come to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;this place&lt;/a&gt; seeking to bring judgement upon &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;the damned&lt;/a&gt;. You will venture deep into forgotten lands. You will see wonders beyond imagining. But be warned. The land itself will rise up against you. Long forgotten terrors will smother your courage. Sacrifice everything as the final darkness falls... in the end, all that awaits you is death. Only then will you understand - you've been following in my footsteps all along.\"\n\"So come then, you heroes! Come in all your power and glory! For in the final hour, all must serve the one... true... king.\"\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n (No text but audio plays)\nSpeculation.\nIdentity crisis.\nThere has been a debate in some areas of the \"Warcraft\" community as to what exactly happened when Arthas and Ner'zhul merged. \nWhen asked, \"What's the truth about the new Lich King?\", &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; replied: \"Arthas and Ner'zhul have become a perfect fusion of one being - Arthas' personality and body with Ner'zhul's wisdom, experience, power and EVIL.\"\nOn the official forums, CM Bornakk made the following statement in response to the question \"Who is the Lich King?\":\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tirion%27s%20Gambit\"&gt;peering into the Lich King's heart&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion Fordring remarks that \"there's nothing left to redeem\" and \"there is no Arthas Menethil anymore - there is only the Lich King.\"\nIn a dream state where Arthas sees past, present, and future, presented by Ner'zhul, Arthas murders the child manifestation of his humanity (representing love, compassion, and so forth). Delighted at this decision, Ner'zhul states, \"We are one, Arthas. Together we are the Lich King. No more Ner'zhul, no more Arthas -- only this one glorious being.\" With that Arthas murders Ner'zhul and tells him \"No \"we\". No one tells me what to do. I've got everything I need from you -- now the power is mine and mine alone. Now there is only I. I am the Lich King. And I am ready.\" Ner'zhul is stunned by the betrayal, then disappears. It was said that Ner'zhul would soon be \"nothing at all\".\nIn the manga story &lt;a href=\"Fate%20%28Legends%29\"&gt;Fate&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King says, \"Ner'zhul is no more. He is consumed. There is only Arthas now... Arthas, whom you shall serve for all eternity.\"\nA Twitter chat from early 2010 suggested Ner'zhul's story was not over:\nQ. Will Ner'zhul appear at any point in 3.3 or the near future?&lt;br&gt;\nA. Well, he is a chunk of the Lich King now. But if you mean will he appear as an orc, we're not ready to tell his story just yet. We have a lot of stories left to tell, but his is a good one.\nOn the official forums, CM Crygil made the following statement in response to a claim that Arthas \"erased\" Ner'zhul upon merging with him (at the end of The Frozen Throne):\nHe didn't actually erase the persona of Ner'zhul. In point of fact, these two beings merged to make up what was collectively known as \"The Lich King\".\nSubsequently, the following was stated by Chris Metzen at a BlizzCon 2010 lore panel:\nQ. I have a question regarding the storyline of Ner'zhul: is he finished, or what's going on with that?&lt;br&gt;\nA. \"Yes. Yeah, Ner'zhul is done. He served us well in that capacity, but really the Lich King idea... really has the ultimate expression, you know, as Arthas or whatever. Ner'zhul's done.\"\nThe situation was clarified in &lt;a href=\"Ask%20CDev\"&gt;Ask CDev&lt;/a&gt; #2, which confirmed that Ner'zhul and Arthas had separate reigns as the Lich King:\nQ. The \"There must always be a Lich King\" mantra seemed awfully suspicious, coming from ghosts trapped in Frostmourne. Was there something else going on there? &lt;br&gt;\nA. To save people from generating elaborate conspiracy theories, we'll be serious for a moment and say, definitively, no. The ghosts of Uther and Terenas understood that the Scourge would run rampant without someone to keep them in check. Yes, that does also mean that Arthas and Ner'zhul were not unleashing the full force of the Scourge during their respective reigns: you are welcome to speculate on the reasons for that. \nIn 2012, &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; tweeted that as far as he's concerned, Ner'zhul is completely gone.\nIn 2014, &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Copeland\"&gt;Sean Copeland&lt;/a&gt; corroborated the novel's account of Arthas destroying Ner'zhul's spirit:\nQ. Okay, my friend and I are at each other's throats over this. Is Ner'zhul's spirit destroyed canonically or not?\nA. So it seems per the Arthas novel (p. 307). :)\nGodhood.\nA debate that has arisen among fans is whether the Lich King can be classified as a god. His origins lie with Kil'jaeden, but his power has continued to increase at an exponential rate beyond Kil'jaeden's intentions. Most of the other gods in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt; have their origins with the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;. However, most of them have contributed something to the world of Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; gave birth to the night elves (according to their own legends), while the Dragon Aspects guard specific elements of Azeroth depending on their origins in the dragonflights. The Lich King contributed the undead to this world; unlike the contributions of other gods this wasn't a \"positive\" change, but it might still elevate the Lich King to the title. Many Blizzard texts (such as the \"Warcraft III\" manual) refer to him as the \"godlike Lich King\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Warcraft Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt; provided by Blizzard classifies a \"god\" in two ways: \n1) Gods are immortal.\n2) Gods are the object of worship.\nAlthough it is true that the Lich King does not age, it is arguable whether or not he is an object of worship. The members of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; and the mortals who serve him as &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s (in \"&lt;a href=\"Reign%20of%20Chaos\"&gt;Reign of Chaos&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;The Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;\"), as well as the unknown number of intelligent undead he controls (in addition to the countless mindless ones) obviously worship him and provide a strong backing for this criterion. The &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; revere him as a death god and it is speculated that the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; have identified him with their death-god, &lt;a href=\"Karkut\"&gt;Karkut&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; refers to offering player's hearts as gifts to the death god, as well.\n\"\" described the Lich King as a &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossible Tolkien Inspiration.\nFrom both his name, occupation, and appearance of his armor, it's been widely speculated amoungst fans that the Lich King was at least partially inspired by two figures from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings series from the world of Middle Earth. These being the Witch-King of Angmar and the King of the Dead Men of the Mountains. Like the Witch-King of Angmar, the Lich King is an undead leader of a vast army who uses dark magic, rules over a frozen and grim domain to the north, wields a cursed blade that can turn living beings into the undead, wears a spiny helmet, and can only be defeated by specific means. Their castles and citadels also bear a passing resemblance. Like the King of the Dead Men of the Mountains, the Lich King can only be harmed meaningfully by blessed weapons, commands an army of the undead, and is notable for breaking an oath.\nOrigin.\nIt seems probable that the Helm of Domination and Frostmourne, supposedly 'forged by the Nathrezim' had in fact been delivered to Denathrius through his path to the Maw, which he then instructed the Nathrezim to provide to Kil'jaeden.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

All classes are tested to the limits of their abilities, in particular all raid members have to react quickly to various abilities, often several at the same time. The encounter is rather unforgiving; most players must react properly in various situations, and all players get ample opportunity to commit mistakes which then wipe the raid. This encounter is a fitting end to &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and on par with &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nThe Lich King melees for roughly 40,000 on an item level 264 geared tank on 25-player difficulty. The Lich King &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28boss%29\"&gt;enrages&lt;/a&gt; after 15 minutes of combat, gaining 900% damage and 150% attack speed. However, he is notably still affected by taunt abilities.\nPhase 2.\nThe Lich King retains Infest.\nPhase 3.\nThe Lich King retains Soul Reaper and Defile.\nPreparation.\nThe fight requires the standard raid composition of 2/3 Tanks and 3/5 healers (10/25 player), while learning the encounter more healers can help. No resistance or other special gear is required.\nTactics.\nPhase 1.\nDuring Phase 1, the Lich King should be tanked by the main tank at a spot near the edge of the platform. On the phase transition this gives Arthas a greater distance to travel before casting Remorseless Winter, thus the raid gets more time to react and a shorter distance to run. Melee sets up behind him, ranged a few yards away, even closer to the edge of the platform. 5 yards to the side of Arthas, the off tank(s) set up to tank the adds. The raid DPS single target Arthas, &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; should not be used.\nHarmless ghouls and very dangerous Shambling Horrors spawn during the phase. Horrors have a frontal cleave and an extremely dangerous enrage. To survive the enrage, they must either be tranquilized or stunned.\nThe adds are mostly killed using the Necrotic Plague mechanism. Every 15 seconds Arthas applies the Necrotic Plague debuff to a player. The plague is a DoT which deals 50k to its target every 5 seconds. Whenever its target dies, or the plague is dispelled, it jumps to any nearby \"unit\" - which includes adds. The trick is to have debuffed players run next to the adds and dispel them there, so the plague jumps to an add. The plague also stacks, this means the longer the phase lasts, the faster the adds die. This can be used to kill the Shambling Horrors, because in heroic mode, even the highest dps raids cannot spare the time to switch to the Horrors. Drudge Ghouls can be used to get higher Necrotic Plague stacks before placing it on the Shambling Horror. Each time the plague debuff jumps, Arthas gains one more stack of Plague Siphon, each of which increases his damage dealt by 2%. At about 40 stacks tanks get one-shotted, thus the plague must not jump too frequently.\nThe Lich King also periodically casts Infest, which requires the target's HP to be topped off quickly to remove the dot. A Discipline priest can proactively shield the raid between Infest casts, helping to minimize the amount the raid needs to be healed.\nThis phase ends at 70%. Arthas should have about 15 stacks of Plague Siphon. When the last add dies, a player (usually the tank) gets the Plague stack (usually about 20).\nPhase 1.5.\nAt 70% health a 1 minute transition phase takes place. The Lich King moves to the center of the arena, away from the tank, and begins casting Remorseless Winter (a 45 yard AoE). When he moves away from the tank, the raid must flee on the edge of the platform to get out of the 45 yard range. He goes on casting Pain and Suffering, and summons a Raging Spirit every 20 seconds. Immediately after the third Spirit, Arthas casts Quake, which destroys the outer ring of the platform - the raid has 2.5 seconds to move away from the edge.\nDuring the transition phase, one player usually gets the plague stack from the last add. This player must move about 10 yards away from everyone else and then get dispelled, this removes the plague (and Plague Siphon from Arthas) without further jumps.\nTargets of Raging Spirits have 5 seconds before the add spawns. Raging Spirits melee very hard and possess a frontal cone-area silence ability. They must be killed quickly, so that only one is up in phase two. Frost orbs head towards the raid and explode if they reach it. They have few HP and can be killed by ranged DPS. Pain and Suffering is a stacking DOT that is applied to random raid members. It spreads to nearby players so the raid should spread out some. \nWhen the Lich King kneels and lights up the ground around him, the raid must return to the center area of the platform before the edges of the platform break away (The area that is about to fall becomes very obvious). Continue to kill any remaining Raging Spirits, but the main tank should pick up the Lich King again as quickly as possible.\nPhase 2.\nDuring Phase 2, the raid must master two different abilities, each of which requires different positioning.\nThe Val'kyr pick up raid members, carry them to the closest edge of the platform and drop them to their death. To avoid them, the raid should be huddled up closely near the center of the platform, so that the Val'kyr have the longest path to the edge. They must be snared, slowed and nuked.\nDefile is an AoE which is centered on a random raid member. Whenever it deals damage, it grows larger and increases its damage output. This ability is extremely dangerous and the major cause of wipes in this encounter. In order to avoid Defile, the raid must be spread out and close to the outer edge of the platform.\nRight after the start of Phase 2, Val'kyrs come up next. Thus initially, the raid should group near the center, everyone on the same side (so that all Val'kyr victims are carried in the same direction). Immediately after the Val'kyr have picked up their targets, the raid should spread out, because after 5 seconds, the first Defile takes place.\nThe area in which the Val'kyr drops their victims is right where the outer ring that dropped away used to be. If a Val'kyr is summoned while the Lich King is close to the transition phase, it might be more valuable to push him to the next phase instead of killing the Val'kyr. When the Lich King resurfaces the outer ring, the victim is dropped safely on the edge, outside of Remorseless Winter.\nSoul Reaper is a very damaging debuff applied on the Lich King's current tank every 30 seconds. It's a good idea to switch tank after Soul Reaper, otherwise a combination of Soul Reaper tick plus melee hit may instantly kill the tank.\nPhase 2.5 \u2013 Remorseless Winter.\nWhen the Lich King falls below 40%, he casts Remorseless Winter again, forcing the raid to the edge of the platform. The transition is similar to the first Remorseless Winter. This time every 15 sec a Raging Spirit spawns for a total of four. Some raids like to use &lt;a href=\"DPS%20cooldowns\"&gt;DPS cooldowns&lt;/a&gt; after 15 sec, so the Raging Spirits die fast. After one minute, Phase 3 starts.\nPhase 3.\nDuring Phase 3, Arthas continues to cast Defile and Soul Reaper. Instead of Val'kyr, he summons Vile Spirits. Generally, the raid should be well distributed during Phase 3, to minimize the danger from Defile.\nAt the start of Phase 3 1-2 Raging Spirits are up, so melee DPS should kill them, while ranged deal with the Vile Spirits. Vile Spirits (10-man normal: 66,000 health; 25-man normal: 200,000) move toward raid members and explode when they reach their target. The most obvious way to deal with them is to AoE kill them before they start moving \u2014 fire mages, shadow priests, affliction warlocks and moonkins are very effective at this - but only if the spirits are grouped closely together. The Spirits move very quickly at start but slow down over time, thus snares are helpful. An effective strategy is to drag the Lich King to one edge of the room and then drag him all the way to the opposite side after Vile Spirits spawn, and kite them through Earthbind Totems and frost traps. They start with a small amount of threat on a random player but they \"can\" be both taunted and outthreated. The tank who is not tanking can taunt the Spirits onto him and absorb their damage. If your raid is low on ranged DPS, attempting to kill them may not be an effective strategy, and the phase can be survived by simply kiting the spirits and staying spread out.\nArthas also casts a new spell called Harvest Soul every 70 seconds on a random raid member, which causes 45,000 (25-man 90,000) damage over six seconds. Victims who survive this are sucked into Frostmourne (see below).\nAfter 15 minutes from when he was engaged Arthas enrages. His enrage gives him an enormous buff to his damage output, but he does not one-shot the raid when he enrages like some other major bosses; therefore it is still possible to push him into phase four (and thus defeat him) after he enrages.\nInside Frostmourne.\nInside Frostmourne, King Terenas' spirit (an NPC) fights with the Spirit Warden (a mob). Upon entering, players get the Harvest Soul buff, which increases damage done by 100%, but kills after 60 seconds. The buff is removed when leaving Frostmourne. Players leave Frostmourne when the mob is dead.\nThis means that the add must die within 60 seconds. The NPC deals nearly enough damage to do the job by himself, but he does need support. The channeled spell from the add (Soul Rip) alone is enough to kill Terenas - it must be interrupted. Tanks should take over the add. Healing classes should heal Terenas. All classes should DPS the add as much as they can, and interrupt Soul Rip. Stunning the add is also very helpful, since it heals itself for 50% damage dealt. It is vulnerable to most forms of CC and interrupts that affect Undead creatures. Restoration Druids can use form to do both healing and damage quickly while in Frostmourne.\nIf either the player or the NPC die inside Frostmourne, Arthas gains +200% damage for 15 seconds.\nPhase 4.\nAt 10% health, the Lich King casts Fury of Frostmourne. This kills all members of the raid and renders them unable to release their spirits (clicking the button displays the message \"Your soul belongs to the Lich King\"). The Lich King and Tirion will have an exchange during which Tirion destroys Frostmourne using the Ashbringer. The ghost of Terenas Menethil II will appear and resurrect the raid while the spirits that were trapped inside Frostmourne hold the Lich King in place. All raid members who have died during the fight, even from being dropped off the edge by the val'kyr, are resurrected by Terenas at this point. The Lich King becomes immobilized, and players can finish off the Lich King at their leisure.\nShould the raid decide not to accept Terenas Menethil's resurrection, Tirion Fordring melees the Lich King to death; which takes approximately one hour. All players still receive the achievement and loot if he dies in this fashion.\nRelease Bug.\nAfter the Lich King uses Fury of Frostmourne, it is normally impossible to release one's spirit. However, once Frostmourne is broken, there is a moment when the block on the release button is lifted, and players can release and be sent out of the instance (losing the kill credit). The obvious way to avoid this glitch is to avoid attempting to release at any time.\nHeroic Difficulty.\nShadow Traps in phase one spawn on people's locations, and after a few seconds, launch anyone still on them 1,000 yards off the platform (in an extremely comical manner).\nVal'kyr HP triples, however they drop their target at 50% health and fly above the raid and begin casting Siphon Life on the raid until they are killed.\nIn the third phase the entire raid will be pulled into Frostmourne instead of one person. Wicked Spirits will fall from above which must be dodged/killed. Any deaths will still result in Harvested Soul being applied to the Lich King and it can stack.\nPhase four is unchanged.\nSolo strategy.\nStand near the throne and/or one of the pillars in case a Shadow Trap goes off that was unnoticed.\nPop cooldowns on the pull and just blow the Lich King up. Cleave most (with one special exception) adds that spawn: don't waste time focusing them directly. In the 60-second intermission that starts at 70% health, Remorseless Winter does a trivial amount of damage to players attempting to solo him, so feel free to ignore it, but do focus the Ice Spheres, as they will still knock players off the platform. Try to get the Lich King below 30% health during the intermission so he cannot cast Infest and Summon Val'kyr.\nIn phase three (30%-10%), quickly burst him down so he cannot get a Harvest Souls cast off. Fury of Frostmourne will likely fail to put a dent in the soloing player's health, but the Lich King will stop at 1 health until the script event plays out.\nLoot.\nIf the Lich King is defeated while someone in the raid has &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne\"&gt;Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt; equipped on any 25-player difficulty, he will also drop the &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Chest\"&gt;Sealed Chest&lt;/a&gt;, which is only lootable by the wielder of Shadowmourne. This drop only occurs the first time that particular Shadowmourne kills the Lich King.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Together with her twin sister, they faced the horrors of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; to put their parents' souls to rest.\nBiography.\nKardan raised Lieren like any loving father would in &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, teaching her the ways of the &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;, and she became the only known human to have earned her own &lt;a href=\"stormhammer\"&gt;stormhammer&lt;/a&gt;. However, Lieren still felt like an outsider among the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; despite the insistence to the contrary of her dwarven friends, which led to an obsession with uncovering her past. One night, Lieren secretly followed Kardan to the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; retreat &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;, where she made a shocking discovery of having a twin sister named &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt;. Loania was raised by a high elf named &lt;a href=\"Voldana\"&gt;Voldana&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the truth out in the open, it is with a heavy heart that their adopted parents revealed how they both accompanied their father, a human &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Dougan\"&gt;Dougan&lt;/a&gt;, an old friend they fought beside in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, on his mission to rescue villagers from the cursed tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, brave hearts and noble intentions were not enough to defeat the evil from with in and they were forced to retreat. Dougan was killed in the process and was left behind. Feeling guilty that they hadn't gone back for their friend, Kardan and Voldana returned to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; and delivered the sad news to Dougan\u2019s wife &lt;a href=\"Adena\"&gt;Adena&lt;/a&gt;. Yet so immense was her grief that her mind snapped and she became unfit to raise her twin baby girls. After some time spent with Adena, it became clear that she might not ever recover. And so, after arranging for Adena to be cared for by a healer, Voldanna and Kardan decided to honor their friend by raising the twin girls as their own.\nWhile Lieren and Loania shared little in common aside from their appearance, they both insisted on seeing their mother. Voldana and Kardan accompanied the twins to the location of a house where their mother lived. However upon arrival of their old home, now called &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, the twins found the house to be empty. While there, they were attacked by ghouls but thanks to arrival of &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Dodds\"&gt;Watcher Dodds&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers, they were rescued. Eventually they learned from &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Commander Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; that their mother was dead. After the loss of the good paladin and neighbor, Adena had committed suicide not long after Kardan and Voldana had adopted the twins, and was then buried in &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt;. On the way to the cemetery with a &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; escort, it was discovered that Adena's corpse had been raised as one of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and was headed with other undead to attack Darkshire. The girls set off on the grisly task of freeing their mother from the rotten prison of flesh by decapitating her.\nIt was then that with their mother\u2019s soul finally laid to rest that Lieren and Loania swore an oath on her new grave in the Hinterlands, to go to Karazhan to free their father\u2019s soul as they did their mother\u2019s.\nA few years later, and the teenagers are now young women. Lieren has become an even more proficient warrior, taking on two of her friends at once in a sparing match, and even holding back. Loania, having been trained as a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, used a spell to contact their father to see if he still lives. Dougan\u2019s spirit warns them to stay away yet Lieren is determined to free him. Without Kardan and Voldana's knowledge, Loania teleports herself and Lieren from Lieren's room in Aerie Peak to Karazhan in search of their father.\nAs the twins make their way through Karazhan, Loania, being a mage, starts seeing visions. The first was a vision of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; opening the dark portal to unleash the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The second vision is of their father fighting the undead in the tower. Loania uses her vision to trace her father\u2019s foot steps which leads her to &lt;a href=\"Terestian%20Illhoof\"&gt;Terestian Illhoof&lt;/a&gt;, their father\u2019s murderer. The twins defeat him in battle but Loania is left injured. Lieren wants to get Loania to safety first before she rescues her father. They meet with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt; who ensorcells Lieren in an attempt to kill her and trap her spirit in Karazhan forever. Loania uses a spell to call out to their father once more and Dougan\u2019s spirit arrives just in time to save Lieren\u2019s life, intimidating Aran into submission. Dougan tells Lieren that it is impossible for his spirit to leave Karazhan and that he has made peace with that.\nAs danger approaches, Lieren and Loania need to teleport out of Karazhan, but Loania is so weak that Lieren offers her access to her lifeforce to beat the the tower's pull. Dougan\u2019s spirit holds off the horrors of Karazhan while Loania teleports themselves out of danger and make their escape. As Lieren could only use her lifeforce to power the spell rather than magic, the strain of the teleportation caused her hair to become streaked with white, which she uses as a reminder that she can\u2019t win every battle.\nAlthough they failed to free their father\u2019s spirit, the twins take comfort in knowing that his spirit remains unbroken, just like theirs."}

They tower above &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and can snap &lt;a href=\"elven\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; necks with single paw swipes. They are immensely strong and tough, and focus on improving their natural, bearlike natures. They disembowel &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s with their claws and crush small creatures that come within their grasp. These creatures achieve a higher level of power and feral grace; many think that ursa totemics are infused with the power of the twin bear &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;). The ursa totemic is a powerful melee fighter and can take a prodigious amount of damage before falling. Ursa totemics represent the continued evolution of their race and are strong melee combatants that rely on natural weapons and sheer toughness to see them through. The ursa totemic rends and mangles his opponents, crushes them in bear hugs, rips them apart with his jaws, and only then notices that he is bleeding from dozens of wounds.\nFurbolgs are naturally strong, tough and wild, and the ursa totemic continues to develop these qualities. Other furbolgs consider ursa totemics to be the pinnacle of their race; they pay them almost as much honor as their &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;. An ursa totemic is a great help to his tribe. Ursa totemics range into the wilderness, attacking the furbolgs' enemies - often other furbolgs (either corrupted or uncorrupted, depending on whether the ursa totemic is corrupted or not). They also tackle large, dangerous prey - creatures such as &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; beasts, &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s, and bull walruses can feed many hungry furbolgs (well, two or three of them usually). Corrupted ursa totemics terrorize forests, setting upon innocent travelers and incautious adventurers, leaving little but blood splatters and chunks of meat.\nUrsa totemics are perhaps more likely than other furbolgs to move beyond their forests' borders and take on a life of adventure. Furbolg totemics often need to continue battling against more and more powerful creatures, and sometimes they exhaust a supply of such creatures around their homes. They get bored killing weakling enemies and unresisting prey. Some ursa totemics are gripped with a burning anger at the beings who corrupted much of their race, and they stalk from their forests to destroy the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; that mutilated their people. Others make friends with &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; adventurers (or adventurers of other &lt;a href=\"races\"&gt;races&lt;/a&gt;) and find a common cause.\nUrsa totemics battle with ferocious and animalistic brutality. They drop to all fours for a quick swipe, leap to their feet for a backhand, plow into their opponents with sheer strength, and otherwise go absolutely crazy in combat. They need their mobility to make full use of their ursine skills, and armor impedes their movement. An ursa can enter a terrifying frenzy: he barrels into his opponents, roaring, swinging and biting, flinging blood and body parts into the air and he may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy.\nA totemic\u2019s hide continues to thicken and toughen and he adds layers of muscle as he progresses; his claws too lengthen, thicken and toughen, eventually becoming stronger than steel. He is adept at fighting with both claws.\nThe ursa totemic\u2019s jaws are strong enough to deal damage and he is adept at drawing his victims close so he can savage them at his leisure. He can send opponents flying with mighty sweeps of his paws, and is skilled at ripping his foes\u2019 muscles and sinews. His final method is to crush his opponents by pulling them into his muscular embrace and squeezing until he hears bones snap and feels liquid splattering onto his feet."}

{"id": "19753", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19753", "title": "Ursoc", "text": "Ursoc was an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, one of the several &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;s that were among the first living creatures to roam &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He was worshiped as a god by the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, the land he used to rule.\nBiography.\nUrsoc and Ursol are patrons of those who favor balance of nature and the living beasts of the wild. Among their most loyal followers, the furbolgs, practice their respective customs; those who follow Ursol become shamans, while the others who follow on Ursoc become hunters or warriors and carve wood statues and structures. &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; is an example, as the stronghold's entrance is a giant wood carved in the shape of a growling bear head \u2014 as homage to the twin bears. A group known as the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; also revere Ursoc.\nEarly life.\nMany millennia ago, two inquisitive bear cubs roamed the area around the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; together. These brothers, named Ursoc and Ursol, had more curiosity than good sense, and they frequently found themselves trespassing in the domains of bigger predators. Danger did not discourage them, and each one never left the other behind, even when circumstances seemed dire. They caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Keeper Freya&lt;/a&gt;, who was traveling across Azeroth in search of exceptional wild animals. Freya recognized their potential and saw what they would become. When they matured, they grew stronger and bigger than any other bears in the Grizzly Hills, and they did not suffer the ravages of aging. In time, Freya made them into &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s for their dedication to each other.\nUrsoc had a strong protective streak. The more he saw of the wilds of Azeroth, the more he felt it was his duty to preserve them. For him and other Wild Gods that were guardians of their domains, Freya crafted unique weapons, artifacts that could only become as strong as their wielder made them. Their true potential could only be unlocked with practice, nurture, and self-improvement. Some Wild Gods did not understand Freya's gifts and neglected their weapons; Ursoc was not one of them. Freya gifted him the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, forged of &lt;a href=\"titansteel\"&gt;titansteel&lt;/a&gt; and imbued with a small portion of the essence of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; herself. With no intention of letting them waste and decay, Ursoc dedicated himself to mastering their power. He trained tirelessly, every day traveling long distances and training with his brother, who had received a staff that eased the use of magic. Ursoc's titansteel claws became an extension of his own body, and Ursol became an expert in manipulating the flows of magic. Together they had become two of the most powerful Wild Gods in existence, and soon they would become known as Azeroth's staunchest defenders.\nUrsoc once fought alongside a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Eruna%20Highmountain\"&gt;Eruna Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; against servants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Believing that a great darkness was coming and the world needed strong warriors and leaders like her, Ursoc blessed Eruna's spear, &lt;a href=\"Talonclaw\"&gt;Talonclaw&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously been blessed by another Wild God named &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe would eventually father a son, &lt;a href=\"Orsonn\"&gt;Orsonn&lt;/a&gt;, and a daughter, &lt;a href=\"Kodian\"&gt;Kodian&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Ursoc and Ursol were the first to answer the call of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; to combat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. They clashed with the &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;, were eventually overwhelmed by &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s, and died defending the land.\nWhen the fighting was over, a young &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; cub found the titansteel Claws of Ursoc. Recognizing who they belonged to, he brought them back to his tribe. For generations, those furbolgs worshiped the claws as the final sign of their god. Few furbolgs had the courage to use the claws in battle, and for those that did the result was horrifying. Ursoc had spent years unlocking their potential; for an untrained mortal, they inspired an uncontrollable bloodlust that lashes out at friends as well as enemies. Eventually, Ursoc's spirit within the Emerald Dream had simply seen enough. The furbolgs were not capable of controlling his power, so he withdrew it from the claws until someone worthy would claim them. Eventually, a group of &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; wrestled the powerless claws from the furbolgs and returned them to Ursoc's spirit within the Dream.\nResurrecting.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the furbolgs of &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, starting to feel the clutch of madness, resurrected Ursoc by using the magics of the failed world tree &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Vordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. However, the mysterious evil taint that still exists within the tree soon began to overcome the furbolg and Ursoc after the resurrection, corrupting them both. After being defeated and cleansed within &lt;a href=\"Ursoc%27s%20Den\"&gt;his own cave&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Tur%20Ragepaw\"&gt;Tur Ragepaw&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, Ursoc warned them about the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, who was responsible for Vordrassil's downfall.\nHis children, Orsonn and Kodian, can be found in &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Fang%20Shrine\"&gt;Rage Fang Shrine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Heart%27s%20Blood%20Shrine\"&gt;Heart's Blood Shrine&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nLegion.\nUrsoc's spirit has resided in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; since his second death in the Grizzly Hills. A &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; adventurer sought out the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; to use in the battle against the Burning Legion, but &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s serving the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; had tainted Ursoc's domain within the Dream in pursuit of the Claws for themselves. After earning the blessing of his brother Ursol, the druid went to obtain the Claws of Ursoc. The adventurer helped Ursoc to fight off minions of the Nightmare, but it was all a trap set up by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. When the Nightmare Lord arrived Ursoc boasted that Xavius could not stand up to a god, but Xavius, saying he has been shaped by the powers of the Old Gods, captured Ursoc nonetheless.\nA Son of Ursoc appears in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; to direct the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid of the Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20Tenacity\"&gt;Essence of Tenacity&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Rokmora\"&gt;Rokmora&lt;/a&gt;, in order to power the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Idol of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; and commune with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. When Malorne becomes trapped in an &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; recreation of his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, figments of Ursoc and Ursol are seen battling demons during the War of the Ancients.\nUrsoc is a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare raid&lt;/a&gt;, fought within a &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;twisted nightmare version of Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. The Nightmare's veil lifted from him just before he died, after he had to be put down by a band of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. After Xavius was killed, Ursoc's spirit could be found within the Emerald Dream.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the events within the Nightmare, Ursoc's soul traveled to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where he fell into slumber within a &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirna%20Noch\"&gt;Tirna Noch&lt;/a&gt; to await his rebirth. A &lt;a href=\"sylvar\"&gt;sylvar&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Ara%27lon\"&gt;Ara'lon&lt;/a&gt; swore an oath to the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; to look after the bear god's wildseed and feed it with fresh &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the anima drought fell upon Ardenweald, it became increasingly difficult for Ara'lon to find new anima. One day when returning from foraging, he came across members of the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt; sacrificing the wildseeds in Tirna Noch to preserve the little anima remaining. He initially lashed out in anger, but the Winter Queen showed him a vision of how all of Ardenweald was at risk of dying. He was requested to sacrifice one soul for the forest, with the Winter Queen sympathetically acknowledging Ara'lon's pure heart and that she would honor his decision if he chose not to, but Ara'lon realized that he would have to sacrifice Ursoc's wildseed if the forest was to survive. He sorrowfully told Ursoc that he would serve the wilds one last time and asked for the bear god's forgiveness, before draining the anima from his seed and leaving it to crumble in the wind.\nIn the RPG.\nUrsoc and Ursol were well-known friends to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and hailed as gods by the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; tribes. The bears held glyph markings on their fur. Ursol and Ursoc visited the villages of the night elves, especially during festivals to the Moon. Ursol carved statues made of dead trees, while Ursoc was fond of brew. Both learned this from mortals. The brother bears would spend time allowing night elven children to mount them, and also spent time drinking ale with the night elves. Ursol and Ursoc befriended generations of night elves and humans.\nUrsoc was a strong &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;, using his paws and teeth. Combining his powers with his brother, they would strike as one at any enemy with efficiency, using strength and magic. Typically, he would employ teamwork in combat so that he could use both of their strengths simultaneously. Ursoc would leap into the fray to fight with tooth and claw, while his brother would use magic. Like his brother, he had instinct for leadership that helped to inspire his allies, but he was ferociously dedicated to his brother and would step away from an engagement if his brother was in need of help.\nIt makes sense that the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; either worship, worshiped, or are possibly even akin to Ursoc and Ursol in much the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; were to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. This is given much credence by the pandaren's shamanistic culture and \"earthy\" civilization (Ursol), combined with their feral combat skills and love of brew (Ursoc). They also appear to have a friendly disposition and seem to be similar in many other ways as well.\nThough some focus on their fierce martial aspect, Ursoc and Ursol remain primarily the patrons of those who believe in a balance between nature and all living creatures. Among the night elves, the druids of the claw take on the form of bears and wander the wilderness on a never-ending pilgrimage dedicated to the ursine Eternals. Though the destruction of the ancient Kaldorei homeland destroyed much of the land traveled by the twins, those who worship them have never given up their search for any of Ursoc's \"alewells\" and Ursol's carvings that may have survived to the present day. The furbolg are the most fervent followers of the twins in the present day, following in their magical tradition and carving their fortress, Timbermaw Hold, in the form of a gigantic, growling bear head. Timbermaw Hold is the shrine to the Ancients Ursoc and Ursol erected by the furbolgs requiring years and the labor of hundreds to construct.\nFurbolg follow in the path of the long-dead ursine demigods Ursoc and Ursol. Though written history says they perished, can Eternals who possess the immortality special quality truly die? Perhaps the \"fallen\" Eternals have simply slept away centuries while their wounds healed\u2026\nFurbolgs and night elves revere the bear twins, Ursoc and Ursol. They were friendly and helpful in the early days of Azeroth's history, attending festivals and delighting children. Ursoc was a brewer, making ales that even today the furbolgs try to mimic; and Ursol was an artisan, carving statues from dead trees. These brothers fought against Queen Azshara and her demon army and fell in battle ten thousand years ago.\nQuotes.\nLegion.\nThank you, &lt;name&gt;.

However, the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; tainted him as well, until a shaman of the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20tribe\"&gt;Timbermaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Tur%20Ragepaw\"&gt;Tur Ragepaw&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s came to cleanse the corruption in the den, freeing the spirit of the Wild God.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a dream portal opened up within a tree downhill from the Den, allowing druids exclusive access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, Guardian druids visited &lt;a href=\"Ursoc%27s%20Lair\"&gt;the Den's counterpart&lt;/a&gt; within the Emerald Dream to claim the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Wild God was captured by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes confronted &lt;a href=\"Ursoc%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;a mad and corrupted Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ursoc%27s%20Lair\"&gt;the Den's counterpart&lt;/a&gt; corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;."}

He and his twin brother &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; were worshipped as gods by the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; tribes.\nBiography.\nUrsol and Ursoc are patrons of those who favor balance of nature and the living beasts of the wild. Among their most loyal followers, the furbolgs, practice their respective customs; those who follow Ursol become shamans, while the others who follow Ursoc become hunters or warriors and carve wood statues and structures. &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; is an example, as the stronghold's entrance is a giant wood carved in the shape of a growling bear head \u2014 as an homage to the twin bears.\nEarly life.\nMany millennia ago, two inquisitive bear cubs roamed the area around the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; together. These brothers, named Ursoc and Ursol, had more curiosity than good sense, and they frequently found themselves trespassing in the domains of bigger predators. Danger did not discourage them, and each one never left the other behind, even when circumstances seemed dire. They caught the attention of &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Keeper Freya&lt;/a&gt;, who was traveling across Azeroth in search of exceptional wild animals. Freya recognized their potential and saw what they would become. When they matured, they grew stronger and bigger than any other bears in the Grizzly Hills, and they did not suffer the ravages of aging. In time, Freya made them into &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s for their dedication to each other.\nFor Ursol and other Wild Gods that were guardians of their domains, Freya crafted unique weapons, artifacts that could only become as strong as their wielder made them. Their true potential could only be unlocked with practice, nurture, and self-improvement. Some Wild Gods did not understand Freya's gifts and neglected their weapons; Ursol was not one of them. Freya gifted him a staff that eased the use of magic, and every day Ursol would train with it against his brother's own gift, the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;. Ursoc's titansteel claws became an extension of his own body, and Ursol became an expert in manipulating the flows of magic. Together they had become two of the most powerful Wild Gods in existence, and soon they would become known as Azeroth's staunchest defenders.\nDeath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Ursoc and Ursol were the first to answer the call of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; to combat the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. They clashed with the &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;, were eventually overwhelmed by fel stalkers, and died defending the land.\nLegion.\nUrsol was called to his lair in &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; to test a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s worth in retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and aiding his brother's spirit against the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. After fighting the spirits of several furbolgs loyal to Ursol, the bear god gave the druid his blessing.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; becomes trapped in an &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; recreation of his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, figments of Ursoc and Ursol are seen battling demons during the War of the Ancients.\nDragonflight.\nWhile most furbolg tribes worship both twin bears, the &lt;a href=\"Winterpelt%20Furbolg\"&gt;Winterpelt Furbolg&lt;/a&gt; worshiped only Ursoc. Eventually, they decided to beseech Ursol for his blessing and worship both once again. Ursol appeared at their long-abandoned shrine to him and gave his blessing, saying that he and his brother's paths were never meant to be taken in isolation.\nIn the RPG.\nUrsol and Ursoc were well known friends to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, and hailed as gods by the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; tribes. The bears held glyph markings on their fur. Ursol and Ursoc visited the villages of the night elves, especially during festivals to the Moon. Ursol carved statues made of dead trees, while Ursoc was fond of brew. Both learned this from mortals. The brother bears would spend time allowing night elven children to mount them, and also spent time drinking ale with the night elves. Ursol and Ursoc befriended generations of night elves and humans.\nUrsol was a fighter, warrior, healer and shaman. Combining their powers they would strike as one at any enemy with efficiency, using strength and magic. Typically, they would employ teamwork in combat so that they could use both strengths simultaneously. Ursol would move into position and use his shamanistic spells, while Ursoc lept into the fray to fight with tooth and claw. They had an instinct for leadership that helped to inspire their allies, but they were ferociously dedicated to one another and would step away from an engagement if the other was in need of help.\nIt makes sense that the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; either worship, worshipped, or are possibly even akin to Ursoc and Ursol in much the same way as the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; were to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. This is given much credence by the pandaren's shamanistic culture and \"earthy\" civilization (Ursol), combined with their feral combat skills and love of brew (Ursoc). They also appear to have a friendly disposition and seem to be similar in many other ways as well.\nThough some focus on their fierce martial aspect, Ursol and Ursoc remain primarily the patrons of those who believe in a balance between nature and all living creatures. Among the night elves, the druids of the claw take on the form of bears and wander the wilderness on a never-ending pilgrimage dedicated to the ursine Eternals. Though the destruction of the ancient Kaldorei homeland destroyed much of the land traveled by the twins, those who worship them have never given up their search for any of Ursol's carvings and Ursoc's \"alewells\" that may have survived to the present day. The furbolg are the most fervent followers of the twins in the present day, following in their magical tradition and carving their fortress, Timbermaw Hold, in the form of a gigantic, growling bear head. Timbermaw Hold is the shrine to the Ancients Ursol and Ursoc erected by the furbolgs requiring years and the labor of hundreds to construct.\nFurbolg follow in the path of the long-dead ursine demigods Ursoc and Ursol. Though written history says they perished, can Eternals who possess the immortality special quality truly die? Perhaps the \"fallen\" Eternals have simply slept away centuries while their wounds healed\u2026\nFurbolgs and night elves revere the bear twins, Ursol and Ursoc. They were friendly and helpful in the early days of Azeroth's history, attending festivals and delighting children. Ursol was an artisan, carving statues from dead trees; and Ursoc was a brewer, making ales that even today the furbolgs try to mimic. These brothers fought against Queen Azshara and her demon army and fell in battle ten thousand years ago."}

Based on this one can optimise code.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php%3Fid%3D4843\"&gt;LuaProfiler&lt;/a&gt; allows you to trace functions calls and reports how much time was spent in that function (on average and peak).\n&lt;a href=\"Warmup\"&gt;Warmup&lt;/a&gt; has helped me a lot when there were issues with long times of zoning. It can also show how much memory is taken by which add-on - with some limitation for embedded libraries (add-ons with embedded libraries show a larger footprint than they really use, after garbage collection).\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//svn.wowace.com/root/trunk/%21BugGrabber/\"&gt;BugGrabber&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//svn.wowace.com/root/trunk/BugSack/\"&gt;BugSack&lt;/a&gt; (both links are to SVN repository) are useful bug catching improvements. BugSack records all errors (including those fired during startup) for later examination.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/klhperformance-monitor.aspx\"&gt;KLHPerformanceMonitor&lt;/a&gt; tracks the memory allocation and CPU usage of all the mods running. You can report on the memory usage and CPU time of the top 10 mods.\nBuilt-in Profiling Support.\nAs of patch 2.1.0, built-in memory and CPU profiling is available. See &lt;a href=\"2.1.0_consolidated_API_changes%23Memory_Profiling\"&gt;2.1.0_consolidated_API_changes#Memory_Profiling&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"2.1.0_consolidated_API_changes%23CPU_Profiling\"&gt;2.1.0_consolidated_API_changes#CPU_Profiling&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe following will show the current CPU profiling setting, in case you think you accidentally left it on:\n /script ChatFrame1:AddMessage(tostring(GetCVar(\"scriptProfile\")))"}

Or perhaps you just want to alternate between two offhand weapons with just one hotkey.\n #showtooltip [mod] 0 16; 17\n /equipslot 17 0 16\nSuppressing Sound and Error Messages.\nSound and Message Error Cleaner.\nWhen you spam a spell you get sounds and error messages that can be annoying. Using the macro below you will avoid all that.\nThis example is a macro which you can use to spam Arcane Missiles. It will not cut an already channeling Arcane Missile cast, nor will it make the error sound or spam your screen with error messages.\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 0\n /run UIErrorsFrame:UnregisterEvent(\"UI_ERROR_MESSAGE\")\n /cast [nochanneling:Arcane Missiles] Arcane Missiles\n /run UIErrorsFrame:RegisterEvent(\"UI_ERROR_MESSAGE\") \n /console Sound_EnableSFX 1\nNo Error Text or Sound (Improved).\nFor people that macro cd's into normal spells, such as petattacks, trinkets, everlasting potions, etc. it gets annoying being spammed with \"This ability is not ready\" and that fun error sound. I've seen a common solution online (similar to the macro above) that fixes this problem with a single issue that's almost as bad as the problem it's fixing.\nFor people who play without sound to begin with, these macro will -enable your sound- every time you use them. So here is my solution:\n /run sfx=GetCVar(\"Sound_EnableSFX\");\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 0\n /cast ExampleTrinket1\n /cast ExampleSpell2\n /run UIErrorsFrame:Clear() \n /run SetCVar(\"Sound_EnableSFX\",sfx);\nThe overall effect is the same, but my macro checks to see what you sound currently is set to (enabled or disabled), disables it for the error, and then sets it back where you had it. (ex: if your sound was already off, it will prevent the text error without turning your sound on at the end)\nNo Error Text or Sound (Improved Again).\nThis is just like the one above but with an added tooltip that matches the original skill, and doesn't disable sound for the skill's error messages. Sound and error messages for the trinket use are still suppressed though. If you set the name of the macro to a blank space, you can't even tell it's a macro. This one is designed more for trinket use than anything else, but it's here for when you only want to silence one of the two skills this macro uses.\n #showtooltip ExampleSpell1\n /run sfx=GetCVar(\"Sound_EnableSFX\");\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 0\n /use ExampleTrinket2\n /run UIErrorsFrame:Clear() \n /run SetCVar(\"Sound_EnableSFX\",sfx);\n /cast ExampleSpell1\nIf you're running low on characters and you're using this for a trinket, you can replace the use command with \"use 13\" (for upper trinket) or \"use 14\" (for lower trinket).\nSuppress Error Text and Sound (Shadowlands).\n #showtooltip Fishing\n /equipset Fishing\n /console Sound_EnableErrorSpeech \"0\"\n /use Darkmoon Fishing Cap\n /run UIErrorsFrame:Hide() C_Timer.After(0, function() UIErrorsFrame:Clear() UIErrorsFrame:Show() end)\n /console Sound_EnableErrorSpeech \"1\"\n /use Fishing\nSuppresses error text and sound to make trinket spamming less painful. \nTraining and Levelling.\nLearn all Spells from a Trainer.\n /run LoadAddOn\"Blizzard_TrainerUI\" f=ClassTrainerTrainButton f.e = 0 if f:GetScript\"OnUpdate\" then f:SetScript(\"OnUpdate\", nil)else f:SetScript(\"OnUpdate\", function(f,e) f.e=f.e+e if f.e&gt;.01 then f.e=0 f:Click() end end)end\nTanks: Check unhittability and avoidance (+ how far away hard-defcap).\n /run local b,d,p,r,a=GetBlockChance(),GetDodgeChance(),GetParryChance(),GetCombatRating(CR_DEFENSE_SKILL) a=1/(.0625+.956/(r/122.9625)) ChatFrame1:AddMessage(format(\"Unhittable: %.2f%% Avoidance: %.2f%% Defense %+.0f rating\",b+d+p+5+a,d+p+5+a,r-689))\nGear By iLevel.\n /run t={}; for i=1,18 do if i~=4 then l=GetInventoryItemLink('player',i); if l then _,_,_,v=GetItemInfo(l); table.insert(t,{l=l,v=v}); end end end sort(t, function(a,b) return a.v&gt;b.v end ) for i,v in pairs(t) do print(v.v..'

Please feel free to request in the discussion page other dailies you would like to see added here, and anything you find wrong with this daily. Hotkey this and enjoy never searching your bags for your quest items that need using every day. 255 characters exactly!\nShow/hide cloak.\n /run ShowCloak(not ShowingCloak())\nShow/hide helm.\n /run ShowHelm(not ShowingHelm())\nSwitch language.\n /run c,d,i,p=DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME,GetDefaultLanguage,GetLanguageByIndex,player;l=(d(p)==i(1) and 2 or 1);if c.editBox.language~=d(p)then c.editBox.language=d(p)else c.editBox.language=i(l)end;c:AddMessage(\"Language set to : \"..c.editBox.language);\nWhere Am I?\n /script local px,py=GetPlayerMapPosition(\"player\"); print(format(\"%s (%.1f, %.1f)\",GetZoneText(),px*100,py*100))\nAttack / Shoot / Throw.\n #showtooltip [nomodifier] attack; [modifier] Shoot (or Throw)\n /startattack\n /cast [modifier] Shoot (or Throw)\nThis will act like a normal Attack button, except that it won't toggle autoattack off in combat (hit escape if you need to do that). It will also show your current weapon when assigned to a quickslot. You may want to leave out the references to Shoot or Throw, or perhaps make them more precise by using [modifier:shift] or some such, depending on your style of play.\nThe above will attempt to shoot, throw or even fish (depending on what you have equipped) For Hunters change \"Thrown\" to \"Gun\" \"Crossbow\" or \"Bow\", remove \"Throw\" and change \"Shoot\" to \"Auto Shot\".\n #shoot\n /cast !Shoot\nThis macro will start shooting wand, but will not toggle it off.\nKeeping space, switching actions.\nTemplate.\nThis principle is for those of us who like to keep buttons as few as possible or to bind as much actions as possible.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [combat] [harm,nodead] &lt;Badass spell&gt;\n /cast [target=mouseover,help,nodead,exists] [help,nodead] [] &lt;Fluffy spell&gt;\nor\n #showtooltip\n /cast [mod:ctrl,target=player] [target=mouseover,help,nodead,exists] [help,nodead] &lt;Fluffy spell&gt;\n /cast [harm,nodead] &lt;Badass spell&gt;; &lt;Fluffy spell&gt;\nwill select actions based on the situation.\nThe first template is better to combine with exclusively non-combat beneficial spells and items, like Arcane Intellect or food &amp; water (see below). The second template is better for use with beneficial spells which you're likely to use in combat (any heal or blessing, for example). The icon will allow you to see what exactly you're going to cast. Note that you can cast the beneficial spell on yourself by mouseovering the player frame, so \"mod:ctrl\" (or \"alt\") condition can better be used to modify the spells (example below).\nDirect damage / buff spell.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [nomod:ctrl,harm,nodead] Fireball, [mod:ctrl,harm,nodead] Pyroblast\n /cast [target=mouseover,help,nodead,exists] [nomod:ctrl,help,nodead] Arcane Intellect\n /cast [mod:ctrl,help,nodead] Arcane Brilliance\nThis convenient macro will cast Fireball / Pyroblast (depending on whether or not \"Ctrl\" was pressed) on a harmable target, Arcane Intellect on selected or mouseovered friendly target (mouseover the player frame to buff yourself), and Arcane Brilliance on a friendly target if \"Ctrl\" was pressed.\nAoE harmful / direct beneficial.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [target=mouseover,help,nodead,exists] [help,nodead] Flash of Light\n /cast [nomod:ctrl] Consecration; [mod:ctrl] Consecration(Rank 1)\nSince AoE spells are often used to search for rogues, they require a template which will force them to be used under any circumstances except when something friendly is mouseovered or directly targeted.\nCombat spell / food &amp; drink.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [combat] [harm,nodead] &lt;Combat spell&gt;\n /use &lt;Water&gt;\n /use &lt;Food&gt;\nA very good use for these macros is to put food &amp; water on them so you'll never have to click something by mouse when grinding!\n\"Some of these macros have not yet been tested directly but the overall principle works.\"\nParties.\nAnnounce Vent in Party.\n /party My Guild Vent | abc.leetvent.com\n /party My Guild Vent | 1234\n /party My Guild Vent | secretpassword\n /party Normalize Vent - http://some.vent.server/somewhere\n /threshold rare\nRaiding.\nAnnounce Vent in Raid.\n /rw Vent Details Posted\n /raid My Guild Vent | abc.leetvent.com\n /raid My Guild Vent | 1234\n /raid My Guild Vent | secretpassword\n /raid Normalize Vent - http://some.vent.server/somewhere\n /threshold epic\n /master player\nTargets.\nSwap focus / target.\n /stopmacro [noexists][target=focus,noexists]\n /target focus\n /targetlasttarget\n /focus\n /targetlasttarget \nFor more information about the focus and how to use it, see &lt;a href=\"Focus%20target\"&gt;Focus target&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdvanced swap focus / target.\n /focus [target=focus, noexists]\n /target [combat, noexists] focus\n /clearfocus [nocombat, noexists]\n /stopmacro [target=focus, noexists]\n /target focus\n /targetlasttarget\n /focus [exists]\n /targetlasttarget\nSets the focus if you don't have one; clears the focus if you're out of combat and don't have a target; targets the focus if you're in combat and don't have a target; otherwise swaps the target and focus.\nAcquire focus target / toggle between previous target.\n /clearfocus [modifier:ctrl]\n /targetlasttarget [modifier:shift]\n /stopmacro [target=target, dead]/[modifier:shift]\n /focus [target=focus, noexists]/[target=focus, dead]\n /stopmacro [modifier:ctrl]\n /target focus\nHow to use: If no target=does nothing. If you have a target but no focus target, it makes target focus target. Once focus target is acquired and current target is anything but focus target= switches active target focus target. Hold down Control + activate = replaces focus target with current target (or clears if no current target). Hold down shift + activate = toggles between current target &amp; last target.\nReplace either ctrl or shift with alt if that modifier key works better for you. Also, it will not let you add a focus target that is dead. If you want to focus corpses just delete the \"[target=target, dead]/\" from line 3 and \"/[target=focus, dead]\" from line 4.\nCast on moused-over unit.\n /cast [target=mouseover, exists][] Name Of Spell\nThe player or mob that is under your mouse pointer will be the one that is hit or healed by your spell. If there is nothing there, your selected target will be used.\n&lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;Crowd Control&lt;/a&gt; stays on 1 mob.\n /focus [target=focus, exists, nodead] focus; [btn:2][] target\n /cast [target=focus] Shackle Undead\nReplace Shackle Undead with a spell name &lt;a href=\"Crowd_control%23Crowd_Control_abilities_of_different_classes\"&gt;appropriate to your class&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe purpose of this macro is to eliminate micro-management of CC. Once a target is identified for control, another target may be selected for healing or damage, and the controlled target will be the victim of renewed control until it is dead.\nIt is common for people to add a shout (e.g.: codice_1) to warn off would-be sheep-breakers.\nRaid icons, Lucky Charms.\n /script &lt;a href=\"API%20SetRaidTarget\"&gt;SetRaidTarget&lt;/a&gt;(\"target\", n)\nwhere n is:\nand 0 is no icon. It's more helpful when used in the same macro call as preparing to sheep (when you as mage are leader) and other CC preps. Alone, this command line isn't that useful unless with a key binding, since you can just rightclick the unit frame to change the icon.\nLucky Charms with Mouseover.\n /script SetRaidTarget(\"mouseover\", n)\nCombined with key bindings, this macro makes for extremely fast marking. See above for corresponding values for \"n.\"\nTank assist macros.\n /focus [modifier:shift] target\n /target [modifier:alt] focus\n /target [nomodifier:shift/alt] targettarget\nThis macro sets the focus with shift-button, targets it with alt-button, and targets the target of the focus with the button itself. Useful for DPS trying to target what the tank is targeting in a pack, or just to keep track of a polymorphed target.\nor:\n /focus [modifier:alt]\n /stopmacro [modifier:alt]\n /cleartarget\n /assist focus\nBegin by selecting the MT/MA and then click the assist macro with the alt pressed.\nIf no Focus (MT/MA) has been set and the macro is clicked, you will receive a UI message stating \"Unknown Unit.\"\nIf you have set your Focus and just click the macro, you will assist the MT/MA and target his or her target.\nBandages.\nHeavy Netherweave Bandage on self.\n /use [target=player] Heavy Netherweave Bandage\nThis macro will always use Heavy Netherweave Bandages on yourself, regardless of target.\nHeavy Netherweave Bandage friendly then self.\n /use [help,nomodifier:alt] Heavy Netherweave Bandage; [target=player] Heavy Netherweave Bandage\nThis macro will use a Heavy Netherweave Bandage on your target if you can, yourself otherwise.\nIf you hold down ALT, you will always bandage yourself.\nSpecify target by modifier key.\n /use [modifier:alt,target=player] Heavy Netherweave Bandage\n /use [modifier:ctrl,target=pet] Heavy Netherweave Bandage\n /use [help] Heavy Netherweave Bandage\nBags and money.\nSell all grey items.\n /script for bag = 0, 4 do for slot = 1, GetContainerNumSlots(bag) do local name = GetContainerItemLink(bag,slot) if name and string.find(name,\"ff9d9d9d\") then DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage(\"Selling \"..name) UseContainerItem(bag,slot) end end end\nMail all green items (Good for mailing greens to be disenchanted).\n /run for bag=0,4 do for slot=1,GetContainerNumSlots(bag) do local texture,itemCount,locked,quality=GetContainerItemInfo(bag,slot) if quality==2 then UseContainerItem(bag,slot) end end end\nThe mailbox must be open on the Send tab (preferably with a To: name typed in) to use this.\nGet all money from mail items (Good for Auction House sales).\n /script CheckInbox() for m = GetInboxNumItems(), 1, -1 do TakeInboxMoney( m ) end\nIf there is any money in any of your mail messages it will be collected. As for the Auction House messages, once the money is collected the message will be removed. Your mailbox must be open before the script will work.\nGet all items from mail (edit of macro above).\n /script CheckInbox() for m = GetInboxNumItems(), 1, -1 do TakeInboxItem( m ) end\nThis macro will remove any items in your mailbox. Your mailbox must be open before the script will work.\nSwap carried &amp; bank bags.\n /script PickupInventoryItem(20) PickupInventoryItem(71)\n /script PickupInventoryItem(21) PickupInventoryItem(70)\n /script PickupInventoryItem(22) PickupInventoryItem(69)\n /script PickupInventoryItem(23) PickupInventoryItem(68)\nUse: Swap your four bags with the first four bags in the bank. You have to be in the bank and open the window before you use the macro. It is very helpful if you have bags with your tools and other stuff you need for your jobs.\nOpen all bags.\n /script OpenAllBags()\nThis macro opens all bags, the same as pressing shift-B in the default keybindings. Useful if you want to put a button for this on an action bar.\nOpen all bags but leftmost one.\n /run o=OpenAllBags c=CloseAllBags i=IsBagOpen cw=CloseBag if i(0) and i(1) and i(2) and i(3) and not i(4) then c() cw(0); else if i(0) or i(1) or i(2) or i(3) or i(4) then c() cw(0) o() cw(4) else o() cw(4) end;end\nOne could find this macro useful if playing as a Warlock and wanting to open all bags at once but the SoulBag.\nPlease note: My SoulBag is the leftmost one but one can easily replace the code in the script above to leave closed whichever she prefers.\n\"Background information:\" In v2.3.3.7799 the \"CloseAllBags\" function is buggy: under certain conditions, it ignores the backpack. This fact led the macro author to create a longer macro than he would have preferred.\nQuests.\nOne-click &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Skyguard&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt; dailies.\n #show [mounted]Skyguard Bombs; Fel Gland\n /use [mounted]Skyguard Bombs\n /use [mounted]Skyguard Blasting Charges\n /target [mounted]Diso\n /use [mounted]Booterang\n /stopmacro [mounted]\n /use Banishing Crystal\n /use Yarzill's Mutton\n /use Wrangling Rope\nThese are all items used in the pre-2.4 daily quests put together in a single button. If you choose the Question Mark for the icon, it will show while mounted and the number of you have while dismounted. It won't show the cooldown on the blasting charges nor the number of Apexis Shards you possess - unless you change the #show line, of course.\nNote that this will not work for druids in flight form.\nOne-click &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; dailies.\n #show [mounted]&lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Charges%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;item:34475&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;a href=\"Mana%20Remnants\"&gt;item:34338&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Banner\"&gt;item:34414&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Astromancer%27s%20Crystal\"&gt;item:34533&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Attuned%20Crystal%20Cores\"&gt;item:34368&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Remnants\"&gt;item:34338&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Razorthorn%20Flayer%20Gland\"&gt;item:34255&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Bash%27ir%20Phasing%20Device\"&gt;item:34248&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20Armament\"&gt;item:34500&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Murloc%20Control\"&gt;item:34483&lt;/a&gt;\n /use &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Charges\"&gt;item:34475&lt;/a&gt;\n /use 1\n /use [btn:2]&lt;a href=\"Flaming%20Oil\"&gt;item:34489&lt;/a&gt;\nThere are so many quest items associated with Quel'Danas dailies that they all had to be converted to item ID format to save space. If you choose the Question Mark for the icon, it will show while mounted and the number of you have while dismounted.\nThe macro normally attempts to use every item available to the quests \"except\" Flaming Oil. To use the oil, right-click the macro button instead. (If you prefer the ALT key, change btn:2 to mod:alt.) This distinction was made due to the oil's ability to override Arcane Charges.\nEquipment of &lt;a href=\"Multiphase%20Spectrographic%20Goggles\"&gt;Multiphase Spectrographic Goggles&lt;/a&gt; has also been omitted from the macro since it would become equipped too early, and decrease player stats for the other dailies. Here are the omitted lines, but they make the macro too long. Remove any 1 quest that you prefer to skip, and replace codice_2 with:\n /equip [mounted]item:35233\n /use 1\n /equip [noworn:1]item:#####\n... where ##### is the item number of your standard helm. Be sure to use the macro as you fly into Nagrand.\nList objectives.\n /script i = GetNumQuestLeaderBoards(); for j = 1, i, 1 do a1, a2, a3 = GetQuestLogLeaderBoard(j); SendChatMessage(a1, \"PARTY\"); end;\nUse: Sends your current quest objectives to party chat. This way, you don't have to constantly type to party members how many of each creature you need to complete a quest.\nbugged: always displays the first item, even if it's not being tracked.\nBypass turn-in dialogue.\n /script SelectGossipAvailableQuest(1)\n /script SelectGossipActiveQuest(1)\n /script CompleteQuest()\n /script SelectGossipOption(1)\n /script AcceptQuest()\n /script GetQuestReward(1)\nThis macro will do the following: Attempt to bypass any initial dialogue with an NPC (such as a banker or flightmaster, or any NPC with only one quest available), Select the first quest reward available (can be dangerous if you get too addicted to this macro), Turn in a quest. Credit goes to www.Feign.org from back in the halcyon days of CC Rep farming when it was possible to get a quest done twice in one go - with a fast mount and mad skills.\nDo not add the command /startattack no matter how tempting it is, you'll inevitably find yourself turning in a quest in a neutral town with an opposing-faction player standing in close proximity behind the quest NPC - with hilarious consequences. Add the line /cast [insert skill/spell of choice here] at the end of macro to make it truly vital. The druid version, for example, casts Faerie Fire or Faerie Fire (Feral) depending on whether the druid is in form or not.\nAutomatically Abandon the First Quest in the Quest Log.\nThis macro can be used to abandon a quest without clicking the abandon button and confirming your decision. It's most useful to perform this repeatedly to clear out your quest log.\n /script SelectQuestLogEntry(1); SetAbandonQuest(); AbandonQuest();\nDrinking.\nMana Potion / Water.\nThis macro will use a mana potion if you're in combat, or your favorite beverage when not in combat. Use the icon and it will show which one will be used. Substitute your item names:\n /use [combat] Super Mana Potion; [nocombat] Filtered Draenic Water\nWater / Manna Biscuit.\nThis will use Purified Dranic Water on normal click and Conjured Manna Biscuits on shift-, alt- or ctrl-click if found in your inventory.\n #showtooltip\n /use [nomodifier]Purified Draenic Water; [modifier] Conjured Manna Biscuit\nThis macro will use your Manna Biscuits if you have any, if not will use your Naaru Rations.\n #showtooltip Naaru Ration\n /use Conjured Manna Biscuit\n /use Naaru Ration\nMana / Healing / Dreamless Sleep Potions.\nThis macro will use a Super Mana Potion with a normal click, a Super Healing Potion with a alt- click or a Major Dreamless Sleep Potion with a ctrl- click. You can change the potions to whatever suits you best.\n /use [nomodifier]Super Mana Potion; [modifier:alt ] Super Healing Potion;[modifier:ctrl] Major Dreamless Sleep Potion\nRacial abilities.\nForsaken.\nOne-key &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Will of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cannibalize\"&gt;Cannibalize&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis macro will use Will of the Forsaken if in combat, or Cannibalize if not in combat: \n #showtooltip\n /cast [nocombat,mod:alt] Will of the Forsaken\n /cast [combat,mod:alt] Cannibalize\n /cast [combat] Will of the Forsaken\n /cast [nocombat] Cannibalize\nNotice that holding down the alt button will reverse the abilities, letting the user execute Will of the Forsaken outside of combat or Cannibalize inside of combat. This manual override is included because though Will of the Forsaken is mostly a combat ability and Cannibalize is a non-combat ability, there are times when it is useful otherwise. For example, if a mob &lt;a href=\"fear\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt;s the player just before dying, the combat condition might be cancelled but the player runs the risk of inadventently moving into the &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; range of another mob and &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;ing. Likewise, during a particularly long encounter a player may need to break from combat and Cannibalize to regain health while the rest of the party is still engaged.\nCooking.\nThis consolidates the cooking button, and creating a fire. This is separated with simple left/right-click logic.\n #showtooltip Cooking\n /use [button:1] Cooking\n /cast [button:2] Basic Campfire\nFishing.\nTwo Modifier Swap.\n /equip [noequipped:Fishing Poles, nomodifier:alt] Seth's Graphite Fishing Pole\n /equip [modifier:alt] Mana Wrath\n /equip [modifier:alt] Lamp of Peaceful Radiance\n /cast [equipped:Fishing Poles, nomodifier:alt] Fishing\nThis macro is handy in that on a regular click (or hotkey press) it will equip your fishing pole (simply change Seth's Graphite Fishing Pole to the name of whichever pole you use), and when pressed again will begin fishing. On an alt-click (or alt+hotkey) it will re-equip your normal weapon(s). If you use a two hand weapon, simply take out the third line and change Mana Wrath to your own main weapon, otherwise if you use two change Mana Wrath and Lamp of Peaceful Radiance to your own particular weapons. This macro also avoids any error messages from popping up. You could also add to this macro to have it swap out a Lucky Fishing Hat or gloves with the fishing enchant as well, if you had them.\n2H Coordinate Swap 1.\nAnother, more simple, fishing macro is this: \n #showtooltip Fishing\n /cast [button:1] Fishing\n /use [button:2] x y\nReplace x and y with the container location of your fishing pole (bag slot and item slot respectively.) A right-click will equip or unequip a fishing pole, and a left click will cast a lure. Note though that this macro only works with two-handed weapons and not a single-handed weapon and an offhand item, shield, or weapon; if you are going to use other than a two-handed item, use the first macro.\n2H Coordinate Swap 2.\nHere is a more elaborate version:\n #showtooltip Fishing\n /equip [noequipped:Fishing Poles, nomodifier:alt] x y\n /equip [modifier:alt] x y\n /cast [equipped:Fishing Poles, nomodifier:alt, nomodifier:ctrl] Fishing\n /use [modifier:ctrl] x z\n /use [modifier:ctrl] 16\nIt will equip your fishing pole if not equipped, or cast Fishing. If you hold alt it will equip your weapon. If you hold ctrl it will use a fishing lure. The bag number is x, y is the slot your fishing pole is in, z is the slot for the lures. Again this works best if you have a two-handed weapon.\nOutfitter + Coordinate Swap.\nHere is a complete fishing macro that utilizes the Outfitter add-on:\n #showtooltip [mod:shift] 4 17; [mod:ctrl] 4 13;Fishing\n /cast [equipped:Fishing Pole, nomod:shift, nomod:ctrl] Fishing\n /use [mod:shift, equipped:Fishing Pole] 4 17\n /use [mod:shift, equipped:Fishing Pole] 16\n /stopmacro [nomod:ctrl]\n /outfitter toggle Fishing\nWhere x y and z i are the bag locations of your lure and your pole, respectively. With no modifiers and a fishing pole equipped, this will cast fishing. With shift held and a fishing pole equipped, it will use your lure. With control pressed, it will toggle the \"Fishing\" outfit using Outfitter, which will automatically unequip your fishing outfit if you enter combat.\nCount fish.\n #show Speckled Tastyfish\nIf you want to keep track of how many of a specific kind of fish you have, use the icon and this macro.\nAutolure.\nThis macro is useful to automatically set a lure to your fishing pole, if you're a using a shortcut to /cast fishing.\n /cast \"Lure\"\n /equip \"Pole\"\n /cast Fishing\nIf no lure is active, then it'll cast one, if a lure is active, then it'll simply just fish.\nChange \"Lure\" to the name of whichever lure you are using and \"Pole\" to the name of whichever pole you are using.\nAnnounce resurrection target.\n /run R=R or CreateFrame(\"Frame\")R:RegisterEvent(\"UNIT_SPELLCAST_SENT\")R:SetScript(\"OnEvent\",function(R,E,T,T,T,T)SendChatMessage(\"Rezzing \"..(T or UnitName(\"mouseover\")),\"YELL\")R:UnregisterEvent(E)end)\n /cast Rebirth\nThis macro yells out the intent to resurrect someone (\"Rezzing Name\", or Corpse of Name if released) as the spell is cast. Coordination of rezzers saves mana and time, especially after a raid wipe.\nRebirth is the druid rez; it leaves you with 40 letters to improve upon the message. The longest-named rez in the game, Ancestral Spirit, leaves 31 letters.\nIt may be possible to find an AddOn that does the work of this macro - however, it was not always possible to identify a ghost player with a spell. Many rezzers have been witnessed making the bizarre claim \"Rezzing &lt;no target&gt;\".\nToggle gathering.\n /castsequence [nocombat] find herbs, find minerals\nSimple &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; now that changes between &lt;a href=\"Find%20Herbs\"&gt;Find Herbs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Find%20Minerals\"&gt;Find Minerals&lt;/a&gt; - bind it to a mouse key and you can change it every few second or so as you run along.\nFor &lt;a href=\"hunters\"&gt;hunters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warlocks\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; it is easy to add in the other tracks, or make your own. Simply substitute for one of the finds below, or add on to the end, separated only by a comma. I have included some examples here.\nThe [nocombat] check in the macros is so you don't accidentally trigger a global cooldown in combat.\n /script T,F=T or 0,F or CreateFrame(\"frame\")if X then X=nil else X=function()local t=GetTime()if t-T&lt;3 or not IsMounted() or UnitAffectingCombat(\"player\")then return;end;SetTracking(t%2+1)T=t end end F:SetScript(\"OnUpdate\",X) \nMacro that allow you alternate tracking automatically,once active tracking herb and tracking mine will be alternated every 3 sec,it will be inactive if you run this macro again.\nThis macro will not active if you are mounted or in combat,you can delete [or not IsMounted()]or[or UnitAffectingCombat(\"player\")] to have it be active when you are mounted and in combat\nFollow with emote.\n /follow\n /script if UnitIsPlayer(\"target\") and UnitIsFriend(\"player\",\"target\") and CheckInteractDistance(\"target\",4) and not IsControlKeyDown() then SendChatMessage(\"is following \"..UnitName(\"target\")..\".\",\"EMOTE\") end\nThis macro is equivalent to following a unit - like using the \"/f\" command - and typing \"/me is following %t.\"\nIf /follow is likely to fail or the control key is down, there is no emote.\nBattleground.\n /yell \"%n, stop running so I can heal you!\"\nThis is a simple macro for a healer in a battleground. Often your heal targets will be running away from battle, so you must tell them to stop running.\nBattle map.\n /script BattlefieldMinimap_LoadUI() if BattlefieldMinimap:IsVisible() then MiniMapBattlefieldFrame.status = \"\"; BattlefieldMinimap:Hide() else MiniMapBattlefieldFrame.status = \"active\"; BattlefieldMinimap:Show() end\nThis macro will toggle the battle map in every region, just like in the battlegrounds and the areas with outdoor pvp. Take care to combine lines 2 through 4 as shown above into a single line (put a space at the end of each line and remove the linebreak).\nShift- M toggles the battlemap for all zones without the need for this macro.\nThere is also an option in the menu &lt;esc&gt; &lt;Interface Options&gt; to control default settings of the battlemap.\nWorld map.\n /script ToggleFrame(WorldMapFrame);\nThis macro will toggle the world map, just like pressing \"M\" with the default keybinding. The ToggleWorldMap() API apparently does not work in a macro. Useful if you want to put a button for this on an action bar.\nWhile these macros are useful for switching weapons with different names, if you have 2 weapons with the same name, which often happens when you wish to have different enchants, WoW will not know which you are referring to using a name or an item ID. This is remedied by using a mod like Baud Gear which keeps track of individual pieces of gear.\nEasy equip off-hand.\nSee the top section for an offhand swapping macro.\n /equipslot 17 *Your weapon name*\nUse: Equips the weapon you choose into your off-hand instead of your main, so you can switch back and forth between 2-Handed/1-Handed+Shield sets and Dual Wielding easily. (Select the question mark for your picture, so the icon is your weapon of choice.)\n /equipslot [equipped:Two-Hand] 16 *One-Hand Weapon name*\n /equipslot [equipped:Two-Hand] 17 *Shield name*\n /equipslot [equipped:One-Hand] 16 *Two-Hand Weapon name*\nAbove macro allows you to quickly interchange your One-Handed+Shield with Two-Handed weapon. When One-Hand+Shield is equipped it will equip Two-Handed weapon and viceversa. Select the question mark for your picture, so the icon is your weapon of choice. Change the names of weapons and shield to the ones you currently use. If you wish to use Dual-Wield instead of One-Hand+Shield just change the second line to the weapon instead of the shield\n /equip [equipped:Two-Hand] *DPS One-Hand Weapon name*\n /equip [equipped:Two-Hand] *Off-Hand Weapon name*\n /equip [equipped:One-Hand] *Tanking Weapon name*\n /equip [equipped:One-Hand] *Shield name*\n /equip [equipped:Shields] *Two-Hand Weapon name*\nThis macro will cycle through three sets of weapons (NOTE: If you use the same main-hand weapon for both DPS and Tanking the third line is not necessary)\nCycle (Starting with Two-Hand equipped):\nNote: Will \"double switch\" trying to re-equip tanking weapons prior to Two-Hand. At the moment, I don't know how to check for One-Hand weapon in Off-Hand slot (if I did this \"double switch\" would not exist as that would be the requirement for equipping a shield.\nPossible Work around is to configure this to Cntrl Alt Shift and/or no modifier\n /equipslot [modifier:alt] 17 *Shield name*\n /equipslot [modifier:alt] 16 *One-Hand Weapon name*\n /equipslot [nomodifier] 16 *Two-Hand Weapon name*\n /equipslot [modifier:shift] 17 *Offhand Weapon*\n /equipslot [modifier:shift] 16 *MainHand Weapon name*\nUse or swap trinket.\n #showtooltip\n /use [nobutton:2] Z\n /equipslot [button:2] Z X Y\nThis will use the trinket in slot Z, unless you click button 2, in which case it will equip the trinket at bag coordinates X,Y. Useful for engineers with multiple trinkets on separate cooldowns (i.e. Goblin Mortar and Goblin Dragon Gun in slot 13, Goblin Bomb Dispenser and Mithril Mechanical Dragonling in slot 14).\nUse either trinket.\nThis macro activates the upper trinket if it is not on cooldown. If it is on cooldown, the macro tries to activate the lower trinket. This is useful if you have two trinkets on short cooldowns that do similar things (add attack power, add spell damage, add healing, etc.). You will get an error that one item is not ready every time you use this macro.\n /use 13\n /use 14\nHere is another example using /castsequence and setting the reset timer to your primary trinket's cooldown. When you use the first trinket (use the '?' icon!) you will see the icon switch to your second trinket. If you use your second trinket or wait the reset time it will switch back to your primary trink. Like above, this is useful for trinkets that do similar things, as shown in this example.\n /castsequence reset=90 Bladefist's Breadth, Blackhand's Breadth\nAnother version of this macro is this: \n /use [button:1] 13\n /use [button:2] 14\nThis macro is useful if you have trinkets that do dissimilar things. Left-clicking the macro will use the first trinket, right-clicking the macro will use the second trinket.\nThis example disables the annoying sound you get when your trinkets are on cooldown (credit to Syrloin on Steemwheedle Cartel):\n /run SetCVar(\"Sound_EnableSFX\",\"0\")\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /run SetCVar(\"Sound_EnableSFX\",\"1\")\n /castsequence X, Y, Z\nThis is the same as the previous one but also disables the red error messages. In addition, the sound issue can be solved with fewer characters leaving you with extra characters for those long spell names. And the icon and tooltip of the substantive spell will be shown.\n #showtooltip Spellname\n /run UIErrorsFrame:UnregisterEvent(\"UI_ERROR_MESSAGE\")\n /console Sound_EnableErrorSpeech 0\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /cast Spellname\n /run UIErrorsFrame:RegisterEvent(\"UI_ERROR_MESSAGE\") \n /console Sound_EnableErrorSpeech 1 \nThis next macro moves the spellcast to the end, outside of the sound toggling. This allows the \"that spell is not ready yet\" warning if the final spell is indeed not ready, but still prevents the voice emote for the trinkets. As an alternative to managing the UI_ERROR_MESSAGE event to suppress the error messages on the trinkets, you can call UIErrorsFrame:Clear(), but this will have the side effect of clearing any previous error messages. \n #showtooltip Mind Blast\n /run UIErrorsFrame:UnregisterEvent(\"UI_ERROR_MESSAGE\")\n /console Sound_EnableErrorSpeech 0\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /run UIErrorsFrame:RegisterEvent(\"UI_ERROR_MESSAGE\") \n /console Sound_EnableErrorSpeech 1\n /cast Mind Blast\nFor offensive spells, the following line can be added at the top to prevent trinket use if there is no target selected, or the target is dead or not an enemy.\n /stopmacro [noharm] [dead]\nInterface (How to find hidden program information).\nSome AddOns include a library that provides the /print command. When the command is available, it can replace any codice_3 phrase in a macro with codice_4.\nGet itemNumber (Used to shrink a macro).\n /script local infoType, info1, info2 = GetCursorInfo(); if infoType == \"item\" then DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage( info1 ); end\nThis macro uses the script language to obtain the item number of what is on the cursor and displays it in the chat window. Assign the macro to a hotkey, pick up an item with the cursor, and hit the hotkey of the macro to see the item's number. This is useful for shortening macros by replacing long item names with codice_5.\nGet frame name.\n /script DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage( GetMouseFocus():GetName() );\nYou can bind this macro to a hotkey, then hover your mouse over a frame and press this macro, and the name of the frame under your mouse will go to the chat frame. This is mostly useful to help identify AddOns that are making odd frames on the screen.\nGet icon name / \"texture\".\n /script local type, id, book = GetCursorInfo();DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage((type==\"item\") and GetItemIcon(id) or (type==\"spell\") and GetSpellTexture(id,book) or (type==\"macro\") and select(2,GetMacroInfo(id)))\nAssign the macro to a hotkey, pick up an item, spell, or macro with the cursor, and hit the hotkey of the macro to see the filename of the object's image. The filename is relative to the World of Warcraft installation folder, and may not actually be 'there' on your hard drive since the program has a virtual directory system. This is useful only to programmers and those curious enough to ask.\nProfession Macros.\nEasy Milling/Prospecting.\n #showtooltip\n /script SetCVar(\"AutoLootDefault\", 1)\n /cast Milling\n /use Herb A\n /use Herb B\n /use Herb C\n /in 1 /script SetCVar(\"AutoLootDefault\", 0)\nEasy Borean Leather.\nThis macro was made by Pyroshen of Wowhead. Just spam this macro and you'll make a few Borean Leather from Borean Leather Scraps.\nThis is also easily accomplished by simply putting your stack of Borean Leather Scraps on a hotbar button, and clicking the item as you would when using a scroll or a potion. It's not affected by the Global Cool-Down, so you can spam it as well. An advantange to using this method is that you will not only be shown you how many Scraps you have in your bags/containers, but it will accomplish the same task without actually using one of your available macro slots.\nAs an alternative, you could make something like\nTo easily open clams and combine a variety of combinable items.\nOne advantage is that you can use the macro while having the bank screen opened."}

They are not intended to cover all situations, buffs, or items which you, or other players, own. You may need to modify these macros for your specific use.\nIncluded below is a quick-reference guide to the most relevant macro customizations that druids may want to perform. This is not an exhaustive list, as this is not the primary aim of this document. Should you need to perform other customization work which is not part of this quick guide, please refer to &lt;a href=\"Making%20a%20Macro\"&gt;Making a Macro&lt;/a&gt;. The UI Forums and the Druid Forums on the official World of Warcraft website are also great resources, should you need additional help.\nStance Number Variations 4.0.6.\nMany druid macros make use of the stance modifier to detect which form you are taking. The stance numbers each refer to a Form. Be aware that &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;Flight Form&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Flight%20Form\"&gt;Swift Flight Form&lt;/a&gt; will be either stance 5 or 6, depending on the availability of &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;Moonkin Form&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Life%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Tree of Life (druid ability)&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral Customization.\n How do I remove audible error messages, such as \"Target not in Range\"?\n You can either turn off Error Speech in your Sound &amp; Voice settings, or add the following lines at the beginning and end of the offending macro:\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 0\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 1\n How do I activate a trinket, or any other item?\n Add these lines at the end of your macro to activate a trinket (13 is the top trinket slot, 14 is the bottom slot). For any other equipment or inventory slot, refer to &lt;a href=\"InventorySlotId\"&gt;InventorySlotId&lt;/a&gt;\n /use 13\n /use 14\n How do I set a raid target?\n The following command will set a skull raid target: \n /script SetRaidTarget(\"target\",8)\nNotes\n How do I swap action bars?\n Nowadays, most action bar mods allow very fine control of action bar paging. However, some might still wish to page bars using macros. In that case, this line will allow you to do that. Change the numbers to the bars you wish to swap.\n /swapactionbar 1 2\nShapeshifting and Travel.\nShadowlands Speed Shifting Macro.\nAs of 9.0, the stag part of Travel Form can no longer be ridden by party members. You must either speak to Amurra Thistledew in The Dreamgrove (Legion class order hall in Val'sharah) or to Lorelae Wintersong in Moonglade and purchase Tome of the Wilds: Mount Form. This will teach you a new shapeshifting option called \"Mount Form\" that is a rideable stag. Glyph of the Doe will affect the appearance of Mount Form, but Glyph of the Cheetah will not.\nOnce you have acquired this new form, you can use the following macro for a shapeshifting button that is almost identical to how Travel Form worked before 9.0. This macro will:\nShadowlands Speed Shifting Macro (with Mount Form)\n #showtooltip\n /cast [modifier] Travel Form, [swimming] Travel Form; [indoors] Cat Form; [noflyable, group] Mount Form(Shapeshift); Travel Form;\nShadowlands Speed Shifting Macro (without Mount Form)\n #showtooltip\n /cast [modifier] Travel Form, [swimming] Travel Form; [indoors] Cat Form; Travel Form;\nWoD Power Shifting Macro.\nNow that all three travel forms (Flight Form/Swift Flight Form, Travel Form and Aquatic Form) have been all merged into a single Travel Form as of 6.0, a much simpler macro can be used to powershift. This macro will:\nWoD Power Shifting Macro\n #showtooltip\n /cast [swimming,nostance:3] Travel Form; [indoors,nostance:2] Cat Form; [outdoors,nostance:3] Travel Form; [stance:2/3] Bear Form\nTravel 4.0.6.\nThis macro will select the appropriate travel mode depending on which ones are usable.\nBreakdown\nNotes\nLVL 16\n #showtooltip\n /cancelform [nostance:0,mod:shift]\n /stopmacro [mod:shift]\n /cast [swimming] !Aquatic Form; [indoors] !Cat Form; !Travel Form\nLVL 20\n #showtooltip\n /cancelform [nostance:0,mod:shift]\n /stopmacro [mod:shift]\n /cast [swimming] !Aquatic Form; [indoors] !Cat Form; [combat][mod:CTRL] !Travel Form; Ground Mount\n /dismount [mounted]\nLVL 60 - 85\n #showtooltip\n /cancelform [nostance:0,mod:shift]\n /stopmacro [mod:shift]\n /cast [swimming] !Aquatic Form; [indoors] !Cat Form; [combat][mod:CTRL] !Travel Form; [flyable] !Swift Flight Form; Ground Mount\n /dismount [mounted]\nFeral Powershift/Travel - 4.0.6.\nThis macro will remove snares without taking you out of your current form.

They can be used individually, or in pair, without conflict.\nCrowd Control 4.0.6.\nThis macro is meant to be used for Crowd Control.\nThis focus macro is designed to be used with Crowd Control abilities.

The mouseover target is simply a target which is under your mouse pointer. This can be the frame of any friendly unit in your UI, or a friendly player you are mousing over in your play area. This does not change your current target.\nHover healing.\nThis macro will cast &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Touch\"&gt;Healing Touch&lt;/a&gt; either on your mouseover target, your target, or yourself.\nNotes\n /cast [target=mouseover,help,nodead][help][target=player] Healing Touch\nRebirth / Revive.\nThis macro will cast the appropriate resurrection spell depending on if your in combat or not.\nNote\n #showtooltip\n /cast [@mouseover,help,combat][help, combat] Rebirth ; [@mouseover,help][help] Revive\nMultibox Battle Rez Macro 4.0.1.\n #showtooltip Rebirth()\n /stopcasting\n /target [target=Player1, dead] [target=Player2, dead] [target=Player3, dead] [target=Player4, dead]\n /castsequence [exists,noharm,dead] reset=600 Rebirth(),\n4th line: the reset timer is set to 10 minutes and it's put on a cast sequence so that each of the 3 guys i have it on casts it in order\n 1st guy: Rebirth(),\n 2nd guy: ,Rebirth(),\n 3rd guy: ,Rebirth()\nWhat this does is cause each of the different druids to cast nothing and move on to the next \"spell\" in the cast sequence, or cast Rebirth\nIn a nutshell, you press one button when one of your guys keels over and it auto-selects, auto-cast, and auto-cycles all in one button press.

In order to use it you must have the spells &lt;a href=\"Call%20Pet\"&gt;Call Pet&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Revive%20Pet\"&gt;Revive Pet&lt;/a&gt;, or simply, a Hunter's Pet. You will need to edit the macro to specify which Call Pet to use. By default it uses &lt;a href=\"Call%20Pet\"&gt;Call Pet 1&lt;/a&gt;\nHow the Macro works...\nIf you are mounted: You will dismount.\nIf your pet is dead: You will cast &lt;a href=\"Revive%20Pet\"&gt;Revive Pet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf your pet is not summoned: You will cast &lt;a href=\"Call%20Pet\"&gt;Call Pet 1&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf your pet is not summoned but is dead you can hold shift to cast &lt;a href=\"Revive%20Pet\"&gt;Revive Pet&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf you do not have a focus: You will focus on your target and your pet will be sent to attack it.\nIf you have a focus: You will clear focus and your pet will be recalled to follow you.\nIn less technical terms...\nIf your pet is missing, dead, or you are holding down shift: Your pet will be summoned or revived.\nIf your pet is not attacking: Your pet will attack your target.\nIf your pet is attacking: Your pet will stop attacking and return to your side.\nHunter's Mark will be cast on the target\n /dismount\n /cast [@pet,dead][mod:shift] Revive Pet\n /cast [nopet,nomod] Call Pet 1\n /clearfocus [@focus,dead]\n /focus [@focus,exists]player;target\n /clearfocus [@focus,noharm]\n /petattack [@focus,exists]\n /petfollow [@focus,noexists]\n /cast Hunter's Mark\nOne Button Call Pet.\nThe tooltip will show the icon of the pet (and the name of the pet on mouseover) \n #showtooltip\n /cast [button:2]Call Pet 2; [mod:shift]Call Pet 3; [mod:ctrl]Call Pet 4; [mod:alt]Call Pet 5; Call Pet 1\n&lt;a href=\"Revive%20Pet\"&gt;Revive Pet&lt;/a&gt; -&gt; &lt;a href=\"Call%20Pet\"&gt;Call Pet&lt;/a&gt; (-&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Mend Pet&lt;/a&gt;).\nThis will revive your pet if it's dead, call your pet if you don't have him out, or mend your pet.\n /cast [mod]Revive Pet; [@pet,dead]Revive Pet; [nopet]Call Pet 1; Mend Pet\nIf your dead pet is out of range (i.e. cannot be found by the target command), you can hold down any modifier to force Revive Pet.\nAlternatively, the following macro does the same as above but without Mend Pet.\n /cast [nopet]Call Pet 1; [mod][]Revive Pet\nFull One button Pet Treatment.\nThis macro will revive your pet if it's dead or you hold down shift, call it if it's dismissed, mend it if it's alive, feed it if you press alt at the same time and dismiss it if you right click the button.\n #show [modifier:alt] Mutton Chop\n /cast [nopet] Call Pet 1\n /cast [@pet,dead][mod:shift] Revive Pet\n /cast [pet,nomod,button:1] Mend Pet\n /cast [pet,nomod,button:2] Dismiss Pet\n /cast [pet,mod:alt] Feed Pet\n /use [pet,mod:alt] &lt;food item&gt;\nAn alternative to this is below. Left clicking while holding SHIFT or ALT will cast Revive Pet, or left clicking without holding anything will cast Mend Pet if the pet is out and at your side. If you right click, you will cast Call Pet if he's alive but not out, Feed Pet if he's by your side, and if you hold SHIFT or ALT, it will cast Dismiss Pet. Be sure to change the type of food at the bottom of the macro to the name of the food you feed your pet.\n /cast [button:1,modifier] Revive Pet\n /cast [button:1,@pet,exists] Mend Pet\n /cast [button:2,@pet,noexists] Call Pet 1\n /cast [button:2,pet,nocombat] Feed Pet\n /cast [button:2,modifier] Dismiss Pet\n /use [button:2,pet,nocombat] &lt;food item&gt;\nNo Combat &lt;a href=\"Feed%20Pet\"&gt;Feed&lt;/a&gt; / Combat &lt;a href=\"Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Mend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis macro will cast Mend Pet when in combat and Feed Pet when out of combat.\nFeed by food name.\n /cast [nocombat] Feed Pet; [combat] Mend Pet\n /use [nocombat] &lt;food item&gt;\n-OR-\nFeed by bag slot: bag #1 slot #13.\n /cast [combat] Mend Pet; [nocombat] Feed Pet\n /use [nocombat] 1 13\n-OR-\nFeed a certain food item depending on the type of pet.\n /cast [pet, nocombat] Feed Pet\n /use [pet:Cat/Ravager, nocombat] &lt;food item&gt;; [pet:Wind Serpent, nocombat] &lt;food item&gt;\n-OR-\nHold down alt to cast Mend Pet out of combat, and shows the amount of food you have in your bags.\n #show &lt;food item&gt;\n /cast [modifier:alt][combat] Mend Pet; [pet, nocombat] Feed Pet\n /use [pet, nocombat, nomodifier:alt] &lt;food item&gt;\nPet Attack / Follow toggle.\nGet your pet out of that boss' AOE faster by putting Pet Attack and Pet Follow on the same button. Here's a way to toggle them by holding any modifier key:\n /petattack [pet,nomodifier]\n /petfollow [pet,modifier]\nOr here's a way to make the toggle automatic -- if your pet is attacking, it'll call him back; otherwise he'll go to attack your target.\n /petfollow [@pettarget,exists]\n /petattack [@pettarget,noexists]\nA downside to the latter is that you may have to retrain your fingers a bit if you're accustomed to using your Pet Attack key to make your pet switch targets.\nQuick Mark &amp; Pull.\nThis macro will mark your target, start Auto Shot and send in your pet, all at once.\n #showtooltip\n /cast Hunter's Mark\n /cast Auto Shot\n /petattack\nThis is the one that I use to open with.\nIf you are in a group, it turns off Growl, and turns on Cower; If you are solo, turns on Growl, and turns off Cower. ()\n #showtooltip\n /stopmacro [noexists]\n /cast Hunter's Mark\n /petautocaston [group] Cower; [nogroup] Growl\n /petautocastoff [nogroup] Cower; [group] Growl\n /cast Auto Shot\n /petattack\nGeneral.\n&lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of an instance or raid, set your focus target to the &lt;a href=\"Main%20Tank\"&gt;Main Tank&lt;/a&gt;, then use this macro just before &lt;a href=\"pulling\"&gt;pulling&lt;/a&gt; to cast &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; on him/her without losing your target.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [@focus,help][help][@pet,exists] Misdirection\nThis will misdirect to your focus target, if that is friendly. If not, it will cast on a friendly selected target instead. If that doesn't exist either, it will misdirect on your pet. That way, the macro works as intended in any situation, without the need of pressing qualifier keys or choosing between different buttons.\nAlternatively, you can create a macro designed to cast Misdirection on a friendly player by name. Simply replace \"Tank\" with the name of the player you'd like to misdirect.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [@\"Tank\"] Misdirection\nAnother useful macro combination for one-button misdirecting. If you select a friendly target, it will make them the focus, otherwise it will cast misdirection on whatever the focus was. If you haven't got a focus set, it will misdirect to your pet instead. Usage:\n #showtooltip\n /focus [help]\n /stopmacro [help]\n /cast [@focus,exists] Misdirection;[@pet,exists] Misdirection\nA variation on this wonderful macro is\n #showtooltip\n /focus [help]\n /script SendChatMessage (\"You are now my FOCUS target\",\"WHISPER\",nil,UnitName(\"target\"))\n /stopmacro [help]\n /y ~~Misdirecting on %f~~\n /cast [@focus,exists] Misdirection\nThis will whisper your tank every time you change focus targets; feel free to change the message to something witty. This also includes a yell that will announce your misdirection on your focus target.\nHere is a version that can be set to an arbitrary target with a click, yet does not use up your focus to maintain the misdirection target. There are some limitations: You need to name this macro \"misd\" for it to work. Casting it on people with certain names (such as \"Macro\" or \"Body\") could break the macro, but those names should be pretty rare. You can only memorize a new target while not in combat. And there is a limit to the length of the name that fits in the macro. Usage:\n /cast [mod:ctrl,@Replace][mod:alt,@pet][nomod:shift]Misdirection\n /stopmacro [nomod:shift]\n /run local t=UnitName(\"target\");if t:len()&lt;18 then EditMacro(\"misd\",nil,nil,GetMacroBody(\"misd\"):gsub(\"Replace\",t)..string.rep(\" \",40),1,nil);end\nYet another useful Misdirection macro application geared towards raiders.\nIf you have a focus target and your focus target is friendly, cast Misdirection on your focus target.\nIf you have a focus target that is not friendly and your focus has a target and that target is friendly, cast Misdirection on your focus' target. (It will fail here if the focus' target is you.)\nIf you have a target and your target is friendly, cast Misdirection on your target.\nIf you have a target that is not friendly and your target has a target, cast Misdirection on your target's target.\nElse, if your pet is alive and exists, cast Misdirection on your pet.\n #showtooltip Misdirection\n /cast [@focus,help][@focustarget,help][@target,help][@targettarget,help][@pet,nodead,exists] Misdirection\nA script based Misdirection where the tank (assigned by role) will always be the one getting the Misdirection. The macro auto-updates itself as you use it. There are two versions, one for raid and one for groups (as the 255 chars are not enough for a hybrid party/raid version). Note that it only updates when you use it out of combat, as in-combat EditMacro can't be executed. Also the macro works with any language as Misdirection is referred by spell id rather than a name.\n&lt;br&gt;Party:\n /run local g=\"party\"for i=1,GetNumPartyMembers()do if UnitGroupRolesAssigned(g..i)==\"TANK\"and not InCombatLockdown()then EditMacro(\"MISD\",nil,nil,strsub(GetMacroBody(\"MISDP\"),0,224)..\"\\n/use [@\"..g..i..\"]spell:34477\")end end\nRaid:\n /run local g=\"raid\"for i=1,GetNumRaidMembers()do if UnitGroupRolesAssigned(g..i)==\"TANK\"and not InCombatLockdown()then EditMacro(\"MISD\",nil,nil,strsub(GetMacroBody(\"MISDR\"),0,222)..\"\\n/use [@\"..g..i..\"]spell:34477\")end end\n&lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Mark\"&gt;Hunter's Mark&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis macro will set a friendly target as your focus, assist your focus if you have one, and cast hunter's mark on an enemy target.\n #showtooltip Hunter's Mark\n /assist [@focus, exists]\n /cast [harm] Hunter's Mark;\n /focus [help]\nAspect of the Cheetah / Pack by mouse click.\nLeft-click to cast &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;; right-click to cast &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Aspect of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;\n /cast [button:2] Aspect of the Pack; Aspect of the Cheetah\nClever Trapping.\nCut down on the number of buttons you have dedicated to traps. The stopcasting &amp; stopattack will help keep you from breaking your own traps. You can also use Immolation/Explosive. Use the icon.\n #showtooltip [modifier:alt] Frost Trap; Freezing Trap\n /stopcasting\n /stopattack\n /cast [modifier:alt] Frost Trap; Freezing Trap\nTrap Launcher.\nA macro for cutting down the number of buttons for traps AND adding trap launcher. You can change the mod keys to fit your preferences, along with the traps. I suggest just leaving the icons as they are so that the correct trap icon will show with each mod key.\n /cast [nomod] Trap Launcher; [mod:ctrl]Freezing Trap(Frost); [mod:alt] Explosive Trap(Fire); [mod:shift] Snake Trap(Nature)\nBeast Mastery.\nBeast Mastery \"I-Win button\".\nThis macro requires a &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; specialization with the &lt;a href=\"Bestial%20Wrath\"&gt;Bestial Wrath&lt;/a&gt; talent learned. It can also use any items with On-Use effects, such as potions, trinkets, and items with specific enchants, such as Hand-Mounted Pyro Rockets.\n #showtooltip Bestial Wrath\n /use Potion of Speed\n /cast Bestial Wrath\n /cast Intimidation\n /petattack\nA version for beastmasters with &lt;a href=\"Focus%20Fire\"&gt;Focus Fire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bestial%20Wrath\"&gt;Bestial Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intimidation\"&gt;Intimidation&lt;/a&gt; and a core hound. It also uses both trinkets.\n #showtooltip Rapid Fire\n /cast Rapid Fire\n /cast Bestial Wrath\n /cast Focus Fire\n /cast Intimidation\n /cast 13\n /cast 14\n /cast Ancient Hysteria\nBM DPS Rotation Macro for Patch 4.0.1.\nI made this using an older Hunter macro while in IF testing out rotations to find a steady shot rotation that wouldn't starve for focus while maintaining a solid DPS. I decided not to include Beastial Wrath as it can be activated on demand and may not always be needed depending on the situation. Also, note Multi-Shot is optional depending on the type of fight your in so don't let this macro get you in trouble by leaving Multi Shot in if threat will be a problem. -=DragonBeard=- \n #showtooltip\n /castsequence reset=10 Serpent Sting, Steady Shot, Steady Shot, Arcane Shot, Steady Shot, Steady Shot, Steady Shot, Multi-Shot, Steady Shot, Focus Fire\n /cast [target=pettarget] Kill Command\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear\nSpirit Beast Super Heal Macro.\nI developed this specifically for my &lt;a href=\"spirit%20beast\"&gt;spirit beast&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Mend\"&gt;Spirit Mend&lt;/a&gt; ability, although feel free to change the spell to whatever pet skill you'd like. Basically, this gives you more control over the spell. Holding shift will heal your focus, alt heals your pet, ctrl heals your current target's target (NOT your pet's target's target), and using no modifier will heal you. \n #showtooltip Spirit Mend\n /cast [mod:shift, @focus] Spirit Mend; [mod:alt, @pet] Spirit Mend; [mod:ctrl, @targettarget] Spirit Mend; [@player] Spirit Mend "}

In the ideal rotation, the casting sequence of GCD spells is static, while the use of &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Word of Glory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Shield of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; is situational. Such a design allows the automation of these GCD spells with a castsequence command. By doing so, paladin tank players can better focus on positioning, threat, and damage mitigation instead of which spell to cast, as the rotation has been simplified into two elements: pressing of the castsequence macro, which generates &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Power\"&gt;Holy Power&lt;/a&gt;, and use of the Holy Power (by &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Word of Glory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Shield of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;, based on the situation).\nComparing to other reported faceroll macros, automation of GCD, instead of automating the entire rotation, does not interfere with the situational use of &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Word of Glory&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Shield of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;. We write this macro as the following:\nAutomation of GCD Rotation, AoE:\n #showtooltip\n /startattack\n /castsequence reset=12 Hammer of the Righteous,Consecration,Sacred Shield,Hammer of the Righteous,Judgment,Holy Wrath,Hammer of the Righteous,Sacred Shield,Judgment\nImportant: do not use the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Consecration\"&gt;Glyph of Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, as the macro will stuck at \"Consecration\".\nTo use the above macro, press the macro button in every GCD and cast &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Word of Glory&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Shield of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; when you want to use the Holy Power. In other words, you need at least three buttons for the rotation: the automation of GCD rotation macro, &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Word of Glory&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Shield of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Avenger%27s%20Shield\"&gt;Avenger's Shield&lt;/a&gt; is not in the above castsequence, and you can use it when you need silencing or additional threat for the targets.\nAdvance Use: Automation of GCD Rotation with Crusader Strike.\nUsually in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, we do not need to use &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; for single target tanking to hold a sufficient amount of threat, and thus the above macro does not cast &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt;. However, you can replace the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; spells by &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; spells in the castsequence, if you find it necessary. The following macro represents an alternative castsequence for the automation of GCD Rotation, where &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; spells are replaced by &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; spells.\nAutomation of GCD Rotation, ST (single target):\n #showtooltip\n /startattack\n /castsequence reset=12 Crusader Strike,Consecration,Sacred Shield,Crusader Strike,Judgment,Holy Wrath,Crusader Strike,Sacred Shield,Judgment\nImportant: do not use the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Consecration\"&gt;Glyph of Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, as the macro will stuck at \"Consecration\".\nBased on the 5.0 buffs and debuffs map, we do not need to cast &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; every 30 seconds to maintain &lt;a href=\"Weakened%20Blows\"&gt;Weakened Blows&lt;/a&gt; debuff, as DPS DKs, druids, and warriors will do it. You can modify the macro by changing one \"Crusader Strike\" into \"Hammer of the Righteous\" if you are the one to maintain the Weakened Blows debuff, so you will cast &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; in every 9 GCDs.\nFull Rotation Automation.\nA foreign player, Bubi, has first reported the following faceroll macro which fully automates the paladin tank rotation:\nBubi's full rotation automation macro:\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 0\n /startattack\n /castsequence reset=combat Hammer of the Righteous,Judgment,Holy Wrath,Hammer of the Righteous,Sacred Shield,Judgment,Hammer of the Righteous,Consecration,Sacred Shield\n /cast Shield of the Righteous\n /cast Word of Glory\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 1\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()\nImportant: do not use the &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Consecration\"&gt;Glyph of Consecration&lt;/a&gt;, as the macro will stuck at \"Consecration\".\nThis macro automatically casts the static sequence of spells and try to cast &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Shield of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Word of Glory&lt;/a&gt; whenever possible. As it is designed for spamming, Bubi recommends the application of \"console Sound_EnableSFX\" and \"script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()\" commands to eliminate error sounds and messages.\nThere are also many other reported faceroll macros for MoP paladin tanking, but for the concision of this article, we forgo any further introduction to MoP paladin tanking faceroll macros as for now.\n4.0.6 Faceroll Tanking Macro Setup.\nThis tanking macro setup is made to make your tanking as a paladin easier. Like all facerolling macros, this macro setup helps you decide which spell to use, so you can focus on tanking itself. This design is based on the 939 rotation proposed by Theck.\nThe setup is effective under &lt;a href=\"Patch_4.0.6\"&gt;4.0.6&lt;/a&gt; and all earlier versions of Cataclysm.\nTo tank with these macros, simply spam the Main Castsequence macro while paying attention to its cooldown. When a longer (&gt;2 sec) cooldown appears, switch to Branch Castsequence 1 and use it \"three\" times before going back to the Main Castsequence macro. The Branch Castsequence 2 is for the rare occasions when both Main Castsequence and Branch Castsequence 1 are cooling down, and it also demands being used three times before going back to the main one.\nMain Castsequence (939 Rotation, AoE):\n #showtooltip\n /startattack\n /castsequence reset=4/combat Hammer of the Righteous, Judgement, Hammer of the Righteous, Avenger's Shield, Hammer of the Righteous, Shield of the Righteous\nBranch Castsequence 1:\n #showtooltip\n /startattack\n /castsequence reset=6/combat Consecration, Hammer of the Righteous, Shield of the Righteous\nBranch Castsequence 2:\n #showtooltip\n /startattack\n /castsequence reset=6/combat Holy Wrath, Hammer of the Righteous, Shield of the Righteous\nAdvance Use: ISH9 Rotation and WoG Build.\nYou can use ISH9 rotation for single target tanking to maximize the threat. According to Theck, it can increase approximately 1~2% of the threat over 939 rotation. The following variation of main castsequence is ISH9 based. You can use it instead of the 939 Main Castsequence for single target tanking. To save slots, keep using the 939 branch castsequences as fillers:\nMain Castsequence (ISH9, single target variation):\n #showtooltip\n /startattack\n /castsequence reset=4/combat Crusader Strike,Judgement,Crusader Strike,Avenger's Shield,Crusader Strike,Crusader Strike,Judgement,Crusader Strike,Avenger's Shield,Crusader Strike,Shield of the Righteous\nFurthermore, you can use &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;WoG&lt;/a&gt; build for 939 rotation to provide some self healing. To do so, use the following castsequence to replace the 939's main castsequence. This is designed for single target use, because the macro casts &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Power\"&gt;Holy Power&lt;/a&gt;:\n #showtooltip\n /startattack\n /castsequence reset=4/combat Crusader Strike,Judgement,Crusader Strike,Avenger's Shield,Crusader Strike,Word of Glory\nSince occasionally casting &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Strike\"&gt;Crusader Strike&lt;/a&gt; reduces insignificant threat, it does not worth the two slots for Crusader Strike build branch castsequences as fillers. And since players can cast &lt;a href=\"Word%20of%20Glory\"&gt;Word of Glory&lt;/a&gt; separately on the third pressing of the filler, these branch castsequences can also fit WoG builds. An example of action bar using these macros is shown on the picture, where button ` is Branch Castsequence 2, 1 is &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Wrath\"&gt;Hammer of Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, 2 is Main Castsequence (939 Rotation, AoE), 3 is Branch Castsequence 1, 4 is Main Castsequence (ISH9, single target variation). WoG build is not shown here.\nRetribution Macros.\n\"Macros for use with the Retribution Paladin Build\"\nTemplar's Verdict.\n #showtooltip Templar's Verdict\n /startattack\n /cast Rebuke\n /cast Templar's Verdict\nCrusader Strike.\n #showtooltip Crusader Strike\n /startattack\n /cast Rebuke\n /cast Crusader Strike\n /cast Judgement\n /cast Holy Avenger\nAvenging Wrath.\n #showtooltip Avenging Wrath\n /startattack\n /cast Rebuke\n /cast Avenging Wrath\n /cast Hammer of Wrath\n /cast Judgement\n /cast Crusader Strike\nRepentance.\nA useful Macro for CC.\n #showtooltip Repentance\n /focus [@focus,noexists] [@focus,dead]\n /stopcasting\n /cast [@focus] Repentance"}

Archangel is included at the end for convenience; you can choose to delete Archangel from the end of both sequences and activate it manually if you wish.\nWhile this macro is convenient, it does have some drawbacks. If any ability in this sequence is on cooldown, the macro will continue trying to cast that spell until it is available, preventing the priest from dealing further damage/healing. It may therefore be preferable to omit Archangel, due to its 30-second cooldown. In addition, when not chain-casting, Holy Fire will usually become available before the end of the sequence. The macro will not cast it until the sequence is complete, potentially wasting damage, healing and efficiency, albeit in exchange for convenience.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [harm] Smite; [@targettarget] Smite\nThis macro causes the priest to Smite the target, or if the target is friendly, the target's target. This is very useful when tank healing, as it allows the priest to continue targeting the tank while healing via Atonement. It also ensures that the target hit by Smite is the tank's current target, which should minimise the significance of the aggro this generates for the priest. Priests may also wish to use the same macro design for Holy Fire:\n #showtooltip\n /cast [harm] Holy Fire; [@targettarget] Holy Fire\nShadow.\nClip-prevention Mind Flay.\n #showtooltip\n /stopmacro [channeling]\n /cast Mind Flay"}

Using this macro will both interrupt the target's casting, and cast Purge on them. \n /stopcasting\n /cast Wind Shear\n /cast Purge\nOne Button Weapon Enchants.\nShamans use a lot of action bar space for all of their self-enchants. This macro combines all four weapon enchants into a single button that heaves thus when you click it:\n #showtooltip\n /use [nomod] Windfury Weapon; [mod:alt] Rockbiter Weapon; [mod:ctrl] Flametongue Weapon; [mod:shift] Frostbrand Weapon\nNaturally, spells can be changed around depending on what enchant you like to use. To conserve space in the macro, you don't need the Windfury option until level 30, and at that point you will want to remove Rockbiter from the macro.\nOne Button Harm or Heal.\nThis simple macro combines a damage-dealing spell with a healing spell. It will never give you an error message from casting a spell on the wrong target, it saves space on your action bar, and gives you access to two spells at once.\n /cast [harm] Lightning Bolt; [help] Healing Wave\nYou can pair damage dealing spells with healing spells however you want. I prefer to match similar spells together to make it easier to use. This example pairs &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Bolt\"&gt;Lightning Bolt&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt; due to their similar cast times. Another example would be &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; which share similar cast times, cooldown, and impact multiple targets.\nDepending on your spec and role in a party or raid, you may want the macro to display a tooltip. For example, a healer may want to check how much healing his spell does. You can add the showtooltip command to display the healing spell during a mouseover, like this:\n #showtooltip Healing Wave\n /cast [harm, nodead] Lightning Bolt; [help, nodead] [@player] Healing Wave\nYou could remover the Healing Wave from the #showtooltip and the tooltip would change depending on your target, if you have the icon set to the ? then the icon will change to match the tooltip.\nTo advance this extremely helpful macro even further:\n #showtooltip\n /cast [mod:alt, @player] Healing Wave; [help, nodead] Healing Wave; [harm, nodead] Lightning Bolt; [@player] Healing Wave\nHolding the ALT key (standard for self-casting) will make you cast a heal on yourself. When targeting a friendly target, you will cast a heal. When targeting a harmful target, you will cast a harmful spell, and finally, if you are targeting nothing, you will heal yourself.\nBy default, the icon will change depending on who you're targeting unless you specify which tooltip you would like to show. In this macro, you will always see &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Lesser Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt; unless you're targeting a harmful target.\nThis macro could be further expanded to:\n #showtooltip\n /cast [nocombat, dead, help] Ancestral Spirit; [mod:alt, @player] [help, nodead] Healing Wave; [harm, nodead] Lightning Bolt; [@player] Healing Wave\nThis will now resurect a dead friendly target if you are out of combat, if you are in combat or the target is alive or not friendly, the macro will move on to casting the appropriate spell depending on the target. \nOne Button Fire totem and Nova.\nTo put a fire totem* and are use a nova on it afterwards unsing only one button, you can use any of these options: \nOption 1: Use the macro holding a specific key (in this case shift**) to set the totem, and continue clicking it (withouth the shift key) to make it explode as many times as you want (or as long as the totem lasts). \n #showtooltip Fire Nova(Rank 7)\n /cast [modifier:shift] Magma Totem(Rank 5), Fire Nova(Rank 7)\nOption 2: Set the totem the first time you use the macro and nova the next times. \nWith this option you don\u00b4t need to use the modifier key at all but has been added at the end of the macro in order to allow to place another totem while in combat (in case you need to move it or the old one runs out).\n #showtooltip Fire Nova(Rank 7)\n /castsequence reset=combat/20 Magma Totem(Rank 5), Fire Nova(Rank 7)\n /cast [modifier:shift]Magma Totem(Rank 5)\n\"* Of course, feel free to change the \"Magma Totem\" with your prefered fire totem!\"\n\"** Using a key (ctrl, shift, alt..) is easier if you have added the macro to a key binding, however if you normally use the mouse to click the macro, you can also use the option [button:2] instead. In this case you would put the totem when you left-click the macro, and nova when you right-click it.\"\nMount Or Wolf.\nThis macro will put you on your mount if you're out of combat, and shift you into &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;Ghost Wolf&lt;/a&gt; when in combat. You can also right-click on the macro to put yourself in Ghost Wolf form without being necessarily in combat.\n #showtooltip\n /stopcasting\n /cast [stance][combat,nomounted][button:2] Ghost Wolf;Mount Name\n /dismount [mounted]\nOf course, you can also add the flyable option, to choose your flying mount in case it is possible to use it. This way you have only one button to any of the travelling options:\n #showtooltip \n /cast [combat,nomounted][modifier:shift] Ghost Wolf;[flyable] Swift Red Wind Rider; Black War Raptor\n /dismount [mounted]\nShaman Travel Macro.\nThis is a macro I adapted from a similar druid travel macro now that Ghost Wolf is usable indoors.\n /stopcasting\n /cast [swimming] Water Walking;\n /cast [indoors] Ghost Wolf;\n /cast [flyable,nocombat] Flying Mount Name;\n /cast [combat,outdoors] Ghost Wolf;\n /use [nocombat,outdoors,noswimming,noflyable] Land Mount Name;\n /dismount [mounted]\nReincarnation.\nIf you would like to keep track of your &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt; cooldown and how many Ankhs you have left you can use this:\n #showtooltip Reincarnation\nShock Cycling.\nThis macro is designed to economise bar space. Use this if you find you open with Flame Shock, and use Earth Shock as a follow-up before Flame Shock's DoT has passed. \n #Showtooltip\n /castsequence reset=combat/target/12 Flame Shock, Earth Shock\n /startattack [harm]\nThe macro will cast Flame Shock on the target, then start you fighting the target. When your next shock is available, the macro will cast Earth Shock, unless Flame Shock's DoT has completed. The macro will also reset if you drop out of combat, or change targets. Note that as you advance, and the cooldown on your Shocks becomes low enough thanks to Reverberation and Glyphs, you can add a third shock into the sequence.\nThis is good for all three specs of shamies (even healers when there no healing to do). A little bit of damage from you may make the change from a wipe to a clean kill.\nElemental Macros.\nPvE Burst.\n #showtooltip Elemental Mastery\n /use 13\n /use 10\n /cast Elemental Mastery\n /cast Lightning Bolt\nAll cooldowns except Bloodlust.\nFocus Interupt.\n #showtooltip Wind Shear\n /dismount\n /stopcasting\n /cast [target=focus , exists] Wind Shear\n /cast Wind Shear\n /cast Lightning Bolt\nInterupts spell cast of focused enemy, interupts spell cast of current target if no enemy is focused. Since Wind Shear is off the GCD, casting Lightning Bolt in the same macro minimizes dps loss.

This macro uses /startattack to fix that.\n #showtooltip\n /cast Stormstrike\n /startattack [harm]\nShamans who use a shock spell as an opening move may also find this macro useful, as spells do not activate autoattack. \nShamanistic Rage and Trinket.\nThis macro is designed for those situations when you're surprised and need a burst - both offensive and defensive - to get back into the fight. This requires an at-use Attack Power boosting trinket. \n /use (trinket that you have equipped) ex. Platinum Disks of Battle\n /cast Shamanistic Rage\nTauren characters have an additional option in that their warstomp racial ability doesn't trigger global cooldown. This means they can add it to the macro - though, because it is channeled slightly, it needs to be put last. \n /use (trinket that you have equipped) ex. Platinum Disks of Battle\n /cast Shamanistic Rage\n /cast Warstomp\nNote that &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;Blood Fury&lt;/a&gt; can also be used instead of Warstomp, or &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Blessing of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;.\nEasy Shields.\nThis macro allows you to pick your shield using modifiers. Hold shift to cast Water Shield, or use it without holding additional keys for Lightning Shield. Makes shield management a bit easier and saves space on the action bar.\n /cast [nomodifier] Lightning Shield; [modifier:shift] Water Shield;\nIf you use the Looking for Dungeon tool while questing this could be useful.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [group:party/raid] [mod:shift] Water Shield; [] Lightning Shield;\nEnhancement Rebuff Both Weapons.\nIf you want a combined macro to rebuff both weapons then use:\n #showtooltip \n /castsequence reset=5 Windfury Weapon, Flametongue Weapon;\n /castsequence reset=5 16, 17;\nHowever that requires you to rebuff in quick succession and will fail if the main hand is buffed but the off hand isn't. If you prefer a safer option then go with two macros :\n #showtooltip \n /cast Windfury Weapon \n /use 16 \nfor main hand and \n #showtooltip \n /cast Flametongue Weapon \n /use 17 \nfor off-hand.\nOr, you could get REALLY simple and use only a single macro, as follows:\n /stopcasting\n #showtooltip \n /cast [button:1] Windfury Weapon\n /use 16 \n /cast [button:2] Flametongue Weapon \n /use 17\nThis macro casts &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Weapon\"&gt;Windfury Weapon&lt;/a&gt; on your &lt;a href=\"Main%20Hand\"&gt;Main Hand&lt;/a&gt; weapon when you left click, and cast &lt;a href=\"Flametongue%20Weapon\"&gt;Flametongue Weapon&lt;/a&gt; on your &lt;a href=\"Offhand\"&gt;Offhand&lt;/a&gt; when you right click it. \nI elected to add \"/stopcasting\" to the macro so there will be no \"Another action currently in progress\" errors, but feel free to leave it off.\n3.2 Restoration Macros.\nCure or purge?\n #showtooltip \n /cast [@mouseover,help] Cleanse Spirit ; [@mouseover,harm][harm,nodead] Purge ; [help,nodead] Cleanse Spirit\nThis macro is designed to purge and cleanse a target with one key; it is not 100% reliable (for example, if the target is under a Paladin's &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt;, the shield will confuse the macro, failing to cleanse the target of a poison.\nModifier-less, One button Multi-targeting heal macro.\nThis macro requires no extra buttons or modifier keys to be pushed in order to operate, only the normal mouse pointer you would use to click on the intended target and the single button you would use to cast the heal normally. This macro puts the heals on an extended priority list that allows you to work different healing assignments with ease. It attempts the following in order, moving to the next if one it is unable to preform the previous action.\nHow it is used.\nThis macro is exceptionally useful in boss fights where tanks are swapped regularly, allowing you to target the enemy NPC and directly heal who it is targeting. It also lets you quickly heal or cure other players without having to drop your current target, simply by mousing over their avatar or name plate and tapping the hotbar key. The use of this macro assumes and nearly requires that you play selecting targets with your mouse and using the keyboard to cast spells on your hotbar or keybound slots. It may take getting used to, but if used right it can essentially turn you in to a Healbot without any addons. \nHow it works.\n #showtooltip Healingspell\n /cast [target=mouseover,help,exists] [target=target,help,nodead] [target=targettarget,help,nodead] [target=player] Healingspell\nThis macro can be used with Lesser Healing Wave, Healing Wave, Chain Heal, or any other heal from any other class as well as curative abilities like Cleanse Spirit, Purge, and the like. Just replace 'Healingspell' with the appropriate spell name.\nIt can be used with the spells of any class. Druid HoTs, Priest shields and Paladin bubbles as well as the poison/disease/magic/curse cleansing abilities of any class. This macro should work with ANY non-hostile spell, and perhaps a few hostile ones as well.\nInstant cast, high crit heal.\nThis macro combines a couple of restoration spells to create an 'OH SHIT' heal.\n #showtooltip Healing Wave\n /p Blowing all cooldowns.\n /cast Nature's Swiftness\n /cast Tidal Force\n /cast Healing Wave\nFor those moments when the tank is losing health fast and you don't have time to cast a healing spell, this macro works as well as a paladin's Lay On Hands. Also, if you're in a raid group, replace /p with /ra."}

Clicking with no modifiers will trigger Metamorphosis on the first click and Immolation Aura on the second click. Metamorphosis does not trigger the Global Cooldown however you will still need to click twice to trigger Immolation due to it's requirement that the Meta be active to cast.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [modifier:alt] Demon Charge(Demon)\n /cast [modifier:ctrl] Challenging Howl(Demon)\n /cast [modifier:shift] Shadow Cleave(Demon)\n /cast [nomodifier] Immolation Aura(Demon)\n /cast [nomodifier] Metamorphosis\nAlways Use Metamorphosis, Demonic Empowerment and/or Trinkets.\nWhen activated, this will use any available trinket, cast &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Metamorphosis (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt;, cast &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Empowerment\"&gt;Demonic Empowerment&lt;/a&gt; when an Imp or Felguard is summoned, and cast your regular spell. Change all occurrences of Curse of Agony to the spell of your choice. \n #showtooltip Curse of Agony\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /use Metamorphosis\n /use [pet:Felguard] [pet:imp] Demonic Empowerment\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()\n /use Curse of Agony\nThis version allows for focus casting when the ALT key is held. Without holding alt, casts on your current target.\n #showtooltip Curse of Agony\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /use Metamorphosis\n /use [pet:felguard][pet:imp]Demonic Empowerment\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()\n /use [target=focus,mod:alt,harm][nomod:alt,harm]Curse of Agony\nBoth versions will stop error messages from appearing on your screen but audible messages will still occur so you may wish to turn off Error Speech in the sound options.\nThis version will turn the error speech off during the casting and back on once it is done. It will NOT remove the visual error messages.\n #showtooltip shadow bolt\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 0\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /use Metamorphosis\n /use Demonic Empowerment\n /use shadow bolt\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()\n /console Sound_EnableSFX 1\nMetamorphosis/Immolation Aura/Trinkets/Demonic Empowerment/Charge.\nThis macro combines the two above primarily for demonology AoE.\n #showtooltip Metamorphosis\n /cast [nomodifier] Metamorphosis\n /cast 13\n /cast 14\n /use [pet:Felguard] [pet:imp] Demonic Empowerment\n /cast [nomodifier] Immolation Aura(Demon)\n /cast [modifier:ctrl] Demon Charge(Demon)\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()\nThis version allows control of Demon Form with one button and prevents error messages appearing on screen for this macro if trinkets etc are on cooldown. (Note: error speech will still occur) \nLazy Demonology DPS Macro.\nThis Macro is for easy DPS as Demonology (0/56/15 spec). Simply spam the macro until the end, then when your DoTs fall off, press again three times (four times if you're using the Glyph of Life Tap). If you're moving around a lot and the macro gets stuck in the middle, you'd hold shift to start the macro from the beginning. In between using this macro, spam Incinerate, or Soul Fire when Decimation is active. The macro also automatically makes your pet attack your target and activates Demonic Empowerment (which can be fit in outside of the cast sequence since it's not on the GCD). You can omit or Shadow Bolt if you have another warlock with the ISB talent, or substitute whatever curse you may prefer or be asked to use instead of CoE. You can also include Metamorphosis and/or a trinket at the end, using the same command as DE, assuming you're in a situation where it's not vital to use CDs at any specific point (e.g, heroics). \n #showtooltip\n /castsequence reset=target/shift,12 Corruption, Immolate, Shadow Bolt, Curse of the Elements\n /petattack\n /cast Demonic Empowerment\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Hide() \nInstant Summoning with One Click.\nThis simple macro allows you to use Soulburn and instantly summon a demon with one click.\n /use Soulburn\n /use Summon Petname\nSubstitute your preferred pet (Voidwalker, Felhunter, etc) for Petname.\nThe following variation, based on Nicodeamus' \"Summon Demons\" macro lower on this page, additionally combines all Summon spells into one macro; hold shift for Voidwalker, ctrl for Succubus, alt for Felhunter, or no mod for Imp. If you assign it the \"?\" icon, it will change to reflect which modifier you are holding.\n #showtooltip [mod:shift] Summon Voidwalker;[mod:ctrl] Summon Succubus;[mod:alt] Summon Felhunter;[nomod:] Summon Imp\n /use Soulburn\n /use [mod:shift] Summon Voidwalker;[mod:ctrl] Summon Succubus;[mod:alt] Summon Felhunter;[nomod:] Summon Imp\n=3.3 Destruction Macros=\nFaster Imp Casting.\nThis macro binds your incinerate with your Imp's firebolt. Very useful if you spam your spells; Imp effectively casts quicker. \n #showtooltip Incinerate\n /cast [target=pettarget,exists] Firebolt\n /cast Incinerate\nCan also be used with other spells so that you are constantly spamming the Imp's firebolt. Eg. bound to Immolate:\n #showtooltip Immolate\n /cast [target=pettarget,exists] Firebolt\n /cast Immolate\nFaster Targeting.\nSet your MT (or yourself or pet if soloing to make the macro work) as focus and assist them\n /focus target\n /assist focus\nThen this macro:\n #showtooltip\n /cleartarget [target=focus,dead][target=focus,noexists]\n /tar [noexists,dead] focustarget\n /pettarget [noexists,dead] focustarget\n /petattack\n /castsequence reset=target/combat/5 Soul Fire, Bane of Doom\nImmolate+Incinerate.\nThis will cast Immolate then Incinerate 5 times. It will reset:\n #showtooltip \n /castsequence [nomod] reset=target/combat/13 Immolate,Incinerate,Incinerate,Incinerate,Incinerate;[mod:shift] Incinerate; Immolate\n\"Axel's Funeral Pyre\".\nCast's \"&lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Curse of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sacrifice\"&gt;Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hellfire\"&gt;Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;. Only should be used when the voidwalker is out and when the cooldown meter is at zero. This is essentially a \"Nuke Button\" to maximize damage to the enemy while minimizing damage to you. The name comes from a scene in \"Kingdom Hearts II\" Where a character by the name of Axel suicide attacked the enemy by setting himself on fire. However, Sacrifice should keep you from dying in a fiery inferno of death. \n #showtooltip\n /cast Curse of the Elements\n /cast [ pet:Voidwalker] Sacrifice\n /Cast Hellfire\n=3.1 All Warlock Macros=\nFear Focus Macro.\nA modified version of the old Fear Mouseover/Focus macro. \nThis fear macro will do the following:\n /clearfocus [@focus,noharm][@focus,dead]\n /focus [@mouseover,harm,nodead][@focus,noharm][@focus,dead]\n /cast [@focus,harm] Fear\nYou can also use this macro without the mouseover feature; just delete the [@mouseover,harm] bracket from the macro and you're set. \nThis macro will also work for other crowd control spells like Polymorph, Hex, etc.\nA slight variation on this which will do the following:\n #showtooltip fear\n /petpassive\n /clearfocus [mod:shift][@focus, noexists][@focus, dead]\n /focus [@focus, noexists][@focus, dead]\n /cast [@focus] Fear\nMax effect Healthstone.\n #showtooltip Fel Healthstone\n /castsequence reset=target Demon Armor, Fel Healthstone, Fel Armor\nDemonic Circle.\nWhen activated without holding ALT, this macro will teleport you to your Demonic Circle. When ALT is held, you will summon a new Demonic Circle\n #showtooltip [nomod:alt]Demonic Circle: Teleport;[mod:alt]Demonic Circle: Summon\n /use [mod:alt]Demonic Circle: Summon;[nomod:alt]Demonic Circle: Teleport\nBasic DoTs.\nCasts your &lt;a href=\"Corruption\"&gt;Corruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Curse of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; with one button by tapping this macro.\n #showtooltip\n /castsequence reset=target/combat/5 Corruption, Curse of the Elements\nDevour Magic.\nIf you have your felhunter out, it will cast Devour Magic on yourself, removing a magical debuff. If there is no magical debuff on you, your felhunter will devour a magical debuff from itself. If there is no magical debuff on either you or your felhunter, it will devour your current target. If your felhunter is not out, it will do nothing.\n #showtooltip Devour Magic\n /stopmacro [nopet:felhunter]\n /use [target=player][target=pet][]Devour Magic\nPet attack toggle button.\nSimple, one-button attack/return. Won't change Aggressive, Defensive, or Passive status.\n /petattack [target=pettarget,noexists]\n /petfollow [target=pettarget,exists]\nBubble/Kick/Sap.\nThis puts the Voidwalker's Sacrifice, the Felhunter's Spell Lock, and the Succubus's Seduction all in one button. The effect and tooltip shift depending on which pet you have out. Make sure the \"?\" image is selected for the tooltips to shift.\n #showtooltip [pet:voidwalker] Sacrifice; [pet:felhunter] Spell Lock; [pet:succubus] Seduction\n /use [pet:voidwalker] Sacrifice; [pet:felhunter] Spell Lock; [pet:succubus] Seduction\nWhen you have one or two trinkets that have a &lt;a href=\"use\"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt; effect that increases spell damage or some other kind of effect that you always want in use during combat you normally have use them manually or at best, click a button for it in the hot bar.\nThis macro will allow you to use whichever trinket is not on &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; and cast one of the spells that it helps without causing an error message to appear due to either one or both of the trinkets being on cooldown.\n #showtooltip Shadow Bolt\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()\n /cast Shadow Bolt \nThis version allows you to press the ALT key to cast the spell on your [focus] instead of your target. Works best with the [FocusFrame] add-on.\n #showtooltip Shadow Bolt\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /script UIErrorsFrame:Clear()\n /cast [modifier:alt,target=focus] Shadow Bolt\n /cast [nomodifier,target=target] Shadow Bolt\n /clearfocus [target=focus, dead]\nSummon Demons.\nThis macro will allow you to summon all the normal Warlock pet demons (Imp, VoidWalker, Succubus, and Felhunter) by using only one action bar slot and some simple modifiers. I also set the tooltip to change depending on the modifier you are currently using.\n #showtooltip [mod:shift] Summon Voidwalker;[mod:ctrl] Summon Succubus;[mod:alt] Summon Felhunter;[nomod:] Summon Imp\n /cast [mod:shift] Summon Voidwalker;[mod:ctrl] Summon Succubus;[mod:alt] Summon Felhunter;[nomod:] Summon Imp\nOLD MACROS BELOW.\nThe macros below this line have not been validated to work in 4.0. Use at your own risk.\n=General Macros=\nImmolate &amp; Incinerate in one button.\nOn regular click this will cast Incinerate, hold down alt to cast Immolate.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [mod:alt]Immolate;Incinerate\nMake sure that you select the \"question mark\" for the buttons icon so the proper icon will show up (Incinerate as it's default). When you hold ALT the button will change to show the Immolate icon.\nPvP Prep.\nBuff Self - Armor/Pats.\nPvP with Pet\nThis one buffs you with Demon Armor, Soul Link, and Detect Invisibility.\n #showtooltip\n /castsequence [target=player] Demon Armor, Soul Link, Detect Invisibility\nThis macro will summon your Voidwalker if he's not already out. Feel free to substitute different pets/armors if your situation differs!\n /use [nopet:voidwalker]Fel Domination\n /use [nopet:voidwalker]Summon Voidwalker\n /use [pet:voidwalker]Demon Armor\nAnd another one, especially useful after a pet has been killed, sacrificed, or dismissed. Summons your steed after your buffs, so you can get back to the action.\n #showtooltip\n /castsequence [nopet,mod:alt] Summon Voidwalker; [nopet,mod:ctrl] Summon Felhunter; [nopet] Summon Felguard; [pet] reset=4 Soul Link, Demon Armor, Summon Dreadsteed\nGrind Macro.\nThis is intended for grinding. The assumption is that you have the following spells: Curse of Agony, Corruption, Drain Life, Health Funnel and Drain Soul. You should have some level of these spells by level 12. After that point, the macro will just use the most advanced version of each spell (except Drain Soul). The Voidwalker or Felguard are good pets when using this macro.\nTo use, simply press the button when each spell is finished. To drain the soul (and create a soul shard)hold down the &lt;Alt&gt; key while pressing the button.\n /petattack\n /cast [mod:alt] Drain Soul\n /cast [nocombat] Curse of Agony\n /castsequence reset=target/combat Corruption,Life Tap,Drain Life,Health Funnel,Shoot\nAnd another one (without pet attack):\n #showtooltip\n /castsequence [mod:ctrl] Searing Pain; [mod:alt] Incinerate; reset=10/combat/target Immolate, Corruption, Incinerate, Life Tap, Drain Life, Searing Pain\nAnd another one (with pet attack):\n /petattack\n /castsequence [mod:ctrl] Searing Pain; [mod:alt] Incinerate; reset=10/combat/target Immolate, Corruption, Incinerate, Life Tap, Drain Life, Searing Pain\nTrinkets + Curse of Doom.\nThis macro will use your available Trinket, and Curse of Doom all in one button.\n #showtooltip Curse of Doom\n /use 13\n /use 14\n /use Curse of Doom\nBe wary this will still cast Curse of Doom regardless if you have a trinket available.\nMultidrain.\nAll three drains on a single button (via ctrl and alt).\n #showtooltip\n /cast [mod:ctrl]Drain Mana; [mod:alt]Drain Life;Drain Soul\nIf you do NOT want to be able to start your drain over before it is completely channeled, use this instead:\n #showtooltip\n /cast [mod:ctrl,nochanneling:Drain Mana]Drain Mana; [mod:alt,nochanneling:Drain Life]Drain Life; [nochanneling:Drain Soul]Drain Soul\n=Crowd Control=\nFear / Banish Focus Macro.\nThis is a rather complex macro, utilizing focus to keep track on the target. Casting fear or banish will hit your target as well as create a focus of which all consecutive fears and banishes will target. Having a dead focus will be treated as if you had no focus.\n /cast [nomod]Howl of Terror\n /stopmacro [nomod]\n /focus [mod:shift,nomod:ctrl]none;[target=focus,harm,nodead]focus;[harm,nodead];none\n /cast [target=focus,mod:alt]Fear;[target=focus,mod:ctrl,mod:shift]Banish;[target=focus,mod:ctrl]Banish\nChain-Fear Focus Macro.\n #showtooltip\n /focus [target=focus, noexists][target=focus, dead] mouseover\n /cast [target=focus, exists] Fear; Fear\n /stopmacro [nomodifier]\n /clearfocus [modifier:ctrl]\n\"Note that if you select the macro picture the first line of the macro will make this icon the fear spell, and will allow your usual tooltip to display\" \n=Pet Macros=\nAll pet abilities in one button / AI.\n221 characters long to get the most out of all pet abilities, this macro will:\n #showtooltip\n /cast [pet:Imp]Dark Pact;[pet:Succubus,target=focus]Seduction;[pet:Felhunter,target=focus]Spell Lock\n /stopmacro [nopet:voidwalker]\n /cast [combat]Dark Pact;Health Funnel\n /cast [nocombat]Consume Shadows;Sacrifice\nThis is another version of the above macro which has been modified to include all of the most important pet abilities.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [pet:voidwalker,combat] Sacrifice\n /cast [pet:Succubus,target=target] Seduction\n /cast [pet:Felhunter,target=target] Spell Lock\n /cast [pet:Felguard,target=target] Intercept\nImp Dark Pact / No Imp Life Tap.\nDark Pact if you have an Imp out, Life Tap if you don't have an Imp out. Depending on your playstyle, this may let you get by with only 1 keybinding for both Dark Pact and Life Tap.\n /cast [pet:imp] Dark Pact; Life Tap\nAnother variant for this macro would be to use Dark Pact if your Imp or Felhunter is out since both have a nice mana pool, otherwise use Life Tap. If you use this macro with ? as icon it will show the icon for the available spell.\n #showtooltip [pet:imp/felhunter] Dark Pact; Life Tap\n /cast [pet:imp/felhunter] Dark Pact; Life Tap\nVoidwalker management on one button.\n /use [nopet:voidwalker]Summon Voidwalker\n /use [pet:voidwalker,nocombat]Consume Shadows\n /use [pet:voidwalker,combat]Sacrifice\nVoidwalker Health Recovery.\nOften when soloing with an affliction build, a warlock ends combat with near full health and mana. This quickly gets your voidwalker back up to fighting condition in a single click. If you aren't using your voidwalker or are in combat it acts just like the normal health funnel button.\n #showtooltip\n /cast Health Funnel\n /cast [nocombat, pet:Voidwalker] Consume Shadows\nTwo-button Total Pet Control.\nWith two buttons (macros) you can have total pet control if you make them context sensitive. The point of this is that a keyboard can become utterly cluttered, and requiring more than 2 buttons for 5-6 functions on your pets results in more buttons than preferred being in an unreachable place. Before the macro I'd bind pet function 1 (attack) and 5 to two buttons, but occasionally the situation comes up where the pet needs to be recalled, or needs to be told to stay in a position in sentry mode. Using the mouse + pet bar for these more advanced techniques wastes valuable time, multiple buttons waste valuable pet space. I therefore wrote a macro to bring it all down to two buttons, based on having a target selected or not.\n /petfollow\n /petpassive\n /petattack [harm]\n /petfollow [pet:succubus]\n /cast [harm] Spell Lock\n /cast [help] Devour Magic\n /cast Seduction\n /cast Sacrifice\n /cast Intercept\n /petstay [noexists]\n /petdefensive [noexists]\nThis allows you to do the following things: \nBasically everything you ever need to do with your pet in 2 buttons.\nAnother 2 button AI system.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [help,pet:felhunter] Devour Magic; [pet:felhunter,target=player] Devour Magic; \n [pet:voidwalker,combat] Suffering; [pet:voidwalker,nocombat] Consume Shadows; \n [pet:succubus] Soothing Kiss\n #showtooltip\n /cast [pet:felhunter,target=target] Spell Lock;\n [pet:succubus,target=target] Seduction;\n [pet:voidwalker,combat] Sacrifice; [pet:voidwalker,nocombat] Consume Shadows;\nWhen Button 1 is pressed, if you have a felhunter up and are targeting a friendly player, he will Devour Magic that player, otherwise he will devour magic on you. If you have a voidwalker up and in combat he will cast Suffering (taunt), otherwise he will cast Consume Shadows (heal). If you have a succubus up, she will cast Soothing Kiss.\nWhen Button 2 is pressed, if you have a felhunter up he will cast Spell Lock on your target. If you have a succubus up, she will cast Seduce on your target, and if you have a voidwalker up, and are in combat he will cast Sacrifice (put in combat to help deture misclicks), otherwise he'll attempt to heal himself.\nPet-casting management with Focus handling.\nIn two macro buttons (controlled by one), below code allow you to manage minions, its pellcasts and automatically adjustable focus.\n\"[alt] - spellcasts:\"\n\"using Focus advance:\"\n /focus [mod:ctrl,nomod:shift][@focus,noexists][@focus,dead]\n /clearfocus [@focus,dead][@focus,noharm]\n /click [mod:alt]MultiBarLeftButton9\n /petattack [nomod]\n /petstay [mod:ctrl,mod:shift,nomod:alt]\n /petfollow [mod:shift,nomod:alt]\nnotice: \"MultiBarLeftButton9\" in the macro means the location of the second macro on action bar. If you have trouble to modify this, here is list of actionbars: &lt;a href=\"Making%20a%20macro%23Action%20bar%20button%20names\"&gt;Action bar button names&lt;/a&gt;.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [pet:Imp]Fire Shield\n /cast [nopet:Voidwalker];[mod:shift]Consume Shadows;Sacrifice\n /cast [nopet:Succubus];[@focus,harm][]Seduction\n /cast [nopet:Felhunter];[mod:shift,@focus,harm][mod:shift]Devour Magic;[@focus,harm][]Spell Lock\nFocused Seduction.\n #show Seduction\n /clearfocus [modifier:alt] \n /focus [target=focus,noexists]; [target=focus,dead] \n /clearfocus [target=focus,help] \n /petstay \n /petfollow \n /stopcasting \n /cast [pet:succubus,target=focus,exists,harm] Seduction; Seduction\nDevour Magic - 3v3 Arena Style.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [pet:Felhunter,button:1,target=party1] Devour Magic; \n /cast [pet:Felhunter,button:2,target=party2] Devour Magic;\n /cast [pet:Felhunter,button:3,target=player] Devour Magic;\nAgain, same thing more space saving, and using modifiers rather than mouse buttons (for those keyboard enthusiasts out there). Normal click will cast it on you, alt+click (or alt+hotkey) will cast it on party member 1, ctrl+click (or hotkey) will cast it on party 2. Since only the Felhunter has Devour Magic, there's no need to ensure that the Felhunter is out. I recommend replacing your normal Devour Magic button on your pet toolbar with one of these.\n #showtooltip\n /cast [mod:alt,target=party1] Devour Magic; [mod:ctrl,target=party2] Devour Magic; [target=player] Devour Magic\nAdvanced Spell Lock with Focus.\n #showtooltip Spell Lock\n /clearfocus [modifier:shift]\n /focus [target=focus, noexists]\n /cast [nomodifier, pet:Felhunter, target=focus, harm] Spell Lock; [modifier:ctrl, pet:Felhunter, target=mouseover, harm] Spell Lock\nAdvanced Devour Magic.\n #showtooltip Devour Magic\n /cast [modifier:shift, pet:Felhunter] Devour Magic; [pet:Felhunter, target=player] Devour Magic\nPet Assist -&gt; Grind -&gt; Drain Soul.\n #Showtooltip\n /cast [exists,target=pettarget] Drain Soul\n /cast [exists,nodead] Drain Soul\nSoulstone Macro.\nThis macro will on right click make a soulstone (change for appropriate level), left click, use it and on alt left click cast it on yourself.\n #showtooltip Minor Soulstone\n /cast [modifier:alt,target=player] Soulstone; [button:1] Soulstone; [button:2] Create Soulstone\nHealthstone and Healing Potion.\nNote: It is currently impossible to write a macro that will have you use a Healthstone if you have one and a potion if you do not.\n #showtooltip\n /use [button:1] Healthstone; [button:2] Superior Healing Potion\nThis macro summons a Healthstone if you are not in combat, uses a Healthstone AND potion if you are. Note, depending on whether you have a Healthstone and/or potion in inventory at the time (and applicable cooldowns), you may see error messages. The macro also cannot tell whether you have a Healthstone in inventory or not. These are unavoidable - the macro will still do the best it can. NB: You must edit this to indicate the correct Healthstone and healing potion names. \n /use [nocombat]Create Healthstone \n /use [combat]Lesser Healthstone \n /use [combat]Lesser Healing Potion\nHealthstone use/summon, Ritual of Souls in group.\nThis will allow to use a healthstone with one click, summon with another, however in groups you will cast Ritual of Souls rather than a single summon.\n #showTooltip Master Healthstone\n /cast [group, button:2] Ritual of souls\n /cast [button:2] Create Healthstone\n /use [button:1] Master Healthstone\nWhen you first log in it'll show you a red question mark icon until you make your first stone. You can change the first line to \"#showTooltip Create Master Healthstone\" to fix this, however it will display the number of soulshards remaining instead of healthstone."}

Unit frame addons allow a player to track the health and status of the focused unit while targeting other units. Macros can be written to cast spells on the focused unit. Moreover, click-style addons such as Clique can be used on the focus' unit frame as appropriate. These possibilities are the motivation for including focus management in macros.\nSheep/Monitor/Resheep Pattern.\n /focus [target=focus,exists,nodead] focus; target\n /cast [target=focus,harm,nodead] Polymorph\nIf you have a focus, and it exists and is not dead, then your focus is set to your focus (in other words it remains unchanged). Otherwise, focus is set to your current target. Then, now that you have a focus set, if it is an enemy, Polymorph it.\nAs a result, this macro can be placed on the action bar, and be used as a single-button solution to sheep an initial target (as long as you have no focus, or the one from the previous fight has died already), and to resheep as necessary.\nLast Pet Target Pattern.\n\"Keep in mind that this may or may not have any usefulness in combat. The following work is presented only as an exercise.\"\nBecause there's no petlasttarget function, we use the player's abilities instead. Thankfully we can accomplish this without actually altering the player's target in the end. There are really only two steps that we want to accomplish:\n1. Send the pet to attack the focus. \n2. Set the focus to your pet's old target. \nThese two steps will allow us to mash a single macro and have the pet go back and forth between two targets.\nSince the following macro will use the focus ability to do that, you won't want to try it if you're using the focus ability for your own evil deeds, like keeping track of a seduction target, or what-have-you.\nHere's the simple version. We assume that your pet is attacking someone, and that you want to send it to attack the target that you focused.\n /target pettarget\n /petattack focus\n /focus target\n /targetlasttarget\nRinse and repeat. If you met all the prerequisites, then your pet will bounce back and forth between the two targets each time you press the macro.\nNow let's try adding a small amount of error correction:\n /focus [target=focus,exists,harm,nodead] focus; [exists,harm,nodead] target; [target=mouseover,exists,harm,nodead] target\n /bonk [target=focus,noexists] player\n /stopmacro [target=focus,noexists]\n /target pettarget\n /petattack focus\n /focus target\n /targetlasttarget\nStep 1: if you don't have a focus, set it to your current target, or failing that, to whomever you are mousing over.\nStep 2: if you STILL don't have a focus, bonk yourself on the noggin' and stop.\nAnd then back to the meat and potatoes of the macro:\nStep 3: send your pet to attack the focus.\nStep 4: switch the focus to your pet's previous target.\nSteps 1 &amp; 2 make it so that you don't have to take time out of your busy schedule to focus a target before you send your pet to attack it. You just target it or mouseover it, then hit the macro, and the focusing is done for you. That's the point of macros anyway.\nThat takes care of the possibility of no focus when you start. But, what if your pet doesn't have a target at first? Oh, my. Well it's actually alright. A quick look shows us what will happen: your target will be set to None, the pet will attack the shiny new focus, the focus will be set to None, and your target will revert to what it was before the macro started.\nSo, at this point that's about as much functionality as we can reasonably ask for, but you may have noticed that we're pushing the 255 character limit. We can eliminate a few extra words that are implied by context, get rid of the bonks, and keep the same functionality:\n /focus [target=focus,exists,harm,nodead] ; [exists,harm,nodead] ; [target=mouseover,harm,nodead]\n /stopmacro [target=focus,noexists]\n /target pettarget\n /petattack focus\n /focus target\n /targetlasttarget\nThat's 193 characters if I count correctly."}

These can be collected repeatedly, but only after completing certain quests in the zone. Thes buffs are zone-specific in that you need to go to a specific zone to get the buff, collect the reagents, or make the item.\n&lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; Plants.\nYou must first complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Felwood\"&gt;Cleansing Felwood&lt;/a&gt; given by &lt;a href=\"Arathandris%20Silversky\"&gt;Arathandris Silversky&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) or &lt;a href=\"Maybess%20Riverbreeze\"&gt;Maybess Riverbreeze&lt;/a&gt; (Horde), who can be found near the road to &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Emerald Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;. You will be given a , which, when held in your inventory, allows you to collect from mobs in Felwood. You can also collect other drops based on your profession. For example, you will collect &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Creep\"&gt;Fel Creep&lt;/a&gt; every time you gather herbs or &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Vitriol\"&gt;Tainted Vitriol&lt;/a&gt; every time you mine ore. These items only drop in Felwood. You can repeatedly turn in quantities of these items to the NPC and get two &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Plant%20Salve\"&gt;Cenarion Plant Salve&lt;/a&gt; in exchange. \nYou can then use the salve to cleanse the corrupted plants that spawn at certain set locations around Felwood. A cleansed plant gives you a reward and then cannot be interacted with for a while. 25 minutes after a cleansing, you (or any other player) can harvest the plant again without using salve. Eventually, the plant will despawn or respawn as a corrupted plant.\nAll these items are on a 2 minute cooldown shared with &lt;a href=\"healthstone\"&gt;healthstone&lt;/a&gt;s and other \"non-aggressive\" items (but separate from potions.) After the appropriate amount of salve is applied, the plant changes to \"\"Cleansed\" &lt;plant name&gt;\". Some of the items produced are not technically buffs, but are listed here for completeness.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//img89.imageshack.us/my.php%3Fimage%3Dfelwoodplants0oc.jpg\"&gt;Map of plant locations&lt;/a&gt;\nWinterspring Juju.\nWitchdoctor Mau'ari is in &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt; will give you Juju items when you bring her e'ko, which you can sometimes get from creatures throughout &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. You need to have the &lt;a href=\"Cache%20of%20Mau%27ari\"&gt;Cache of Mau'ari&lt;/a&gt; with you to collect the e'ko, and also to use the Juju once you've received it. You must complete two quests for her first. As of patch 1.12.2, it is most efficient to farm E'kos in a group or raid. If you are grouped and an E'ko drops, everyone in the group/raid gets to loot one, provided they meet the above prerequisites. If you already have plenty, you can help out others by just being in the group to make an extra one drop and giving it to them! \"These buffs do NOT stack with castable buffs!\" \nJujus are now available to both Alliance and Horde.\nUn'Goro Crystals.\nThroughout &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, as you may have noticed, are lots of multicolored crystals growing out of the ground. If you collect them, you'll be able to use them in the 3 pylons located in the North, East, and West areas of the crater to produce items that you can use at any time to give you a certain buff. You need to complete the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//thottbot.com/%3Fq%3D1041\"&gt;Crystals of Power&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//thottbot.com/%3Fq%3D2593\"&gt;Making Sense of It&lt;/a&gt; quests to be able to use the pylons.\n\"These buffs do NOT stack with castable buffs!\" These buff items can be used on friendly targets. \nBlasted Lands Blood Elves Concoctions.\nThere are two &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; in the Northeast corner of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; who will give you certain items when you bring them certain parts from the animals in the area. It's pretty obvious which parts come from which animals. All of the concoctions are unique so you can only carry one of each at a time; however, you can carry as many of the ingredients as you have bag space for. Upon turning in each quest for the very first time, you will receive the buff of the concoction rewarded in addition to the concoction itself. You may only have one of these five buffs active at any given time (i.e. they do not stack with each other).\nThey stack with castable buffs, but counting as a battle/guardian elixir, the do not stack with other elixirs of the same type.\nAll concoctions have a shared 60 min. cooldown.\nSayge's Dark Fortunes.\nSayge is a Gnoll who works at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;. He can \"read\" your fortune through a couple questions he asks you, and depending on your answer, he'll cast a certain buff on you as well. You'll also receive an unrelated scroll, most of which are worthless, but some of which give you a quest.\nThese buffs do NOT stack.\n&lt;a href=\"Mangletooth\"&gt;Mangletooth's&lt;/a&gt; Revenge.\n&lt;a href=\"Mangletooth\"&gt;Mangletooth&lt;/a&gt; is a Razormane Quillboar who has been captured by the Taurens of Camp Taurajo. He still desires his revenge against the Bristleback Quillboar tribe, and will assist you in carrying out their defeat. Bristlebacks carry &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Shard\"&gt;Blood Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, which you can trade to Mangletooth for his buffing assistance. These buffs are applied directly to the player as the reward for turning in the specified number of shards."}

{"id": "12392", "revid": "819614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12392", "title": "User interface customization guide", "text": "This user interface customization guide is based upon &lt;a href=\"slouken\"&gt;slouken&lt;/a&gt;'s post on the official Beta UI forums \"(a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away)\".\nWorld of Warcraft user interface customization guide.\nThe interface of \"World of Warcraft\" is built from XML files, which describe the look and layout, and lua files, which contain scripting functionality. This document is a short introduction into modifying these files to customize your interface. Customizing the interface is a very technical endeavor, (although Lua is an extremely simplistic language, comparitively speaking) and you should not attempt it unless you have a good working knowledge of XML and Lua. \nNo official support exists for modifying the WoW interface. If you break it, you get to keep both pieces. =)\nWith that said, there are a number of websites devoted to user interface customization (add-ons) available, such as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowinterface.com/\"&gt;WowInterface&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse.com\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;. These sites have customized interfaces and add-ons for almost every conceivable need, so it is extremely unlikely that you will need to create an add-on from scratch yourself. If you find an Add-on suitable for your needs from one of these sites, you will find using them much easier than attempting to create a new add-on yourself.\nTo get started, download the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml%3FarticleId%3D21466\"&gt;World of Warcraft Interface AddOn Kit&lt;/a&gt; and use that application to extract both User Interface Data &amp; User Interface Art. This creates three new directories called:\n\"Blizzard Interface Data (enUS)\"\n\"Blizzard Interface Art (enUS)\"\n\"Blizzard Interface Tutorial\".\nThe art folder contains all of the graphics used in the built-in UI. They are generally &lt;a href=\"BLP_files\"&gt;BLP files&lt;/a&gt;, which are a simple container DirectX-formatted texture data. The &lt;a href=\"BLP_files\"&gt;BLP files&lt;/a&gt; page lists several tools for converting between BLP and other image formats.\nThe data folder contains all of the &lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"XML\"&gt;XML&lt;/a&gt; files which are used to describe and program the UI. Editing these files will not do anything - they are there to show you how the Blizzard UI works, and a reference for examples of algorithms, syntax, using the game API and much more.\nThe Blizzard Interface Tutorial is where you start. After you complete the tutorials, you should have enough knowledge to create a basic addon. From your addon, you can make whatever changes to the Blizzard UI that you want. \nXML layout.\nThe files containing the layout and scripts for the game user interface can be found in Blizzard Interface Data\\FrameXML.\nThe FrameXML.toc file is a plain text file and contains a list of Lua and XML files to load at login. The files are loaded in the order they're listed and any load errors are written to FrameXML.log in the game's Log folder.\nIn your own addons you will also have a .toc file which performs the same function for your own code. You will list your Lua and XML files in it and they will be loaded during login. Errors which occur while loading your addon will also be written to the FrameXML.log file.\nEach XML file describes a collection of UI elements and Blizzard separates their XML files into functional modules. You will find files for the GameTooltip, ActionBarFrame, ReadyCheck, and everything else in the built-in UI. The Blizzard XML and Lua files make a great reference for understanding how to develop an addon.\nThe XML files strictly adhere to the XML standard and if your text editor supports XML syntax checking, the file UI.xsd in the FrameXML folder contains the schema used by the WoW interface.\nLots more details here: &lt;a href=\"XML%20User%20Interface\"&gt;XML User Interface&lt;/a&gt;.\nLua scripting.\nAll of the functionality in the interface is provided through Lua scripting. It is also possible to create any layout that is possible with the XML markup in pure Lua scripting.\nThe manual for Lua 5.1.4 (http://www.lua.org) is available online at http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1.\nFor more concise help, topic-specific Lua tutorials can be found at: http://lua-users.org/wiki/TutorialDirectory.\nThe best way to become familiar with the way Lua is used to script the interface is to look at the scripts in the XML files, denoted by the &lt;script&gt; tag, and to browse the lua files. The lua files typically contain functions which are used by the corresponding XML files.\nAs a reference, the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20API\"&gt;World of Warcraft API&lt;/a&gt; page contains a (almost) complete list of available API functions in \"World of Warcraft\". When you want to figure something out, this is the first page you should turn to. Also the &lt;a href=\"Widget%20API\"&gt;Widget API&lt;/a&gt; page contains an overview of the methods that are available when dealing with objects of the user interface \u2014 like action buttons or unit frames. Feel free to play around with the codice_1 function to try out the various API functions.\nFor example type this into the game chat:\n /run print(GetLocale());\nGetLocale() is an API function. It returns the client locale (\"enUS\" for English clients, \"deDE\" for German clients, etc). Print() then prints that value into the default chat window. \nYour addons are loaded after the Blizzard files, so your addon can overwrite or change any Blizzard UI. For example, you could create an addon with one line of code:\n MailFrame:Show()\nMailFrame is the name of a Blizzard Frame, created in Blizzard Interface Data/FrameXML/MailFrame.xml. Anyframe:Show() will make that frame appear, even if you are nowhere near a mailbox. Type /run MailFrame:Show() in game to accomplish the same thing.\nGetting started.\nA good place to start getting familiar with the interface is the file BasicControls.xml.\nAt the top of this file is a script block which contains the function _ERRORMESSAGE(), which is called whenever an error occurs in your script. This function pops up a window with the error message. Another function is defined there, message(), which just pops up the error window with the argument to the function. \nFurther on in the file a few textures are defined in XML. They have the \"virtual\" attribute, which means that they are not actually created, only stored definitions to be inherited later. After that a frame, or widget, called \"DialogBoxFrame\" is defined. This frame is also virtual, and contains an anchor which defines how it's positioned relative to its parent, a background, and a child button which just hides the dialog when it's clicked. \nEach frame consists of a number of layers, each of which can contain any number of textures and font strings. Each texture and font string must be anchored and sized so they are visible. The numbers used for anchor offsets and sizes are values in pixels. \nAt the end of the file we define an actual frame called \"ScriptErrors\" which inherits the dialog box we defined previously. This is the frame which is shown in the message function at the top of the file.\nHow does it work?\nThe very first frame that is created is the WorldFrame. This frame is required, and is where the game world renders. The next frame that is created is the UIParent frame. This frame manages all the rest of the user interface, and allows it to be hidden separately from the world. This is how we get screenshots without the interface visible. :) \nWhenever a frame, texture or font string is defined in XML, its initial attributes are defined and it is added to the lua name space as an object of the appropriate type. Each type of object has member functions that modify that object. This is how we show the error dialog frame from script. \nEach frame has a set of script handlers which are called under certain conditions. For example, UIParent has OnLoad, which is called immediately after the frame is loaded, OnEvent, which we will get to later, OnUpdate, which is called every time the world is updated, and OnShow, which is called whenever the frame is shown. \nThe OnEvent handler is special. This is the handler that allows the game to communicate with the interface. \"World of Warcraft\" is designed so that it needs to know very little about the interface. Instead of calling directly into the interface, whenever something interesting happens, it generates an event. Each frame registers for events that it is interested in, and when those events happen, the OnEvent handler is called for that frame. \nHaving the UI respond to events wouldn't be very useful if the interface couldn't affect the game in return. The game provides a wide array of functions to query information and change game state. Examples of using these functions are throughout the provided lua files. \nTips and tricks.\n\"World of Warcraft\" supports dynamically reloading the user interface. At any time, you can modify the XML and Lua files and then reload them by typing codice_2 in the chat edit box.\nIf you are not sure what is happening in a script, use the &lt;a href=\"API%20print\"&gt;print()&lt;/a&gt; function to print a message into the default chat frame. This function is extremely forgiving and will print any variable.\nFeel free to experiment. If you break something, starting fresh is really easy. If you have questions, look on the forums to see if other people have already figured out the answers. Occasionally, Blizzard staff will be available to answer scripting questions \u2014 we value your feedback!\nConclusion.\nThe interface files are provided for your enjoyment, and are not supported in any way. That said, we hope that \"World of Warcraft\" provides a robust and flexible system for custom interfaces."}

{"id": "62424", "revid": "612753", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=62424", "title": "Using UIDropDownMenu", "text": "UIDropDownMenuTemplate is a &lt;a href=\"FrameXML\"&gt;FrameXML&lt;/a&gt; Frame template that can be used to create contextual menus and dropdown boxes in World of Warcraft. This tutorial explains how to use it in your addon.\nSummary: implement a function describing the contents of your drop-down menu, and possibly another function to respond to the user selecting a particular menu item.\nProvided functionality.\nThe template can be used to create two UI elements: drop-down lists and context menus, both of which can be used to present a multi-level menu to the user. The menu's items may be disabled, checked, show a color picker swatch, or be styled as a title. The template automatically creates a drop-down box, as well as any list buttons as necessary.\nThe differences between the two display modes are inconsequential from a coding perspective -- if you're creating a context menu, you'll need to provide an appropriate argument to the call slightly and call yourself when you want the context menu to appear.\nMenu initialization functions.\nIn order to display a menu, you'll need to create an \"initialization\" function which will describe what items your menu contains. The function will be passed these three arguments:\nYour function must, rather than returning any values, call with a description of each menu item you wish to create. Menu items are described via a table argument, with a large number of &lt;a href=\"UI%20Object%20UIDropDownMenu%23The%20info%20table\"&gt;named keys&lt;/a&gt; providing customization options. The most important ones to set are:\nIn practice, your initialization function may be as simple as the one in the following example.\n function WPDropDownDemo_Menu(frame, level, menuList)\n local info = UIDropDownMenu_CreateInfo()\n info.text, info.checked = \"Blue Pill\", true\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info)\n info.text, info.checked = \"Red Pill\", false\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info)\n end\nHandling user interaction.\nTypically, your addon will want to respond to the user making a dropdown selection in some fashion. The easiest way to accomplish this is to use the func and arg1/arg2 keys of the info table:\nThis means that you'll frequently need to write two functions: one to respond to the user making selections in the menu, and the other to describe the items in your menu.\nThe following snippet illustrates the pattern. The info.func value is set to the function handling the clicks, and the menu initializer is modified to set the info.arg1 values in addition to info.text, which allows the _OnClick function to determine which option was selected easily.\n local function WPDropDownDemo_OnClick(self, arg1, arg2, checked)\n if arg1 == 1 then\n print(\"You can continue to believe whatever you want to believe.\")\n elseif arg1 == 2 then\n print(\"Let's see how deep the rabbit hole goes.\")\n end\n end\n function WPDropDownDemo_Menu(frame, level, menuList)\n local info = UIDropDownMenu_CreateInfo()\n info.func = WPDropDownDemo_OnClick\n info.text, info.arg1 = \"Blue Pill\", 1\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info)\n info.text, info.arg1 = \"Red Pill\", 2\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info)\n end\nNesting menus.\nDropdown and context menus may be nested -- menu items may be marked such that they open an additional \"level\" of menus when hovered over. The following two info table keys are relevant to this purpose:\nYour initializer function will therefore need to be aware of which level of the menu its being asked to describe. For instance:\n function WPDropDownDemo_Menu(frame, level, menuList)\n local info = UIDropDownMenu_CreateInfo()\n if level == 1 then\n -- Outermost menu level\n info.text, info.hasArrow, info.menuList = \"Play a game\", true, \"Games\"\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info)\n info.text, info.hasArrow = \"Plain old option\", nil\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info)\n info.text, info.hasArrow = \"Some other list\", true, \"Other\"\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info)\n elseif menuList == \"Games\" then\n -- Show the \"Games\" sub-menu\n for s in (\"Tic-tac-toe; Checkers; Chess; Global Thermonuclear War\"):gmatch(\"[^;%s][^;]*\") do\n info.text = s\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info, level)\n end\n elseif menuList == \"Other\" then\n -- Show the \"Some other list\" sub-menu\n for s in (\"Something old; Something new; Something borrowed; Something blue\"):gmatch(\"[^;%s][^;]*\") do\n info.text = s\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info, level)\n end\n info.text, info.hasArrow, info.menuList = \"Infinite menus\", true, menuList\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info, level)\n end\n end\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton's second argument, level, specifies to which level of the currently open menu the menu item should be appended. If you fail to specify it for sub-menus, your \"nested\" menu items will be added at the bottom of the outermost menu level.\nCreating a dropdown widget.\nIn order to use your menu initializer function, you'll need to create a frame inheriting from codice_1 and call to bind your menu function to your frame. Your frame must have a name.\nThe following code creates, positions, and initializes a dropdown menu widget:\n local dropDown = CreateFrame(\"Frame\", \"WPDemoDropDown\", UIParent, \"UIDropDownMenuTemplate\")\n dropDown:SetPoint(\"CENTER\")\n UIDropDownMenu_SetWidth(dropDown, 200) -- Use in place of dropDown:SetWidth\n -- Bind an initializer function to the dropdown; see previous sections for initializer function examples.\n UIDropDownMenu_Initialize(dropDown, WPDropDownDemo_Menu)\nGenerally, you'll want to have your dropdown display text indicating the current value of whatever choice the user can make using the dropdown. To adjust the text displayed by the dropdown, you can use the following function:\n UIDropDownMenu_SetText(dropDown, \"Exciting goes here text\")\nThe text displayed by the menu will be automatically set to the newly selected menu item's info.text value whenever the user makes a selection, so you'll usually only need to explicitly alter the text when your dropdown is first presented to the user, or when its value is changed without user interaction.\nCreating context menus.\nThe following code creates and initializes a context menu widget.\n local dropDown = CreateFrame(\"Frame\", \"WPDemoContextMenu\", UIParent, \"UIDropDownMenuTemplate\")\n -- Bind an initializer function to the dropdown; see previous sections for initializer function examples.\n UIDropDownMenu_Initialize(dropDown, WPDropDownDemo_Menu, \"MENU\")\nTo show a context menu, you'll need to call function when you wish to show the context menu. Generally, the call to show a menu would look like this:\n ToggleDropDownMenu(1, nil, dropDown, \"cursor\", 3, -3)\nA complete example.\nThe following example illustrates how UIDropDownMenuTemplate can be used in a typical addon, allowing the user to customize the value of some variable in the addon. In this example, a multi-level dropdown menu is used to let the user pick a favorite number from 0 to 49.\n local favoriteNumber = 42 -- A user-configurable setting\n -- Create the dropdown, and configure its appearance\n local dropDown = CreateFrame(\"FRAME\", \"WPDemoDropDown\", UIParent, \"UIDropDownMenuTemplate\")\n dropDown:SetPoint(\"CENTER\")\n UIDropDownMenu_SetWidth(dropDown, 200)\n UIDropDownMenu_SetText(dropDown, \"Favorite number: \" .. favoriteNumber)\n -- Create and bind the initialization function to the dropdown menu\n UIDropDownMenu_Initialize(dropDown, function(self, level, menuList)\n local info = UIDropDownMenu_CreateInfo()\n if (level or 1) == 1 then\n -- Display the 0-9, 10-19, ... groups\n for i=0,4 do\n info.text, info.checked = i*10 .. \" - \" .. (i*10+9), favoriteNumber &gt;= i*10 and favoriteNumber &lt;= (i*10+9)\n info.menuList, info.hasArrow = i, true\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info)\n end\n else\n -- Display a nested group of 10 favorite number options\n info.func = self.SetValue\n for i=menuList*10, menuList*10+9 do\n info.text, info.arg1, info.checked = i, i, i == favoriteNumber\n UIDropDownMenu_AddButton(info, level)\n end\n end\n end)\n -- Implement the function to change the favoriteNumber\n function dropDown:SetValue(newValue)\n favoriteNumber = newValue\n -- Update the text; if we merely wanted it to display newValue, we would not need to do this\n UIDropDownMenu_SetText(dropDown, \"Favorite number: \" .. favoriteNumber)\n -- Because this is called from a sub-menu, only that menu level is closed by default.\n -- Close the entire menu with this next call\n CloseDropDownMenus()\n end"}

{"id": "23065", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=23065", "title": "Using function hooking libraries", "text": "Hooking and You!\nHooks: What are they?\nPeople have been hooking blizzard's UI functions for a long time. The traditional 'manual' way to hook is usually 1- 4 lines long where you either replace a function with one of your own or you store the function, replace it with your own and call the orig from inside your function.\nThe following example demonstrates a manual hook:\n function AddonName_SendChatMessage(msg, system, language, channel)\n --Your 'before' code here\n SavedSendChatMessage(msg, system, language, channel);\n --Your 'after' code here\n end\n local SavedSendChatMessage = SendChatMessage;\n SendChatMessage = AddonName_SendChatMessage;\nNOTE: The hooking must be done AFTER you have declared your function or AddonName_SendChatMessage will be nil at the time you hook stuff. -\nExample of a returning hook:\n function AddonName_UnitIsConnected(unit)\n --Your 'before' code here\n local connected = SavedUnitIsConnected(unit);\n --Your 'after' code here\n return connected;\n end\n local SavedUnitIsConnected = UnitIsConnected;\n UnitIsConnected = AddonName_UnitIsConnected;\nExample of a more brusque hook:\n local Orig_UnitIsConnected = UnitIsConnected;\n function AddonName_UnitIsConnected(unit)\n -- Your code here\n return Orig_UnitIsConnected(unit);\n end\nFor the most part, that's all that the new developer knows or ever learns. However, what you may not know is that there are problems about hooks that have plagued seasoned programmers for a long time, especially ones that program compilations of dozens if not scores of addons.\nHooking Pitfalls and Limitations.\nMultiple addons hooking the same function.\nFirst off, if you or another programmer ever tries to hook the same function you start running into problems. Short replacement hooks are the most destructive in this manner. They completely break one of the two hooks and oftentimes cause additional havok by changing the internal mechanics of the function that may be required by another addons. For example, if function A is called within function B and function B is replaced by C which uses function D and not A, then any thing that hooks A will not be called when B is called. \nThere is no easy/efficient ways around this, however if you are programming for compatibility, you may have a number of choices. You could simply call you function before or after calling the orig function. This usually only requires storing the orig function under a different name, a simple fix, and under most circumstances this method is the most compatible with other hooks. Sometimes the effects of your 'before' hook may be cancelled by another 'after' hook. But fixing this would almost always require you to know of the other hook while programming so you can account for its effects. This usually only happens if you wrote the other addon or if someone reports the bug. \nUnfortunately using manual hooks this is still very hard to debug. First of all you have to know what functions conflict. Then you need to guarantee that your hook code gets called after the offending hook. If both hooks are called OnLoad this can sometime be done by adding an optional dependency to your addon, causing the other addon to load first. However, if a hook is called from an event, or sometime later than OnLoad it can become very difficult to make your code load afterwards, and in some cases you may even want to hook the function before the other addon does, but then it conflicts with yours when it finally hooks.\nUnhooking.\nAnother common problem involves both conflicts and efficiency: unhooking. With manual hooks unhooking is almost always a bad idea. Unhooking involves replacing your hook with the orig function, with the effect of negating the effects and cpu processing of your code, and in some cases memory space. The simplest unhook is an assignment of the function to the saved orig function. It is possible to manually unhook, but it requires checking the current function definition against your stored definition to make sure the function has not been modified since you hooked it. This is require or else any hook assigned after your saved orig function was defined will be destroyed as well. This can also be more safely circumvented using a flag and an if statement inside your hook function. Thus to unhook your code you aren't actually unhooking, but your code is not processed and then the orig function is. This is almost always the safest way to unhook, but requires a global or addon local flag and doesn't actually remove your code from memory, always processing the if statement.\nExample of a safe manual unhook:\n local SavedPickupContainerItem;\n local PickupContainerItem_IsHooked;\n function AddonName_OnLoad()\n PickupContainerItem_IsHooked = 1;\n SavedPickupContainerItem = PickupContainerItem;\n PickupContainerItem = AddonName_PickupContainerItem;\n end\n function AddonName_Unhook()\n if (PickupContainerItem == AddonName_PickupContainerItem) then\n PickupContainerItem = SavedPickupContainerItem;\n end\n PickupContainerItem_IsHooked = nil;\n end\n function AddonName_PickupContainerItem(index,slot)\n if (PickupContainerItem_IsHooked) then\n --Your 'before' code here\n end\n SavedPickupContainerItem(index,slot)\n if (PickupContainerItem_IsHooked) then\n --Your 'after' code here\n end\n end\nHooks modifying input values.\nAnother common practice for hooking safely is to modify the input of the orig function. For example by hooking HealthBar_OnValueChanged and changing the second argument from (smooth) to (not smooth) you can enable health bar color gradient changing without modifying the orig function. This means that other hooks that hooked the same function before your hook was defined will be using the modified parameters defined by your hook and that hooks called after your hook will use the orig parameters. This can be problematic, but is hard to avoid.\nHooks modifying return values.\nThe other similar hooking practice, not quite as well known and possibly less useful is the method of modifying the return values of a function by calling the orig, then using it's return values as arguments to determine new replacement return values. This has the advantage that you have both the function input arguments as well as the return values and then may not have to duplicate logic already done by the orig function. This can mean more efficiency as well as compatibility, but falls under the same problematic constraints of the prior method in that whether additional hook functions conflict or not often depends on the loading order of the hook assignment.\nHooking functions that do too much.\nAnother common problem with hooks is that the orig function does too much, so when replacing it for a small change in the middle it may then conflict with other hooks because the orig is never called. Most of the time this is the result of poor coding either in the case of the orig function (cant be avoided, gg Blizzard) or the hooker and can be avoided by hooking the functions internal to the orig function. Sometimes this is not very practical, as in the case of ChatFrame_OnEvent or FCF_OnUpdate, two of WoW's biggest troublemaker functions. In these cases you would often want to be able to call your function in place of the orig function while still calling other 'before' and 'after' hooks. Unfortunately this is nearly impossible without having the saved orig function defined before any hooks are done and then have the subsequent hooks known about or register with a hooking mechanism for management.\nHooking a function that changes in the next patch.\nThankless. Your hook works fine in the current patch, and then in the next patch, Blizzard adds a third parameter. Or the function suddenly starts returning multiple values. This is somewhat of a different category of problem than this article deals with though; read more about it in .\nHook Management Libraries.\nEven knowing all this, generating a suitably flexible, low overhead, compatibility minded hook management system is a definite challenge. Here are some of the libraries that attempt to make hooking simpler, safer, easier to debug and more compatible with multiple hooks.\nCosmos/Sea.\nCosmos has been using a hook management system since beta and it is in a continual state of fluctuation and improvement. In the early days it was added into the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20%28add-on%29\"&gt;Sea (add-on)&lt;/a&gt; library. New things have been added since then, such as the ability to hook to and from functions within tables and the ability to replace the return arguments. Around the dawning of WoW 1.9, &lt;a href=\"SeaHooks\"&gt;SeaHooks&lt;/a&gt; was created as an embeddable mini-library that was reverse compatible with the old Sea style hooks and also added new features such as modifying the input arguments from 'before' hooks, intercepting and modifying the return arguments from 'after' hooks and compatibility debugging to predict hook conflicts.\nAce.\n&lt;a href=\"AceHooks\"&gt;AceHooks&lt;/a&gt; is a Object Oriented framework for building AddOns, and it provides an abstraction for hooking methods and functions. This method is literally just an implementation of the standard hook method, and as such you are expected to act nicely (call your parent function passing the arguments) or purposely disrupt the hook chain, which is a bad thing. There is built-in prevention of double-hooks naturally, In addition the latest version of AceHook has some improvement on the hooking methods to provide proper integration with non-ace hooks.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wiki.wowace.com/index.php/AceHooks\"&gt;AceHooks&lt;/a&gt; is also an embeddable hooking library that can be used without the entire Ace framework.

The frame can also be used by third-party addons.\nOverview.\nThere is only one instance of the ColorPickerFrame, and, as such, only color selection request can be processed at a time. When the player interacts with the color picker, the frame calls functions assigned to the following variables:\nThe opacity slider's visibility is controlled by the codice_1 boolean value.\nShowing the color picker.\nThe ColorPickerFrame is already defined by Blizzard. You can display it by simply calling: ColorPickerFrame:Show()\nHowever, displaying it is not enough if you want it to have any functionality. So, you also need to define the following three functions:\nWhen you want to prompt the user to select a color, you need to assign your own callback functions to the ColorPickerFrame variables, set the currently selected color to your previous value, and show the ColorPickerFrame.\nTo set the initial color and opacity values, you need to:\nThe following example function performs all of the required tasks: sets the initial color, enables/disables the opacity control and registers your callback function before showing the color picker.\n function ShowColorPicker(r, g, b, a, changedCallback)\n ColorPickerFrame.hasOpacity, ColorPickerFrame.opacity = (a ~= nil), a;\n ColorPickerFrame.previousValues = {r,g,b,a};\n ColorPickerFrame.func, ColorPickerFrame.opacityFunc, ColorPickerFrame.cancelFunc = \n changedCallback, changedCallback, changedCallback;\n ColorPickerFrame:SetColorRGB(r,g,b);\n ColorPickerFrame:Hide(); -- Need to run the OnShow handler.\n ColorPickerFrame:Show();\n end\nResponding to user interactions.\nThe functions assigned to the ColorPickerFrame table will be called when the user alters the color; your registered callback function should handle the changed color by updating your internal color storage and the display. The function is called without arguments, except when the user cancels the color selection (in which case, the previousValue field on ColorPickerFrame is passed as the sole argument).\nYou can fetch the user-selected color values using two functions:\nAn example callback handler function is shown below.\n local r,g,b,a = 1, 0, 0, 1;\n local function myColorCallback(restore)\n local newR, newG, newB, newA;\n if restore then\n -- The user bailed, we extract the old color from the table created by ShowColorPicker.\n newR, newG, newB, newA = unpack(restore);\n else\n -- Something changed\n newA, newR, newG, newB = OpacitySliderFrame:GetValue(), ColorPickerFrame:GetColorRGB();\n end\n -- Update our internal storage.\n r, g, b, a = newR, newG, newB, newA;\n -- And update any UI elements that use this color...\n end\nThis can then be used with the previously described ShowColorPicker function:\n ShowColorPicker(r, g, b, a, myColorCallback);"}

This hall splits in to two wings; one side has &lt;a href=\"Ares%20the%20Oathbound\"&gt;Ares the Oathbound&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Harpoon%20Operation%20Manual\"&gt;Harpoon Operation Manual&lt;/a&gt;, and the other further splits into a long hallway infested with undead and the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Judgement\"&gt;Ring of Judgement&lt;/a&gt; where four Mini Bosses: &lt;a href=\"Firjus%20the%20Soul%20Crusher\"&gt;Firjus the Soul Crusher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jlarborn%20the%20Strategist\"&gt;Jlarborn the Strategist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Oluf%20the%20Violent\"&gt;Oluf the Violent&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yorus%20the%20Flesh%20Harvester\"&gt;Yorus the Flesh Harvester&lt;/a&gt;, can be fought.\nThere are a few quests here, notably &lt;a href=\"The%20Shining%20Light\"&gt;The Shining Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ring%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;The Ring of Judgment&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the Vrykul are using the undead to dig a tunnel to &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt;, players will move through the undead-infested tunnels. \"While there is an undead-infested tunnel here, this info may refer to &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; proper.\"\nTrivia.\nIt was previously reported by playtesters at Blizzcon and the Leipzig Games Convention that Utgarde Catacombs was the first wing of the &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; instance, with the mini bosses fought at the Ring of Judgement being actual bosses along with the current three, and area details of the Keep and Catacombs combined. This was later partially reconciled with the Catacombs being thought to be the uninstanced lobby of Utgarde Keep, but when WotLK was launched it was confirmed that they are separate, albeit related and close by areas."}
{"id": "117346", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=117346", "title": "Utgarde Keep", "text": "Utgarde Keep (pronounced \"OOT-ghaard\") is the name of a &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; which is the location of two dungeons in \"World of Warcraft\", as well as the first dungeon of the same keep (see below). The keep is located on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Cauldros\"&gt;Lake Cauldros&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. It was built into the fjord this region was named for, so it's got a lake at its feet and a waterfall tumbling down the cliffs on either side.\nUtgarde is inhabited by the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;, bent on proving their strength to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, who will raise the most worthy of their warriors to serve him beyond the grave. Enemy encounters within the keep include vrykul, their minions (such as &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s), and various types of undead.\nThe massive structure of stone blocks with flying buttresses has giant skulls carved into the cliffs below the keep. The height of the keep is like the social ladder for the vrykul: the higher on the food chain one is, the higher up in the keep they live. The keep and Wyrmskull village below it are the home of the Dragonflayer clan, which leads the vrykul.\nThe first of two wings, known simply as &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, was available for play at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt;. It is suitable for a 5-man level 70-72 party.\nThe second wing, &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Utgarde Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, is a more difficult, 5-man instance for level 80 players. Besides the Keep and the Pinnacle, there are also the &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Catacombs\"&gt;Utgarde Catacombs&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth wings also have a &lt;a href=\"Heroic\"&gt;Heroic&lt;/a&gt; setting for level 80 players.\nHistory.\nIt is said that, in ancient times, the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; inhabited the land, founding a vast and prosperous civilization. Then one day, without warning or explanation, the vrykul vanished, leaving behind only deserted villages and abandoned temples.\n\"Utgarde Keep was long thought to be abandoned, a relic of a lost civilization among the central cliffs of the Howling Fjord. Yet in recent days something has roused the fortress' slumbering residents, the vrykul.\"\n\"Feared to be allied with the Scourge, the savage race now terrorizes nearby settlements. With ferocious proto-dragons at their command and unparalleled prowess in battle, the vrykul pose a direct threat to Horde and Alliance campaigns in Northrend. Perhaps the only way to break the will of Utgarde's denizens is to defeat their revered leaders - but any heroes who fail in this task will surely become trophies to line the ancient halls of the vrykul fortress.\"\nDue to the settlement of Valgarde, the vrykul have recently returned. Loyal to the slumbering &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;, rumors abound that they serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. They are savage in nature, and tie into the titan creation myth that is slowly unfolding as events of the expansion take place. These formidable warriors have begun attacking &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; settlements, and many of the vrykul are pouring out of the fortress of Utgarde Keep, not far from &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, King Ymiron had his throne in Utgarde Keep. The vrykul's alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; meant that the Lich King sent an &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Prince Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, to reside at Utgarde. He oversaw Scourge operations in Howling Fjord and made himself a general pain in the rear around the region, working with &lt;a href=\"Ingvar%20the%20Plunderer\"&gt;Ingvar the Plunderer&lt;/a&gt; to organize raids. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s eventually killed him, but he was later resurrected.\nYmiron's ultimate reward was to be made undead, and then to get killed like a dog by adventurers at the pinnacle of his own keep.\nUtgarde Keep is their main base of operations and is similar to the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s' &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, the Dragonflayer clan also built massive engines of war and trains proto-dragons to act as steeds for their raids."}

If the group wipes and reappears at the dungeon entrance, ropes can be used to climb down without taking damage.\nIn phase 1, Raigonn is nearly invulnerable. The tank should stay down and keep aggro on Raigonn and random mantid adds that periodically spawn. It is also preferable to leave one DPS down to help the tank quickly kill Swarmbringers before they can summon enough swarms to overwhelm the tank. The remaining DPS should jump into cannons, which will launch them on top of Raigonn, and attack the weak spot.\nAfter the weak spot drops to zero health, phase 2 begins, and Raigonn becomes vulnerable. This phase is straightforward: kill the remaining adds, then focus on Raigonn. The only thing to watch for is his charge attack: move out of the way when you see him cast Fixate."}

Versions of the spell can raise corpses into mindless undead, although some versions may give true life back to an individual. Versions of the spell can be used by casters both good and evil. Evil casters such as &lt;a href=\"necrolyte\"&gt;necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s will create undead creatures, and &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s (druids, priests, etc) can bring someone back to life.\nIn Warcraft I.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Necrolytes&lt;/a&gt; have close ties to the dark forces of Hell, and in consequence study the forbidden arts of the dead. They have gained the ability to bind the bodies of the dead to this domain, creating armies of soulless creatures. With no minds to speak of, they will disdain the use of weapons, seeking to rend the flesh of those they are directed to attack with their bare boned hands.\nIn Warcraft II.\nThis dark &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magik&lt;/a&gt; is the final legacy of the Orc &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s who were destroyed shortly after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The Death Knight can animate corpses of the newly dead and then command these monstrosities to attack their enemies. This terrifying spell is the paramount power of the Death Knight as it serves to augment the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces with vast armies of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;the Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaise Dead (WC3).\nThrough the powers of Ner\u2019zhul, the corpses of the recently slain can be raised again as skeleton warriors. Though relentless and fearless, these mindless automatons of death soon fall apart and fall to dust. Spell used by the Scourge, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRaise Dead (RPG).\nA healer can restore life to a deceased creature. The healer can raise a creature that has been dead for no longer than one day. In addition, the subject\u2019s soul must be free and willing to return. If the subject\u2019s soul is not willing to return, the spell does not work; therefore, a subject that wants to return will return. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. Normal poison and normal disease are cured in the process of raising the subject, but magical diseases and curses are not undone. While the spell closes mortal wounds and repairs lethal damage of most kinds, the body of the creature to be raised must be whole. Otherwise, missing parts are still missing when the creature is brought back to life. A creature who has been turned into an undead creature or killed by a death effect can\u2019t be raised by this spell. Constructs, elementals, outsiders, and undead creatures can\u2019t be raised (this includes the Forsaken). The spell cannot bring back a creature that has died of old age. Raise dead is weaker form of the Resurrection spell.\nRaise Dead (World of Warcraft).\nA &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; ability which turns a corpse into a &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Ally\"&gt;Risen Ally&lt;/a&gt; which lasts for two minutes and has a number of abilities. Unless one has a point in &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Ghouls\"&gt;Master of Ghouls&lt;/a&gt; then the ghoul becomes a pet, much like hunter or warlock pets."}
