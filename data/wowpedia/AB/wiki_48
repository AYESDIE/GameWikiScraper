It presented information about a variety of things in the Warcraft universe. The original article, formerly located at &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;, did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website. \nAlso known as: Lord of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Satyrs\"&gt;Satyrs&lt;/a&gt;, Satyr Lord\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Demons\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt; type: Satyr\nAffiliation: &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\nInsatiably curious about the first Well of Eternity, Lord Xavius bent all of his knowledge and effort to researching the Well's capabilities. He even went so far as to have his eyes removed and replaced with magical spheres that allowed him to see beyond the range of normal vision. Through his ambition and hard work, Xavius became Queen &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s chief counselor before the Great Sundering.\nCorruption and Defeat.\nXavius was the first &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; to be contacted by Sargeras, creator of the Burning Legion. In moments Xavius had been enthralled by the dark titan. Sargeras swiftly corrupted the rest of the Highborne in the royal palace, including the queen, and convinced them to begin summoning Sargeras' demonic minions into &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe War of the Ancients broke out, and Xavius remained one of the chief agents of Sargeras' will. At last &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; called upon the power of nature to slay Xavius. Repeatedly struck by lightning, Xavius screamed in pain as he was destroyed in a violent thunderstorm. Even the cloud of dust that remained of his body was dispersed by an angry wind.\nA Second Chance.\nThe counselor's failure infuriated Sargeras, who spent some time torturing the &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Night%20Elves\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;'s disembodied spirit as punishment. Eventually Sargeras decided that Xavius could still prove useful, and so Sargeras remade Xavius into a demon: the first satyr in existence. Only Xavius' eyes remained unchanged from those of his previous night elf existence.\nSummoned back to Azeroth at Sargeras' command, Xavius gleefully used his new powers of persuasion and corruption to convert further night elves into satyrs, including Peroth'arn. He also encouraged dark thoughts of jealousy and ambition in &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, thereby ensuring a chain of events that would culminate in Illidan's being imprisoned in a barrow prison for ten thousand years.\nPrimarily because he knew the deed would cause Malfurion great anguish, Xavius and a group of other satyrs kidnapped High Priestess &lt;a href=\"The%20Warcraft%20Encyclopedia/Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; from the battlefield. In retaliation, Malfurion struck out with his druidic powers and caused an oak tree to grow inside Xavius. Even as the satyr swore that one day he would have revenge, the tree fed off his flesh and grew rapidly. In moments the tree had utterly consumed his body.\nMillennia after the Satyr Lord met his end, night elves who know the tale of Xavius fear that some day he will manage to make good on his threat. To other satyrs, however, Xavius has become an object of worship: they hope he will return to Azeroth and lead them. Aside from demons, only a few warped individuals here and there pray to Xavius today, and they do so in the hope of being transformed into satyrs.\nReferences.\nThe information could still retrieved from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml\"&gt;http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/encyclopedia/index.xml&lt;/a&gt;."}

Also, if you have a flying mount, you can save some swimming time by first throwing your net at the schools that spawn closest to the floating pieces of ice, then jumping on the ice, mounting and flying to the next school.\nOrcas and sharks in the area will also occasionally drop a &lt;a href=\"Tasty%20Reef%20Fish\"&gt;Tasty Reef Fish&lt;/a&gt; or two.\nAlternate strategy.\nTo save even more time, use a single fish to activate a male. Then run across the straight and &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; a female. Then &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt; her across the straight to the male. This saves time collecting fish, because you need only one to make the male receptive, and it saves time getting the pair together, because kiting the aggressive female will be a little faster than repeatedly bumping the male across. (Remember that the female has to arrive alive, so use minimal-damage attacks to keep her following you.)\nKilling the female, of course, violates the spirit of the quest, though not the letter of it.\nMacros.\nHere are two macros which are helpful for this quest.\nPulling the cow: Replace Icy Touch with a ranged attack appropriate to your class which does little damage.\n /target Reef Cow\n /cast Icy Touch\nActivating the bull \n /target Reef Bull\n /use Tasty Reef Fish"}

Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; is interrogated by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, but at what cost?\nPlot.\nIn Stormwind City, Varian, Anduin, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; oversee the preparations for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; when a dense fog begins enveloping city, unsettling many of the workers and guards. Suddenly, a &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army consisting of &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; appears and attacks the capital while a &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; appears in the sky and a &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;large ghostly figure&lt;/a&gt; yells out the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s message to the Alliance. Varian immediately rallies his soldiers to fight back and tells Bolvar to get Anduin to safety. While killing Scourge, the king orders his &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; to shield the city and force the necropolis out to sea. One undead tries to strike the king from behind while he's distracted, but Anduin decapitates it by hurling a dagger through its neck. While Bolvar takes the prince up to a nearby tower from where he can protect his father with his bow, Anduin laments that he simply longs for peace.\nMeanwhile in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; holds a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh accuses Thrall of turning the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s into weaklings. Believing that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; should rule all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, he advocates conquering the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s before sending their forces to crush the Lich King in Northrend. Rehgar quietly tells Thrall that Garrosh is close to challenging him. The &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; concurs and decides to force the &lt;a href=\"mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;mag'har&lt;/a&gt;'s hand by saying that he will not make the same mistakes as &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh's father&lt;/a&gt;. Provoked, Garrosh challenges Thrall to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which the warchief accepts. The two orcs duel in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt; until Saurfang runs in and informs them that the Scourge is attacking Orgrimmar. Thrall and Garrosh interrupt their duel to join Saurfang and the others in defending the city from the undead. During the battle, Rehgar incorrectly concludes that the Scourge must have orchestrated the attack at &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to kill Thrall and throw the orcs into disarray before the Lich King's assault.\nIn Theramore, Jaina, Aegwynn, and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; question Garona to find out where &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; might have been taken. The &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; informs them that Med'an's kidnapper's name is &lt;a href=\"Stasia%20Fallshadow\"&gt;Stasia&lt;/a&gt;, but she is unable to recall anything more and experiences great pain when trying to do so. Jaina warns that they need to proceed carefully, since it could be dangerous to remove any of the deeply embedded magical blocks on Garona's mind. With no regard for her own safety, Garona insists that they continue anyway so they can rescue her son as quickly as possible.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; scolds Stasia for failing in her mission, but she insists that she did what she had to do and points out that she has captured Med'an, the most vital part of their plans. Suddenly, the boy breaks free of Stasia's stasis spell and tries to lash out. In response, Cho'gall throws him up on the corpse of &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, where whispers from the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; begin barraging his mind. Cho'gall is contacted by his &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; spy, who informs him of the Lich King's attacks on cities throughout Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; declares that with the leaders of the world distracted, it is time for his master's resurrection to begin.\nBack in Theramore, Jaina tries to unlock Garona's most recent memories through a ritual. The half-orc begins to remember the orders Cho'gall gave her even though it causes her distress, and before passing out she manages to partially yell the word \"Ahn'Qiraj\".\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl&lt;/a&gt; approaches Theramore on his &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; and reflects on how he has raised Med'an like his own son. He regrets lying to the boy about his mother and wishes that he would have asked more questions about Med'an's parentage. When the mage spots a Scourge necropolis approaching Theramore, he lands in the city, immobilizes some guards who mistake him for being Scourge, and bursts into the &lt;a href=\"mage%20tower\"&gt;mage tower&lt;/a&gt; where Jaina, Aegwynn, and Valeera are watching over the unconscious Garona to inform them of the impending attack and ask where Med'an is. Meryl and Aegwynn are surprised to see each other, and Aegwynn explains to the others that Meryl was a founding a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. He was mortally wounded during the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt; but was \"forced by circumstance\" to survive as an undead, and his purpose has always been to protect Azeroth. Meryl then explains how he came to have Med'an in his care. When Jaina asks about the boy's father, Meryl simply replies that Garona never told him and he didn't think it mattered. In the middle of the conversation, Meryl suddenly realizes that Med'an looks like Aegwynn and begins to wonder what that means for who the child's father is.\nThe Scourge reaches Theramore. While Meryl would like to stay and fight, he states that his duty is to Med'an first and foremost. Jaina tells Valeera to accompany the mage to Ahn'Qiraj. At first, the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; refuses; the Scourge destroyed her homeland, and while Meryl is not Scourge, an undead is still an undead in her eyes. However, she reluctantly agrees after Aegwynn tells her that her fate and that of all of all Azeroth may rest in Meryl's hands. The mage teleports himself and the elf to Ahn'Qiraj, but unfortunately they arrive in the middle of a group of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; led by Stasia. The cultists immediately attack the intruders, but Meryl begins unleashing fire while Valeera jumps forward, decapitates Stasia, and kicks her body into a nearby bonfire. While Meryl holds the cultists at bay, Valeera runs into the nearby main building, where a weakened Med'an is still tied to C'Thun's body and being assaulted by the Old God's voice. Valeera kills the guards, cuts down the boy, and carries him outside, where Meryl suddenly comes face to face with Cho'gall, who has started to gain monstrous mutations due to his master's influence. Meryl kills the remaining cultists attacking him, but Cho'gall effortlessly knocks the mage unconscious with a single punch. Valeera is left on her own to face the huge ogre, who gloats that he can sense &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;a demon&lt;/a&gt; lurking inside her."}

With nowhere else to go, these outcasts resettled in the &lt;a href=\"ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, founding a powerful society devoted to their Dark Lady.\nThe kingdom of Lordaeron stood for centuries against countless threats and was the birthplace of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Even after the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the Scourge, many of its fortifications remained standing\u2014a significant tactical advantage for whomever holds this territory.\nThis &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; was once the glorious &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. A mighty &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nation\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt; and the fulcrum of the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; took up residence beneath Lordaeron's ruins, establishing the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. The Banshee Queen built her seat of power there, where prying eyes could not easily see.\nMany innocents were killed by the Lich King's armies and raised into the undead Scourge to serve him forevermore. Sylvanas Windrunner managed to save a remnant of them and restore their free will. Though they regard undeath as a \"torment,\" each Forsaken finds their own reasons to exist.\nA tragic past and an uncertain future have led Sylvanas Windrunner down dark paths. First to ensure the survival of her people and then to seek an ultimate victory against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. As a cunning strategist, a skillful &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;, and a focused leader, she reigns as &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and her tenure will certainly not be remembered as a peaceful one.\nIn life, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt; was the only human capable enough to be named a &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; of Silvermoon. In undeath, he has sworn absolute loyalty to Sylvanas Windrunner, believing that her leadership is the only hope of survival for the Forsaken... no matter how dark her path becomes.\nWhen the Scourge swarmed across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. They were led by one of the nation's greatest heroes\u2014&lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. As the Lich King, Arthas used his dark command to hold bound the army of the undead.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; were exiled from &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, cutting them off from the source of their &lt;a href=\"immortal\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;ity\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Across the seas, they created a new font of power, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and established &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; around it as the capital of their &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;new nation&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe high elves of Silvermoon were almost completely wiped out when the Scourge &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; their kingdom. The survivors called themselves &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; or \"children of the blood.\" Today, they are more commonly known as \"blood elves.\"\nSilvermoon was an early ally of &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;human nations&lt;/a&gt;, but the battles of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; left the elven kingdom devastated. Eventually, the blood elves followed Sylvanas Windrunner, the former &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General\"&gt;ranger-general&lt;/a&gt; of Silvermoon, into allegiance with the Horde.\nTo save Azeroth from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed the source of their immortality: the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to reclaim their glory, the night elves planted a new World Tree just off the &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; coast, naming it &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the \"crown of the world.\" Though the early days of the tree were troubled, it would come to serve as the home of the night elves for many years.\nThe night elves built a city high in the branches of Teldrassil\u2014a quiet, peaceful refuge called &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. It was revered both by &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and the worshippers of the moon &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;dess, &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The temples and shrines nestled amid the massive branches were some of the most pristine wonders the world had ever seen.\nIn the wake of the Burning Legion's unsuccessful &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, tensions between the Horde and the Alliance boiled over. The opening salvo of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; was a &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;surprise attack&lt;/a&gt; on Teldrassil. Although the Horde planned on capturing the World Tree, Sylvanas ordered her army to burn it instead, an act that plunged the world into a ruthless, bloody conflict.\nMany millennia ago, the Burning Legion corrupted and conquered the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. The few who escaped called themselves &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, \"exiled ones.\" As they fled from world to world searching for a safe haven, the draenei knew full well the threat the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s posed to Azeroth and stood with the Alliance to repel the Legion's third invasion of this world.\nThe Prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; has been blessed\u2014or perhaps cursed\u2014with foresight. He was the sole eredar leader who saw what the Burning Legion would do to his people, so he fled with as many &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s as he could take. Thousands of years later, he &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; the champions of Azeroth back to his homeworld to confront his fallen brethren and end the threat of the Legion\u2014a mission that tested his faith but ultimately proved successful.\nThe Alliance capital of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; is a testament to survival, unity, and strength. Decades ago, Stormwind &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;was razed&lt;/a&gt; to ashes, but its citizens endured, rebuilt, and reclaimed their land. It has become the largest human nation and the military seat of power for the entire Alliance.\nThe noble &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt; has adorned the crest of Stormwind for generations. The stalwart city has often had to stand alone against catastrophe but has never failed to offer shelter to members of its pride.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the fiery but noble leader of Stormwind, sacrificed his life to allow the armies of the Alliance to escape annihilation at the hands of the Burning Legion.\n&lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; was once proud that his &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; had stubbornly kept to itself. However, when the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;curse of the worgen&lt;/a&gt; threatened to leave him and his people as little more than feral beasts, the Alliance helped them gain control. Now part of the Alliance once more, Greymane serves as the adviser to Stormwind's king, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and has become as protective of the young leader as a father would be toward his son.\n&lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; was once the naval backbone of the Alliance. After Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; died trying to eradicate &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s new Horde, Kul Tiras broke ties with Stormwind. For years, they stubbornly maintained their isolation in the face of constant dangers\u2014a choice they would come to regret. Now they have rejoined the Alliance and keep the seas fortified against the Horde.\nBlessed by the spirits of the sea itself, the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20navy\"&gt;Kul Tiran navy&lt;/a&gt; is a powerful force, crewed by sailors descended from centuries of seafaring traditions.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; left &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; at a young age to study the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; arts. When she returned home years later, her own people blamed her for the death of her father, Daelin Proudmoore. But after proving her dedication to her people, Jaina was not only welcomed back but given command of the Kul Tiran navy.\nDeep in the heart of the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; stands &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, the ancestral home of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Waterfalls of magma and bountiful supplies of metallic ores allowed the denizens of Ironforge to become masters of smithing and weaponry, making this stronghold one of the most resilient cities in Azeroth.\nThe dwarves did not always live together in peace. Ironforge was ruled solely by King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; until his apparent death several years ago, though his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;, initially rose to take the throne, it was clear the old monarchy would not please all the dwarf &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s. Representatives of all three clans\u2014&lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt;\u2014reached a tenuous agreement to rule Ironforge as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Though fraught with tension at first, the three clans slowly regained trust in one another.\nIronforge became a sanctuary for the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s after their &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, was rendered uninhabitable. Their new home in Ironforge, named &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; and led by &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, became a wondrous place of invention and experimentation, though its inhabitants never stopped longing to reclaim their &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;lost city&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilt in the canyons of an unforgiving desert, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; was the founding location of the uncorrupted Horde. Massive walls and tall &lt;a href=\"tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;s protect its inhabitants against a hostile world. Its streets are filled with outcasts, survivors, and newcomers who joined together in the creed of strength and honor: \"For the Horde!\"\nMost of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish people were once damned by the demonic power of the Burning Legion. But after heavy sacrifices, they secured a costly redemption. The orcs freed themselves from the &lt;a href=\"blood-curse\"&gt;blood-curse&lt;/a&gt; and regained their honor.\nThe nomadic &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt; once roamed the plains of Kalimdor, living off the land and protecting the wilds from any foes. When they joined the Horde, they settled at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, building a city high upon the mesa above &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Runespear\"&gt;Bloodhoof Runespear&lt;/a&gt; has been passed from &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; to chieftain for twenty generations. Each chieftain writes their story in runes across the spear's shaft. The mighty spear was destroyed in &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, a ritual of single combat, between &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Its fragments were burned on Cairne's funeral pyre, thought his son, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, and friend Thrall still hold pieces.\nThe &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s were among the earliest sentient creatures to form &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s on Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s were the first to form &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;an empire&lt;/a&gt;. One so resilient it has endured for more than fifteen thousand years.\nSince ancient times, trolls have offered gifts and sacrifices to their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for blessings and power. Many of these loa appear as wise &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; or fearsome monsters, while others take a more troll-like form. Whether benevolent or cruel, every loa draws strength from the devotion of its worshipers.\nThough most trolls worship the loa, it takes a brave (or foolish) soul to worship &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the loa of death. Every dead troll\u2014or any creature killed by Bwonsamdi's followers\u2014gives him more power and influence. Recent wars have granted him more strength than ever, and a &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;desperate pact&lt;/a&gt; has given him dominion over the Zandalari's &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;ruling bloodline&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; has been a mighty seafaring empire for millennia. When war broke out between the Alliance and the Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Zandalari fleet&lt;/a&gt; became the backbone of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Horde%20navy\"&gt;naval power&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzeroth is a world scarred by conflict and coveted by the forces of evil, and yet it has withstood the terrors of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;cosmos&lt;/a&gt; for millennia. The &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; is an enduring reminder that each catastrophe has a cost and that the champions of the world must always be ready to defend their home against new threats."}

Their aged and wizened leaders have been replaced by ruthless firebrands who lead the crazed furbolgs to prey upon the denizens of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Where the furbolgs coexisted peacefully with the night elves for ages, with claw and fang they now seek to carve out their own home in the endless forest.\nFound in: &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Ashenvale Forest\n&lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;Harpy&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce content to confine themselves to their ancestral home in the peaks of the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the feral and vicious harpies of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; have spread their influence across the length and breadth of the continent. The vicious winged women have taken to raiding unsuspecting caravans and savaging any who cross into their territories. Their nests, littered with the gruesome remains of their victims, are now a common sight from the arid mesas of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; to the lush forests of Teldrassil.\nFound in: Teldrassil, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, Durotar, the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonspawn\"&gt;Green Dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeeding the call of their goddess, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, the Green Dragonspawn stand to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the waking evil within the &lt;a href=\"Sunken%20Temple\"&gt;Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Dragonspawn form the ranks of the ground army within each of the five great &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Among the murk-ridden marshes of the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, the Green Dragonspawn patrol at the behest of their dreaming mistress; Ysera has warned of a lurking terror within the temple, and her loyal servants are determined to protect the land from the emerging doom.\nFound in: Swamp of Sorrows\n&lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane Troll&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Frostmane Trolls once ruled over the frigid lands of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, only to have their empire fall to &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; armies. These tribal creatures were driven to the hills in retreat -- a shameful blow to their warring nature. With King &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;'s forces split between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; Wars and quelling the &lt;a href=\"Trogg\"&gt;Trogg&lt;/a&gt; invasion, the Frostmane Trolls have seized the opportunity to reclaim Dun Morogh in an attempt to restore the kingdom that crumbled under Dwarven might ages ago.\nFound in: Dun Morogh\n&lt;a href=\"Rockjaw%20tribe\"&gt;Rockjaw Trogg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe jagged, snowy peaks of Dun Morogh provide the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge Dwarves&lt;/a&gt; with a limitless supply of &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; for their ambitious &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; endeavors. From the city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, dug deep into the mountains, to &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar\"&gt;Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the marvels of Dwarven ingenuity mark the land. Not all is at peace in Dun Morogh, however. The Dwarves' insatiable digging at the &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Bolar%20Quarry\"&gt;Gol'Bolar Quarry&lt;/a&gt; unleashed a menacing tribe of Rockjaw Troggs from their subterranean den. While the massing Trogg invasion looms over the lands of King Magni Bronzebeard, the Frostmane Trolls have taken advantage of the distraction to attempt to reclaim their ancestral home. Life is harsh in the white-powdered mountains of Dun Morogh, but what the Dwarven people lack in height they make up for in heart and valor.\nFound in: Dun Morogh\n&lt;a href=\"Skeleton\"&gt;Skeleton&lt;/a&gt;.\nA strange darkness has recently engulfed the region of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, bringing out Skeletons and other &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures from deep within the shadows. While gangly and seemingly frail, the Skeletons possess superhuman strength and are highly resistant to most physical attacks. Though it is unclear whom the Skeletons work for or whether they serve a greater purpose at all, it is alarmingly clear that they seek to destroy anything in their paths.\nFound in: Duskwood\n&lt;a href=\"Venom%20Spider\"&gt;Venom Spider&lt;/a&gt;.\nLong ago, &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; was populated with a group of &lt;a href=\"Spider\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;s that lived peacefully among the woods. However, when the curse fell over Duskwood - turning the once peaceful woodland into a realm of terror - the Spiders began to mutate and grow to monstrous proportions. Now, the lurking Venom Spider hunt their hapless prey in all of the shadowed corners of the land. Possessing both deadly acidic &lt;a href=\"venom\"&gt;venom&lt;/a&gt; and powerful webbing, these cruel &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s stalk any foolish wanderers who stray too far into the haunted woods.\nFound in: Duskwood\n&lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese powerful, enchanted creatures are something of an anomaly throughout the land of Azeroth. They are not known for their ill temper, but if provoked, these hulking creatures will defend themselves and their nesting grounds with ferocity. Fond of the legendary \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Singing%20Crystals\"&gt;singing crystal&lt;/a&gt;s\" of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, the Basilisk have learned that consuming these crystals will give them exceptional powers to lull their prey to sleep or even turn them to stone. As a side effect of eating the crystals, the Basilisk have mutated: the mystical crystals now grow from their scaly hides, giving them even greater power against their enemies.\nFound in: Stranglethorn Vale\n&lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;Jungle Troll&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Jungle Trolls are dark, superstitious creatures who revel in the hunt and the rigors of personal combat. In ancient times, the Jungle Trolls reigned over the lands south of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Though their glorious kingdoms have since fallen to ruin, they seek to reclaim the dark majesty of their former empire. Equipped with &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; magics and unparalleled combat skills, these Trolls have become relentless in their efforts to reclaim their jungle homeland.\nFound in: Stranglethorn Vale\n&lt;a href=\"Harvest%20golem\"&gt;Harvest Golem&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe terrifying Harvest Golems are &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"construct\"&gt;construct&lt;/a&gt;s programmed to hunt down and terminate the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. Though their origin is uncertain, some believe that only the wily &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s could have created these mechanical monstrosities. Others speculate that the &lt;a href=\"Defias\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; Thieves had the Harvest Golems built to scare off the local inhabitants of Westfall so that they could run their smuggling operations with greater impunity. Whatever the case may be, the Harvest Golems have done their jobs well - eliciting terror in anyone foolish enough to roam the fallow fields of Westfall alone.\nFound in: Westfall\n&lt;a href=\"Defias%20Thief\"&gt;Defias Thief&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegend holds that the Defias Brotherhood was founded by a group of noblemen who once stood for freedom and justice. Having long ago forsaken those noble virtues, the mysterious Defias faction is now composed of thieves, &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s, and vicious &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;. This vile group is determined to wreak havoc upon and ultimately destroy the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Convinced that the Nobles are corrupt and villainous, the Defias Brotherhood has waged an underground war in their quest to rid the land of their hated enemies.\nFound in: Westfall, Elwynn Forest\n&lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;Gnoll&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe cunning Gnoll packs of the Redridge Mountains have notoriously plagued the Human and Dwarven kingdoms alike. Recent times, however, have seen the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw Pack&lt;/a&gt; of Gnolls became a more ominous threat, raiding farms and Human villages throughout Elwynn forest. Many speculate that the historically dimwitted Gnolls have conspired with another force, which is equipping them with weapons, tactical leadership, and magic. Though it is unclear what the Gnolls are after, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Marshal\"&gt;Stormwind Marshal&lt;/a&gt;s have now realized that the creatures pose an obvious threat to the kingdom and must be eradicated.\nFound in: Elwynn Forest\n&lt;a href=\"Kobold\"&gt;Kobold&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe grimy, vermin-like Kobolds dwell deep within the crags and rocky caves of the Redridge Mountains. These slovenly creatures are best known for their penchant for digging and their underground excavations. Most recently, the Kobolds have found themselves falling prey to the merciless Riverpaw Pack of Gnolls. These cunning Gnolls have proven themselves to be merciless taskmasters, forcing the Kobolds into an existence of neverending drudgery. Since their enslavement, the historically meek Kobolds have grown bitter and aggressive toward any creature that meddles with their ceaseless labor.\nFound in: Elwynn Forest\nReferences.\nThe bestiary can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20080813064258/http%3A//eu.blizzard.com/en/wow/townhall/beastiary/furbolg.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;.

It presented the classes to be implemented in the game. The original article did not survive the overhaul of the \"World of Warcraft Official Website\", but can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nClasses.\nWhat type of hero will you be? This is one of the first questions you'll answer when playing World of Warcraft. After deciding what race to play, each character will choose one of several classes. Each race has its own list of class options available to it. Throughout their entire careers, characters will be able to learn from a pool of over 1000 spells and skills. A character's class will help determine which spells and skills he or she can master; this page lists just a few for each class. Below you will find information detailing each of the classes you'll be able to play in World of Warcraft, including a few examples of the numerous spells and skills available to each class.\nThe Paladin.\nUpholders of the Holy Light and defenders of the Alliance, the Paladins can be found from the northern forests of the Tirisfal Glades, fighting back the advance of the Forsaken, to the southern reaches of the Blasted Lands, ceaselessly upholding their vigil against demonic forces from beyond the Dark Portal. Wielding their mighty hammers and the strength of the Light, these holy warriors command forces in battle, all the while throwing themselves to where the fighting is the thickest. Here are a few sample spells available to Paladins:\n Divine Shield - Drawing on their faith in the Holy Light, Paladins are able to surround themselves with an impregnable shield that renders them impervious to physical attacks and magical spells.\n Devotion Aura - A paladin's specialty lies in the ability to command. Those who follow one of the holy warriors feel themselves steeled in battle by their leader's courage and strength.\n Holy Light - Manifesting the power of the Light, Paladins are able to heal their comrades in battle using their holy magic.\n\"...and many more.\"\nThe Rogue.\nAt home in the shadows and skilled at disappearing from sight, the Rogues of Azeroth are most comfortable when acting in the background. Twisting events to their favor, striking only when advantage is greatest: this is where a Rogue excels. With their cunning tricks, physical abilities, and mastery of concealment and disguise, Rogues have no trouble finding employment as thieves, cutthroats, spies, and assassins. Here are a few sample skills available to Rogues:\n Backstab - Silent as a whisper, a Rogue can slip behind a target, and in the blink of an eye, bury a weapon into the victim's back.\n Stealth - From a clump of bushes in the deep forest to the streets of a bustling city marketplace, Rogues can render themselves invisible and unseen to all but the keenest of observers.\n Dual Wield - Through diligent training and practice, Rogues are able to master the art of dual-weapon combat, making them an even more dangerous foe.\n\"...and many more.\"\nThe Priest.\nPriests lead the many faiths spread throughout the disparate lands of the world of Azeroth. In Kalimdor, Night Elf Priestesses revere the moon goddess Elune, while Dwarven priests in Khaz Modan deliver the message of the Light to their people. In the ruins of Lordaeron, the undead priests of the Forsaken, their faith twisted and tainted by their tortured existences, spread a dark interpretation of the Holy Light. Regardless of their faith, however, all Priests share in their ability to manipulate the minds of those who turn to them for spiritual guidance. Here are a few sample spells available to Priests:\n Sleep - Through training, Priests become masters of manipulating the mind. They are able to lull a creature or person to sleep, rendering them completely immobile -- as long as the target is not disturbed from its slumber.\n Heal - Warrior and Mage alike can be brought low by injury, but the Priest can restore their health through magic, enabling the injured to return to battle anew.\n Shadow Word: Pain - Though traditionally benign in nature, Priestly magic has a darker side as well. Through this word of darkness, a Priest can cause excruciating pain to a targeted victim for an extended period of time.\n\"...and many more.\"\nThe Hunter.\nAzeroth is home to a wide variety of beasts. From the new world of Lordaeron to the old world of Kalimdor, all manner of creatures can be found. Some are friendly, some are ferocious and aggressive - yet they all have one thing in common. Each creature shares a special connection with Hunters. Hunters track, tame and slay all manner of animals and beasts found in the wilds. Whether they rely on bows or firearms, Hunters consider their weapons and pets to be their only true friends. Here are a few sample skills available to Hunters:\n Beast Tracking - Hunters can find and follow a wide variety of animal tracks, allowing them to locate their elusive prey with ease.\n Beast Soothe - Not every encounter with a beast is a friendly one, and Hunters can soothe ravenous animals whenever necessary.\n Beast Taming - Beasts are found in all shapes, colors and sizes. It is the special journey of the Hunter to find which he is most connected to - and tame it. Once tamed, the beast will grow, learn and be the Hunter's constant companion.\n\"...and many more.\"\nThe Warlock.\nWarlocks were mages that delved too deeply into the roots of demonic power. Consumed by a lust for dark knowledge, they've tapped into chaotic magics from beyond the world. The Burning Legion now feeds them their powers, allowing them to channel destructive energies and call upon the powerful emissaries of their demon masters. Here are a few sample spells available to Warlocks:\n Immolate - The devouring fires of entropy are one of the primary forces Warlocks wield. They can cause their foes to ignite in flames that burn flesh, bone, and soul.\n Anti-Magic - Having discovered a few of the deepest magical secrets, Warlocks have learned how to render it useless against them.\n Infernal - Warlocks can summon many demonic soldiers to destroy their enemies. The powerful Infernal is just one of these.\n\"...and many more.\"\nThe Druid.\nDruids are the keepers of the world. Locked in slumber for generations, they awoke to meet the threat of the Burning Legion during its recent invasion. After Archimonde's defeat, the Druids chose to remain in the waking world and help to rebuild their shattered lands. The Legion's attack left a terrible scar on the natural order, and the Druids seek to heal it. Here are a few sample spells available to Druids:\n Shapeshifting - Druids can assume a variety of animal forms to aid them in both travel and combat. The Night Saber panther and Storm Crow are just two of the shapes Druids will be able to assume.\n Rejuvenation - In keeping with the Druids' philosophy to restore and regenerate the world, they have the ability to rejuvenate their allies. This ability restores health over time to any wounded being.\n Faerie Fire - Druids can envelop their enemies with a supernatural glow, making them easier to see and attack.\n Mark of the Wild - Druids have the ability to aid themselves and others using Mark of the Wild. Initially this spell will enhance a few basic character attributes. Eventually Mark of the Wild will be one of the best character enhancements available buffing all attributes.\n\"...and many more.\"\nThe Warrior.\nWarriors are the melee-centered class. These characters are tough as nails and masters of weaponry and tactics. The special abilities of the warrior are naturally combat-oriented. Here are a few sample skills available to Warriors:\n Shield Bash - A skill that allows the Warrior to strike enemies with a shield, stunning them for a short period of time.\n Defensive Stance - A technique for warding off enemy attacks. When used, this skill increases the character's armor rating for a little while.\n Whirlwind - An attack spell that sends the caster into a berserk fury, creating a destructive force that damages nearby enemies within a small area of effect.\n\"...and many more.\"\nThe Mage.\nThe Mages of Warcraft once centered their powers within the mageocracy of Dalaran. After that kingdom's destruction by the Burning Legion, however, the arcane arts spread to the far corners of the world. Here are a few sample spells available to Mages:\n Invisibility - Whether a mage needs to infiltrate an enemy camp or quickly avoid a bad situation, they can make themselves undetectable using the Invisibility spell.\n Frost Armor - An enchantment the caster uses to increase armor protection for a time.\n Fireball - An offensive spell that hurls a fiery magic missile at a single target.\n\"...and many more.\"\nThe Shaman.\nShamans are the spiritual leaders of their tribes and clans. They communicate with spirits, have visions of the future, and guide their people through the darkest of times. Many mistake their wisdom and serenity for a pacifist nature. When challenged, though, shamans have a range of powers available for dealing with threats to the natural order. Here are a few sample spells available to Shamans:\n Lightning Bolt - A spell that channels the energies of nature into a fearsome electrical charge that strikes a single enemy.\n Lightning Shield - The reverse of the offensive bolt, generating an electrical barrier around a friendly character - damaging any that dare to attack.\n Restoration - Questing in World of Warcraft is bound to be dangerous, and player characters won't always be on the right side of a sharpened edge. The shaman can prove a valuable ally during these times by calling on the aid of friendly spirits to heal wounds with the Restoration spell.\n\"...and many more.\"\nNotes.\nClasses:\nRaces:\nSpells:\nReferences.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20031124092319/http%3A//www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/classes.shtml\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "522664", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=522664", "title": "The World of Warcraft Townhall/Dungeons", "text": "This article is a copy of \"The World of Warcraft Dungeons\", an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It presented the dungeons to be implemented in the game. The original article did not survive the overhaul of the \"World of Warcraft Official Website\", but can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nDungeons.\nPlayers will come across two types of dungeons while playing World of Warcraft: micro dungeons and world dungeons. There are more than a hundred micro dungeons throughout the world of Azeroth, ranging in relative size from small to quite big. Micro-dungeon locations will include tombs, haunted mines, ice caves, and sunken ships to name a few. The transition into and out of these dungeons will be seamless, and you'll be able to run into other players anywhere along the way.\nWorld dungeons, such as Medivh's Tower, the Westfall Deadmines, and the Scarlet Monastery, are grander in scale than micro dungeons and are specifically designed for more epic encounters. All these locations have common areas where players can meet up and fight together. But, deeper in the dungeons are areas set up specifically for more private group (or sometimes guild) adventures. These areas, called \"instanced zones,\" allow you and a group of friends to have a more personal experience, exploring, adventuring, or completing quests in your own private dungeon. You also have the ability to invite others into your instanced zone to join you. This relieves many of the camping, kill-stealing, and farming issues that MMORPGs sometimes face. The monsters in instanced zones are typically more powerful, so groups of players will have to work together to defeat them, but with greater dangers come greater rewards!\nThe Deadmines.\nWorld Dungeon - Westfall\nAllegedly, the Deadmines are a network of tunnels and caverns that have been taken over by the Defias Brotherhood and transformed into a complex base of operations. No one knows if the underground complex really even exists, and if it does, specifically what is contained there, but rumor has it that the way into the Deadmines lies through Moonbrook.\nReferences.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20040405005902/http%3A//www.blizzard.com%3A80/wow/townhall/dungeons.shtml\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;.

The original article did not survive the overhaul of the World of Warcraft Official Website, but can still be viewed through online archives (see &lt;a href=\"%23References\"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;).\nGeneral.\nWorld of Warcraft is a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG). In World of Warcraft, thousands of players will have the opportunity to adventure together in an enormous, persistent game world, forming friendships, slaying monsters, and engaging in epic quests that can span days or weeks.\nMMORPG stands for massively multiplayer online role-playing game. In an MMORPG, thousands of players exist in the same game world at the same time. This creates an incredibly rich and active environment in which interesting things are constantly taking place. MMORPGs provide thousands of hours of game play, with a nearly infinite variety of goals to achieve across a vast world covering miles of land and sea. For World of Warcraft, we will also be adding new content on a regular basis, thus ensuring that there will always be new adventures, new locations, new creatures, and new items to discover.\nWe have not yet announced a release date for World of Warcraft. MMORPGs are vast and complex; we want to make sure that we take the time necessary to develop a game that will meet the high standards that our developers and fans have come to expect from Blizzard games.\nWorld of Warcraft will differ from other MMORPGs in many ways. One of our main goals is to ensure that players can enjoy World of Warcraft without having to invest huge amounts of playtime. Players will be able to complete quests and experience the world at their own pace-whether it be a few hours here and there, or week-long adventuring marathons. Additionally, our quest system will provide an enormous variety of captivating quests with story elements, dynamic events, and flexible reward systems. World of Warcraft will also feature a faster style of play, with less downtime and an emphasis on combat and tactics against multiple opponents. We also plan to incorporate several unique features, which we'll disclose throughout the course of development.\nYes; however, we are still investigating our business model and have not yet determined what the fee will be.\nWorld of Warcraft will require a fee to play. This fee will be used to support the costs associated with the high-quality levels of service, support, and ongoing content creation that we are planning for World of Warcraft.\nYes, we plan to support a range of payment methods. However, we are still working out our business model, so the specifics on which payment methods will be available have not been finalized.\nGamers will be able to purchase World of Warcraft at retail outlets, online sites, or directly from Blizzard Entertainment. However, in order to play you will need to sign up for a monthly account.\nThe development team is currently doing everything it can to eliminate the possibility of cheating. Also, because the game requires gamers to have a personal account to play, we will be able to identify and track cheaters much more closely. World of Warcraft has many features specifically designed to detect, identify and prevent cheating and hacking in the game. Additional resources - particularly the implementation of a live team of Gamemasters to monitor play - will provide security far beyond what we can currently offer for Battle.net\u00ae. As always, we will constantly look for ways to make the experience of our customers better and more secure, and as we continue to find new methods of doing so, we will certainly pursue and implement them.\nFeatures.\nYes. The Blizzard Film Department will create cinematic sequences for World of Warcraft. We do not anticipate, however, that the game will have as many as our previous games due to the nature of Massively Multiplayer Role Playing Games. You can see the first cinematic for World of Warcraft on the movies page.\nThe cities in World of Warcraft are large, sprawling areas, each with their own distinctive architecture and style. Cities are where players go to train in their professions, shop for rare goods at local vendors, develop their trade skills, obtain new and exciting quests, buy and sell goods with other players, construct and maintain their personal dwellings, and sometimes, even participate in unique city adventures.\nYes. We fully intend to support a full-featured community. Specific details regarding clans and guilds will be released in the months ahead.\nHow do guilds work?\nPlayers can band together to form guilds, which are large social groups, in order to help each other progress in the game. Players get to choose an emblem and color combination unique to their guild, embroidered on special guild tabards that players can display proudly over their characters' armor.\nWorld of Warcraft will include a full-featured Friends interface with a number of different features for managing your interaction with the online community.\nWe would like to include player housing, but it is too early to determine whether doing so would be plausible.\nYes, there will be a bank with ample storage space to hold multiple player items. This option will allow players to store as many items as they need without requiring them to create additional characters to store surplus items.\nNo. Hardcore Mode is a feature in the Diablo universe.\nWorld.\nWorld of Warcraft takes place four years following the aftermath of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, when a great tension has settled over the ravaged world of Azeroth.\nCurrently, players will be able to explore the lands of Azeroth, Khaz Modan, Lordaeron, and the newly discovered lands of Kalimdor. Players familiar with the Warcraft series will find that we have depicted nearly every location from the Warcraft universe in World of Warcraft.\nWorld of Warcraft will be vastly larger than any other universe found in previous Blizzard games. In World of Warcraft, players can expect to journey through the familiar lands of Azeroth, Khaz Modan, and Lordaeron, to name a few. The game will also feature several uncharted and exotic new lands. We are expanding the Warcraft universe because we believe that a critical part of the MMORPG experience is the ability to journey through robust new lands. Our goal is to create a vast new world filled with adventure and excitement, while keeping the game fully populated to support a strong sense of community.\nWorld of Warcraft will be set in lands both familiar and new to long-time players of the series. It is difficult to discuss the World of Warcraft story without giving away the plot for Warcraft III. We can say that Azeroth will experience significant changes and be a very different world than Warcraft fans know today. And, while there will be plenty of recognizable characters and places to explore, we think that the balance between discovering what is known and what is different is something that players will really enjoy.\nIn regard to the inclusion of the Undead or Burning Legion, you will just have to wait and see...\nWorld of Warcraft will not feature \"zones\" in the traditional sense denoting loading screens between each area of gameplay. Our plan is to incorporate different regions of the world for players to explore, each with their own distinct look and theme. Questing through the majority of these regions will be seamless, however, certain regions may require a short load time.\nMost definitely. Players will explore the ruins of old battles, interact with legendary heroes, and visit many of the locations that have made the Warcraft series so memorable.\nYes.\nYes. The game will feature a wide range of content suitable for all levels and types of players, allowing both casual and hardcore gamers to enjoy their gameplay experience.\nPlayers will come across two types of dungeons while playing the game: micro dungeons and world dungeons. There are more than a hundred micro dungeons throughout the world of Azeroth, ranging in relative size from small to quite big. Micro-dungeon locations will include tombs, haunted mines, ice caves, and sunken ships to name a few. The transition into and out of these dungeons will be seamless, and you'll be able to run into other players anywhere along the way.\nWorld dungeons, which are grander in scale than micro dungeons, are specifically designed for more epic encounters. World dungeons include places such as Medivh's Tower, the Westfall Deadmines, and the Scarlet Monastery. All these locations have common areas where players can meet up and fight together. But, deeper in the dungeons are areas set up specifically for more private group (or sometimes guild) adventures. These private dungeon areas, called \"instance zones,\" allow you and a group of friends to have a more personal experience, exploring, adventuring, or completing quests in your own private dungeon. You also have the ability to invite others into your instance zone to join you. This relieves many of the camping, kill-stealing, and farming issues that MMORPGs sometimes face. The monsters in instance zones are typically more powerful, so groups of players will have to work together to defeat them, but with greater dangers come greater rewards! \nRaces.\nThe game currently features:\nWorld of Warcraft is an enormous universe filled with many different races. All of those named above can be seen in the game as NPCs, but at this time, we can't announce any plans for future player races. The ones that we've announced so far--Humans, Orcs, Dwarves, Tauren, Night Elves, Undead, Gnomes, and Trolls--are the races that will be available for players to choose from when the game launches.\nLed by the banshee-queen Sylvanas, the Forsaken are an Undead faction that split violently with the Scourge during the Third War. Knowing that no Human agency would ever give them shelter or aid against the Scourge, now their hated enemy, they turned to the savage Horde, based across the sea in the distant land of Kalimdor, for assistance. To convince the Horde to allow the Forsaken into their alliance, the Undead ambassadors claimed that they merely sought a cure for their degenerative condition, which they believed that only the powers of shamanism and the life-giving energies of the earth could provide. In exchange for the shamans' healing aid, the Forsaken vowed to support the Horde in all of its ventures throughout Lordaeron and Azeroth.\nHaving done battle with the Undead on many occasions, Orc warchief Thrall and Tauren chieftain Cairne Bloodhoof of the Horde were immediately suspicious of the Forsaken's motives. However, due to growing political tensions, the warriors acquiesced to a council of sages known as The Earthen Ring. The council argued that it was the Horde's duty to aid the Forsaken, who wrestled with inner demons just as the Orcs had for generations.\nThough Thrall and Cairne secretly suspect the worst, it remains to be seen what Sylvanas and her fanatical Forsaken have planned...\nThe eccentric, often-brilliant Gnomes, known throughout the world for their obsession with developing radical new technologies and constructing mind-bending marvels of engineering, served the alliance well during the Second War. However, during the recent invasion of the Burning Legion, the Gnomes refused to send any personnel to aid their allies. Though Gnomish designs helped turn the tide against the Legion, the Dwarves and Humans were shocked by the Gnomes' decision to withhold their courageous troops and pilots.\nWhen the war ended, the Alliance discovered the reason behind the Gnomes' sudden withdrawal: an ancient, barbaric menace had emerged from the bowels of the earth and invaded the Gnomes' wondrous techno-city of Gnomeregan. Knowing that their allies' priority was defeating the Burning Legion, the Gnomes decided to make their stand alone. They fought valiantly, but Gnomeregan was lost, and nearly half of the Gnomish race was wiped out.\nThose Gnomes who survived fled to the safety of the Dwarven stronghold Ironforge, where they recommitted themselves to the Alliance's cause and also to devising strategies and weapons that would help them retake their ravaged city and build a brighter future for their people.\nThe Tauren are a mighty race of nomadic tribesmen who live on the dusty plains of a faraway land. These noble, bull-like hunters have lived in harmony for countless generations and are threatened only by the periodic raids of marauding centaur herds.\nYes. Even Tauren!\nYes. Each race in the game will have access to racial skills, abilities and equipment.\nYes. Each race will have a unique start location. \nReferences.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20040201225212/http%3A//www.blizzard.com%3A80/wow/faq/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

April 2004:\nHumans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; are a resilient breed, having survived an invasion by the savage &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the armies of Stormwind rallied with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. After the success of the Second War, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt and Human civilization began to flourish once again throughout the southlands. With the recent invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; - which left the northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in ruins - Stormwind now stands as the last bastion of human civilization. Following the heroic examples of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Sir Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Llane&lt;/a&gt;, the defenders of Stormwind are considered to be among the fiercest warriors in the land. They stand resolute in their charge to maintain the honor and might of humanity in an ever-darkening world.\nAvailable Classes: &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;\nStart Location: &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt;\nHome City: &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;\nNight Elves.\nThe reclusive &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt; were the first race to awaken in the World of Warcraft. These shadowy, immortal beings were the first to study &lt;a href=\"Arcane\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and let it loose throughout the world nearly ten thousand years before . The Night Elves' reckless use of magic drew the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; into the world and led to a catastrophic war between the two titanic races. The Night Elves barely managed to banish the Legion from the world, but their wondrous &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;shattered&lt;/a&gt; and drowned by the sea. Until recently, the Night Elves closed themselves off from the rest of the world and remained hidden atop their holy mountain of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; for many thousands of years. The Legion's invasion brought the Night Elves out of their &lt;a href=\"Long%20Vigil\"&gt;long period&lt;/a&gt; of slumber. They now have renewed interest in shaping the world, and for the first time are allying themselves with other races to insure the continued survival of Azeroth. As a race, Night Elves are typically honorable and just, but they are very distrusting of the 'lesser races' of the world. They are nocturnal by nature and their shadowy powers often elicit the same distrust that they have for their &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt; neighbors.\nAvailable Classes: &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; \nStart Location: &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;\nHome City: &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;\nDwarves.\nThe stoic &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; are an ancient race of robust humanoids who live beneath the snow-capped mountains of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. The Dwarves have always been fast allies with the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s, and they revel in the prospects of battle and storytelling alike. In past ages, the Dwarves rarely left the safety of their mountain fortresses. However, whenever the call to battle sounded, they rose up to defend their friends and allies with unmatched courage and valor. Due to a recent discovery that uncovered fragments of their &lt;a href=\"Earthen\"&gt;ancient origins&lt;/a&gt;, the Dwarves have undergone a remarkable transformation. The discovery convinced the Dwarves that the mighty &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s created them from stone when the world was young. They feel that their destiny is now to search the world over for more signs and proof of their enchanted heritage and to rediscover the Titans' hidden legacies. To this end, the Dwarves have sent out their &lt;a href=\"Prospector\"&gt;Prospector&lt;/a&gt;s to all ends of the world in the hopes of discovering new insight into their shrouded past. These journeys led to Dwarven excavation sites all over the known world, some of which serve as outposts and some of which serve as potential hunting grounds for enemies of the Dwarven race. \nAvailable Classes: &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; \nStart Location: &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar\"&gt;Anvil Marr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;\nHome City: &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;\n Mage was shown on the official website as an option but was later removed.\nGnomes.\nThe eccentric, often-brilliant &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s are one of the most peculiar races of the world. With their obsession for developing radical new technologies and constructing marvels of mind-bending &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, it's a wonder that any Gnomes have survived to proliferate.\nThriving within the wondrous techno-city of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, the Gnomes shared the resources of the forested &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; Peaks with their Dwarven cousins. Though the dwarves of Ironforge also have a propensity for technology and engineering - it is the gnomes who provide the critical, visionary designs for most of the Dwarves' weapons and &lt;a href=\"Steam%20tank\"&gt;steam vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Gnomes served the Alliance well during the Second War, but strangely, they refused to send any personnel to aid their allies during the Burning Legion's recent invasion. Though their designs helped turn the tide against the Legion, the Dwarves and Humans were shocked by the Gnomes' decision to withhold their courageous troops and pilots.\nWhen the war ended, the Alliance discovered the reason for the Gnomes' sudden withdrawal. Apparently, an ancient, barbaric &lt;a href=\"Trogg\"&gt;menace&lt;/a&gt; had risen from the bowels of the earth and invaded Gnomeregan. Knowing that their allies' priority was defeating the Burning Legion, the Gnomes decided to make their stand alone. Though they fought valiantly to save their beloved city, Gnomeregan was irrevocably lost.\nNearly half of the Gnomish race was wiped out during the fall of Gnomeregan. The ragged Gnomes that survived fled to the safety of the Dwarves' stronghold of Ironforge. Committed once again to the Alliance's cause, the Gnomes spend their time devising strategies and weapons that will help them retake their ravaged city and build a brighter future for their people.\nAvailable Classes: &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; \nStart Location: &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar\"&gt;Anvil Marr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;\nHome City: &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060621174758/http%3A//www.blizzard.com/wow/insider/metzen-interview.shtml\"&gt;Gnomes and Trolls interview&lt;/a&gt;\nOrcs.\nThe savage, green-skinned &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s are one of the most prolific races of Azeroth. They are commonly believed to be brutal and mindless, possessing no humanity or empathy for other races. Born on the hellish world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Orcs were brought into the kingdom of Stormwind through the dimensional gateway known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and forced to wage &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; on the Humans. Although few are aware of their history, the Orcs once cultivated a noble, &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; society on the world of Draenor. Tragically, the proud Orc &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orc%20clans\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; were corrupted by the Burning Legion and used as pawns in the Legion's invasion of Azeroth. The Orcs managed to rebel, however, and they were ultimately able to help turn the tide against their demon masters. Led by the young &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the Orcs have reclaimed their strength and honor. Now, the Orcs stand ready to fight not for the sake of conquest, but for their right to survive in their adopted world. \nAvailable Classes: &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; \nStart Location: &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;\nHome City: &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;\nTauren.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; are huge, bestial creatures who live in the grassy, open &lt;a href=\"barrens\"&gt;barrens&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"central%20Kalimdor\"&gt;central Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They live to serve nature and maintain the balance between the wild things of the land and the restless spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their enormous size and brute strength, the remarkably peaceful Tauren cultivate a quiet, &lt;a href=\"Tribe%23Tauren%20tribes\"&gt;tribal&lt;/a&gt; society. However, when roused by conflict, Tauren are implacable enemies who will use every ounce of their strength to smash their enemies under hoof. Under the leadership of their ancient chief, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, the Tauren allied themselves with the Orcs during the invasion of the Burning Legion. The two races have remained steadfast allies ever since. Like the Orcs, the Tauren struggle to retain their sense of tradition and noble identity. \nAvailable Classes: &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; \nStart Location: &lt;a href=\"Redrock%20Mesa%20%28Mulgore%29\"&gt;Redrock Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;\nHome City: &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;\nUndead.\nHaving broken free from the tyrannical rule of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, a renegade group of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; seek to retain their own free will while destroying all those who oppose them. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, this group is dedicated to serving their leader, the banshee queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. These dark warriors have established a secret stronghold beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s former capital city. Situated deep beneath the cursed &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, the labyrinthine &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; is a sprawling bastion of evil. Within its shadowy confines, Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;royal apothecaries&lt;/a&gt; scramble to develop a devastating &lt;a href=\"new%20plague\"&gt;new plague&lt;/a&gt; - one which will not only eradicate their hated &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; rivals, but the rest of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity as well. To further their dark aims, the Forsaken have entered into an alliance of convenience with the primitive, brutish races of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Holding no real loyalty for their newfound comrades, the Forsaken have duped them into fighting against their common enemy - the Lich King. Only time will tell how these disciples of doom will fare in their mission of vengeance.\nAvailable Classes: &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; \nStart Location: &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;\nHome City: &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;The Undercity&lt;/a&gt;\nTrolls.\nThe vicious &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;Jungle Troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who populate the numerous &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas%23Major%20islands\"&gt;islands&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, are renowned for their cruelty and dark mysticism. Barbarous and superstitious, the wily &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s carry a seething hatred for all other races.\nOne &lt;a href=\"Tribe%23Jungle%20troll%20tribes\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;, however, was forced to overcome its prejudices when it encountered the Orc Warchief, Thrall, and his mighty Horde. The Trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, long since exiled from their &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;ancestral lands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, were nearly destroyed by a band of aquatic &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, but Thrall and the Horde managed to save them. In return the grateful Trolls swore an oath of eternal allegiance to the Horde.\nLed by the cunning &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20hunter\"&gt;Shadow Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear Trolls now make their home in Durotar along with their Orcish allies. Their &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;, named after their fallen tribal elder, &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;, lies along the eastern coast of the harsh, rocky land. The Darkspear tribe also occupies tracks within the nearby jungles of the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs part of the Horde, the Trolls have extended their loyalty to the mighty Tauren, but they have little trust for the manipulative Forsaken, whom they believe will visit only misery and strife upon their allies.\nAvailable Classes: &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;\nStart Location: &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;\nHome City: &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20060621174758/http%3A//www.blizzard.com/wow/insider/metzen-interview.shtml\"&gt;Trolls and Gnomes interview&lt;/a&gt;\nReferences.\nThese pages can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20031124092215/http%3A//www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;.

Each of the major cities represents the &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; and a major hub for the &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s that inhabit them.

More than just a collection of &lt;a href=\"building\"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt;s with &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s standing around, the cities will serve as a place for adventuring, shopping, &lt;a href=\"train\"&gt;train&lt;/a&gt;ing, socializing, and much more.\nWe will be revealing more information about the nuances of cities and the purposes they serve in the future. Check the news for updates.\nCity Highlights:\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nCity Residents: Humans\nThe city of Stormwind stands as the last bastion of &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt; power in Azeroth. Rebuilt after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind is a marvel of Human design and &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind's guards&lt;/a&gt; keep the peace within the city's walls, while the young &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, rules from his mighty &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bazaar%20District\"&gt;Bazaar District&lt;/a&gt; bustles with trade from across the continent and beyond, while &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s of every sort can be found wandering the streets of &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt;. Unaffected by the ravages of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the north, Stormwind still faces its own threats, both from without and from within.\n&lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nCity Residents: Dwarves, Gnomes\nWhile many &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; strongholds fell during the Second War, the mighty city of Ironforge--nestled in the wintry peaks of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;--was never breached by the invading &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. A marvel to the Dwarves' expertise of shaping rock and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt;, Ironforge was constructed in the heart of the mountain itself: an expansive underground city of craftsmen, &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;explorers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"miner\"&gt;miner&lt;/a&gt;s and Warriors. Although the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has been weakened by recent events, the Dwarves of Ironforge, led by King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, are forging a new future in the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCity Residents: Night Elves\nHigh atop the boughs of the great tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; lies the wondrous city of Darnassus, the new refuge of the reclusive &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and Warriors alike make their homes among the rows of woodcrafted lodges and delicately tended groves. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; rises like a shining beacon above the trees, flanked by the colonnaded &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Hall of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, where the vigilant &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; gather to safeguard the land. Ruled by the &lt;a href=\"High%20priest\"&gt;high Priestess&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, Darnassus stands as a tranquil testament to all that the Night Elves hold sacred. A city in tune with the rush and flow of nature, Darnassus was built along the shores of a large lake, with elegant bridges spanning its crystalline waters. Elsewhere, the falling leaves of the forest carpet the soft pathways of the city.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nCity Residents: Orcs, Trolls\nNamed in honor of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrimmar was founded to be the capital city of the &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s' new homeland. Built within a huge, winding canyon in the harsh land of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrimmar stands as one of the mightiest Warrior cities in the world. Behind Orgrimmar's immense walls, elderly &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s patiently share their knowledge with the Horde's newest generation of leaders, while Warriors spar in the &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;ial arena, honing their skills in preparation for the trials that await them in this dangerous land.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;.\nCity Residents: Tauren\nThe great city of Thunder Bluff lies atop a series of mesas that overlook the verdant grasslands of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. The once nomadic Tauren recently established the city as a center for trade caravans, traveling craftsmen and artisans of every kind. The proud city also stands as a refuge for the brave Hunters who stalk their dangerous prey through the plains of Mulgore and its surrounding areas. Long bridges of rope and wood span the chasms between the mesas, topped with tents, longhouses, colorfully painted &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20totem\"&gt;totems&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"spirit%20lodge\"&gt;spirit lodge&lt;/a&gt;s. The mighty chief, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, watches over the bustling city, ensuring that the united Tauren tribes live in peace and security.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nCity Residents: Undead\nFar beneath the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;ruined capital city of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the royal &lt;a href=\"crypt\"&gt;crypt&lt;/a&gt;s have been turned into a bastion of evil and &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Originally intended by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; to be the Scourge's seat of power, the budding \"Undercity\" was abandoned when Arthas was recalled to aid the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in distant &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. In Arthas's absence, the Dark Lady, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, led the rebel &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to the Undercity, and claimed it for her own. Since taking up residence, the Forsaken have worked to complete the Undercity's construction by dredging the twisted maze of catacombs, tombs, and dungeons that Arthas began.\nFeatured Locations.\n&lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nOff &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s northern coast lies the island of Teldrassil, the new home of the reclusive Night Elves and a stunning testament to the power of their magic and their connection with nature. After the cataclysmic events that followed the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and powerful druids combined their powers to grow an immense new world tree on Teldrassil. They called the tree Teldrassil, meaning \"crown of the earth\" in their native tongue. The night elves made their new home in the boughs of Teldrassil, creating a forest of mighty trees and flowing rivers, bathed in the endless night that fell over the lands of the elves from the dawn of time. However, the calm of the enchanted forest has slowly fallen into the shadow of a sinister presence. Crazed &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and fouler beasts have appeared in Teldrassil, and it occupies all the attention of the vigilant Sentinels and the wise druids to ensure the safety of their new home.\nA sprawling city of &lt;a href=\"moonstone\"&gt;moonstone&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lumber\"&gt;wood&lt;/a&gt;, the night elf capital of Darnassus stands as a shining beacon atop Teldrassil. Within its mighty walls are housed countless druids, hunters, and warriors, led by the priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande Whisperwind. A stunning marvel to the ability of night elven craftsmen, the ethereal Temple of the Moon rises above the tree line, balanced by the druids' meticulously cultivated meditative grove. Trade from the main continent bustles through the city's trade quarter, where night elves, dwarves and humans alike haggle for wares and services. Delicate bridges and pathways crisscross the serene waterways of the city, the pristine waters reflecting the glowing light from the moons above.\n&lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20030801075544/http%3A//www.blizzard.com/wow/townhall/kalidar.shtml\"&gt;Originally&lt;/a&gt;, this location was named &lt;a href=\"Kalidar\"&gt;Kalidar&lt;/a&gt; and had almost the same text, with only the word Kalidar in place of the word Teldrassil in the text shown above, excluding one place where the word Teldrassil was also used.\n&lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe jagged, snowy peaks of Dun Morogh provide the Ironforge Dwarves with a limitless supply of &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; and stone for their ambitious engineering endeavors. From the city of Ironforge, dug deep into the mountains, to &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar\"&gt;Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Coldridge%20Valley\"&gt;Coldridge Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the marvels of Dwarven ingenuity mark the land. Not all is at peace in Dun Morogh, however. The Dwarves' insatiable digging at the &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Bolar%20Quarry\"&gt;Gol'Bolar Quarry&lt;/a&gt; unleashed a menacing tribe of &lt;a href=\"Rockjaw%20tribe\"&gt;Rockjaw Troggs&lt;/a&gt; from their subterranean den. While the massing &lt;a href=\"Trogg\"&gt;Trogg&lt;/a&gt; invasion looms over the lands of King Magni Bronzebeard, the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane Trolls&lt;/a&gt; have taken advantage of the distraction to attempt to reclaim their ancestral home. Life is harsh in the white-powdered mountains of Dun Morogh, but what the Dwarven people lack in height they make up for in heart and valor.\n&lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nElwynn Forest is a vast woodland that cradles the Human civilization of Azeroth. Though much of the area was burned or destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; - when the Orcs laid siege to Stormwind - the giant trees and lush glades have grown anew. Heavily patrolled by the mighty &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Garrison\"&gt;Stormwind Garrison&lt;/a&gt;, Elwynn has remained a peaceful land since the war's end. Several &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt; stretch across the fertile fields, and the Garrison &lt;a href=\"Guard%20tower\"&gt;Guard Towers&lt;/a&gt; stand vigilant every few miles, helping to keep the forest safe from the rampaging forces of the Horde. The tranquil forest is also inhabited by wild &lt;a href=\"Boar\"&gt;Boar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Wolf\"&gt;Wolves&lt;/a&gt; that hunt throughout the woodlands in hope of finding easy prey. Scraggly &lt;a href=\"Gnoll\"&gt;Gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and grimy &lt;a href=\"Kobold\"&gt;Kobold&lt;/a&gt;s wander the forest's outlying regions, but seldom do these timorous creatures attack property in Elwynn or Stormwind directly. For the most part, Elwynn exudes a feeling of comfort and serenity. However, if travelers wander too far off the main roads they may still encounter hidden dangers lurking within the shadows.\n&lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the lush southern belt of Elwynn Forest, the land of Duskwood has transformed into a dark and mysterious land. Many speculate that its proximity to the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; brings monstrous horrors out at night. Others wonder if an ancient curse has been cast upon the land. No matter the reason, Duskwood has become a land of terror and superstition. The Human farmers who once toiled over the rich land have become dark and brooding - unwilling to leave their ancestral home but unable to lift the terrible cloud that has settled over their lives. Bordered by the fallow fields of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; to the west and the dark, treacherous Deadwind Pass to the east, Duskwood has become a tainted realm where shadows and evil permeate the atmosphere even during the brightest hours of day. \n&lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce the breadbasket of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the land of Westfall has now grown fallow from years of conflict and neglect. Crops are no longer cultivated in the fields, and the once abundant mines have been deserted. Even the former defenders, the Stormwind Garrisons, pulled stake and abandoned the lonely realm when the cost of upkeep became too great. Due to this lack of military protection, Westfall has been all but destroyed by the rebel &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"demi-human\"&gt;demi-human&lt;/a&gt; minions. The Brotherhood, composed of &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s, have made Westfall their refuge. Employing everything from local superstitions to &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Harvest%20golem\"&gt;Harvest Golems&lt;/a&gt;, the Brotherhood will stop at nothing to scare away trespassers and protect their malicious schemes from being unraveled.\n&lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;.\nStranglethorn is a vast jungle south of Duskwood. Once the extended homeland of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;Jungle Trolls&lt;/a&gt;, Stranglethorn is now dotted with ancient ruins and crumbling Troll cities. In recent years, the Humans of Stormwind attempted to forge trade routes through this savage jungle. Though they did manage to establish the small port town of &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Cove\"&gt;Blackwater Cove&lt;/a&gt;, they were quickly overwhelmed by a crazed pack of Trolls and driven back to their homeland. In the wake of the Humans' departure, the crafty &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Trade%20prince\"&gt;Trade Princes&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the jungle's shores and quickly set up their mining and deforesting operations. The Goblins have maintained a tenuous hold over these remote facilities, but they remain threatened by the Jungle Trolls' growing obsession with purging their ancient lands of any and all foreign invaders.\nReferences.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//web.archive.org/web/20040405004141/http%3A//www.blizzard.com%3A80/wow/townhall/worldmap.shtml\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;.

While I have delved into many aspects of their &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;-worship in previous volumes of this study, I put forth here an examination of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s' interesting and unique relationship with the sea.\nThe Gurubashi Empire was surrounded on three sides by the sea, so it comes as little surprise that water would figure prominently as an aspect of their society. While the trolls were able to roam and control the large areas of their jungle empire, the sea eluded them. It was vast and immeasurable, no doubt a disconcerting neighbor for the powerful trolls. It should be noted here that recent discoveries seem to suggest that the trolls had little interest in exploring the lands beyond the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. While the troll species have been encountered along the length and breadth of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, little evidence of their civilization has been found in the newly discovered lands of Kalimdor or upon the islands in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. Whether this demonstrates an unwillingness of the trolls to venture away from their terrestrial holdings or a failure on their part to develop the technologies needed to make such a journey will take further research and analysis that is out of the scope of my writings here. But one can hardly ignore so large a presence, and new findings in the extensive troll ruins of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; show and aspect of their relationship with the sea previously unknown and undocumented.\nRecent discoveries during surveys of the troll ruins of Stranglethorn Vale have shown references to an object known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;\". Various fragments of the troll legends can be pieced together to paint a rather complete picture of the Stone and its importance to the ancient Gurubashi Empire. It appears that the Stone of the Tides allowed its bearer to control &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; in its many forms, rivers, rain, and the tides. Because of the stories related to use of the Stone of the Tides. I have conjectured that it is actually a physical manifestation of the powers of &lt;a href=\"Neptulon%20the%20Tidehunter\"&gt;the Waterlord&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful elemental of the seas. How and why such an object would leave the Waterlord's control and fall into the hands of the trolls is another question that is beyond the scope of my knowledge.\nLike the movements of the eponymous tides, the Stone of the Tides entered the world of the trolls and departed, never constantly staying in the trolls' hands for longer than a generation at a time. In troll legends, it is said that the first time the Stone of the Tides came to the Gurubashi Empire, it was found by a troll &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; wandering along the coast of Stranglethorn. He came upon a mysterious blue stone within which milky white strands floated and flowed. Intrigued by the stone, the warrior took it with him and continued upon his journey. Over the weeks and months, the warrior discovered that the stone had given him control over water. He could summon forth water &lt;a href=\"elementals\"&gt;elementals&lt;/a&gt;, creatures formed completely of water--duplicating a feat that only powerful &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; are able to perform.\nThe warrior traveled to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, to the heart of the empire, to show his newfound abilities to the Emperor. He easily gained a court audience after demonstrating his powers in the center of the Imperial capital. His powers easily amazed the Gurubashi Emperor, who immediately gave him a place of honor at court, naming the warrior \"&lt;a href=\"Tidebearer\"&gt;Tidebearer&lt;/a&gt;\", leaving his old name behind. For years, the Tidebearer served the Gurubashi Empire, summoning his thrall water elementals in battle and manipulating the flow of water in Stranglethorn Vale for the benefit of the Empire. But as the years went on, the Tidebearer became more reclusive, tending to stay for long periods of time away from court.\nThe Tidebearer was hiding a secret from the prying eyes of court. The abilities granted to him by the Stone of the Tides also came with a curse. As the years passed, the Tidebearer was fading away. With each coming and going of the tides, the Tidebearer became less of himself, losing his corporeal form--pulsing in and out of existence--until in his dying days he traveled to the beach where he had first found the Stone, and walked into the sea, disappearing for the last time. Generations later, the Stone of the Tides washed upon the shores of Stranglethorn, and another Tidebearer was chosen, as the troll brought the Stone to Zul'Gurub. So the process continued for generations, the Stone appearing with the tide, and the Tidebearer leaving into the tide. \nModern day accounts of the Stone of the Tides have appeared from place to place, but one must still wonder why an object of such power would appear with such regularity, and by whose design.

And now, perhaps, I have the opportunity to add one to my extensive collection. Did you have any luck finding the source of the rumor?\nCompletion.\nSo the stories were true! Incredible!\nHowever, we will need to figure out a way to defeat the curse of the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;, if we are to retrieve it. The curse is magical business, we'll need one of those wizards to help us out. \nNotes.\nThe island is fairly easy to spot... on the map, it is the large island north and west of &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Library%20Scrip\"&gt;Library Scrip&lt;/a&gt; can be turned in to &lt;a href=\"Donyal%20Tovald\"&gt;Donyal Tovald&lt;/a&gt; in the Stormwind Library, for either\n&lt;a href=\"Legends%20of%20the%20Gurubashi%2C%20Volume%203\"&gt;Legends of the Gurubashi, Volume 3&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"The%20Story%20of%20Morgan%20Ladimore\"&gt;The Story of Morgan Ladimore&lt;/a&gt;."}

Here, you help a collector get another piece for his collection...\nThe Stone of the Tides.\nIn &lt;a href=\"the%20Salty%20Sailor%20Tavern\"&gt;the Salty Sailor Tavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krazek\"&gt;Krazek&lt;/a&gt; tells you that he picks up rumors for &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt;. And since you're headed out that way anyway, would you tell him about this\nparticular ghost story he's heard? (Krazek really likes his cups; the Baron is on the tavern's boat-porch.)\nThe Baron, it turns out, collects artifacts of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi empire&lt;/a&gt;. And this rumor that Krazek had you pass to him sounds strikingly like it might have to do with the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Stone of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful - but cursed - artifact.\nThe Baron provides you with a token that the Stormwind library should honor, to let you learn\nmore about the Stone. But meanwhile, he wants you to confirm that this haunted island really is there.\nYou travel north, and sure enough, there's an island, pretty much just as described.\nYou report your find, and the Baron is pleased. He recognizes, though, that if he is to hold onto this item, he's got to hire out to someone who would know how to break the curse. But whoever he hires is going to need magical traces from the use of the stone. And since the water elementals were probably summoned by &lt;a href=\"Gazban\"&gt;Gazban&lt;/a&gt;, the previous owner of the Stone, the bracers binding them are the most likely thing to be useful.\nAnother long and tiring journey north, then. You dispel a fair number of the elementals, and collect a few suitable-looking bracers from among the jetsam remaining. All the way back to Booty Bay, then, to bring them to the Baron.\nThe Baron knows who you need to talk to, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Ansirem%20Runeweaver\"&gt;Archmage Ansirem Runeweaver&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, but doesn't have the time to run up to the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; himself. You've proven willing to travel for him before, and you're pretty sure that the Baron will reward you grandly if you put the Stone in his hands. Fortunately, you can take a Gryphon up as far as &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, though Dalaran itself is still a ways past the internment camp.\nYou don't have to search far to find the Archmage, he's near the edge of the ruins surrounding Dalaran. And it seems the Baron chose wisely: while Ansirem was preoccupied, the puzzle surrounding the Stone of the Tides tempts him into taking a look at those bracers you brought.\nThe Archmage is able to discover that the holder of the stone is using some sort of altar to focus the power through. Break the altar, disrupt the power. And with the power disrupted, the curse should be too.\nHe even knows of something that is suitable for doing this disruption, another troll relic. Unfortunately, he gave it to his daughter, who then ran off to play at pirates in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nSo down to Booty Bay again, this time to find &lt;a href=\"Catelyn%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Catelyn&lt;/a&gt;, the Archmage's wild child. Catelyn isn't particularly pleased to see you, either. She recently lost her knife to one of the pirates - &lt;a href=\"%22Pretty%20Boy%22%20Duncan\"&gt;\"Pretty Boy\" Duncan&lt;/a&gt;. She wants her knife back, and she doesn't care what shape Duncan is in when you leave him. In fact, if he's had a fatal case of iron poisoning, she'd be pleased.\nYou smack around enough of the pirates that they let you and Duncan fight it out between you. And you know how that's gotta end. Blood on the sand, none of it yours, and a new trophy. At least for a short while.\nAnd Catelyn is even gracious enough to let you borrow the knife to complete your task of retrieving the stone. How about that? (And hey, the denizens of Booty Bay are happy with you too. The buccaneers aren't high on their invite list...)\nSo now you know where to go, what to do, and you have the right knife for the job. Once more up the coast, then, this time to the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Reef\"&gt;Vile Reef&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s in the area have taken over the ruins with the sunken &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20the%20Tides\"&gt;Altar of the Tides&lt;/a&gt;. A bit of martial discouragement, and you are left alone to disrupt the altar.\nAs expected, the stone's owner, &lt;a href=\"Gazban\"&gt;Gazban&lt;/a&gt;, is none too pleased with you, and puts in an appearance. You're prepared for him, though, and with a bit of effort, part him fatally from the Stone.\nOne last trip to Booty Bay, and you can discharge your obligations to the Baron.\nRewards.\nExperience aside, you are given\nYou also garner 1175 &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; reputation over the course of the chain, plus some additional from the pirate slaughter."}

She refers to the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; as her children and is referred to by &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt; as the \"mother of stone\" and \"the mother of the stoneborn\", as she was the one who created the stoneborn and formed the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion\"&gt;Stone Legion&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxi\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; forces did not come to defend Revendreth from the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; retaliating against the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. She personally banished the dreadlords from Revendreth due to the loss of her children.\nShe remained loyal to Denathrius during &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;'s rebellion, believing that he could not defeat both Denathrius and the Jailer and being unwilling to subject her children to the suffering of an unwinnable fight.\nAfter the defeat of Denathrius and the recovery of &lt;a href=\"The%20Primus\"&gt;The Primus&lt;/a&gt;, the latter sent a note to the Stonewright informing her of the return of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; and imploring her to take a side against the Jailer. Naturally, the Stonewright was wroth, and immediately set about removing the unseen guests from Revendreth and Sinfall. She and the Maw Walker uncovered a much larger nathrezim plot, and exposed &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;. Later, she was beseeched by &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; who was looking for Night Warriors to aid &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nSo you are the one who slew the &lt;a href=\"stoneborn\"&gt;stoneborn&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Darkhaven\"&gt;Darkhaven&lt;/a&gt;.\nI am sure you did what you thought was right. Most people do.\nI am known as the Stonewright. By my hammer and chisel were crafted the first stoneborn, and I see each as my child. They are all brothers and sisters in arms, and now they wage war on each other in this short sighted rebellion.\nThe Master believes you can bring an end to this conflict. Of that I have no doubt. I only hope it is the right end.\nSinfall. This place holds barely a fraction of the power it once held.\nOne more reason to despise the dreadlords and their arrogant actions against the Light.\nI had fully expected Sire Denathrius to order me to smash this place into ruin along with you and the Prince still in it. He never did.\nThe relationship between Denathrius and Renathal is one not easily set aside by mere betrayal or attempted patricide, apparently.\nI am taking &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; into custody and securing &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Keep\"&gt;Dominance Keep&lt;/a&gt; from outsiders. You would do well to avoid that place for a time.\nI will bring my forces to bear on &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt;, but it is still vital we extract as much information from Mal'Ganis as we can, and Renathal's methods are... soft... compared to mine.\nWhen I am done with him, Renathal can have Mal'Ganis back for whatever atonement he believes a dreadlord capable of.

(50 Energy, instant, 5 sec cooldown).\nGymer's Grab: Gymer will grab a Vargul that he can then use as a living weapon! Also used to grab Storm Clouds (see below). (30 yd range, instant, 10 sec cooldown).\nGymer's Throw: Throws the Vargul that Gymer is holding in his hand. Will explode on impact! (Unlimited range, instant).\nOnce you mount Gymer you will be &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phased&lt;/a&gt;, and only see the set mobs (trash mobs and the boss mobs) and other players doing the quest on their Gymer. You should zoom out your camera as far as the video settings will allow. It has been reported that Gymer has an auto attack, but will not use it after his action bar attacks; you must activate it by using the 't' key or right-clicking your target. It may be a similar experience as the &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Titans\"&gt;Will of the Titans&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Frenzyheart%20Tribe\"&gt;Frenzyheart Tribe&lt;/a&gt; quest &lt;a href=\"Kartak%27s%20Rampage\"&gt;Kartak's Rampage&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile on Gymer, you will see small purple sparkly clouds near the ground. These are Storm Clouds. Picking them up with Gymer's Grab ability (button 3) will heal him over time for about 50% of his full health. This is crucial for surviving the later portions of this quest. Remember, you cannot pick up a Storm Cloud if you have a Vargul in your hand. You'll need to throw the Vargul first.\nMost players prefer to kill Algar first. He is to the northeast, near , around one corner of the Voltarus complex. He is fairly straightforward to kill. Make your way south to Navarius. You will likely get your 100 trash Scourge from defending yourself. The trash will instantly respawn, so try to make your way to clear spots with no mobs if you need a breather and grab a Storm Cloud on the way.\nNavarius is the human-sized guy inside the purple bubble, around , just north of the main steps up to the next region of Zul'Drak. Once you kill Navarius (remember to be aware of when he uses &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Deflection\"&gt;Soul Deflection&lt;/a&gt;), Thrym will spawn on the wall above Navarius' spot, then jump down to attack you. Try to save at least one nearby Storm Cloud to grab after he engages you and not before. Be careful: if you run too far in search of a Cloud, you can de-aggro him, and he will despawn. You will have to kill Navarius to spawn him again.\nAfter Thrym is dead you can ride back to &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Forward%20Camp\"&gt;Crusader Forward Camp&lt;/a&gt; for turn in, or ride around and see the sights. Players have reportedly been able to \"duel\" other players, through the use of Gymer's knock back ability."}

The Warchief will be interested to know what happens next.\nNotes.\nOn accept:\nAlts can choose to speak with Nathanos again to skip the scenario: \nPlayers who wish to continue, pick up the potion, &lt;a href=\"Blightcaller%27s%20Easy%20Death\"&gt;Blightcaller's Easy Death&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"Deathguard%20Malcolm\"&gt;Deathguard Malcolm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathguard%20Sansa\"&gt;Deathguard Sansa&lt;/a&gt; join the party. Go near the &lt;a href=\"Bank%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Bank of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; (pre-\"Shadowlands\": the Gates of Orgrimmar) where &lt;a href=\"Lasan%20Skyhorn\"&gt;Lasan Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviash\"&gt;Aviash&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20Eagle\"&gt;Skyhorn Eagle&lt;/a&gt;s await.\nHop on a war eagle to begin the scenario:\nStage 2: Down the Drain.\nIf you move out of the area and attack guards, Thalyssra will teleport you to back to the sewer gate.\nInteract with two &lt;a href=\"Padlock\"&gt;Padlock&lt;/a&gt;s to open the Sewer Access Gate. Rokhan and Thalyssra jump down. Follow them to enter the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 3: The Stockades.\nUpon arriving, Rokhan kills a &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Enforcer\"&gt;7th Legion Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; and Thalyssra blasts a &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion%20Sharpshooter%20%28Stockade%29\"&gt;7th Legion Sharpshooter&lt;/a&gt;. Rokhan goes to pick the cell door lock.\nStart clearing a path alongside Thalyssra. Several &lt;a href=\"Jailed%20Thief\"&gt;Jailed Thieves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Incarcerated%20Troublemaker\"&gt;Incarcerated Troublemaker&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Imprisoned%20Thug\"&gt;Imprisoned Thug&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen. Make it to the center of the dungeon to catch up with Rokhan.\nLooking at a locked Cell Door, Rokhan quickly delegates:\nStage 4: Honor and Loyalty.\nInteract with the Cell Door to unlock it. Then speak with Saurfang:\nStage 5: The Primary Objective.\nRokhan and Thalyssra run to face the remaining guards. Once they are dead, the group moves to the cell containing &lt;a href=\"Zul%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Zul the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt;.\nInteract with the Cell Door to break the lock.\nJoin them in the hall:\nFollow them to the center of the hall:\nStart attacking the battlemages and other guards, clearing to the eastern end of the stockade. In the next intersection, Mage-Commander Lyra teleports in:\nStart attacking:\nOn her death:\nEnter the last room, where a trapdoor provides Stormwind Sewer Access:\nInteract with the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Sewer%20Access\"&gt;Stormwind Sewer Access&lt;/a&gt; to continue.\nStage 6: The City Stirs.\nRokhan used his power and called a &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; to stealth the group, much like a rogue's &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20Concealment\"&gt;Shroud of Concealment&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in the circle, close to him during the duration. Avoid &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Stormwind Guards&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Knight%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Stormwind Knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"D.R.O.N.E.\"&gt;D.R.O.N.E.&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Town%20Crier%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Town Criers&lt;/a&gt;, and even King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; himself!\nIf you leave, Rokhan will summon you.\nNearby &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Citizen\"&gt;Stormwind Citizen&lt;/a&gt;s and a Stormwind Guard also have dialogues\nTalk to Rokhan to begin moving:\nSpeak with Rokhan again:\nStage 7: WAY Behind Enemy Lines.\nThalyssra conjured up a barrier that deflects the attacking &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Mauler%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Gilnean Maulers&lt;/a&gt;. Talanji and Rokhan also attack the worgen. If Talanji is killed, Rezan brings her back to life.\nDefeat the Gilnean Maulers throwing themselves against Thalyrssra's shield. Once the maulers are defeated, the magic barrier is down and the group begins to run, no longer stealthed. Genn and his party will continuously walk toward the group. If he catches up, everyone will die.\nKeep killing interlopers.\nOnward, a town crier drops his torch and Zul picks it up:\nKeep moving.\nApproaching Jaina will also result in a quick death.\nContinue with the group.\nSpeak with Nathanos to continue:\nStage 8: No Diplomatic Solutions.\nThe group heads down to the harbor. Zul burns a banner. They stop by the lion statue as the path is blocked by Jaina's ice walls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Icy%20Barrier\"&gt;Icy Barrier&lt;/a&gt; is attackable, so start breaking it.\nStage 9: The Harbor Run.\nOnce the wall is destroyed, continue with the group to the main section of the Harbor filled with &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Rifleman\"&gt;Dwarven Riflemen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Gyro-Engineer\"&gt;Gnomish Gyro-Engineer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil%20Sentinel%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Teldrassil Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Exodar%20Peacekeeper%20%28BfA%29\"&gt;Exodar Peacekeepers&lt;/a&gt;, Gilnean Maulers, Stormwind Knights, and Stormwind Battlemages.\nContinue following the group, clearing a path to the docks. As the party approaches the pier, Zul holds short:\nContinue to the end of the pier. Jaina and her &lt;a href=\"Mageguard%20Elite\"&gt;Mageguard Elite&lt;/a&gt;s are there.\nFinal Stage: Fate's Cold Logic.\n\"Jaina roots the group with a Frost Nova and starts walking towards it.\"\nSpeak with Talanji to continue:\nAn ending &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth%20in-game%20cinematics\"&gt;cinematic&lt;/a&gt; plays:\nFinale.\nOn the other side of the cutscene, the party arrives at the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. Talk to Nathanos to finish the quest.\nTalanji offers the followup, &lt;a href=\"Welcome%20to%20Zuldazar\"&gt;Welcome to Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;."}

Fighting has erupted in the strategic battlegrounds of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt;, and more recently in &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Even as these old enemies have renewed their quarrels, many ancient threats have resurfaced to menace the beleaguered races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As if spurred by unseen forces, dark agents have labored to push the world closer to the brink of oblivion.\"\n\"Within &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the legacy of the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; continued to unfold as &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; followed in his father's contemptible footsteps. With the aid of his sister &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; and the orchestrations of their human personas, Nefarian worked toward replenishing the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, he created &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragon\"&gt;chromatic dragon&lt;/a&gt;s: unspeakable hybrids of both &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\n\"Meanwhile, the priests of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; enacted primitive rituals on behalf of their fiendish blood god. First, priests at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in calling forth &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;the god's avatar&lt;/a&gt;. Then, within the crumbling ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, priests summoned the bloodthirsty, diabolical Soulflayer physically into Azeroth.\"\n\"Nor was the spread of evil limited to the physical realm alone. Several green dragons, once &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s trusted lieutenants, have been corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, emerging from dream portals across the world to threaten the very lives they once protected.\"\nThroughout Silithus, insect swarms surged as if guided by some malignant, ancient intelligence. Behind the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; the merciless &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; stirred once again. Empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, the qiraji prepared their legions for a worldwide assault to avenge &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;their bitter defeat&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; a thousand years ago.\"\n\"Worst of all, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s icy grip descended upon Azeroth once again as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; renewed its assault against living and undead alike. Foreboding necropoli recently appeared over several major cities. Alliance and Horde forces mobilized and drove the Scourge back. Nevertheless, questions remain. Was this defeat truly a setback for the Lich King? Or did this first attack further a different goal for the Scourge? Whatever the case, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; is clearly setting the stage for a full-scale, apocalyptic invasion from his seat of power in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"The heroes of the world have bravely faced these challenges and more, struggling to ensure the continued survival of their races. The greatest perils, however, remain unseen. Many of these new threats have the inhabitants of the world wondering if peace will ever find a home in Azeroth...\"\nShadows Return.\n\"Deep within &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, restless ghosts roam the darkened halls of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, where the demon-possessed wizard &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; spent his final days. Tempted by rumors of the time-lost secrets kept within, adventurers have begun infiltrating the haunted tower. Within the secret passages of the arcane stronghold, horrific nightmares have awakened.\"\n\"Elsewhere, the brooding dragon &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; stirs. The Timeless One has sensed a threat to his beloved timeways. Shadowy agents have infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to sabotage three key historical events: &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Thrall's escape from Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;, the monumental &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and Medivh's &lt;a href=\"Opening%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;creation of the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. In the face of this overwhelming threat, Nozdormu is enlisting heroes to help him prevent the fabric of time from unraveling forever.\"\n\"With the future in peril, a relic of the past has also surfaced, radiating renewed energy. This relic has enabled &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; to activate the current &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, thereby reopening the gateway to...\"\nThe Shattered Realm of Outland.\n\"Here, before &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was torn apart by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s portals, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; once lived in peace. Now this wasteland is ruled by the one-time defender of the night elves: the power-mad Betrayer, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Joined by Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and the insidious, serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan maintains a tight hold on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and its multiple portals. The &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; has set its sights on Outland as well, hoping to utilize the portals to gain access to numerous unspoiled worlds. Should the demons prove successful, no refuge would remain against their nihilistic crusade.\"\n\"Furthermore, the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; has not forgotten Illidan's failure to destroy the Lich King. Although Illidan still controls the mighty &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, he anticipates the Burning Legion's return and is preparing accordingly. He and his allies fight to ensure that Outland's multiple portals remain tightly sealed while he strengthens his power base.\"\n\"Even so, Illidan's forces are not the only presence on Outland. Several other factions roam the scattered wastes as well.\"\n\"Bands of draenei remain, although many of them have devolved into &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, warped shells of their former selves. Cut off from the Light, these Broken fight for their sanity and their lives.\"\n\"In addition, much to &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s horror, refugee orcs in the desolate region have discovered and embraced a new source of demonic corruption. Recently a new breed of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s began streaming out of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde base of operations during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s. Though these savage orcs have made no secret of their presence on Outland, the source of their newfound corruption remains a mystery.\"\n\"Using their dimensional fortress, &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; have recently arrived on Outland as well. These energy beings recognize the strategic importance of the broken wastes and have vowed to defeat their sworn enemies--the Legion--at all costs. When most of the naaru set out to explore the ravaged territories of Outland, however, Kael'thas seized the opportunity to strike.\"\n\"The blood elves assaulted the fortress, overcoming its automated defenses and taking command of the keep's satellite structures. Kael'thas has now begun manipulating the fortress' otherworldly technologies, using them to harness the chaotic energies of the Netherstorm itself.\"\n\"Despite Illidan's efforts to keep Outland's portals closed, the Horde and Alliance have anticipated Outland's role in renewed hostilities and ever more perilous threats. The denizens of Azeroth are thus preparing not only to battle each other, but also to face the inevitable onslaught of the Burning Legion. To that end, both Horde and Alliance have recruited new allies.\"\n\"Two bold new races have stepped forward to answer the call. Devastated by the recent Scourge invasion of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the resourceful, magic-addicted blood elves have rallied to rebuild much of their kingdom and take up the cause of the Horde. Meanwhile, the draenei, who once peacefully coexisted with the shamanistic orcs, have joined the Alliance to fight the Burning Legion and avenge past atrocities committed by the orcs...\"\nFlight of the Draenei.\n\"Long ago, on the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the brilliant and magically gifted &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; race drew the attention of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the Destroyer of Worlds. Sargeras offered untold power to the three leaders of the eredar - &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; - in exchange for their unquestioning loyalty. A troubling vision soon came to Velen, who saw the eredar transformed into unspeakable demons - the first sentient members of the Legion, which would grow to immense size and decimate all life.\"\n\"Despite Velen's warnings, Kil'jaeden and Archimonde decided to accept Sargeras' offer. Velen despaired at his former friends' decision and prayed for help. To his surprise and relief, he was answered by one of the benevolent naaru. These energy beings had, like Velen, foreseen the formation of the Burning Legion.\"\n\"The naaru offered to shepherd Velen and other believers to refuge. Velen quietly gathered those of his fellow eredar who seemed trustworthy and dubbed them the draenei, or \"exiled ones\". As Sargeras returned to Argus and transformed many willing eredar into demons, the draenei narrowly escaped their homeworld. Furious, Kil'jaeden vowed to track Velen to the ends of creation.\"\n\"Even as the Burning Legion chased the draenei across the cosmos, the naaru instructed the exiles in the way of the Light. Deeply affected, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's ideals.\"\n\"In time the draenei settled on a remote world and met the shamanistic orcs who inhabited it. The draenei came to call their new home Draenor or \"Exiles' Refuge\". Kil'jaeden continued to hunt the exiles, however, and he eventually learned of the idyllic world and its unsuspecting inhabitants.\"\n\"Working through the shaman Ner'zhul, the demon lord gradually began corrupting the orcs. When Ner'zhul refused to serve the Legion's agenda past a certain point, Kil'jaeden turned to Ner'zhul's apprentice. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; worked the orcs into a frenzy of bloodlust, and the newly formed Horde began slaughtering the peaceful draenei.\"\n\"The orcish campaign against the draenei was brutally effective. Over eighty percent of the draenei race was destroyed, though a small group of survivors remained, including the noble Velen.\"\n\"The orcs went on to invade Azeroth through Medivh's Dark Portal. Years later, after the Second War, Ner'zhul's additional portals would tear Draenor to pieces.\"\n\"Recently Velen and the remaining draenei survivors gained control of one of Tempest Keep's satellite structures and used it to escape to Azeroth. Now they search for allies in their never-ending battle against the Burning Crusade.\"\nLegacy of the Blood Elves.\n\"Long ago the exiled high elves landed on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. They struck out to find a new home, and after many battles with the trolls, established the kingdom of Quel'Thalas.\"\n\"Using a vial of sacred water stolen from the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves created a fount of mystical power at a convergence of ley energies in Quel'Thalas. They named this fountain the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Its potent arcane magic fed and strengthened the high elves, and soon the wondrous city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; was established.\"\n\"Protected by a magical barrier, the high elves enjoyed peace for roughly four thousand years, but that peace was not meant to last. The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s gathered an immense army and assaulted the elven kingdom. Vastly outnumbered, the high elves hastily struck an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"human%20nation\"&gt;human nation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. The elves taught a small number of humans how to wield magic. In exchange the humans aided the elves in destroying the trolls' power base forever.\"\n\"Over the following years the high elves returned to their reclusive ways, but during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the diabolical Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; brought battle once again to their doorstep. Arthas craved the power of the Sunwell and would stop at nothing to harness it. He invaded Quel'Thalas and wiped out most of its population. In the end, even &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; lay dead.\"\n\"Additionally it became clear that the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; had become addicted to the Sunwell's arcane energies. Now that the source of their magic was gone, the few remaining high elves quickly grew ill and apathetic.\"\n\"Prince Kael'thas, last of the royal line, returned from his studies in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to find Quel'Thalas in ruins. Thirsting for vengeance, he gathered the survivors, renamed them blood elves, and took a group of the strongest fighters to join Lordaeron's campaign against the Scourge.\"\n\"Due to human prejudice, Kael'thas was forced to accept the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her reptilian naga. When the humans discovered that the blood elves had been working with the naga, Kael'thas and the others were imprisoned and condemned to death. Lady Vashj soon arrived to set them free, leading them through a portal and into the broken wastes of Outland.\"\n\"There, the elves met the one being capable of putting an end to their hunger: the renegade demon, Illidan Stormrage. Certain that the blood elves would die without Illidan's assistance, Kael'thas agreed to serve the Betrayer. A lone representative, Rommath, was sent back to Azeroth with a message of hope for the blood elves remaining in Quel'Thalas: that one day Kael'thas would return to lead his people to paradise.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; has made great progress in teaching the blood elves advanced techniques to manipulate arcane energies. With renewed purpose, the blood elves have now rebuilt the city of Silvermoon, though it is powered by volatile magics. Emboldened by the promise of Kael'thas' return, the weary citizens of Quel'Thalas now focus on regaining their strength, even as they forge a new path into an uncertain future.\"\nSource.\nThe page can still be viewed &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20071002114317/http%3A//worldofwarcraft.com/burningcrusade/townhall/story.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"https%3A//web.archive.org/\"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;."}

We've banished the fiendish &lt;a href=\"Blood%20God\"&gt;blood god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Realm\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; from whence he came. We exterminated the hivemind infestation that plagued &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; and shut &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;'s all-seeing eye once and for all (we hope). And when &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s icy grip threatened our world with an &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;apocalyptic invasion&lt;/a&gt;? We shattered his wicked bones and scattered their dust to the wind.\nAzeroth's heroes have bravely faced these challenges and more, struggling to ensure the continued survival of their &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s. The greatest perils, however, have just begun.\nThis story began over 10,000 years ago during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, back when the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic Burning Legion invaded Azeroth. A &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; who held great promise, Illidan Stormrage, allied himself with &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the Destroyer of Worlds, and his Burning Legion armies in exchange for unfathomable power. At the eclipse of the conflict, when the Burning Legion would vanquish Azeroth and enslave all its inhabitants, Illidan had a change of heart. He joined forces with his brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and together they reversed the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; Sargeras tried to use to enter Azeroth. Though Illidan fought against the Burning Legion's forces, he was put on trial for his reprehensible crimes\u2014notably for attacking his fellow kin and creating a &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;forbidden fount of power&lt;/a&gt;. He was found guilty, and was imprisoned under the watchful eyes of the night elf &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, led by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Legion once again invaded Azeroth during the events of \"\". Out of desperation, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; broke Illidan out &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;his prison deep within the earth&lt;/a&gt; so he could fight the sinister demons and save their world. To ensure victory, Illidan consumed the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; power of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. In so doing, he grew wicked curved horns, cloven hooves, and leathery wings and became the very thing he hunted\u2014a demon. This transformation forced Malfurion to exile him from their home, and Illidan disappeared into the wilds.\nNot finished with his never-ending pursuit of power, Illidan recruited &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; to steal another demonic artifact, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. He used it to perform a ritual to split &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; asunder and stop the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. However, Malfurion, Maiev, and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; intercepted him and caused the spell to end prematurely. An emotional Malfurion confronted Illidan, and accused him of killing Tyrande. Illidan denied this atrocity, and it is revealed that Maiev lied about Tyrande's death. Worried about the woman he loved, Illidan pledged to save her. With his naga allies, they searched &lt;a href=\"River%20Arevass\"&gt;the river she fell into&lt;/a&gt; and broke through &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; lines to rescue her.\nThey saved Tyrande but failed to stop the Scourge, and Illidan realized his Burning Legion masters would search the ends of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt; to punish him. He prepared for their wrath, and erected a magical portal into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and rushed through, closing the doorway behind him\u2014but not before Maiev and her &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; followed, intent on seeking justice and vengeance.\nIn Outland, Maiev captured Illidan, but his naga and new &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; allies rescued him. Kael'thas pledged his loyalty and that of his people to Illidan in exchange for curing &lt;a href=\"Magic%20addiction\"&gt;their addiction&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. Illidan told the prince that there was no cure, but instead taught them how to siphon magic from other sources to sate their hunger.. The Betrayer tasked his minions to scour Outland for the Burning Legion's agents so he could claim the broken world and solidify his power for the inevitable confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'Jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. While smiting the land, they located the demonic &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; who has amassed a massive army by bringing in hapless demons through the many portals that to Outland. Together, Illidan and his allies sealed the &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gates&lt;/a&gt; and prepared to storm the seat of power in this shattered world, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Upon storming the desecrated fortress, a warped subsect of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; also joined the fight. Together they overthrew Magtheridon, and Illidan ascended as the master of Outland with the Broken\u2014led by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;\u2014joining Illidan's ranks. Soon after taking over the Black Temple, Kil'jaeden found them. He threatened Illidan and gave the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; one last chance to redeem himself: Destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; or suffer the Burning Legion's eternal wrath.\nKnowing that the demon's threat was dire, Illidan journeyed to the frozen tundra of Icecrown. At the steps of the Frozen Throne, &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; intercepted him and asked him to stand down. Knowing he could not fail Kil'jaeden again, Illidan refused to give up his quest and drew arms against the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. After a long, bloody battle, Arthas gained the upper hand and cut down Illidan and left him for dead in the snow. Illidan was recovered by his allies and returned to Outland, where he began to build an &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;army&lt;/a&gt; to protect his people from Kil'jaeden, who would certainly bring the Burning Legion to Outland.\nTHE DARK PORTAL.\nNow, many years after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan Stormrage's past betrayals threatens us all. The Burning Legion has come to Outland, seeking their revenge on the wayward demon hunter and to reclaim the shattered world. Knowing full well that their conquest will not stop until they pour into Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are preparing a preemptive strike by using the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to attack the demonic forces that constructed it. Step through the gateway between worlds and drive these terrors back into the abyss\nTo face the relentless threat of the Burning Legion, both the Horde and Alliance have recruited new allies. Read on to learn more about the two bold new races who have stepped forward to answer the call.\nThe Flight of the Draenei.\nLong ago, on the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the brilliant and magically gifted &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; race drew the attention of Sargeras, the Destroyer of Worlds. Sargeras offered untold power to the three leaders of the eredar\u2013Kil'jaeden, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;\u2013in exchange for their unquestioning loyalty. A troubling vision soon came to Velen, who saw the eredar transformed into unspeakable demons, who would decimate all life.\nDespite Velen's warnings, Kil'jaeden and Archimonde decided to accept Sargeras' offer. Velen despaired at his former friends' decision and prayed for help. To his surprise and relief, he was answered by one of the benevolent &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. These energy beings had, like Velen, foreseen the formation of the Burning Legion.\nThe naaru offered to shepherd Velen and other believers to refuge. Velen quietly gathered those of his fellow eredar who seemed trustworthy and dubbed them the draenei, or \"exiled ones.\" As Sargeras returned to Argus and transformed many willing eredar into demons, the draenei narrowly escaped their homeworld. Furious, Kil'jaeden vowed to track Velen to the ends of creation.\nIn time the draenei settled on a remote world and met the &lt;a href=\"Shamanism\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who inhabited it. The draenei came to call their new home &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; or \"Exiles' Refuge.\" Kil'jaeden continued to hunt the exiles, however, and he eventually learned of the idyllic world and its unsuspecting inhabitants.\nWorking through the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; gradually began corrupting the orcs. When Ner'zhul refused to serve the Legion's agenda past a certain point, Kil'jaeden turned to Ner'zhul's apprentice. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; worked the orcs into a frenzy of bloodlust, and the newly formed Horde began slaughtering the peaceful draenei.\nThe orcish &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; against the draenei was brutally effective\u2014most of their race was destroyed. A small group of survivors remained, including the noble Velen.\nThe orcs went on to &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;invade&lt;/a&gt; Azeroth through &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s Dark Portal. Years later, after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul's additional portals would tear Draenor to pieces.\nRecently Velen and the remaining draenei survivors gained control of &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s satellite structures and used it to escape to Azeroth. Now they search for allies in their never-ending battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy of the Blood Elves.\nLong ago the exiled &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; landed on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. They struck out to find a new home, and after many battles with the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, established the &lt;a href=\"kingdom%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing a vial of sacred water stolen from the first &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves created a fount of mystical power at a convergence of &lt;a href=\"Ley%20lines\"&gt;ley energies&lt;/a&gt; within their home. They named this fountain the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Its potent arcane magic fed and strengthened the high elves, and soon the wondrous city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; was established.\nProtected by a &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;magical barrier&lt;/a&gt;, the high elves enjoyed peace for thousands of years, but that peace was not meant to last. The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls gathered an immense army and assaulted the elven kingdom. Vastly outnumbered, the high elves hastily struck an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;. The elves taught a small number of humans how to wield magic. In exchange the humans aided the elves in destroying the trolls' power base forever.\nOver the following years the high elves returned to their reclusive ways, but during the Third War, the diabolical Prince Arthas Menethil &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;brought battle&lt;/a&gt; once again to their doorstep. Arthas craved the power of the Sunwell and would stop at nothing to harness it. He invaded Quel'Thalas and wiped out most of its population. In the end, even King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; lay dead.\nWith the fount corrupted and unusable, it became clear that the high elves had become addicted to the Sunwell's arcane energies. Now that the source of their magic was gone, the few remaining high elves quickly grew ill and apathetic.\nPrince Kael'thas, last of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider\"&gt;royal line&lt;/a&gt;, returned from his studies in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to find Quel'Thalas in ruins. Thirsting for vengeance, he gathered the survivors, renamed them &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and took a group of the strongest fighters to join Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; against the Scourge.\nDue to &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;human prejudice&lt;/a&gt;, Kael'thas was forced to accept the assistance of Lady Vashj and her reptilian naga. When the humans discovered that the blood elves had been working with the naga, Kael'thas and the others were imprisoned and condemned to death. Lady Vashj soon arrived to set them free, leading them through a portal and into the broken wastes of Outland.\nThere, the elves met the one being capable of putting an end to their hunger: the renegade demon, Illidan Stormrage. Certain that the blood elves would die without Illidan's assistance, Kael'thas agreed to serve the Betrayer. A lone representative, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, was sent back to Azeroth with a message of hope for the blood elves remaining in Quel'Thalas: that one day Kael'thas would return to lead his people to paradise.\nNow that you're caught up on the story, you can try out the two new playable races\u2014blood elves and draenei\u2014during the pre-expansion going on right now and then prepare to step through the Dark Portal on June 1."}

It presented the story implemented in the third expansion, \"\".\nShattered Hopes.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s reign of terror was over. As if to affirm that a bright future would soon dawn on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, other joyful events occurred across the world. Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was at last freed from his imprisonment by the shadowy &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; through the efforts of his love, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and her allies. Elsewhere, after years in exile, the highly intelligent &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and the fearless &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20troll\"&gt;Darkspear troll&lt;/a&gt;s made gains toward reclaiming their respective homes in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Yet just as hope was beginning to surge among Azeroth's races, tragedy struck. The world's elemental spirits grew increasingly erratic, setting off a series of deadly natural disasters. Agents of the nefarious &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt; surfaced throughout &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; cities, spreading word of the impending apocalypse. The world's leaders scrambled to find a solution to Azeroth's growing instability.\"\n\"In the dwarven bastion of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; undertook a mystic ritual to commune with the earth. The ceremony, however, had an unexpected effect: Magni was transformed into diamond and became fused to the depths of the mountain city itself. In the wake of his petrification, the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;s agreed to rule over Ironforge via the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, but the city's future remained uncertain.\"\n\"Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to his ancestors' lands in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to glean insight from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s elemental spirits as well as other respected shaman. In his absence, Thrall appointed &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, son of the legendary orc &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom&lt;/a&gt;, as acting Horde warchief. Garrosh's brash demeanor inflamed relations between the Horde and the Alliance. A gruesome slaughter of druids in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, which the Twilight's Hammer had perpetrated to look like an act of the Horde, escalated tensions further and sowed mistrust among Garrosh's own comrades.\"\n\"In particular, Garrosh infuriated &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, the wise &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; high chieftain. Believing that the new warchief would lead the Horde to ruin, Cairne challenged Garrosh to a duel of honor. Although the mighty tauren fought valiantly, no amount of strength could have led him to victory. The matriarch of the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribe, &lt;a href=\"Magatha\"&gt;Magatha&lt;/a&gt;, had poisoned Garrosh's blade, unbeknownst to either of the duel's combatants. Cairne became immobilized after he received a flesh wound during the battle, allowing the new warchief to land a killing blow.\"\n\"Following the duel, Magatha's agents seized the tauren capital of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; for the Grimtotem. The usurpers also intended to murder Cairne's son, &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, but the young tauren eluded his assassins and staged a counterattack. Ultimately, Baine and his forces reclaimed Thunder Bluff, expelling Magatha and her traitorous followers from tauren lands forever.\"\n\"Unaware of these critical events, Thrall received an ominous warning in Nagrand from the Fury of Earth: the fear and turmoil of Azeroth's elementals echoed the condition of Outland just before that world\u2014then known as Draenor\u2014had been ripped apart. Yet Thrall had little time to act on this unsettling revelation...\"\n\"In a sudden upheaval eclipsing the world's recent elemental unrest, Azeroth shattered. Violent quakes tore through the earth. Mountains of fire and magma burst from the ground. Colossal tidal waves obliterated coastlines and caused widespread flooding.\n&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;The Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; had begun.\"\nHeralds of Twilight.\n\"As the world's races struggled for survival in the wake of the Cataclysm, details came to light concerning what\u2014or who\u2014had caused the disaster. Prior to the upheaval, the Fury of Earth had cryptically told Thrall that Azeroth's instability had been caused by something good that had turned unnatural. Something that wished to inflict pain and suffering on the entire world.\"\n\"The warning was in reference to an ancient being once known as &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion the Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt;. Long ago, this &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; had been granted dominion over Azeroth's earthly expanses by the benevolent &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. Yet the incessant whisperings of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; had gradually driven Neltharion insane and caused him to abandon his sacred charge. He had later revealed his treachery during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; by turning an immensely powerful artifact \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 against his allies, annihilating nearly all of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Forever after, Neltharion would answer to a new name: &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Deathwing's murderous aim had become the subjugation of the other dragonflights, a goal left unfulfilled decades ago when he was chased into hiding by the Dragon Aspects &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;. In Deathwing's absence, agents of the black dragonflight continued one of his darkest schemes: creating a more powerful breed of dragon. The most promising of these vile experiments resulted in &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, malefic creatures that first appeared in the cursed and abandoned dwarven city of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, and later within the hallowed &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"During many of these developments, Deathwing remained hidden. Rumors regarding his death circulated, leading to the assumption that his malevolent influence on Azeroth was at an end. Such was not the case. In &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, the domain of earth within the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing nourished his hatred of Azeroth's inhabitants, awaiting his moment to burst forth from his lair and reforge the world in flame. That fateful day\u2014the Cataclysm\u2014arrived shortly after Thrall's return from Outland.\"\n\"Deathwing's violent return did much more than sunder the lands of Azeroth; it also ruptured the boundaries of the Elemental Plane. In the aftermath, chaotic elementals emerged into the world from within the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt;, Deepholm, the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;. Working with Deathwing, the Twilight's Hammer cult and its twisted leader, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, established footholds across the world with the aid of twilight dragons and enslaved elementals.\"\n\"Thus far, many of Azeroth's defenders have devoted themselves to combating the cult and allaying the elemental forces threatening to tear the world apart. Chief among these champions are the shaman of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, including Thrall, &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;. Other Horde and Alliance heroes have also risen to the challenge, but their focus has been split due to skirmishes between the two factions.\"\n\"Amid the turmoil, two other beleaguered groups are striving to overcome their own hurdles. The human &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, walled off from the rest of the world for years, has come under assault by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Sylvanas\"&gt;Queen Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Aside from the undead, the kingdom is assailed by a debilitating curse that transforms its victims into feral wolf-beasts known as &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, a volcanic eruption on the tropical &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Kezan\"&gt;Isle of Kezan&lt;/a&gt; has ousted the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s from their homes. &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; has capitalized on this moment of panic and swindled his fellow goblins out of their life savings\u2014and their freedom\u2014in exchange for transport off of Kezan.\"\n\"Much like Gilneas and the Bilgewater Cartel, other kingdoms and factions the world over face their own trials, from internal political strife to the reappearance of ancient foes. Yet there is one inescapable truth that they all share: if Deathwing and his nihilistic servants are left unopposed, the Cataclysm will pale in comparison to the chaos that lies ahead for Azeroth.\""}

Theirs is a history of betrayal, corruption, and a fight for the very survival of their legacy.\nThe Rise of the Aspects.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s were ordering Azeroth, they needed a more delicate hand to combat the agents of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Due to their colossal forms, &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; feared the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; would irreparably damage or even kill &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;the world-soul&lt;/a&gt;. He proposed creating powerful constructs to act as the Pantheon's hands and prosecute their will against the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Old Gods: Physical manifestations of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, these parasitic horrors grow like cancers and are administrators of corruption. Notable Old Gods are &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nThe Pantheon members imbued their servants with their specific likenesses and powers to lead the rest of the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. They called these empowered beings \"&lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s.\" One titan, Aggramar, imparted his strength and courage to Keeper &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, who would become the greatest &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; of the titan-forged. In time, the keepers led the titan-forged against the armies of the Black Empire.\n\"Titans: The titans are a &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of majestic planet-sized cosmic beings made up of &lt;a href=\"Order\"&gt;Order&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and the primordial matter from which &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;the universe&lt;/a&gt; was born. Notable titans are &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn the far north of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; had been the largest and most effective predator. Eventually, he would succumb to corruption and began to devour his own kind.\nTyr knew that if Galakrond remained unchecked, he would devour all nature, spreading his affliction to the far corners of Azeroth. He warned his fellow keepers of what he had seen, but they wouldn't act. So he searched for a means to destroy the giant proto-dragon and his fetid minions.\nDragon Aspect Leaders.\nThe answer lay with five of the greatest and most intelligent proto-dragons: &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed with how they worked together to survive Galakrond's attacks, Tyr reached out to Malygos. Under Tyr's guidance, the proto-dragons warred with Galakrond.\n\"I have watched you. I have watched the others. I see much potential in you, in these friends of yours...and I say that as someone who has watched many of your kind since the first of you began to stir toward self-consciousness.\" - Tyr\n\"Primal Dragons: Also known as proto-drakes or &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, these creatures were the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;kind. After the dragon Aspects were elevated by the titans, some primal dragons also embraced the gifts of the titans to form the five &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Others shunned this ordering and roamed the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and the Dragon Isles.\"\nTyr requested that these five proto-dragons be imbued with powers to guard Azeroth's lands. Keeper &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; challenged the idea. Despite their heroism, Odyn only saw the dragons as primitive life forms. He felt that only the mighty titan-forged could be trusted to protect the world. The other keepers were not easily swayed by Odyn, and the proto-dragons were transformed into the Aspects\u2014leaders of the dragonflights and guardians of Azeroth. Odyn, believing the dragons would fail, left to build his own group of warriors, the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlexstrasza, The Life-Binder.\nAlso known as the Dragon Queen and Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza was empowered by &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; to act as guardian of all &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. As Dragon Queen, Alexstrasza served as the leader of the Aspects, bringing them together in times of great need. In order to defeat Deathwing, Alexstrasza and the rest of the Aspects sacrificed much of their power.\nNozdormu.\nAlso known as the Timeless One, Guardian of Time, Murozond. Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu was empowered by &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; to safeguard &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt; itself and police the ever-spinning pathways of fate and destiny. When Deathwing was defeated, Nozdormu lost much of his power along with the rest of the Aspects. Nozdormu foresaw his eventual fall to corruption, becoming the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, this future self ultimately fell to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nNeltharion, The Earth-Warder (former).\nAspect of the black dragonflight . After being driven mad by the Old Gods, he took the name Deathwing the Destroyer. Failing in his goal to enslave the other dragonflights, he aimed to bring about the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, the unmaking of all creation. Though he possessed the power to shatter the world, in the end, he fought alone, facing his fellow Aspects and their allies. He fell from the skies into the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed by the Dragon Soul and the champions of Azeroth.\nMalygos, Aspect of Magic\u00a0(former).\nAspect of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. He was empowered with the essence of &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the guardian of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and hidden arcanum. Malygos and his mate &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; ruled the blue dragonflight until the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when the crazed Deathwing used the Dragon Soul to wipe out most of the flight, leaving only Malygos and precious few eggs left. Malygos was killed after declaring war on all mortal spellcasters in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; to lead the blue dragonlfight in his wake.\nYsera, The Dreamer (former).\nAlso known as The Awakened and Aspect of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Alexstrasza's younger sister, Ysera, was chosen by &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; to watch over the growing wilds of the world from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera fell to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; and was put to rest by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Her &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;afterlife&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where she was restored by the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Ysera's essence remains bound to the Shadowlands, leaving her daughter &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; to guide the green dragonflight.\nTyr's Sacrifice.\n&lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, a keeper falling to an Old God's influence, began working toward the downfall of the other keepers. Tyr suspected darkness was growing within the fallen keeper, so he and his companions stole the &lt;a href=\"discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; to preserve the vital knowledge they contained. When Loken discovered the discs were missing, he turned to the only creatures he knew were powerful enough to stop the mighty Tyr\u2014ancient &lt;a href=\"C%27Thraxxi\"&gt;C'Thraxxi&lt;/a&gt; monstrosities. He ordered the colossal abominations to kill Tyr and all who followed him.\nFar to the south, the C'Thraxxi overtook the fleeing keepers and their followers in a tranquil and temperate glade. Fearing for his allies' lives, Tyr ordered &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; to lead the rest of the titan-forged farther south. Meanwhile, he would hold off the C'Thraxxi for as long as possible.\nThe violent struggle between the lone keeper and the C'Thraxxi raged for six days and nights. As fatigue set in, Tyr resolved to sacrifice himself to protect his friends. He unleashed his remaining power on the C'Thraxxi, expending his life force in a blinding explosion of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy that shook the world to the core.\nArchaedas and Ironaya watched as the eruption of magic flared across the horizon. After the volatile energies subsided, the two titan-forged returned to the site of the battle. Within a &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;giant crater&lt;/a&gt; crackling with arcane magic, there lay Tyr's lifeless body.\nIn honor of her fallen comrade, Ironaya named the glade surrounding the crater \"Tyr's Fall,\" which in the &lt;a href=\"Vrykul%20%28language%29\"&gt;vrykul tongue&lt;/a&gt; translated to \"&lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\" She and her followers buried Tyr where he lay and placed Tyr's massive silver hand atop his final resting place to memorialize his valiant sacrifice.\nThe Sting of Betrayal.\nWith the fall of Tyr, the Aspects were blinded to the darkness slowly growing within their midst. The tendrils of Old Gods corruption had tightened the hold on Neltharion the Earth-Warder.\nWith the guidance of the Old Gods, Neltharion would devise a way to enslave the other dragonflights to usher forth the Hour of Twilight and the unmaking of all creation. The moment when the Old Gods could finally be free from their imprisonment, but he needed help.\nWhen the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began an invasion of Azeroth, Neltharion suggested creating a magical artifact to aid in destroying the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. He asked the other Aspects to help craft it; each Aspect would contribute a portion of their essence to the artifact.\nNeltharion brought the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; to bear against the Legion, devastating the demonic swarm. But in his corruption, Neltharion, once the Earth-Warder and protector of Azeroth, became Deathwing the Destroyer. He would shock his fellow Aspects as he turned the Dragon Soul against them. His betrayal cut deep as he turned on his own kind. The shocked dragons were helpless to resist the power of the deadly artifact, for it contained a fraction of each of their essences. All the dragonflights, save the black dragonflight, were paralyzed.\nBut Deathwing's doom would eventually come.\n\"Forged by Deathwing during the War of the Ancients, the Dragon Soul harnessed the combined power of the dragonflights until it was ultimately destroyed. Through the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the remaining dragonflights recovered the powerful artifact before its destruction. Now they have rallied at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; in a desperate attempt to use the might of the Dragon Soul against Deathwing himself.\"\nWyrmrest Temple was the final hope for the forces allied against Deathwing the Destroyer. Here, the remaining aspects\u2014 Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, and Kalecgos, along with their ally Thrall, would gather to empower the Dragon Soul\u2014Azeroth's last chance to stop the great behemoth. But, as they began to charge the Dragon Soul with energy, Deathwing and his entire army assaulted Wyrmrest Temple.\nEventually, with the help of allies, the remaining Aspects would sunder Deathwing, and he would fall from the skies into the Maelstrom.\nThe Aftermath.\nIn the coming years, the pain of Neltharion's betrayal would cut deeper than any could imagine. His betrayal was so destructive that the five dragonflights never truly recovered. The flights were left listless and could no longer protect Azeroth, and the blue dragonflight was all but destroyed. Their sacrifice was apparent as they were now made mortal.\nThe Birth of the Dracthyr.\nThe &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; were created in the ancient past by Neltharion, the Earth-Warder, to serve as soldiers. He combined the essence of dragons with the adaptability of the mortal races. They would train off the coast of the Dragon Isles on an island known as the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;. After a terrible battle, the island would lie abandoned until an ancient enemy awakens the fiercest of warriors, unlike any Azeroth has seen.\nEyes on the Horizon.\nAfter returning to the Dragon Isles, Queen Alexstrasza has learned of another disc locked away within &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;... one that holds the memories of Tyr himself. Believing this knowledge is needed to restore the power of the Aspects, Alexstrasza has asked her mortal allies to brave the perils of Uldaman and recover Tyr's memories to secure the future of dragonkind. However, there are others among dragonkind that do not want Alexstrasza's plans to succeed.\nThe story continues in World of Warcraft: Dragonflight and Azeroth's heroes must heed the call to aid Alexstrasza in rebuilding the kingdom and reclaiming the legacy of the dragons.\nTo learn more about Dragonlfight, visit\u00a0Dragonflight.blizzard.com and soar to\u00a0WorldofWarcraft.com/news\u00a0for updates.\nSee you on the Dragon Isles!"}

But battles of good versus evil are never straightforward when cosmic deities meddle in the matters of &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s. When a &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;fallen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; possessed of untold power and a desire to scour all &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; ordered the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, they were set on a path that would end in an inevitable clash with a &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;nation&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s enjoying a prosperous existence. This &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;universe&lt;/a&gt;-spanning conflict helped forge &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into the world we know it as today.\nRead on to relive the history of \"Warcraft\" and prepare yourself to take up arms in \"\".\nOf Orcs and Humans in \"Warcraft\".\nOnce the greatest &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;like Titans\u2014the assemblage of cosmic entities responsible for the shaping and ordering of the universe\u2014Sargeras succumbed to the all-consuming corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;worlds&lt;/a&gt; composed of chaotic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s, and its resident fiends while attempting to shield his brethren from its depravity. Convinced that the only way to spare the universe from the Nether's &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic entities was to purge it, he soon turned his power on the cosmos, seeking to cleanse all life in existence. To this end, he forged the demonic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After a failed &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth 10,000 years ago, Sargeras saw an opportunity to once again strike at the world, and possessed the &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magus&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, intending to use his power to foment a war between worlds that would force Azeroth to buckle upon itself.\nCorrupted by the malignant magics of Sargeras, Medivh, the last of an ancient line of &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;powerful magi&lt;/a&gt; and friend to the throne of Stormwind, worked to orchestrate Azeroth's downfall. He found in the far-off world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; a kindred spirit\u2014the powerful &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. Wielding &lt;a href=\"heretic\"&gt;heretic&lt;/a&gt;al &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, this nefarious orc taught his brethren to channel demonic energy. His influence over the orcs came to a head when he convinced them to &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Felblood\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of the demon &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, promising them invincibility in exchange for their compliance. The fiend's blood poisoned their minds, transforming the orcs into an army consumed by bloodlust and controlled from the shadows by Gul'dan and his puppet &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;.\nMedivh struck a deal with his new ally: in exchange for the promise of godhood, Gul'dan would create a &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;gateway&lt;/a&gt; between the human homeworld of Azeroth and his own planet, Draenor. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was first opened, and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; flooded through to &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;clash&lt;/a&gt; with the humans of Azeroth.\nThe orcish Horde assailed the humans' heartlands, razing entire &lt;a href=\"Settlement\"&gt;towns&lt;/a&gt; and leaving ruin in their wake. For years, orcs and humans clashed in savage skirmishes, each side biding their time and surveying the enemy with the intent to launch a full-force strike when the hour was right. Three years after the Dark Portal was opened, the Horde marched on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Though their first attack was repelled by the &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde retreated to regroup and decide how best to land a decisive blow against the human kingdom.\nMeanwhile, Medivh's apprentice &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; confided in King Llane and Anduin Lothar, revealing that his master had been corrupted by dark forces and had unleashed the Horde upon Azeroth. With Khadgar's aid, Lothar slew Medivh and banished the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt; of Sargeras within him to the Nether. Gul'dan, having entered Medivh's mind prior to his death to scour it for information, fell into a deep coma after the magus's death.\nThe great orc &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; found himself disillusioned with the Horde's leadership under Gul'dan and Blackhand. Sensing an opportunity, he &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt; Blackhand for the mantle of Warchief and emerged from the fray victorious.\nUnited under the &lt;a href=\"banner\"&gt;banner&lt;/a&gt; of Doomhammer, the Horde marched upon Stormwind once more. While the city was under siege, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, a former ally of the humans who was secretly in the thrall of Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, secured victory for the orcs, and assassinated King Llane under the Council's orders. The morale of Stormwind's military died along with him, and the city fell to the might of the Horde. Anduin Lothar declared the war lost and retreated with the remnants of Stormwind's populace across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Warcraft II\"'s Turning Tides.\nDesperate for aid, Lothar and the survivors of Stormwind's siege fled &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;north&lt;/a&gt;. There, they sought support from the sovereign of the mighty human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s were irrefutable proof of the threat posed by the Horde; unable to deny the existence of such a threat to life on Azeroth, King Terenas summoned the leaders of the human kingdoms to prepare a counteroffensive against the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven nations&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;united&lt;/a&gt; under a single banner for the first time in three thousand years, giving birth to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan, recently awoken from his magical coma following the death of Medivh, bargained with the Horde's new Warchief and disavowed the Shadow Council to spare his life. Though wary of the warlock, Doomhammer spared Gul'dan, and allowed him to establish &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;his own clan&lt;/a&gt; to bolster the Horde's ranks. With powerful aid in the form of conscripted &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and the recently discovered &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an ancient artifact capable of controlling &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014the orcs prepared to advance upon the remaining human nations.\nWhile the Horde readied themselves to march upon their enemies, Lothar rallied the disparate &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s of Lordaeron, gaining the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and invoking his right as the last descendant of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; line to call upon the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Bound by a blood oath sworn long ago to Lothar's kin, King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; sent a small force of soldiers to Lordaeron's aid, first among them the &lt;a href=\"Ranger\"&gt;Ranger&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href=\"Captain%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrgrim Doomhammer led his Horde north on a continued path of destruction, following the remnants of Stormwind's people to Lordaeron and razing all that stood in his way. Though victory seemed in sight as the orcish forces marched on Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; would live to withstand the latter days of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; by virtue of discord within the Horde's ranks. Doomhammer and his army, poised to strike at the heart of the Alliance, received dire news: Gul'dan had abandoned his fellow orcs, taking with him half of their military might to seek out the fabled &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; in his pursuit of godhood. \nGul'dan's betrayal afforded the Alliance the very chance it needed to turn the tide of war. Anduin Lothar's troops rallied and pushed the Horde from the lands of Lordaeron all the way down to the volcanic fortress of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Unwilling to accept defeat, the determined Doomhammer landed one final blow upon the humans, putting an end to Lothar's life in a suicidal charge.\nAs Lothar fell, his &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; took up the mantle of commander, calling upon his brothers and sisters to persevere and fight on in honor of their commander's legacy. So inspirational was his battle cry that the human forces fervently cleaved through the Horde, scattering its army and seizing those they could find as &lt;a href=\"prisoner\"&gt;prisoner&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance. Those who were caught were herded into &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s and left to wallow.\nAnd so, the flames of the Second War guttered out, and peace settled upon a land that had for so long been plagued by war. In the years following the Horde's defeat, the Alliance splintered, no longer held together by the tenuous covenant that had been forged out of common desperation. Thus, the Kingdom of Lordaeron was left to face alone an uncertain future.\nChaos Rising.\nAs \"\" begins, nearly 13 years after the Horde's defeat, trouble stirs once again. Rumors of a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; spread quickly through the kingdom of Lordaeron, unsettling the citizenry and prompting King Terenas's son, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, to investigate its source\u2014a venture that will set him on a dark path and forever define his fate. Meanwhile, a young upstart rallies the orcs that have spent the past decade laboring in crowded internment camps, inspiring them to cast off the yoke of imprisonment and once more take up their blades. Within Alliance-ruled lands, a &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt; arises, poisoning the minds of its members and heralding the start of an insidious &lt;a href=\"scourge\"&gt;scourge&lt;/a&gt; that seeks to pave the way for a new invasion of Azeroth. And the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt;, desperate to protect their ancient homelands from destructive forces, awaken their dreaming kin and contemplate freeing the most dangerous prisoner their kind has ever known, in a bid for the power necessary to stand against their enemies.\nCalamity returns once more to the world of \"Warcraft\", and its inhabitants, both new and old, take up arms to fight for the future.

All too soon they will face a new menace with a familiar face.\nParting the Mists.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s menace ended, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; seized the opportunity to strike at the Alliance and expand the Horde's territory on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. His assault completely obliterated the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, causing world-wide violence between the factions to erupt anew. A destructive naval skirmish left Alliance and Horde forces washed ashore on the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;fog&lt;/a&gt;-shrouded island of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, which had appeared in the open sea, defying modern &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt;s and charts. As both warring factions established footholds on the resource-rich continent, they made contact with the noble &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, one of its most prolific peoples. This ancient &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; worked with the Alliance and Horde in the hopes of dispersing the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;: dark, ephemeral beings roused from beneath Pandaria by the bloody conflict.\nTheirs is a tale with a history best told by the last of the pandaren &lt;a href=\"emperor\"&gt;emperor&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shaohao\"&gt;Shaohao&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandfall.\nThe conflict between the Horde and the Alliance entered a bloody new chapter in Pandaria. As the two factions' armies clashed on the shores of the continent, Warchief Garrosh Hellscream dispatched elite troops to find the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an ancient &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; artifact capable of endowing his &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s with unimaginable power. Garrosh's bold and reckless actions, however, had dire consequences for the Horde, including the outbreak of violence against the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; and the expulsion of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; from the once-&lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Although Garrosh claimed the bell, &lt;a href=\"Prince\"&gt;Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance secret &lt;a href=\"agent\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt;s of closely tracked the warchief's every move. On the highest peaks of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, the brave prince thwarted Garrosh's plans, leading to the fabled mogu artifact's destruction.\nThe Thunder King.\nWhile war between the Horde and the Alliance raged across Pandaria, the scattered mogu plotted a return to their terrible former glory. They rekindled their historical alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s, who managed to resurrect the tyrannical mogu emperor, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; the Thunder King, in the hopes of restoring mogu dominion over the continent. The valiant &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-pan&lt;/a&gt; rushed to suppress their enemies, creating a task force, the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-pan Assault&lt;/a&gt;, originally composed of pandaren &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and later supported by heroes of the Horde and Alliance. These fearless &lt;a href=\"Champion%20%28rank%29\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; strove to defeat the Thunder King, though they also simultaneously served their factions' interests on Pandaria. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; on a quest to uncover the source of all mogu power (and keep it from the Horde), and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; took the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; in search of mighty mogu weaponry to aid a daring plan\u2026an insurrection against Warchief Garrosh Hellscream.\nEscalation.\nGarrosh Hellscream's quest for power in Pandaria leads him to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;excavate&lt;/a&gt; part of the sacred &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; in search of a sinister artifact, a decision that puts the Horde at odds with the Shado-pan and other influential pandaren. Meanwhile, in the Horde capital of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chieftain\"&gt;Chieftain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and the Darkspear trolls are declared traitors and hunted by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, Hellscream's personal guard. Vol'jin's people &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;retreat&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to gather supplies and reinforcements for their counter-strike, relying on the support of their former warchief, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and a particularly tenuous pact with the Alliance, whose interest in ending Garrosh's rule may not bode entirely well for the Horde...\nThe Siege of Orgrimmar.\nThe tensions stoked by Garrosh Hellscream's arrogance have reached a boiling point with the destruction unleashed upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Leaders of the Alliance and Horde lay siege to Hellscream's capital in order to topple the ruthless Warchief once and for all! \nGarrosh's subsequent defeat and trial should have been the end of his reign of terror, but it was not to be and now a new threat is building on . The &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; is on the march and readying to take &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in a flood of iron and blood. \nNow: Treacherous Developments.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; has turned blood red.

Shortly after reaching &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and joining the Alliance, the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; were instrumental in convincing their new allies to venture back into the broken land beyond the portal.\"\n\"Likewise, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; urged their new allies within the Horde to journey into the realm where their beloved prince, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, had come to reside. The prince had sent his people a message beckoning them onward, promising deliverance and future salvation. Thus it was that adventurers from Azeroth flooded into the blasted landscape. The blood elves soon learned that the salvation promised by Prince Kael\u2019thas was a lie, that the\nprince pursued his own terrifying agenda. The paradise they believed Outland would be was instead a perilous realm of unending conflict.\"\n\"Rather than see the prince\u2019s plan reach fruition, Outland\u2019s heroes defeated him and then set out to dethrone Outland\u2019s malefic ruler: &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan the Betrayer&lt;/a&gt;. They began by overcoming one of Illidan\u2019s top lieutenants, the naga witch, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. The emboldened fighters then stormed the gates of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and confronted Illidan himself. They waged a fierce and desperate battle and ultimately killed the Betrayer, wresting Outland from his iron grip.\"\n\"The adventures of Outland proved particularly rewarding for the orcs of Azeroth, who reconnected with their ancestral forebears, the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, son of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the Mag\u2019har embody the lost heritage of the orcs and may yet herald a return to the Horde\u2019s former glory.\"\n\"For the draenei, the return to Outland provided a chance to reclaim regions of their former home, face old enemies, and learn at last the fate of those left behind.\"\n\"Back on Azeroth, adventurers of all races converged on the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; to combat the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragons&lt;/a&gt;\u2019 assault on the timeways\u2013an assault that would have unraveled the very fabric of history.\"\n\"In &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the kingdom of the blood elves, antagonists from the past reemerged. The troll warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, embittered by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s\u2019 abandonment during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde\u2019s recent acceptance of blood elves into its ranks, turned against his former allies. Within the walled fortress of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, Zul\u2019jin directed the &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Hex Lord Malacrass&lt;/a&gt; to infuse the spirits of ancient animal gods into living troll warriors.\"\n\"Once again, intrepid heroes stepped in to conquer the fearsome troll army. Yet despite the bloodshed in the elven kingdom, it was in the heart of Quel\u2019Thalas that hope shone brightest after a hard-fought battle at the site of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Having survived his defeat in Outland, Kael\u2019thas had returned to the ruins of the elves\u2019 ancient fount of power, the Sunwell. There he did the unthinkable, openly siding with the demonic Burning Legion, which sought to usher the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; into the world through the fountain\u2019s magical depths.\"\n\"Horde and Alliance forces banded together in the face of impossible odds and vanquished Kil\u2019jaeden, once again protecting Azeroth from the Legion\u2019s Burning Crusade. In the aftermath of victory, the draenei prophet &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; sanctified the legendary Sunwell using the power of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. With the Sunwell\u2019s rebirth, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s \u2013 an order of blood elf &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s who once wielded the Light by force\u2013have decided instead to embrace it and to forge for themselves a new identity as they lead their people into a more promising future. This future may soon be thrown into question, however, for an immensely powerful, dark, and brooding presence awakens in the snowy wastes of a distant land...\"\nNorthrend: The Roof of the World.\n\"Long before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world, a malign insectoid race known as the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt; fought bitterly against the savage trolls. In time the troll armies split the aqir empire in half. The aqiri armies that fled to the northern wastes founded the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually their race came to be known as &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s.\"\n\"The nerubians discovered traces of another civilization in the north as well: the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, who were descended from giants. Yet the vrykul\u2019s fortresses and villages lay silent and deserted while the barbaric race slumbered beneath the earth.\"\n\"In the wake of the Sundering the frozen north split off into a separate continent called Northrend. Though isolated from the rest of the world, the nerubian empire thrived... until the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Commanded by the demon lord Kil\u2019jaeden to spread a plague of undeath among the mortal races, the Lich King was granted immense power, yet locked within an icy cask that came to be called the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Over the next several years the nerubians fell to the Lich King\u2019s wrath. The events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; played out, and in their aftermath, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; shattered the Frozen Throne and merged with the Lich King.\"\n\"As the Lich King sat once more in quiet reflection, an eerie stillness settled over his macabre fortress of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Even so, life stubbornly pressed on across the primordial continent.\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Proto-dragon\"&gt;Proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, the long-forgotten forbears of the dragon species, emerged from the mists of the north. Steadfast races such as the bovine &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and the walrus-like &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; survived in the face of adversity. Even the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s continued to carve out an existence in the inhospitable realm.\"\n\"Just as life on Northrend seemed to reach a tenuous equilibrium, the Lich King stirred from his Frozen Throne and sent his Scourge minions to swarm across the land, destroying everything and everyone in their path. The slumbering vrykul awakened soon after, pouring from the ancient fortress of &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, bent on conquest.\"\n\"The blue &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, also emerged from his long seclusion, launching a merciless war against mortal practitioners of arcane magic. This conflict has raised the red dragonflight\u2019s ire and sown widespread chaos.\"\n\"The Horde and Alliance have both responded to the threat of the Scourge, establishing bases in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. Both factions amass their armies even now, all too aware that the final confrontation with the Lich King is about to begin. And failure could mean the end of life for all of Azeroth.\""}

As C'Thun incited the qiraji to frenzy, both the Alliance and Horde prepared for a massive &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;war effort&lt;/a&gt;. A mixed force of Alliance and Horde soldiers, dubbed the &lt;a href=\"Might%20of%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Might of Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, opened the gates of Ahn'Qiraj under the command of the indomitable orc &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.

Expeditions from the Horde and Alliance, reinforced by their new &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; allies, passed through the gateway to &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;stop&lt;/a&gt; the invasion at its source. On Outland's desiccated &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance discovered several of their heroes who had crossed through the portal many years before, while the Horde made contact with the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; - 'uncorrupted' orcs who had not participated in their race's &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;original invasion&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth. The expedition into Outland dragged Horde and Alliance armies further into conflict with the agents of the Legion and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;lieutenants&lt;/a&gt; of Illidan Stormrage, who had claimed the shattered realm for his own.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%202.1.0\"&gt;The Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in May 2007 | World of Warcraft Patch 2.1\nIn his quest to reign over all of Outland, Illidan the Betrayer had established a mighty stronghold for his forces within the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a former draenei citadel. Yet his influence began to wane after the defeat of his most trusted lieutenants, including the traitorous former leader of the blood elves, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting window of opportunity permitted &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt;, an elder &lt;a href=\"sage\"&gt;sage&lt;/a&gt; of devolved draenei known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, to rebel against the self-styled \"Lord of Outland.\" Along with Illidan's former jailor, the stoic night elf &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Akama helped a group of heroes infiltrate Illidan's seat of power and put an end to the Betrayer's reign once and for all.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;The Gods of Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in November 2007 | World of Warcraft Patch 2.3\nFollowing years of battles alongside the old Horde, the troll warlord &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; retired to the city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls, where he called upon mysterious dark powers to rebuild his army. While the eyes of Azeroth focused on the fight against the Burning Legion and the expedition to Outland, treasure-seekers invaded Zul'Aman, rekindling Zul'jin's hatred of the outside world - particularly the high elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing that these newly christened \"blood elves\" had become part of the Horde in his absence, the infuriated Zul'jin declared war on both Horde and Alliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.0\"&gt;Fury of the Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in November 2007 | World of Warcraft Patch 2.3\nFresh from his defeat in Outland, Kael'thas Sunstrider returned to the blood elf city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than lead his people to glory as he had promised, the disgraced prince betrayed them. Kael'thas plotted to use the legendary &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, source of the blood elves' magical power, to summon the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth. Aided by a joint task force of blood elves and draenei, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, Horde and Alliance heroes narrowly &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;stopped&lt;/a&gt; both Kael'thas and Kil'jaeden, purifying the Sunwell with the help of the draenei &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;.\nPatch Trailer.\nReleased in November 2008 | PC / Mac Expansion Set\nIn the wake of the Sunwell's purification, a period of suspicious quiet had swept over the world. As if on cue, the undead Scourge launched a &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;massive assault&lt;/a&gt; against the cities and &lt;a href=\"Settlement%23Village/Town\"&gt;towns&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, this time extending its reach far beyond the Eastern Kingdoms. Under pressure to respond with a full army, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Thrall deployed an &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;expedition force&lt;/a&gt; to Northrend led by Overlord &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the missing human king Varian Wrynn at last returned to Stormwind City and reclaimed his crown. He sent an equally &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;powerful Alliance army&lt;/a&gt;, commanded by Bolvar Fordragon, to &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; the Lich King\u2014and any Horde forces who would stand in their way.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.1.0\"&gt;Secrets of Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in April 2009 | World of Warcraft Patch 3.1\nThe march of Horde and Alliance armies through Northrend led to a number of victories, but these successes paled before a discovery made by the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;explorer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; within the ancient titan complex of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. This mysterious fortress had long served as the prison of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, a being of unfathomable evil whose influence had spread into the continent of Northrend itself. With Brann's assistance, small bands of Alliance and Horde champions infiltrated Ulduar to confront Yogg-Saron, who blasted the invaders with cryptic visions: the millennia-old creation of an artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, the assassination of Stormwind's King Llane, and a glimpse of the Lich King's future.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;Call of the Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in August 2009 | World of Warcraft Patch 3.2\nIn preparation for the final offensive against the Lich King, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a union of holy warriors from the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the Argent Dawn\u2014assembled a base near &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to gather resources and identify the champions who would serve at the vanguard of their army. Highlord &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; organized a &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;tournament&lt;/a&gt; to test potential heroes of the Horde and the Alliance, but agents of the Scourge quickly emerged to sabotage the event. The undead attack culminated with the appearance of the monstrous &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to exterminate Tirion's elite force before it could be assembled.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%203.3.0\"&gt;Fall of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in December 2009 | World of Warcraft Patch 3.3\nAs the final battle against the Lich King approached, the human sorceress &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the Banshee Queen Sylvanas Windrunner journeyed to the icy heart of Northrend. Both had come for different reasons: Jaina hoped to discover whether a part of her former friend and lover, Arthas Menethil, still lived; Sylvanas longed to take revenge on her old enemy. With the aid of these two heroes, Azeroth's champions stormed Icecrown Citadel and vanquished the Lich King's minions. Their confrontation with the Lich King involved thousands of souls consumed by Arthas's blade, &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Arthas was slain, and the heroes who triumphed over him learned a chilling truth about the existence of the undead Scourge.\nPatch Trailer.\nReleased in December 2010 | PC / Mac Expansion Set\nThe victorious Northrend expeditions returned home to find all of Azeroth shaken by erratic &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; forces. This &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; preceded the return of the maddened &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; Deathwing the Destroyer, who erupted from his lair in the bowels of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;shattering&lt;/a&gt; Azeroth in the process.

The Zandalari restored the fallen cities of Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman, and begun to conduct bloody raids on territories that had once been \"theirs.\" The burgeoning troll force hoped to lead a great war against the other races of Azeroth, but the honorable &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; stood against their murderous agenda, and recruited champions from both the Horde and the Alliance to &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;invade the ancient cities&lt;/a&gt; and stop the onslaught.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%204.2.0\"&gt;Rage of the Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in June 2011 | World of Warcraft Patch 4.2\nAfter a ferocious series of battles, Azeroth's heroes banished Ragnaros the Firelord and his elemental minions from Mount Hyjal. Yet, threats to Hyjal persisted, including &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;traitorous druids&lt;/a&gt; who had abandoned their allies and joined forces with the elementals. Fearing another elemental invasion, the defenders of Azeroth made a daring assault into Ragnaros' blazing realm: the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. Among the seething flames of this elemental domain, Ragnaros was at his most powerful; only the greatest champions of the Horde and the Alliance, aided by &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic champions like &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, could dare hope to defeat the Firelord.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%204.3.0\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in November 2011 | World of Warcraft Patch 4.3\nAt the peak of his insanity, Deathwing the Destroyer fought to drive the world into twilight - a devastated future bereft of all life. The Dragon Soul, a powerful artifact lost in the past, was the only weapon capable of truly stopping Deathwing, and so the guardians of Azeroth - the Dragon Aspects - sent a number of valiant heroes racing through time to retrieve it. Despite being attacked by the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; as they travelled the &lt;a href=\"Alternate%20timeline\"&gt;timeways&lt;/a&gt;, the champions returned the artifact to the present and delivered it to the wise shaman Thrall. With his aid, the Dragon Soul was deployed against the Destroyer during a &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;brutal battle&lt;/a&gt; that began in Azeroth's skies and continued into the roiling heart of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the world. Through the combined efforts of the Aspects and their allies, the &lt;a href=\"madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;madness of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; was finally brought to an end.\nPatch Trailer.\nReleased in September 2012 | PC / Mac Expansion Set\nWith Deathwing's menace ended, Warchief Garrosh Hellscream seized the opportunity to strike at the Alliance and expand the Horde's territory on Kalimdor. His assault completely obliterated the human city of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, causing world-wide violence between the factions to erupt anew. A destructive naval skirmish left Alliance and Horde forces washed ashore on the fog-shrouded island of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, which had appeared in the open sea, defying modern maps and charts. As both warring factions established footholds on the resource-rich continent, they made contact with the noble &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, one of its most prolific peoples. This ancient race worked with the Alliance and Horde in the hopes of dispersing the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;: dark, ephemeral beings roused from beneath Pandaria by the bloody conflict.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1.0\"&gt;Landfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in November 2012 | World of Warcraft Patch 5.1\nThe conflict between the Horde and the Alliance entered a bloody new chapter in Pandaria. As the two factions' armies clashed on the shores of the continent, Warchief Garrosh Hellscream dispatched elite troops to find the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an ancient &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; artifact capable of endowing his soldiers with unimaginable power. Garrosh's bold and reckless actions, however, had dire consequences for the Horde, including the outbreak of violence against the Darkspear trolls and the expulsion of the blood elves from the once-neutral &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Although Garrosh claimed the bell, Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance secret &lt;a href=\"agent\"&gt;agent&lt;/a&gt;s of closely tracked the warchief's every move. On the highest peaks of &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, the brave prince thwarted Garrosh's plans, leading to the fabled mogu artifact's destruction.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.2.0\"&gt;The Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in March 2013 | World of Warcraft Patch 5.2\nWhile war between the Horde and the Alliance raged across Pandaria, the scattered mogu plotted a return to their terrible former glory. They rekindled their historical alliance with the Zandalari trolls, who managed to resurrect the tyrannical mogu emperor, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; the Thunder King, in the hopes of restoring mogu dominion over the continent. The valiant &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-pan&lt;/a&gt; rushed to suppress their enemies, creating a task force, the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Assault\"&gt;Shado-pan Assault&lt;/a&gt;, originally composed of pandaren warriors and later supported by heroes of the Horde and Alliance. These fearless champions strove to defeat the Thunder King, though they also simultaneously served their factions' interests on Pandaria. Jaina Proudmoore led the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor%20Offensive\"&gt;Kirin Tor Offensive&lt;/a&gt; on a quest to uncover the source of all mogu power (and keep it from the Horde), and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; took the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; in search of mighty mogu weaponry to aid a daring plan\u2026an insurrection against Warchief Garrosh Hellscream.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.3.0\"&gt;Escalation&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in May 2013 | World of Warcraft Patch 5.3\nGarrosh Hellscream's quest for power in Pandaria leads him to excavate part of the sacred &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; in search of a sinister artifact, a decision that puts the Horde at odds with the Shado-pan and other influential pandaren. Meanwhile, in the Horde capital of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Chieftain Vol'jin and the Darkspear trolls are declared traitors and hunted by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;, Hellscream's personal guard. Vol'jin's people retreat to Durotar and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to gather supplies and reinforcements for their counter-strike, relying on the support of their former warchief, Thrall, and a particularly tenuous pact with the Alliance, whose interest in ending Garrosh's rule may not bode entirely well for the Horde...\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in September 2013 | World of Warcraft Patch 5.4\nOrgrimmar, heart of orcish civilization on Azeroth, was set ablaze by &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;revolution&lt;/a&gt;. When Warchief Garrosh Hellscream revived the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;heart&lt;/a&gt; of the Old God &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y\u2019shaarj&lt;/a&gt; to empower his army, he desecrated Pandaria\u2019s sacred Vale of Eternal Blossoms. This affront, alongside Garrosh\u2019s increasingly dangerous conquests, led Horde rebels and Alliance stalwarts to &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;assail the great walls of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to dethrone the tyrant before he ravaged an entire world. Alongside Thrall, champions of the Horde and Alliance fought their way to the Warchief\u2019s &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;lair beneath the city&lt;/a&gt;, where the battle grew so desperate that Garrosh absorbed the energies of the Old God to halt his downfall. It was not enough. At the behest of King Varian Wrynn, a defeated Garrosh was brought to trial before the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; of Pandaria \u2013 but the scars of his rule will bleed for some time.\nPatch Trailer.\nReleased in November 2014 | PC / Mac Expansion Set\nGarrosh Hellscream escaped justice with the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, eventually finding himself in an in the time before the original Horde had come to Azeroth. Hungry for vengeance, Garrosh provided his father, , with the technology to assemble his ideal army\u2014the conquering force called the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Grommash was quick to unite Draenor's orcish &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s under his banner, and the clan leaders became the Iron Horde's warlords. Among them were the bloodthirsty , the cunning , the elder shaman , and the fearless . The Iron Horde took command of several vital locations on Draenor, subjugated the ogre city of &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;, and built massive fortifications like &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Foundry\"&gt;Blackrock Foundry&lt;/a&gt; to outfit the warlords' armies. Once the Iron Horde had Draenor in its grasp, the orcs &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Incursion\"&gt;invaded Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the Dark Portal, razed &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and seized control of &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt;. In retaliation, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; assembled the champions of the Alliance and the Horde, leading them through the portal to &lt;a href=\"War%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;stop&lt;/a&gt; the Iron Horde on Draenor once and for all. Garrosh ultimately met his end at Thrall's hands, and after an exhausting campaign, the heroes of Azeroth were able to defeat most of the Iron Horde's warlords. Khadgar's offensive dealt a crushing blow to the Iron Horde. Grommash's failure to give his warriors the victory he had promised bred dissent within the ranks, affording the warlock the opportunity to usurp the Iron Horde and summon the demonic Burning Legion to Draenor...\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%206.2.0\"&gt;Fury of Hellfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in June 2015 | World of Warcraft Patch 6.2\nThe warlock Gul\u2019dan persuaded the Iron Horde's remaining leaders\u2014 who were enduring crushing defeats against the champions of Azeroth\u2014to serve the Burning Legion. Their servitude, they believed, would give them one last chance to turn the tide of battle. Only Grommash Hellscream proved difficult to break, and so Gul\u2019dan imprisoned him, hoping to make an example out of the former warchief. Gul\u2019dan took control of , intending to use it as a staging area for the Legion to invade Draenor. He then proceeded to summon the demon lord Archimonde. Meanwhile, the heroes of Azeroth assaulted the citadel\u2019s gates, invading from both land and sea. Aided by Khadgar, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and a freed Grommash, Azeroth\u2019s champions battled their way through the horrors unleashed within Hellfire Citadel. After a harrowing struggle that nearly destroyed Draenor, the heroes were able to cast down Archimonde. Yet, even as he fell, the demon hurled the treacherous Gul\u2019dan through a portal. His pact with the Legion was far from being fulfilled.\nPatch Trailer.\nReleased in August 2016 | PC / Mac Expansion Set\nFollowing the battle for Draenor, the deceitful Gul\u2019dan found himself on Azeroth. Gul\u2019dan, tormented by whispers of Kil\u2019jaeden the Deceiver, opened the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and with it a gateway for the Burning Legion to &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;invade Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The warlock bent the denizens of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to his will, including the ancient &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and their leader, Grand Magistrix &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance and the Horde &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;assaulted&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to preemptively stop Gul\u2019dan and the Legion\u2019s forces. Their efforts ultimately failed, costing High King Varian Wrynn and Warchief Vol\u2019jin their lives. A desperate effort by Archmage Khadgar to unite the shattered factions ultimately resulted in the recovery of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the only instruments capable of sealing the Tomb once more. As the dwellers of the Broken Isles are rescued from the Legion\u2019s grasp, the forces of the Alliance and the Horde close in on The &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Gul\u2019dan\u2019s base of operations, poised to end the warlock\u2019s menace once and for all\u2026\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%207.1.0\"&gt;Return to Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in October 2016 | World of Warcraft Patch 7.1\nAs conflict raged across the Broken Isles, the Burning Legion focused its efforts on &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh's ancient seat of power, hoping to find anything they could use to keep the tide of battle moving in their favor. Khadgar and a small band of heroes were successful in stopping this menace, which gave the forces still fighting on the Isles the momentum they needed to strike. Heroes, aided by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, led an &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;insurrection against Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, regent of the ancient city of Suramar. With the city liberated, the heroes then struck at The Nighthold\u2014ending Gul'dan's reign of terror at last. Azeroth's champions now possess the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman\u2019Thul&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and the power they need to close the Tomb of Sargeras forever.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%207.2.0\"&gt;The Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in March 2017 | World of Warcraft Patch 7.2\nThough Gul'dan was defeated at the Nighthold, and the heroes of the Alliance and the Horde recruited new allies to their cause\u2014including Illidan Stormrage\u2014the Legion's menace was far from over. Kil'jaeden the Deceiver, one of Sargeras' most trusted lieutenants, bolstered the Legion's defenses at the Broken Shore, hoping to use the Tomb of Sargeras and the power within it to end all life on Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; , a special force of Azeroth's greatest heroes, fought their way into the Tomb--and found that the Deceiver had nearly accomplished his goal. Kil'jaeden transported the heroes to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-wrought Legion homeworld, intent on exterminating them all, but the &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;Eredar&lt;/a&gt; Lord met his end at the hands of Khadgar, Velen, Illidan and Azeroth's champions. To save those on Argus and to seize an opportunity to fight the Legion on his terms, Illidan did the unthinkable\u2014he used a device known as the &lt;a href=\"%3ASargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;:Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; to open a rift that brought the worlds of Argus and Azeroth together. The Alliance and the Horde are now at a crossroads. They must strike at Argus with all of their might, or risk destruction by the persistent threat of the Legion.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%207.3.0\"&gt;Shadows of Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in August 2017 | World of Warcraft Patch 7.3\nLed by Prophet Velen, the champions of Azeroth embarked on a journey to the shattered world of Argus, home of the demonic Burning Legion, to put an end to their crusade against life. There, they joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a host of &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged&lt;/a&gt; warriors who spent millenia fighting the Legion across the stars, and whose ranks included the legendary &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; Turalyon and &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;-captain &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Together with the champions of Azeroth, the Army of the Light mustered their scattered forces and embarked on a desperate quest to storm the Legion\u2019s seat of power: &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;. There, the heroes discovered that the fallen titan Sargeras had corrupted not only the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; of the world of Argus, but the titan &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; as well. After a tremendous struggle, the heroes of Azeroth defeated the soul of Argus and freed the titans, who imprisoned Sargeras for his transgressions\u2014and appointed Illidan Stormrage as his jailor. As a last act of defiance, the Dark Titan plunged his &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; into Azeroth, inflicting a deep wound in the planet that would leave her fate uncertain...\nPatch Trailer.\nReleased in August 2018 | World of Warcraft Expansion\nThe wounds inflicted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; the Dark Titan on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; brought forth a volatile substance known as &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the blood of Azeroth herself. Tensions escalated between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as both factions came to realize the true power of Azerite, igniting a full-scale war leading to the fall of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeakened and in need of new allies, the Alliance and the Horde called upon their greatest &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; to bolster their ranks. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; traveled to her home kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to bring them once more into the Alliance. She found squabbling nobles and a resentful people, united only in their contempt for Jaina's past actions. Meanwhile, the Horde rescued the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; princess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt;. Talanji worked to convince the Zandalari trolls to aid the Horde, though her father\u2014&lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;\u2014initially refused to listen. Both factions' diplomatic efforts were successful in building trust, however, and their war campaigns alongside new allies led to new footholds being established in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and Kul Tiras. \nUnited in arms with new allies, the Alliance and the Horde stand once more upon the shores of war, as the tides of vengeance loom on the horizon... \n&lt;a href=\"Patch%208.1.0\"&gt;Tides of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in December 2018 | World of Warcraft Content Update\nLord Admiral Jaina Proudmoore led Alliance forces on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor%20%28pyramid%29\"&gt;Dazar\u2019alor&lt;/a&gt;. They disabled most of the Zandalari fleet with clandestine explosives and distracted the Horde\u2019s armies in the swamplands of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the Horde\u2019s champions discovered the deception, the Alliance had already reached the steps of Dazar\u2019alor. The ruler of Zandalar, King Rastakhan, fought to the death rather than surrender his ancient kingdom. Though their attack dealt a crippling blow to the Zandalari, the Alliance was forced to retreat as the Horde took back the city and mortally wounded &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;High Tinker Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;.\nDetermined to regain the upper hand in the war, Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner plotted to undermine the Alliance from within. She revealed a plan to twist the mind of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Jaina's long dead brother, newly raised into undeath\u2014and unleash him as a weapon against his family. &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; refused to permit Sylvanas's warped scheme to unfold, so he chose to free Derek and return him to Jaina. When his defiance was discovered, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; chieftain was imprisoned as a traitor.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; invaders assaulted the coastlines of Kul Tiras and Zandalar in increasing numbers. Repelling those attacks led Azeroth's champions to rediscover a lost artifact: &lt;a href=\"%3AXal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;:Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The dagger's maddening whispers drew a band of heroes into the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Crucible of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, where dark forces gathered to awaken the long-imprisoned Old God, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. While the threat appeared to be contained, N'Zoth's numberless servants will not rest until their master rises once again...\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%208.2.0\"&gt;Rise of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in June 2019 | World of Warcraft Content Update\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner ordered &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; to set sail with the remnants of the Horde fleet. Using Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire as a compass, the Horde hoped to turn the war in their favor. The Alliance fleet engaged in pursuit, and both groups were ambushed by the naga as the sea opened beneath them. Trapped in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient home of the naga, both factions were met by an ancient enemy: &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of the naga and servant of the Old God N'Zoth.\nMeanwhile, Sylvanas Windrunner planned to execute Baine Bloodhoof for freeing Jaina Proudmoore's risen brother Derek. Unbeknownst to her, Alliance and Horde forces were already on route to rescue the tauren chieftain. Upon meeting on the battlefield, the outfits led by Thrall and Jaina realized that only by working together they could hope to destabilize Sylvanas's command over the Horde, and decided to join forces.\nAs Queen Azshara continued to dare those stranded in Nazjatar to face her, the champions learned from &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; that a titan console was keeping N'Zoth prisoner within the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;. As they fought their way through the Palace, the heroes discovered too late that it was a trap\u2014though Queen Azshara was defeated, she successfully tricked the heroes into activating the console, releasing N'Zoth from his imprisonment. The Old God retrieved Queen Azshara and disappeared into the shadows, ready to once more unleash his terrifying might upon Azeroth. Left with no choice but to join forces completely against this new threat, the Alliance and the Horde headed into battle... but first, Sylvanas had to be stopped.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%208.3.0\"&gt;Visions of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nReleased in January 2020 | World of Warcraft Content Update\nFreed at long last from his &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;titan-wrought prison&lt;/a&gt;, the Old God &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; returned to his seat of power\u2014&lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha%2C%20the%20Waking%20City\"&gt;Ny'alotha, the Waking City&lt;/a&gt;. There he gathered his forces and prepared to unleash a new age of madness upon the mortal world.\nElsewhere in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a different battle raged on. &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, after rescuing &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, recruited assistance from &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who mustered the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; dissidents. Saurfang's was a battle for honor, for the very soul of the Horde. The combined army traveled to the gates of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; where Saurfang challenged &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, a duel for the title of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Empowered by a mysterious force, Sylvanas struck a lethal blow to the old soldier after proclaiming that \"the Horde is nothing\". She discarded the mantle of Warchief and left Orgrimmar, losing support from all but a few clandestine loyalists.\nWith the armies of both the Horde and Alliance depleted from the long war, N'Zoth sensed the perfect time to strike. As his shadowy servants assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, the heroes of Azeroth were aided by the return of &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;. The black dragon provided the means to resist the Old God's seductive promises of power and his nightmarish visions of a horrific future. The heroes of Azeroth stormed Ny'alotha and fought through the twisted armies of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, they channeled the full power of the Forge of Origination through the Heart of Azeroth, defeating N'Zoth and purging his corruption from the world. \nThe leaders of the Horde and Alliance signed a treaty to bring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; to an end. The Battle for Azeroth was over, but the whereabouts of Sylvanas were still unknown...\nVisions of N'Zoth Trailer.\nReleased in November 2020 | World of Warcraft Expansion\nLeaving &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; behind, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. There she defeated the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, and claimed possession of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. With a single act of destruction, Sylvanas ripped open the way to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a realm of infinite afterlives never before seen by the living.\nIn a further act of treachery, the Banshee Queen sent her agents to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. The heroes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; pursued Sylvanas into the Shadowlands only to find themselves trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, a prison for the vilest, most irredeemable souls in existence ruled by Sylvanas's ally, the &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. Escaping was no easy feat, but the heroes made their way to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, the Eternal City\u2014the arrival point for all souls who enter the Shadowlands. There they discovered that the impassive &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for judging souls and sending them to their final destination, had gone dormant, unable to discharge her duties. Furthermore, the four Shadowlands covenants were in disarray, deprived of souls and starving for a crucial resource vital to their existence: &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe heroes of Azeroth fought to rebuild the strength of the covenants as they attempted to thwart Sylvanas's plan and rescue their allies from the Jailer's stronghold: &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. A traitor was revealed among the covenants\u2014&lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, the Sire of &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;. Denathrius had been hoarding anima to empower his true ally, the Jailer. Though the Sire was defeated atop his seat of power, &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;Castle Nathria&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas and the Jailer had already set their plan in motion: to dominate Anduin Wrynn and use him as a weapon to further their nefarious plans."}

He does not know what it is to get older and weaker.\nCompletion.\nShu's desires are not so different from our own. He does not want to be alone. Unwanted, unloved. He longs to be needed, and to share his life with others.\nKnowing that, earning his trust is not terribly difficult. He just wants company.\nNotes.\nPick up &lt;a href=\"The%20Sting%20of%20Learning\"&gt;The Sting of Learning&lt;/a&gt; before heading out. Back down the ramp, then take a left, heading southeast, and start killing water pincers. After killing six, keep heading southeast into the deep pool with &lt;a href=\"Barbed%20Ray\"&gt;Barbed Ray&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Fang-she\"&gt;Fang-she&lt;/a&gt;, a named &lt;a href=\"sea%20serpent\"&gt;sea serpent&lt;/a&gt;.

Near the middle of one of the rooms, you find a &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Archaeologist\"&gt;Dying Archaeologist&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe archaeologist tells you that a &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Artifact%20%28Searing%20Gorge%29\"&gt;Mysterious Artifact (Searing Gorge)&lt;/a&gt; guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; is being used to control the expedition members, and that placing it on the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Suntara\"&gt;Altar of Suntara&lt;/a&gt; will break the control.\nYou find the artifact in a pool of lava above &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Point\"&gt;Thorium Point&lt;/a&gt;, guarded by Twilight cultists. Dead cultists don't bother you, and some adroit leaping nets you the artifact without too much contact with the lava itself.\n... but no sooner is the artifact placed on the altar (after yet another trip down into the Slag Pit) when who should appear but Dorius, risen from the dead and calling himself &lt;a href=\"Lathoric%20the%20Black\"&gt;Lathoric the Black&lt;/a&gt;. He monologues about how &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; directed him to build &lt;a href=\"Obsidion\"&gt;Obsidion&lt;/a&gt;, a golem, to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile destroying the power of the Blackrock orcs might be laudable, Dorius is clearly in the grip of even more evil and powerful forces. It takes considerable effort, but you manage to defeat both Lathoric and Obsidion, and return significant parts of both to Thorius."}

For exploration, just send a &lt;a href=\"Grunt%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Grunt&lt;/a&gt; to roam around, but be careful as he will most likely encounter enemy units. You should train several &lt;a href=\"Peon%20%28Warcraft%20I%29\"&gt;Peons&lt;/a&gt; to speed up the process of harvesting. You will need to harvest lumber, so send one of your Peons to the south to do this. Occasionally, Archers or Footmen will come around to the your base and attack, so you should have a few Grunts on standby (you start with three).

Seems &lt;a href=\"Belgrom%20Rockmaul\"&gt;Belgrom&lt;/a&gt; thinks those monsters are a threat. He wants them pushed back into whatever depths they crawled up out of.\nI guess killing the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; sent by the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; wasn't enough\u2014now I have to send a half-dead war party into another battle. We won't be able to do it ourselves; not while we're in this condition. The &lt;a href=\"Rustmaul%20Dig%20Site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;'s to the south of here. There shouldn't be anymore dwarves to deal with. Feel up to wielding a blade or staff and doing your part to aid us?\nRewards.\nYou will receive:\nProgress.\nWith the amount of travelers heading out to the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Flats&lt;/a&gt; for those races, I'm sure we can convince enough adventure seekers to help push back those insects. My party and I won't be able to leave until we do.\nCompletion.\nHa! That ichor you're covered in actually makes you prettier, &lt;name&gt;! It certainly does make you reek at the same time though. Don't stand too close to the &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt;; you'll either start a stampede or cause them to go into heat.\nI think my companions would agree that your smell alone is proof you've done your part to help us against those insect creatures. Thank you, &lt;name&gt;.\nNotes.\nThis quest can be quite difficult, as the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; have some special aggro rules that can wipe you out quick if you aren't aware of them. First of all, the area with the silithid is in the south-western part of the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Flats\"&gt;Shimmering Flats&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Rustmaul%20Dig%20Site\"&gt;Rustmaul Dig Site&lt;/a&gt;, around coordinates (70,83). Here is some info about the different beasties, and hints for defeating them:\n&lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Searcher\"&gt;Silithid Searcher&lt;/a&gt;: These ones seem to be the easiest, as they don't seem to cause other mobs to aggro you like some of the other types. They are also found outside the cave, unlike the &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Invader\"&gt;Silithid Invader&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Invader\"&gt;Silithid Invader&lt;/a&gt;: If close to other mobs and low on health, these have been known to cause other mobs to aggro. The other problem with them is that they are only found inside the cave, where drones are plentiful and dangerous. Sometimes there will only be a few of them in there, kill some drones and more invaders will appear.\n&lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Hive%20Drone\"&gt;Silithid Hive Drone&lt;/a&gt;: These are the most dangerous. Though normally non-hostile, if attacked these mobs aggro everything around them in a surprisingly wide radius. It's best to pull these as far away from other mobs as possible before engaging. They also seem to send out another aggro call when low on health.\nYou will pick up a &lt;a href=\"Cracked%20Silithid%20Carapace\"&gt;Cracked Silithid Carapace&lt;/a&gt; from the first &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; you kill, which begins the quest &lt;a href=\"Parts%20of%20the%20Swarm\"&gt;Parts of the Swarm&lt;/a&gt; - you can complete that quest along with this one.\nOnce you have killed all the necessary monsters and have the parts you need for &lt;a href=\"Parts%20of%20the%20Swarm\"&gt;Parts of the Swarm&lt;/a&gt;, head back to &lt;a href=\"Moktar%20Krin\"&gt;Moktar Krin&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ironstone%20Camp\"&gt;Ironstone Camp&lt;/a&gt; (coordinates (67,63))."}

But\nthey must have been \"quite\" valuable to him, as not only does it loosen his\ntongue, he is willing to give you a bonus.\nIt seems that yes, Lathrai did sell &lt;a href=\"Empoor\"&gt;Empoor&lt;/a&gt; several boxes of exotic\nengineering parts a month back, and the Empoor was delivering them to\nsomeone at &lt;a href=\"Tuurem\"&gt;Tuurem&lt;/a&gt;. He suggests that perhaps some of the parts might still\nbe there somewhere.\nOff you go, to poke around Tuurem. Sure enough, after a good bit of poking\naround the ruined huts, you find a box of engineering parts. And a suprise!\nThere's a blood elf courier guarding it! The courier objects to your taking\nthe parts, but you refuse to take 'no' for an answer.\nYou return to Earthbinder Tavgren with the parts, but he has no more idea\nwhat they are for than you do. However, he knows who to talk to.\nAct 3: The Mana Bomb.\n&lt;a href=\"Earthbinder%20Tavgren\"&gt;Earthbinder Tavgren&lt;/a&gt; sends you to a nearby stronghold, to talk to someone\nbetter connected than he is. (A local spymaster? Who can say?)\nAt the stronghold, your contact reveals that the Ethereals have been smuggling\nproscribed goods in from other dimensions. The box you brought,\nfor instance, has bomb parts.\nThis calls for immediate action. Your contact directs you to a scout\ncloser to &lt;a href=\"Firewing%20Point\"&gt;Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe scout directs you to disrupt the activity at &lt;a href=\"Firewing%20Point\"&gt;Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt; in the\nsimplest way possible - kill a good many of them. You wreak appropriately\nhigh levels of casualties among the blood elves. But while you are doing\nthat, you get a good look at what they are building in the courtyard.\nAnd it doesn't look good.\nKilling Blood Elves bent on bombing civilization may be a good thing, but\nthe important thing is making sure the bomb doesn't go off anywhere that you\ncare about. So the scout wants you to get &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Code\"&gt;The Final Code&lt;/a&gt; for the bomb\nfrom the overseer, and set the nasty thing off.\nYou find &lt;a href=\"Sharth%20Voldoun\"&gt;Sharth Voldoun&lt;/a&gt; at the top of one of the towers at\n&lt;a href=\"Firewing%20Point\"&gt;Firewing Point&lt;/a&gt;. You take the final code from his body, and go back down\nto the bomb. And shortly thereafter, the blood elves of Firewing Point find\nthemselves hoist by their own petard, quite literally.\nEven from some distance away, you feel the effects. But not so bad as had\nthey managed to complete it, and deliver it to a neighborhood near you.\nThe spymaster (or whatever) back at the stronghold is overjoyed.\nSinglehandedly, you've taken out the blood elf leader and destroyed the bomb\nthat was going to wipe out who knows how many people.\nYou finish celebrating your victory and set off again for the unfortunate\n&lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt;, where your quest started.\n&lt;a href=\"Earthbinder%20Tavgren\"&gt;Earthbinder Tavgren&lt;/a&gt; greets you, and listens to the tale of your exploits.\nStill, he can think of no reason the Blood Elves would want to obliterate\nthe Thicket. Perhaps &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Treelos\"&gt;Warden Treelos&lt;/a&gt; might know, but that answer is \nlocked away behind a wounded mind.\nRewards.\nAt the completion of &lt;a href=\"A%20Personal%20Favor\"&gt;A Personal Favor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Trader%20Lathrai\"&gt;Wind Trader Lathrai&lt;/a&gt;\noffers you your choice of\nAt the completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Final%20Code\"&gt;The Final Code&lt;/a&gt;, you are given your choice of\nAnd at the conclusion of &lt;a href=\"Letting%20Earthbinder%20Tavgren%20Know\"&gt;Letting Earthbinder Tavgren Know&lt;/a&gt;,\nyou get your choice from among\nSummary.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\nYou are first directed to &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Thicket\"&gt;Cenarion Thicket&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthbinder%20Tavgren\"&gt;Earthbinder Tavgren&lt;/a&gt;:\nThis is not a prerequisite.

Start running and the party will head up the steps.\nIf you run too far from the scenario area, the screen will fade to black and you'll get teleported back with the words:\nStage 2: Plan of Attack.\nAt the top, the Necrolord forces are already busy fighting Kel'Thuzad's minions. &lt;a href=\"Siege%20Artillery\"&gt;Siege Artillery&lt;/a&gt; is assaulting the walls while &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Steelskin\"&gt;Prime Steelskin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Watcher\"&gt;Mountain Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s are dueling &lt;a href=\"Necromancer%20Ritualist\"&gt;Necromancer Ritualist&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Aran\"&gt;Aran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Messana\"&gt;Messana&lt;/a&gt; are waiting by the side of the road, as is &lt;a href=\"Deathfang\"&gt;Deathfang&lt;/a&gt; (who can be petted). This scenario features a large number of &lt;a href=\"Lich%20%28The%20Third%20Fall%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad%29\"&gt;named lich mobs&lt;/a&gt; whose names are randomly chosen from \"Fel'endae\", \"Mal'endra\", \"Rathborne\", and \"Thultain\". Since there are only four possible names, there will oftentimes be multiple liches with the same name in each stage of the scenario. In this article, they will be referred to as just \"named liches\" for simplicity. In the second stage, two named liches are overseeing the battle from behind a barricade atop some stairs. \nWhen the player's party reaches the top, they are greeted by a huge projection of Kel'Thuzad.\nWhen you start heading to the stairs, the two Steelskins will automatically rush ahead, destroy the Barricades blocking the path, and start fighting their way up. A third Steelskin also spawns to accompany and assist you directly.\nThe stairs are guarded by two named liches, Necromancer Ritualists, and &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Thrall\"&gt;Bone Thrall&lt;/a&gt;s. At the top, Baroness Ninadar waits behind a wall of unattackable &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Bulwark\"&gt;Skeleton Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;s, continually raining frost magic down on the attackers. Help the two AI-controlled Steelskins clear a path to the top, at which point they'll instantly destroy the Skeleton Bulwarks, but Ninadar proceeds to freeze them in place. Aggro Ninadar with your third, as-of-yet unfrozen Steelskin companion:\nGet her to 10% and she teleports away:\nStage 3: Storm the Courtyard.\nDraka, Alexandros, Vashj, Balmedar, and two more Steelskins run up the stairs and into the &lt;a href=\"Grimoirium\"&gt;Grimoirium&lt;/a&gt; (labeled as just \"House of Rituals\" during the scenario).\nThe Grimoirium enters a phase in which it is filled with Ascended Liches, Necromancer Ritualists, and &lt;a href=\"Skeletal%20Defender\"&gt;Skeletal Defender&lt;/a&gt;s, many of which are fighting more Mountain Watchers and Steelskins. At the center of the area, an unattackable Ninadar is absorbing an immense amount of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from a huge crystal. To the southeast, down at the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Arcanum\"&gt;Prime Arcanum&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad and three named liches can be seen channeling around the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20Bone%20Pile\"&gt;Ritual Bone Pile&lt;/a&gt; inside a circular wall of magic.\nKill the quota of enemies. Draka's party will help, but will not kill them on their own.\nStage 4: The Final Lesson of Baroness Ninadar.\nNinadar finishes her channeling and turns into Empowered Baroness Ninadar. Draka and Alexandros run over and start fighting her while Balmedar sits back and watches.\nJoin the fight. Ninadar will periodically cast Ice Fall, whose projectiles create ice blocks where they land, followed by casting Shattering Lance:\nAt 10% the encounter ends:\nStage 5: The Prime Arcanum.\nDraka, Alexandros, and Balmedar (now wielding the Staff of the Primus) join the Steelskins fighting around the area. The &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Stabilization%20Crystal\"&gt;Shield Stabilization Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s are guarded by two named liches. Defeat the guards, then interact with the crystals to destroy them. Destroying the first:\nThe second crystal starts a cutscene, advancing the stage.\nStage 6: The Prime Arcanum.\nA cutscene begins the stage:\nOn the other side of the cutscene:\nDraven and Kael'thas have now joined the Necrolords in battle at the stairs up to the &lt;a href=\"Reagentry\"&gt;Reagentry&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href=\"Sinfall%20Legionnaire\"&gt;Sinfall Legionnaire&lt;/a&gt;s roam the skies above. Kael forgets how to cast spells and tries to punch his way to victory while Draven stands by and watches. Aggro the giant, who is still standing in the center of the Prime Arcanum:\nYou are granted a bonus ability:\nWhen the ability is used:\nStay out of the telegraphs, use the bonus ability on cooldown, and take out the Infernous.\nStage 7: The Third Fall of Kel'Thuzad.\nDraven runs down into the Prime Arcanum:\nSpeak to Draven:\nDraven grabs you and flies you to the necropolis, &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, Kael, Balmedar, Draka, Vashj, and Alexandros stand ready to face Kel'Thuzad, who is floating next to the incapacitated Margrave Sin'dane with the &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;:Medallion of Dominion&lt;/a&gt; on his chest.

Remember that you can only walk on a particular type of tile safely; the type for the day is shown on a tile at the bottom of the entrance ramp into Guo-Lai Halls, or careful observation will reveal which type forms a path to the opposite door. Enter the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Serpent\"&gt;Hall of the Serpent&lt;/a&gt; and head down the stairs, moving quickly around both corners to avoid the Jade Smash from the Jade Sentinels. Head down the lower level to reach , a cloud serpent with 4.7 million health and the following abilities:\nMilau is rooted in one of two spots for the entire duration of the fight and so does not need to be normally tanked. Adventurers attempting the encounter must either stay within Milau's hitbox or on the lower level of the area or it will cast Lightning Pool underneath them, which will one-shot anything that stands in it. Melee players are thus going to be hugging Milau's hitbox for the entire fight minus the 66/33% Lightning Sweeps.\nRanged players must dodge Lightning Breath casts\u2014Milau will randomly face one direction when starting the cast and breathe in that general direction. A large area of the ground is charged with lightning and ticks for ~42,000 damage a second. The cast time is long enough to get out of the area of effect if Milau targets an adventurer's direction specifically. Roughly three pools will be up concurrently and if unlucky, nearly the entire floor will be inacessible. Run away from the boss area toward the steps leading back up to the Hall of Tiles to get out of the damage range and take the opportunity to heal up.\nAt 66/33%, Milau will fly down from the high position to the center of the lower area and do a Lightning Sweep. This sucks all enemies to its position and will do a large (but not one-shottable) amount of damage to all players within ~50 yards or so once the 9-second cast is complete. Melee players should immediately start running back to the cloud serpent's upstairs spot to be in position once the Lightning Sweep is done.\nIt is entirely possible to complete the encounter without taking a single point of damage. It's a requirement for &lt;a href=\"One%20Step%20at%20a%20Time\"&gt;One Step at a Time&lt;/a&gt;!\nPatch 5.4.\nThe &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; have invaded the Vale in even greater numbers. This has resulted in many mogu mobs being located where once there were none (including Milau's room). Also, prior to 5.4, the Lightning Pool ability was infamous for rarely targeting where the player actually stood. This is no longer the case.\nBecause of the above changes, it's much more important now to bring along a friend if you are working towards the achievement."}

If you're worthy.\nNotes.\nUnlocking the Thunder Forges takes place in the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder%20storyline%23Take%20the%20Forge\"&gt;fourth stage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder%20storyline\"&gt;Isle of Thunder storyline&lt;/a&gt;, after completing &lt;a href=\"To%20the%20Skies%21%20%28quest%29\"&gt;To the Skies! (quest)&lt;/a&gt;. Players must have completed To the Skies! and all previous solo scenarios in order to see Wrathion at the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Forges\"&gt;Thunder Forges&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn accept:\nAnduin follows up, depending on the faction:\nHead to the base of the stair between &lt;a href=\"Metal%20Lord%20Mono-Han\"&gt;Metal Lord Mono-Han&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Itoka\"&gt;Itoka&lt;/a&gt; at in the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Forges\"&gt;Thunder Forges&lt;/a&gt; and speak to Wrathion to begin the solo scenario \"The Thunder Forge\".\nAs in the Isle of Thunder storyline, this scenario can only be completed once, so it is documented here.\nStage 1: Speak with Wrathion.\nWalk forward a few yards to speak with Wrathion:\nStage 2: Forged from Trillium.\nGo to the nearby Mogu Crucible and click it to proceed.\nStage 3: Activate the Thunder Forge.\nAt the start of this stage three &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; appear, a &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Defender\"&gt;Shado-Pan Defender&lt;/a&gt; leading two Shado-Pan Warriors, jumping down from the wall along with the mogu.\nSeveral waves of mogu will appear as Wrathion charges up the device, occasionally the forge will send out a buff.\nWhen near its full charge:\nWhen the charge is at 100% &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Vul%27kon\"&gt;Forgemaster Vul'kon&lt;/a&gt; appears:\nStage 4: Into the Forge.\nSpeak with Wrathion:\nStage 5: Corruption Detected.\nSha start appearing as a &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Blacksmith\"&gt;Celestial Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Defender\"&gt;Celestial Defender&lt;/a&gt; appear.\nDuring the fight the Celestial Defender will drop healing lights announced with:\nThe Celestial Blacksmith will run between anvils will it becomes overcharged, while also being attacked by the sha. If killed the event will need to be reset.\nClicking the anvil will cause the smaller sha nearby to be destroyed and stunning the larger one. After several rounds of this, when the blacksmith is finally finished:\nFinal Stage: Manifested Corruption.\nThis fight will take some time, as the boss-level &lt;a href=\"Sha%20Amalgamation\"&gt;Sha Amalgamation&lt;/a&gt; has over 31 million health and the following abilities:\nThe Celestial Defender will again try to tank the amalgamation, but it occasionally gets banished with Dark Binding. The defender retains the green healing beam as well, but that may not be as useful with the area-denial abilities the amalgamation uses. It will either Shadow Burst when the player is within 10 yards, or Shadow Crash the player's position at range. Don't get hit by either. The amalgamation also unleashes a Meteor Storm that targets points on the ground indiscriminately, and also follows the player around. The amalgamation will also randomly summon a Debilitating Sha with 200,000 health that must be killed immediately.\nChampions who typically act as healers should focus on dispelling the defender and then worrying about doing damage.\nHowever, the most important move is Insanity. After a few-second wind-up, the amalgamation will channel Insanity for 60 seconds, which ticks for roughly 100,000 Shadow damage every second. This can only be prevented by using one of the seven overpowered anvils. Insanity is on a 30-second cooldown, and the boss \"will\" try to cast it as soon as it's off the cooldown. Each anvil can only be used once, so the champion and defender must get the amalgamation down to 20% health before the eighth Insanity cast kills the player. \nAt around 20% of total health remaining the lance will be ready to be used against the sha:\nThe lance spawns on the ground near Wrathion's position and is bathed in light. Interact with it, then quickly use the bonus action button to finish off the encounter:\nOn victory:\nSpeak with Wrathion to complete the quest. Complete this quest, then pick up the followup, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Storm%20Lord\"&gt;Spirit of the Storm Lord&lt;/a&gt;, before leaving the scenario."}

The trailer shows the history of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s rule over ancient Pandaria and is narrated by &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt;. The trailer recited an older legend told in &lt;a href=\"Lessons%20from%20History\"&gt;Lessons from History&lt;/a&gt; and then added a couple verses onto there to call people to arms.\nBackground.\nThe poems main verses are exactly eight syllables per line and a iambic octameter. &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt; chose a iambic because every other syllable is stressed. \"When from her sacred vale did spring -- built by slaves their hearts in chains\" -- all the important words are accented, every other syllable. Kosak worked hard on that, to get three line rhymes, to get eight syllables per line. They had a version of the poem that was three stanzas of four lines each, but the music that we did had four musical phrases, followed by the transitional sequence. Kosak wanted the poem to match the music, so they went back to the drawing board and he had to re-write the poem and try to get everyone on the quest team to help feed him rhymes. Finally they came up with four three line stanzas that fits into the music. So if you listen to the trails music, you can see there's a change in between each stanza helping to build an epic experience.\nDuring the creating process they also worked very closely with the voice actor &lt;a href=\"Jim%20Cummings\"&gt;Jim Cummings&lt;/a&gt;. They had him read every version of the poem, three different versions, and the three line stanza became Kosaks favorite. The last two lines were read by Jim Cummings about ten times. They kept going \"No darker. No try darker, let's see how it sounds! Go really dark!\" and then Cummings nailed it. According to Kosak \"He kept -- no matter how dark he got he could still get deeper and darker, and that last \"The Thunder King comes,\" he really brought that home.\"\nTrailer.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nTranscript.\n\"Pandaria, her hills of gold\"\n\"In dark and mournful times of old\"\n\"Did once a hopeless horror hold\"\n\"When from her sacred veil did spring\"\n\"With storm and flash, a monstrous thing\"\n\"His name Lei Shen, the Thunder King\"\n\"His thunder boomed across the land\"\n\"And none who dared and fought could stand\"\n\"Against the iron tyrant\u2019s hand\"\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;A palace grand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;a walled domain&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Such mighty works born of his reign\"\n\"Built by &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt;, their hearts in chains\"\n\"But seasons change and tyrants die\"\n\"His fury spent in times gone by\"\n\"The thunder &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Conquerors\"&gt;slept&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"By &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; hands he has been taken\"\n\"By &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Khar%27zul\"&gt;Zandalari voice&lt;/a&gt; he has awakened\"\n\"Gather heroes, sound the drums\"\n\"The Thunder King comes\"\n\"The Thunder King comes\""}

Unbeknownst to Klaxz, this display of greed yielded a breach in etiquette so great that it offended the dead and attracted the invisible creature that would later become known as the &lt;a href=\"Uninvited%20Guest\"&gt;Uninvited Guest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Uninvited followed Klaxz home that evening. As he slept, it hovered next to him and began feeding on his thoughts of greed. The next day, Klaxz started acting strange by forgiving debts and failing to haggle over prices, saying that the cartel already had plenty of money, and both Slixi and his &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bang\"&gt;Bang&lt;/a&gt; began to feel uneasy. Over the following days, his behavior grew more erratic as he offered discounts and started handing away his and Slixi's valuables, alarming the other members of the cartel, all while the Uninvited Guest writhed around him and consumed his thoughts of wealth before he was even conscious of having them. Klaxz himself never noticed anything strange other than an occasional brief tugging in his belly. When he approached his and Slixi's personal vault, his wife knocked him out with a frying pan and hid away the real galleons in the woods. That night, Klaxz even refused to eat, telling the increasingly furious Slixi that they should share their food with others instead.\nOver the following days, Klaxz's mood improved as his affliction worsened. Slixi tried to watch him to prevent him from plundering the rest of their items, but when she turned her back, he managed to slip out to the market to hand away all of their jewelry. Slixi confronted him, but he merely said that their greed had been a prison and that he was setting them free through charity. Days later, Slixi arrived home to find their house completely empty and Klaxz missing. She found him wandering on the outskirts of town, trying to hand out stones as if they were as valuable as pearls. He refused to return home, revealed that he had given the house to Lyar Ripfizzle, and then walked off into the sunset, never to be seen by his wife again.\nKlaxz had unknowingly left the Uninvited Guest behind at the house. After she had her own close encounter with the creature, Slixi invented &lt;a href=\"tossaway\"&gt;tossaway&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014coins that looked exactly like galleons and which one could throw behind one's back for protection from the Uninvited. The harrowing tale of Klaxz's fate spread, and every goblin who heard it rushed to buy tossaways from Slixi. Klaxz supposedly wanders the land to this day, offering gifts to whoever will accept them."}

He was in a human form called Franklin the Friendly unless you came to bother him with the quest.\nStrategy.\nGuide.\nThe key to beating this demon is to never engage him in melee combat while he is frenzied (red). There are two ways to do this.\nHe may simply be kited using &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Cheetah\"&gt;Aspect of the Cheetah&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Concussive%20Shot\"&gt;Concussive Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt;, and Rank-1 &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt;. Due to Klinfran's high hit points, this takes a long time and uses a lot of mana. Bring several &lt;a href=\"Major%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Major Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt; if you wish to attempt this method. \nA better choice is to melee him. Simply hit him with &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Clip\"&gt;Wing Clip&lt;/a&gt; when he is ready to frenzy, then run away until he frenzies. Once he does, hit him with Scorpid Sting and an &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shot\"&gt;Auto Shot&lt;/a&gt;, and melee him again. When running away from him, \"strafe\" sideways while facing him. This will keep you from being dazed. If he hits you in the back, he can daze you even when he hits for only one point of damage.\nTiming is key. You must Wing Clip him and run early, before he frenzies. If he crits while frenzied, he can kill you in two hits. However, you must Wing Clip him late enough that he will still be slowed when he frenzies. Remember that hitting him early with Scorpid Sting is just a waste of mana.\nThe easiest way to time the frenzies is to count the number of hits with your weapon. A slow weapon will allow you three hits before he frenzies. This timing takes practice.\nKlinfran can and will parry your &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Clip\"&gt;Wing Clip&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, time your Clip early enough that when it misses or gets parried, you have enough time for another attempt. If the second Wing Clip misses, or if he otherwise frenzies while in melee range, fire a &lt;a href=\"Scatter%20Shot\"&gt;Scatter Shot&lt;/a&gt; to stun him, run away, and hit him with Scorpid Sting.\nIf your first &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Clip\"&gt;Wing Clip&lt;/a&gt; hits, you can stay in melee range for another hit, then run away to Sting him. If you run away too early, he may &lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt; before he frenzies. To prevent this, hit him with a Rank-1 &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt; as you run away.\nIf the Wing Clip wears off before he frenzies there is a great danger of him running inside of your Scorpid Sting minimum range, frenzying, and killing you. If this happens, hit him with Concussive Shot and continue to run away from him until he frenzies. If you don't land the Concussive Shot, you'll have to use Scatter Shot.\nIf Klinfran is frenzied in melee range and you can't fire a Scatter Shot, you can save the fight by using &lt;a href=\"Magic%20Dust\"&gt;Magic Dust&lt;/a&gt; to put him to sleep, run to range, and bandage. Wait a few seconds for your mana to regenerate, then re-open combat with an Aimed Shot and a Scorpid Sting.\nAs an absolute last resort, Feign Death to escape and reset the fight. Given how long this fight goes, it's painful to watch him go back up to full health, but it's better than dying.\nSo, a typical sequence for this fight is as follows:\nA Demonslaying Enchant on your melee weapon is very useful in this fight, as it will proc a random stun, allowing you to get some free hits in from melee or range.\nKeep in mind that your Scorpid Sting will only \"remove\" his frenzy effect. It will not prevent the frenzy from happening. You must wait until he turns red before you sting him. In particular, if he is stunned with a Freezing Trap, Demonslaying proc, or Scatter Shot, he will not frenzy. You must wait until the stun breaks, at which point he will typically frenzy immediately. That is the time to sting him. Even if you aren't watching him on your screen as you run away, you can detect when he frenzies. There is a sound effect, and all of his debuffs except for Wing Clip disappear.\nAlso keep in mind that his frenzy works like any spell with a 15-second cooldown. If he's been frenzied for ten seconds when you hit him with Scorpid Sting, he's going to frenzy again in five seconds. Watch out for this so you're not surprised when he does it.\nDue to Klinfran's high hit points, this fight takes a long time. It is easy to run out of mana. Wear +SPI and +mana/5sec gear. Consumables such as &lt;a href=\"Major%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Major Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Dragon%27s%20Breath\"&gt;Night Dragon's Breath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mageblood%20Potion\"&gt;Mageblood Potion&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Mana%20Oil\"&gt;Brilliant Mana Oil&lt;/a&gt; can help a lot. You may also wish to refrain from using any of your spells except Scorpid Sting and Wing Clip. Consumables that increase melee attack power, especially an &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Demonslaying\"&gt;Elixir of Demonslaying&lt;/a&gt;, will speed up the fight and require you to use less mana. If you do have enough mana available, an opening sequence of &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Concussive%20Shot\"&gt;Concussive Shot&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Trap\"&gt;Frost Trap&lt;/a&gt; can remove a good chunk of his health before you engage in melee. If you are good enough at timing his frenzies and have lots of +HIT gear, you can use Rank 1 Wing Clip instead of Rank 3 to save some mana.\nUse +STA buffs and equipment to get your hit points to at least 3900. This will allow you to survive two full hits, even if one of them crits. If you do get hit twice while Klinfran is frenzied, the fight is over. &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; and try again.\nActivate Klinfran on the road west of the ramp up to Blackrock Mountain. There is a long stretch of road where you can run around and fight him free of interference from other mobs.\nPatch 2.0.1 attempts.\nAs of patch 2.0.1, Scorpid Sting no longer weakens Klinfran the Crazed. \nStrategy I used: Followed Klinfran (Franklin the Friendly) to a spot that has a relativly flat surface in the mountains. This area is just south of the strategy video listed at the top of the page. After activating Klinfran from his human state, make sure to lay a freezing trap. You open up with Aimed Shot. Do not put any DoTs on him!\nWhen he hits the 1st Freezing Trap, you can then back up to max range, lay another trap at a different spot, and lead him to the newly set trap. Even if he is in Frenzy mode, the trap will still hold him. By the time he releases from the freezing trap, or you shoot him out of it, the cooldown on the freezing trap spell should be close to finishing. I was able to kite him around this area in this fashion without getting hit once by him.\nAnother method of killing Klinfran (by a hunter from Aerie Peak) is to use nothing but 3 key abilities (4 if you count auto shot), adding multi-shot/Arcane shot when mana allows: Concussion shot, Scatter shot, and Freezing Trap.\nFor the non-MM hunters out there (there are still some left?!?!), the above strat can be modified to a kite/trap strategy so that you never have to scatter. Also, be very careful with the new auto attack function - you really need to turn off your autoshot far more often now than you ever used to. Initiate combat on the road because he has an unpleasant habit of bugging on geometry and resetting. Use Rank 1 Arcane Shot - it can crit for around 800 and only costs 22 mana. Do this with Cheetah or if you have another hunter with you, have them turn on Pack so you can run with Hawk.\nGoing back and forth like this down a small stretch of road kept him from bugging and resetting as he did on a straight kite. Suggested potions: 1x Demonslaying, 1x Mongoose, 1x Major Mana (using Arcane Rank 1, you shouldn't need a mana pot till he's at 20% ish). Don't forget the Nightfin Soup or a pocket Paladin.\nIf the above strategies don't work, there is a more barebones method that works nicely, as long as you time everything properly. This strategy primarily involves your highest rank Serpent Sting and Arcane Shot Rank 1, along with Freezing Trap and Aspect of the Cheetah; make sure you get him to transform while he's on the road, then run to max distance towards Dreadmaul Rock. When he transforms, fire off an Arcane Shot and turn to run [make sure Aspect of the Cheetah is on]. Using either kiting method, run along the road while keeping Klinfran's attention with Rank 1 Arcane Shot, but don't use Serpent Sting until he frenzies, as he'll remove the debuff if it's on before. Hit him with a Serpent Sting right after he frenzies and continue to pull him along the path towards Dreadmaul Rock. You won't kill him on the first pass, so when you feel you are drawing too close to the end of the path, either stop Serpent Sting or hit him with a Scorpid Sting and place a freezing trap, firing at him as he runs at you [stop autoshot so you don't break the trap]. Run around Klinfran and get some good distance on him, but you can wait until the trap breaks on its own to regenerate mana if needed [NOTE: this might not work if you have Clever Traps, I'm not sure if he'll stay tagged to you through the entire trap]. When the trap breaks, repeat the same process of using Serpent Sting after he frenzies whenever possible, turn back around if necessary, and eventually you'll get him down. No consumables are required for this method."}

With a little study and a lot of math, he finally cobbled together what he called a probability generator, based on his experience, and tried it out. The first thing he asked it was if adventuring with the mage was a good idea. The machine spat out a piece of paper saying \"No.\" To test it, the tinker traveled with the mage once more, and lost a finger when he fumbled an explosive.

{"id": "37662", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=37662", "title": "Knight", "text": "Knights are traditionally powerful &lt;a href=\"mounted%20warrior\"&gt;horse-mounted warrior&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the kingdoms of humanity. They are usually &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, although other factions have knights as well such as the &lt;a href=\"elves\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;. Many famous human &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s were knights such as Sir &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, Regent of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and Supreme Commander of the Alliance forces during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. For centuries they have been the bane of many enemies: the legendary &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; who fell Lothar, was indeed killed by a human knight. These legendary mounted warriors also proved to be a decisive factor in many battles; particularly in the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"First%20War%23The%20first%20siege%20of%20Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;First Siege of Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s in particular respected and feared them, describing them as \"... fiends [who] rode atop beasts of muscle and sinew that crashed through our ranks...\". They also symbolize respect and honor among the humans. When one becomes a knight, he or she is given the title \"Sir\" or \"Dame\" in front of his or her name. An armored knight on his charger with his cape flowing is an icon of the might of the human armies.\nKnights tend to be assisted by &lt;a href=\"squire\"&gt;squire&lt;/a&gt;s.\nKnights appeared as units on the human or Alliance side in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20I\"&gt;Warcraft I&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;. They are the classic counterpart to &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s are also called knights, as during the Second War their only difference came from their ability to wield the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Many if not most came from the ranks of former knights, and were even referred as \"Holy Knights\". Like knights, some paladins also have the title of \"Sir\", most notably because some of them have risen up from the ranks of former knights, but not only, like &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; who comes from a family that owns and worked a pumpkin farm in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. The summoning and usage of &lt;a href=\"Charger\"&gt;Charger&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Warhorse\"&gt;Warhorse&lt;/a&gt;s in game mechanics suggest paladins' favor mounted combat in lore which only strengthens the similarity. Because of this, when speaking Knights and Paladins are pretty much interchangeable to most as &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; often called his paladins knights and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; was often referred to as a knight even though he was the only original member of the Silver Hand not to be a knight. Thus, paladins of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; may be called knights, but not all knights may be called paladins.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s are also called knights even when they were not corrupted or risen up from the ranks of former knights. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; are an order of death knights.\nKnights of the Silver Hand devote themselves as diligently to combat training as much as they do to their daily prayers, honoring their battle skills in order to best defend the weak and the innocent.\nKnights of the Brotherhood of the Horse.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the Kingdom of Azeroth (later known as &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;) was served by an order of knights called the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Horse&lt;/a&gt;, Knights of Azeroth, or the Knights of Stormwind.\nThese knights were the fighting elite in &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane's&lt;/a&gt; service. Using the difficult skills required for mounted combat, these warriors wielded huge &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s in order to crush their opponent's skulls. Their &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;warhorses&lt;/a&gt; made them fast and deadly, as they could maneuver much more quickly than an unmounted foe. Knights were well respected throughout the realm, and the tales of their fighting prowess were known far and wide.\nKnights of the Kingdoms of Lordaeron.\nThe forces of &lt;a href=\"Lordain%27s%20tribe\"&gt;Lordain's tribe&lt;/a&gt; were said to have been knightly in appearance and mindset even before joining &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nThe knights of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; represented the fiercest fighting force in the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Protected by suits of heavy armor, they carried mighty &lt;a href=\"Mace\"&gt;warhammers&lt;/a&gt; with which to crush all who would threaten the freedom of their lands. Astride great &lt;a href=\"Horse\"&gt;warhorses&lt;/a&gt;, these honorable and just warriors served as a symbol of order to the peoples of Lordaeron in these dark and chaotic times. Having learned of the fate the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; suffered after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, they had sworn to both avenge their fallen brethren and free their homelands from the grip of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Hordes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; order formed during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; called themselves the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and were those of only the greatest virtue among the knighthood of Lordaeron, and were tutored in the ways of &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; magic.\nDuring the course of the conflict, the Alliance effectively countered the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; with mounted knights, a strategy that served them well throughout the war.\nAfter the war and during the course of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberation of the orcs from internment camps&lt;/a&gt;, a group of knights was serving &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; and protecting the camps. When the Horde was liberating the orcs from &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt;, a knight managed to critically wound &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the knights fought in the final battle for Durnholde. With Durnholde leveled and knights defeated, liberating the remaining camps became easier.\nThird War.\nThough the hearty knights of Azeroth were destroyed during the First War, the shining knights of Lordaeron still continue to serve amongst the warriors of the Alliance. Wading into combat astride their noble warhorses, the knights are renowned for cutting bloody swathes through enemy ranks. The knights' speed and mobility mark them as some of the most versatile warriors of the Alliance.\nKnight orders/types.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", many knights are deployed through the game, though due to game mechanics they are in the form of warriors, paladins and death knights.\n\"Knight\" was also a rank title given to people for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; prior to the revamping of the &lt;a href=\"Honor%20System\"&gt;Honor System&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt; NPCs, see their respective pages.\nIn the RPG.\n\"This proud young man carries himself as if he were the lord of the battlefield. Resplendent in his (probably hereditary) armor, he spends much of his time testing the balance of his lance and speaking with his horse.\"\nAside from champions, the knight is the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; elite of humanity, especially of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the best of the normal troops thus among the most feared. They typically form ranks and charge, which causes a devastating effect on the battlefield. Knights line up for a coordinated charge, using their mounts' mobility to give them an advantage or to overrun an enemy's line so they may trample their opponents.\nHuman and high elf &lt;a href=\"mounted%20warrior\"&gt;mounted warrior&lt;/a&gt;s are called knights."}
