Not all air elementals are minions of the elemental lords and princes, some are minions of the elemental spirits of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrdering of Azeroth.\nTo keep &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; safe from these threats, the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s imprisoned the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s underground and banished the savage &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to the titan-constructed &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, a secure dominion where the elementals could dwell without harming Azeroth. Four domains were created within this primordial realm to serve as ideal environments for each type of elemental. One of the Elemental Plane's domains, a realm of lightning and wind known as the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;, is home to the Air elementals. With the elementals' departure, nature calmed, and the world settled into a peaceful harmony.\nElemental Sundering.\nBut, no matter each lord got to rule over his own realm, the different elementals kept fighting for supremacy and expansion, one of the worst of those battles becoming known as the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan the Wind Seeker&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"elemental%20prince\"&gt;elemental prince&lt;/a&gt; of air, was betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geddon\"&gt;Geddon&lt;/a&gt;, the lieutenants of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, elemental lord of fire, who consumed most of Thunderaan's essence, and stored what little remained of it within a &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;talisman of elemental binding&lt;/a&gt;, which was shattered in two flawless pieces, assigned to his lieutenants.\nElemental Unrest.\nImmediately prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, the Elemental Lords discovered a way to break through their prison and send their armies into major cities throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Al'Akir ordered his lieutenant and herald, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt;, to collaborate with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in their invasions of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; world event. These city assaults were then rebuffed by their defenders as &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; led the charge against Sarsarun's hideout in the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20Terrace\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj Terrace&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first major loss for Al'Akir since &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at mortal hands years ago and revealed the Windlord's new allegiance with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; and his destructive re-emergence into Azeroth, the Elemental Plane collided with the physical realm and resulted in drastic geographical upheaval, causing chaotic elementals to pour out into the world of Azeroth. Allied with Deathwing, their air elementals assault the recently discovered desert of Uldum, threatening to overrun the world once again.&lt;a href=\"Siamat\"&gt;Siamat&lt;/a&gt; was sent by Al'Akir at the behest of Deathwing to the &lt;a href=\"Neferset\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; to cure them of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their loyalty. After becoming exhausted from converting the population of Neferset into their stoney bodies, the Neferset turned on him, trapping him within the tower at the center of &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20Tol%27vir\"&gt;their lost city&lt;/a&gt;. After slaying the leaders of the city, adventurers accidentally freed Siamat. He was then defeated within the crumbled ruins of the tower that imprisoned him.\nLegion.\nWith Al'akir's demise, the air elementals descended into civil war. The majority of the air elementals of Skywall took part in the conflict, each attempting to show that they were powerful and intelligent enough to succeed Al'akir. The battle raged on for months with no true victor in sight, until a &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Typhinius\"&gt;Typhinius&lt;/a&gt; showed himself. He had recovered the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;, legendary fist weapons that were infused with the essence of Al'akir himself. With brute force alone, he was able to bring the air elementals' civil war to an end, crowning himself as the new lord of Skywall. The war in the Skywall had caused more damage than Typhinius realized. It would take time for the air elementals to regain their strength and prepare for a full offensive.\nHowever, the Fists were chaotic and their power could not be contained by a soul that did not seek harmony or balance. It took everything he had to keep the Fists from splitting him apart, let alone keep his mind sane. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; launched their &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Typhinius, in this maddened state, attempted to launch an assault on &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and finish was his predecessor started. Despite the pleas of his fellow elementals to stay his hand and wait until they had recovered from the civil war, Typhinius forced the weakened elemental forces into battle with the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt;. The war was short and the elementals were crushed, the Fists' strength alone not being enough to win. Defeated and maddened, Typhinius retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;. He was summarily killed by &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; Grandmaster, who took the Fists for themselves.\nDragonflight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Unleashed\"&gt;Tempest Unleashed&lt;/a&gt;, many air elementals were summoned alongside the &lt;a href=\"Unbridled%20Storm%20Lord\"&gt;Unbridled Storm Lord&lt;/a&gt; to cause chaos across the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. After the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, hostile air elementals were among the enemies encountered there. A number of them were also called forth by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned them as their reinforcements through elemental gateways linked to &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nAir elementals, the violent and territorial monarchs of the skies, favor mountaintops and other high places for their lairs. These creatures appear as crackling clouds with two glowing yellow orbs for eyes. Two columns of mist shot through with lightning extend from the cloud-like giant arms, each one encircled with blue metal bracers. They seek to effect change in the world (for example, erosion via wind). Air elementals create whirlwinds to suck up their enemies and also blind them with dust storms. Air elementals are the fastest and most agile of the elementals, moving with silent grace. An air elemental uses its special attacks whenever possible. It engulfs smaller opponents in its whirlwind first; if the elemental sees no opponent small enough to affect, it targets combatants with its dustcloud before engaging in melee. They speak &lt;a href=\"Auran\"&gt;Auran&lt;/a&gt;.\nGallery.\nOther \"Hearthstone\" air elemental cards are , , , and ."}

The creature is seemingly humanoid, but rides on a ball of electricity rather than walking on two feet. A lightning revenant wears flowing black and yellow robes under scale mail armor and carries a heavy mace and large metal shield emblazoned with a single white-colored image of an eyeball. Etched into the shield, radiating from the eye out to the shield's edges, are yellow beams. The eye sockets of the creature's metallic helm shines with a menacing white light. Only its arms are readily visible, and appear to be crackling lighting bolts almost suspended in time. Lightning is a force of sudden strikes and distant rumbles, and so too are the lightning revenants prone to violent outbursts after long periods of sleep. Lighting revenants tend to roam places where towns or other civilized outposts once stood, but were destroyed or abandoned. They find small, safe hiding spots to sleep until their territories are disturbed. They attack intruders only to drive them short distances from their hiding places, then retire back into bitter sleep. Lightning revenants are unpredictable in combat. They often switch targets for no good reason. They are equally likely to strike tenaciously at the same foe regardless of other circumstances.

She wields the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of deadly daggers which &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; had crafted from the fangs of &lt;a href=\"Goremaw%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Goremaw&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras' personal hound.\n&lt;a href=\"Rogue%23Subtlety\"&gt;Subtlety&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s seeking to claim the Fangs confront Akaari at &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Citadel\"&gt;her citadel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAkaari was once a distinguished &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; tracker who had made a name for herself in several &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invasions by silently murdering those who mistrusted the demons' promises of power. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, who had long searched for someone loyal and skilled enough to wield the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;fangs&lt;/a&gt; of his long-dead &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goremaw%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Goremaw&lt;/a&gt;, summoned Akaari to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, where she was informed of the great honor being offered to her. Sargeras promised Akaari that she would become his instrument of death and one of the deadliest creatures in any known realm, at the price of giving up her will: betrayal would become impossible. It was a grim bargain, but Akaari accepted it.\nAkaari spent centuries in dark, secret chambers below the surface of Argus, her essence being shaped and molded and intertwined with the daggers' power. The souls of other eredar assassins were sacrificed and bound to her, granting her the experience of a hundred lifetimes and thousands of kills. When she emerged from the chambers, she had become a remorseless weapon of death, perfectly obedient to Sargeras. For her first test, Akaari was sent alone to infiltrate a small, militaristic world. Within a month, tales of an unseen assassin had spread like wildfire and the world's warriors broke into warring factions, blaming each other for the silent assassinations of their heroes and leaders. When the Burning Legion revealed itself, the world begged to surrender, as an eternity of servitude seemed better than constantly living in fear of daggers in the shadows. Having passed her test in stunning fashion, Akaari was brought back into the ranks of the Legion to support their efforts more directly.\nThe eredar proved to be an indispensable ally, able to not only eliminate whom she wanted, but also to take their place in disguise, perfectly mimicking their appearance and manner. Whenever the Legion faced someone who resisted their temptations, Akaari's blades handled the rest. One day, she requested that Sargeras allow her to roam the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; for a time, which the Dark Titan allowed. Akaari spent time skulking among the Legion's own ranks, rooting out dissenters, traitors, and overly ambitious or powerhungry demons, and became a skilled interrogator and torturer. On a dead world, she built a fortress, &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Citadel\"&gt;Shadowgore Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, to hold prisoners and extract knowledge from them. Over time, the demons themselves began to fear Akaari and her weapons.\nWhen the location of the Shadowgore Citadel became known to the rest of the Legion, Akaari made a show of abandoning it, as it had become a useless and unhelpful symbol. However, she would later secretly return to the citadel, but only to prepare for particularly difficult invasions or to interrogate particularly important prisoners. When she returned to Sargeras, she had gained new skills and a new philosophy: \"fear was a double-edged sword, useful, but not always the right choice. An unseen assassin inspired terror, yes, but an unknown assassin inspired complacency. An enemy could not prepare to face a danger that seemingly did not exist.\" She dedicated herself to becoming a truly invisible, silent killer, and her work continued.\nLegion.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Uncrowned\"&gt;The Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;, a highly secretive and clandestine society of &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and assassins from across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, has hunted for Akaari for years. During the Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; informed a newly-joined &lt;a href=\"Rogue%23Subtlety\"&gt;subtlety&lt;/a&gt; rogue that she was close to finally locating the elusive assassin and sent them to speak with several contacts throughout &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to learn of Akaari's location. A mysterious eredar named &lt;a href=\"Val%27zuun\"&gt;Val'zuun&lt;/a&gt; informed the rogue that Akaari was already present in the city, spying for her masters, but that he would not reveal her exact location until the rogue brought him a &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Portals\"&gt;rune of portals&lt;/a&gt;. After \"borrowing\" the rune from &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Celindra\"&gt;Archmage Celindra&lt;/a&gt;, the rogue and Valeera were told by Val'zuun that Akaari was in the &lt;a href=\"Legerdemain%20Lounge\"&gt;Legerdemain Lounge&lt;/a&gt;, and a force of Uncrowned agents were swiftly sent to the lounge to corner the assassin. When the rogue confronted and seemingly killed Akaari, however, the assassin's body dropped the illusion and was revealed to merely be one of Akaari's &lt;a href=\"Shadowgore%20Bloodmaiden\"&gt;bloodmaiden&lt;/a&gt; servants. Enraged by the apparent betrayal, Valeera returned to confront Val'zuun, but he claimed to have been unaware of the deception and told the two rogues that he would be able to open a portal to Akaari's stronghold if they spared his life.\nUsing the rune he was provided earlier, Val'zuun opened up a gateway to Shadowgore Citadel. Once there, the subtlety rogue confronted Akaari once more, but was paralyzed and taken to a holding cell by a &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;. After making their way out of their cage and ascending to the top of the citadel, the rogue witnessed a ceremony where the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; bestowed his blessing upon Akaari and the Fangs of the Devourer before ordering her to wreak havoc upon Azeroth's kingdoms from within. The rogue attacked Akaari once more, and this time succeeded in killing her and taking the daggers for themselves. Upon the assassin's death, the citadel began to initiate a self-destruct sequence, and so the rogue hurried back through another gateway to Azeroth.\nOnly time will tell how Sargeras will respond to Akaari's death. As she died in the Nether, she should be dead for good.\n&lt;a href=\"Akaari%27s%20Soul\"&gt;Akaari's Soul&lt;/a&gt; is still bound to the Fangs of the Devourer, and occasionally appears to assist the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Shadowblade&lt;/a&gt;."}

Offered a chance at revenge against the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who decimated his people, Akama allied himself with the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; hybrid and aided in the overthrow of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, only to later find that Illidan was no better than the &lt;a href=\"Annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;. To all outward appearances, Akama remained a loyal servant of Illidan and led his Ashtongue Deathsworn in his service \u2014 but away from his prying eyes, Akama sought to end Illidan's reign.\nAllying with &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, whom he had been charged with keeping imprisoned, Akama rallied a group of adventurers to enter the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, leading up to the final battle with Illidan himself \u2014 the battle that ended the Betrayer's life. With Illidan gone, Akama hoped that the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; would fill the dismal halls of the temple once more.\nBiography.\nArgus.\nAlthough he has been called young during his time on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Akama lived on the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt;. An echo of him can still be found there, watching a &lt;a href=\"jed%27hin\"&gt;jed'hin&lt;/a&gt; match at the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Aspirants\"&gt;Circle of Aspirants&lt;/a&gt;. His echo is the only one of the future Exarchs who does not have the title of Councilor (except for &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Naielle\"&gt;Naielle&lt;/a&gt;, who is a child).\nUnbroken.\nAkama was the &lt;a href=\"Exarch\"&gt;Exarch&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s and a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt;, one of the leaders of the draenei under &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; chosen soon after the draenei crashed on Draenor. Despite the position, he was apparently young, and spent his youth at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; (indeed, his &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Akama\"&gt;alternate counterpart&lt;/a&gt; was also called young). When the orcs enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; descended upon Karabor, Akama took charge of evacuating as many civilians as possible (including &lt;a href=\"Cora%20%28draenei%29\"&gt;Cora&lt;/a&gt;, a child he'd met in Karabor) and then went into hiding with the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. He fled from the Temple to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; before going into hiding in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;, where he was the most exposed of the &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"red%20mist\"&gt;fel energies&lt;/a&gt; that caused some draenei to mutate, sending him into a coma. Sometime after the general banishment of the Broken from the draenei camps, he came out of his coma and was sent on his way as well.\nBefore and after the cataclysm and the shattering of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Akama took an interest in the activities of the former &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, and had stealthily followed him time and again to observe his efforts to reconnect with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, a power the former &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; was quite familiar with. After coming out of his coma, Akama had felt nothing but despair and a needling dread of the future. Perhaps he was hoping to see if he succeeded and pave the way back to Akama's own abilities and/or form; only Akama can say. What he certainly did \"not\" expect was to witness Nobundo's first contact with the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s, and while he couldn't hear the spirit of fire when it first spoke to Nobundo, it quite clearly was doing so and left Akama in absolute astonishment.\nAkama continued to observe Nobundo for another week, and watched as the elements defended Nobundo from the guards of a draenei camp, allowing him to pass through unhindered. Akama did not dare follow, but he didn't need to. The events that he had just witnessed planted a seed within him; seeing what Nobundo had just done, to see he had accomplished, stirred a feeling in Akama that he had feared long dead: Hope. He slipped back into the marsh with his newfound hope. Nobundo, while he had at times felt as if someone had been watching him through out his efforts, was never the wiser of what he had done for Akama.\nAkama later joined the &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20tribe\"&gt;Ashtongue tribe&lt;/a&gt; and gloated when a rival died, becoming leader of his people.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nYears later, Akama, now an elder sage of the Broken draenei survivors, was forced into the open where he fought a losing battle against the pit lord Magtheridon and his army of demons and &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAkama found himself aided by and , a &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; who had come from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to find a cure for magic addiction. Hoping to gain allies in the fight against Magtheridon, Kael'thas and Vashj destroyed the fel orc base that had been raiding Akama's makeshift outpost. Akama pledged his loyalty to &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and aided them by attacking a larger &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish base, keeping the enemy occupied and away from Kael'thas and Illidan as the two closed the &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 which were supplying constant reinforcements to Magtheridon. After that battle, the time had come to lay &lt;a href=\"Lord%20of%20Outland\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; to Magtheridon's &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nAkama pledged allegiance to Illidan, craving vengeance on the orcs and demons who had corrupted and slaughtered his race. He also hoped that reclaiming the Black Temple would redeem the Broken in the eyes of the draenei. Using his &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; abilities, Akama and a band of his followers sneaked into Black Temple and destroyed the magical energy generators which sustained the defenses of the citadel, and then aided Illidan, Kael, and Vashj in the final attack against Magtheridon himself. However, since the moment of Illidan's triumph, Akama began planning his inevitable conflict with the Betrayer.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; appeared and ordered Illidan to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan, Kael, and Vashj went as ordered, while Akama remained to secure &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; in his absence.\nEnemy of my enemy.\nTime passed with no sign of Illidan returning the Black Temple to the Broken as he had promised; instead, the temple began undergoing further corruption. Akama began to see Illidan as just another pawn of the Burning Legion and contacted the Betrayer's nemesis &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, telling her to meet him in &lt;a href=\"Orebor%20Harborage\"&gt;Orebor Harborage&lt;/a&gt;. While waiting for Maiev's arrival, he healed a sickly Broken child named &lt;a href=\"Rosaria\"&gt;Rosaria&lt;/a&gt;. Once Maiev arrived in the village, she and Akama agreed to work together against Illidan, and the elder sage gave the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; a stone through which he could contact her when needed. Akama publicly remained in the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;'s service but was greatly disturbed by Illidan's actions, such as using Magtheridon's blood to create more &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the creation of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIllidan eventually learned of Akama's duplicity. Rather than killing the Broken, the Betrayer instead ripped out &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;a portion of Akama's soul&lt;/a&gt; from his body and bound it to his service. Illidan then forced Akama to trick Maiev into leading her forces into an ambush at the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, where all of Maiev's soldiers were killed by the Illidari and the warden herself was captured. During the attack, Illidan used the souls of the fallen to rip open a portal to &lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;Nathreza&lt;/a&gt;. Akama, who had been unaware of this part of the plan, was furious that Illidan had not spared the Ashtongue as promised and that he had used their harvested souls for his own purposes.\nAkama was later appointed as Maiev's jailer in the &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Cage\"&gt;Warden's Cage&lt;/a&gt; and told the warden that both Illidan and himself had plans for her.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAkama is a &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; located in front of Maiev Shadowsong's cell in the Warden's Cage in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. In order to reach him, adventurers of the Horde and Alliance had to enter into the underground portion of the Warden's Cage and look to right at what appears to be just a pool of water. Swimming into and under the pool brought them into Maiev's cell where Akama is standing guard.\nAfter an introductory quest chain, in which players have to prove that they are not allied with Illidan by killing some members of the Illidari, they are sent to speak with Akama. He explains that it is best for his people to continue to appear to serve Illidan until certain omens are fulfilled. He then gives a quest to speak with &lt;a href=\"Udalo\"&gt;Udalo&lt;/a&gt; who is being held prisoner in the &lt;a href=\"Arcatraz\"&gt;Arcatraz&lt;/a&gt;, a satellite of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Udalo is dead, but has left a clue behind for the next quest.\nOn returning from the Arcatraz, Akama gives a quest to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Heart of Fury&lt;/a&gt;, one of the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20Terrace\"&gt;Ata'mal Terrace&lt;/a&gt; in Shadowmoon Valley. When this is completed, Akama sends the party to meet the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterwards, he was forced to kill one of his closest allies, &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Olum\"&gt;Seer Olum&lt;/a&gt;, because their plan against Illidan was revealed. Olum asked Akama to kill him in order to confirm the loyalty of the Ashtongue to the Illidari.\nThe , the portion of Akama's soul tied to Illidan's will, is a boss in &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Akama with the help of the adventurers released his soul and was also able to regain his people's trust. After the Illidari Council is defeated, Akama is assisted by the spirits of Udalo and Olum in opening the gate to the very top of the Temple. During the final confrontation with Illidan, Akama himself assisted adventurers in battle, although he cannot be killed. Akama leaves the battle during the first phase and is not seen again for the remainder of the battle; however, Maiev Shadowsong arrives for the final phase and remains until Illidan's death. Akama had freed Maiev from her prison cell and led her into the Temple with the aid of players seeking to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Medallion%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Medallion of Karabor&lt;/a&gt; that allows entry into the Temple. After Illidan is defeated, Akama swears to fill the halls of the Black Temple with Light once again.\nMists of Pandaria.\nBrawler's Guild.\nAt one point, Akama joined the &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Brawler's Guild&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he had to keep his blades sharp due to the ever-present threat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.

For more details on the event and strategy on how to complete it successfully, see &lt;a href=\"Akil%27zon%20gauntlet\"&gt;Akil'zon gauntlet&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThis fight focuses on player positioning. Players should form a semi-circle around the boss, maintaining 8 yards or more between each other to prevent Static Disruption from hitting multiple people at once.\nHealers will need to keep all raid members' health high\u2014Akil'zon will sometimes cast Gust of Wind on a player and then follow up with a Static Disruption. \nRecommended positions for this fight are for all ranged members to spread out around the left or right side of the platform. This will reduce the overall area in which the raid is spread out and reduce the maximum distance anyone will need to run to get under the Electrical Storm.\nThis fight discourages stacking melee classes because they will often share Static Disruption. If using more than two melee classes, assign two with markers and have additional melee stack on one or the other. The marked melee should attempt to be as far from each other as possible. Disruptions will hit all stacked members, but this will reduce the overall jumps.\nElectrical Storm.\nAkil'zon will create an Electrical Storm centered on a random player in the raid. This person will be lifted into the air and a cloud emanating lighting bolts will form around them. There will also be a black circle on the ground. All raid members must move into the very center of the storm (calm in the eye) as the damage received from the storm will kill most players in only a few seconds. Players with the Static Disruption debuff will take increased damage.\nThe Electrical Storm ability is on a 45 second cooldown, which begins when he is initially aggroed. Because this is a cooldown to his ability and not a timed use, the actual case point can appear random.\nGenerally the best approach to dealing with Electrical Storm is for the entire raid to collapse at 10 to 5 seconds before the storm cooldown is up (this is the time tracked by mods such as &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Boss%20Mods\"&gt;Deadly Boss Mods&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"BigWigs\"&gt;BigWigs&lt;/a&gt;). \nCollapse Method 1.\nRaid members should collapse towards the boss but attempt to spread out slightly so that any Static Disruptions cast will chain to as few people as possible. People should begin collapsing towards the boss with 5 seconds left on the storm cooldown timer.\nThis method greatly benefits from group heals as the group will likely take one or more static disruptions before the storm appears. Attempt to keep everyone above 50% as best as possible.\nNotes regarding this method:\nCollapse Method 2.\nUsing timers to establish when to collapse during this fight is risky because of the unpredictability of the Storm ability. The full raid taking more than one Static Disruption at this point will typically result in a wipe. Alternative strategies require large amounts of awareness on the part of the entire raid and will often result in the raid wiping because the storm spawned far away from the other nine people that were collapsing.\nSet group based collapse points:\nThis method results in a 50% reduction of post-cooldown pre-storm Static Disruption damage making healing much easier for the healers but can be less attractive for groups attempting the timer as melee will likely be unable to contribute DPS to the boss during the storm.\nListening.\nThe following sound settings can be used to allow you to hear when Akil'zon is about to use Electrical Storm.\nIn the sound menu, maximize Ambiance:\nBefore the fight all you should hear are birds chirping. During the fight, you will hear the storm roll in!\nEagles.\nAfter the first Electrical Storm, Akil'zon will call forth his \"bruddahs\" which will bring some Soaring Eagles into the fight. They are different from the birds you met during the gauntlet run to the boss. They fly in the air and dive-attack random party members. That means melee dps and off-tanking is useless against them. These eagles have Eagle Swoop which hits for around 1500. Warlocks can seed, hunters can shoot down, mages can fireball, and shaman can chain lightning. They move very quickly across the boss area and some players may find it difficult to finish casting a spell before they are behind the player or out of range. \nStrategies.\nThere are several strategies for dealing with the birds:\nLoot.\nFor the timed event loot, see the &lt;a href=\"Zul%2527Aman_timed_event%23Loot\"&gt;Zul'Aman timed event&lt;/a&gt; article."}

During the event eagles will be sent down in groups of 5 or 6, and Warriors will spawn behind the group in pairs.\nStrategy.\nGroup composition: Two tanks, 2-3 healers, 2 AoE (warlocks/mages are best), and 3-4 single-target DPS for the elites.\nApproaching Akil'zon, the raid encounters an . Upon aggroing the Lookout, he will run up the hill toward Akil'zon, starting a Shattered Halls gauntlet-like trash event. The raid should have two tanks ready to tank the elite trolls and non-elite eagles. \nThere are four pairs total each containing an (shaman) and an (warrior). These mobs cannot be crowd controlled. It is best if one tank always takes the left and one always the right, to avoid confusion on who is tanking what. Both will need to be aware of the coming up from behind. Kill the Wind-Walker first (as he heals), then the Protector.\nWhile the raid heads up the gauntlet Akil'zon occasionally sends down non-elite eagles in groups of 5-6 which must be picked up by the tanks (Thunder Clap and Demoralizing Shout/Roar or Consecration). With sufficient AoE and attentive healers, you can just AoE the eagles. Meanwhile, pairs of will spawn behind the raid and head up the ramp. They have less health than and need to be picked up by the tanks and killed. The charge and stun the first raid member they encounter so it may be more optimal to have someone besides the person tanking them to take the charge. \nBecause of the constant spawns of Eagles and Warriors, the raid will want to move as quickly as they can. When the is engaged, eagle and Amani'shi Warrior spawns will be stopped, but any already en route will need to be killed. Once the has been killed you will be ready to engage Akil'zon. \nIf a member of the raid dies, they should release and run back, being careful to move up the ramp after the Amani'shi Warrior pair has moved toward the raid. If a returning member is intercepted by the Amani'shi Warrior pair, not only can this kill the member again, but it can result in a reset of the event.\nThe respawn time for Akil'zon's trash is short, only 30 minutes. You have only a few attempts on Akil'zon before the trash gauntlet respawns and you must repeat the event. If the respawn happens before you engage the boss and you are still on the boss' platform (after some unsuccessful tries for example) the waves of eagles and warriors will start coming again. Killing the on the boss' platform again will stop the waves from coming but all pairs of elites will come together with the first two non-elite warriors.\nA smooth run of this gauntlet will have a rhythm to it. While the raid and rear tank mop up the warriors adding to the rear, the main tank engages the next static pair and builds aggro on them and any adding birds. This means a new static pair should be pulled every other bird wave. Generally an inability to keep up with this pace will result in a wipe before the is pulled due to the healers going OOM or the raid being overwhelmed with adds. \nAlternate Strategy\nIt can also work well to divide the raid. Use one tank to control the &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Wind%20Walker\"&gt;Wind Walker&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Protector\"&gt;Protector&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile the other tank stands at the back with one of your single target dpsers to intercept the &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Warrior\"&gt;Warriors&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you designate one of your healers to keep an eye on your rear tank, although he probably won't need very heavy healing. The rest of the raid focuses on killing the &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Wind%20Walker\"&gt;Wind Walker&lt;/a&gt; first and then the &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Protector\"&gt;Protector&lt;/a&gt;, while AoEing the birds when they get out of hand.\nAlternate Strategy2 - easy to follow\nHave a stealth user ( Druidcat/Rogue ) move to where the is,then mark up all the he can see. These will be tanked by a warrior preferably ( interruption and silencing from Improved Shield Bash ) while the Offtank handles the . Once the Wind Walker is dead the Main Tank can stay in the group watching from the front and back, AOE aggroing any birds that are incoming and picking up warriors from the back. By the time both the shaman and protector are down there should be 1 or 2 bird mobs that are being AOE'd down while the warriors are focus dpsed. Once its clear the whole raid can move forward to the next row and repeat the process. Keep this up until the last Shaman is dead and have the MT start engaging the to avoid any more spawns from coming. Clean up and its done. If any raid member dies during this gauntlet they must run back and get back to the raid as soon as possible.

While in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;, he gets into a debate with members of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind City Guard&lt;/a&gt;, including the nephew of Danath Trollbane, &lt;a href=\"Cristof%20Dungalion\"&gt;Cristof Dungalion&lt;/a&gt;. They debated over who and what truly makes a hero. They discussed the human heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and those that traveled to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Akinos remembers atrocities committed to his people by each of the \"so-called\" heroes, and while the blademaster side of his thoughts thinks of insults that come to mind, he instead he chooses to weaken the guard's arguments in a more diplomatic way, by pointing out they love their own people. \nThis leads one of the guards into pointing out that the valley contains statues from other races including dwarves and elves, and he added that perhaps someday an orc will be put into the Valley. Akinos however adds, that his Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; belongs there, as does &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. \nOne of the guards is disgusted by idea of a tauren being honored in that way, and chooses to insult Akinos by saying he would be \"lucky if there is room for one race of beasts, let alone two\". However, Akinos deflects the remark away by asking who should be honored if the Valley could contain only one hero. The guards argued over if it should be &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; or Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. \nHowever, Akinos had them where he wanted them, and decided to bring up his own choice, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, \"warrior and warchief, the shadow no prison could hold.\" At that moment Akinos knew that if the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Council\"&gt;Stormwind Council&lt;/a&gt; could be toyed with as easily as he had with the guards then his position as diplomat would be an enjoyable post."}

He ruled over his domain of &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; from his seat at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;. Of all the elemental lords, Al'Akir was known to be the cleverest and was once the foremost tactician in the Old Gods' horrific armies. Aligned with the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow Elemental Lord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in their efforts to usher in the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;end of days&lt;/a&gt;, Al'Akir was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortal champions of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, who were able to enter Skywall from the breach in &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and destroy the Windlord within his own sanctum.\nBiography.\nAncient history.\nIn the beginning, the world that would become known as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was ruled by the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. A nascent &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; maturing within the world's core had consumed much of the fifth element, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, and without this primordial force to create balance, the elements were thrown into chaos. The four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s, who each ruled over innumerable lesser spirits, constantly clashed with one another on the surface of the primordial world during the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20wars\"&gt;elemental wars&lt;/a&gt;. Al'Akir the Windlord was the most cunning of them all, sending his minions to spy on his enemies and sow distrust among their ranks. He would pit the other lords against each other, only to then unleash the full fury of his servants on his weakened foes, sending lightning and cyclones to ravage the world's surface.\nWhen the entities known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; arrived from the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; and established their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Elemental Lords saw the invaders as a threat to their dominion. For the first time in Azeroth's history, the native spirits of the world worked together against a common enemy. Al'Akir's tempests joined with the fiery minions of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, creating blistering firestorms and cyclones of flame that reduced the Old Gods' citadels to ash. Eventually, however, the elementals of the world could not stand against the endless swarms of &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, and were all enslaved.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Azeroth to battle the Black Empire, the Old Gods sent their enslaved Elemental Lord lieutenants to face them. Al'Akir waged war against &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, who used their combined powers over the winds and storms to drive the Windlord back to his lair atop the highest peaks on Azeroth. Once there, the three keepers turned Al'Akir's own powers against him and defeated him atop his domain. The Windlord and his air elementals were thereafter imprisoned in the spires of &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;, a region of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nThousands of years ago, the famed &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; smith &lt;a href=\"Irmaat\"&gt;Irmaat&lt;/a&gt; crafted a pair of &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;magnificent handblades&lt;/a&gt;. Unsatisfied with his work, &lt;a href=\"Irmaat\"&gt;Irmaat&lt;/a&gt; tried to capture the essence of Al'Akir the Windlord to infuse into his blades. Al'Akir was not amused and remembered how the smith had captured his &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt;s. To spite the smith, Al'Akir poured unspeakable amounts of raw elemental fury into the handblades. When Irmaat attempted to unleash their might, a great vortex sprang up, engulfed his city, and scattered the weapons to the winds.\nThe Shattering.\nImmediately prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Elemental Lords discovered a way to break through their prison and send their armies into major cities throughout Azeroth. Al'Akir ordered his lieutenant and herald, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt;, to collaborate with the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in their invasions of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; world event. These city assaults were then rebuffed by their defenders as &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; led the charge against Sarsarun's hideout in the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20Terrace\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj Terrace&lt;/a&gt;. This was the first major loss for Al'Akir since &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat at mortal hands years ago and revealed the Windlord's new allegiance with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAs the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; recovered his strength, &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; commanded Al'Akir to prepare for war, which the Elemental Lord relished. In return, N'Zoth promised to release him from his prison and let him roam free on Azeroth as the Windlord once did in ancient times. Following Deathwing's &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; and his destructive re-emergence into Azeroth, the Elemental Plane collided with the physical realm and resulted in drastic geographical upheaval, causing chaotic elementals to pour out into the world of Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; now floats ominously over the southern sands of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeathwing sought to manipulate the elemental lord of Skywall into accomplishing his goals by turning him against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and all mortal life. He has become one of the Destroyer's staunchest and most powerful allies, and called the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Wind\"&gt;Conclave of Wind&lt;/a&gt;, ancient wind elementals nearly as powerful as Al'Akir himself, to aid in the elemental invasion of his former home.\nHe assists Deathwing's efforts at reclaiming the Titans' ancient reorigination device and lends his elemental forces at crushing Uldum's native defenders and his old enemy, the &lt;a href=\"Tol%27vir\"&gt;Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;. One of his first acts after the Cataclysm was destroying the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Orsis\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt; in revenge for having refused Deathwing's offer of curing their &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. The armies and strongest minions of Al'Akir still reside within the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, training in formation and torturing tol'vir as they prepare to lash out yet again at Uldum. At some point prior to his death, Al'Akir ensnared and twisted &lt;a href=\"Hagara%20the%20Stormbinder\"&gt;Hagara the Stormbinder&lt;/a&gt; with new powers for trying to bind elementals to her will.\nWhen players finally meet him in &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, he is as aloof as ever, but generally conducts himself more honorably in combat than his elemental ally &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. As Al'Akir is slain in his home plane, the Skywall, he is forever dead. This makes him the first of the Elemental Lords to die. What the death of their elemental lord means to the air elementals is currently unclear, but it most certainly is not good. \nLegacy.\nAl'Akir's final words would prove ironic, for his death created such a power vacuum that the other air elementals would fight over their former lord's position for years to come. Of note, &lt;a href=\"Typhinius\"&gt;Typhinius&lt;/a&gt; attempted to use the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt; to forcefully take command of Skywall and continue Al'Akir's war against the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt;, but failed miserably before being slain by a &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. \nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;'s Farseer recovered &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt; and used it to revive Al'Akir's true heir, &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; the Windseeker, who then succeeded the Windlord as the ruler of Skywall. The new elemental lord pledged Skywall's armies to aid Azeroth's forces in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"time%20travel\"&gt;time travel&lt;/a&gt;ling with &lt;a href=\"Andantenormu\"&gt;Andantenormu&lt;/a&gt;, Al'Akir is briefly seen in the past of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Along with his air elementals, he is fighting the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nAl'Akir is absolute ruler over the skies, air and storms. He is the weakest of the four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. His domain is the sky over the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, which touches all of the other elements. Consequently, it \"...interacts with them more than any other, and yet he is the most capricious and aloof of all the Lords. He is as likely to stir up trouble one day as he is to casually ignore incursions the next.\" His mood can quickly change, much like the weather. He is revered by all air elementals and creatures that fly. It is said that he is aware of all air spells that are cast anywhere throughout the multiverse - although this might be true, he rarely becomes personally involved in their resolution unless they affect him directly.\nAl'Akir uses his great speed to his advantage in battle. He strikes first at those foes who fly and thus present the greatest challenge to his mastery of the air. Climbing into the sky to attack him can be a dangerous proposition. Once all flying foes have been dealt with, he generally employs his whirlwind ability to sweep up creatures on the ground, holding them as long as possible before dropping them in whatever manner deals the most punishment to those who would challenge his might.\nAlthough he is the weakest of the Elemental Lords, the others are hard pressed to attack him on his own turf. He rarely attacks them directly, choosing instead to wreak whatever havoc he can before retreating in the face of determined opposition.\nAl'Akir has the power to transform himself into a tireless and raging thunderstorm when outdoors. This transformation completes within a relatively short time, \"during which he swiftly shifts into a massive, roiling black\" 250-foot by 250-foot by 1,000-foot \"cloud bank with lightning dancing within.\" It can last up to one full hour, while also standing a few hundred feet off the ground. While within this form, he has greater power to manipulate the air, such as being able to loose multiple and powerful lightning bolts, each at a different target within approximately 500 feet in any direction he wishes. He also has the ability to slam creatures beneath him or within one hundred feet of the thunderstorm. Furthermore, he can create a single whirlwind underneath his cloud shape that must remain directly below his cloud body. If any other air elementals are in the vicinity, they also can form whirlwinds (at their own power level) that can last for as long as the thunderstorm. There are limits to these abilities; Al'Akir cannot use them with conjunction of the whirlwind, or with other whirlwinds caused by the wind elementals under his command.\nAl'Akir can transform himself into a whirlwind every 10 minutes, and remain in this form for a fairly long duration. Gargantuan or smaller creatures may be injured when caught in the whirlwind, and/or lifted into the air. A creature that can fly has a higher chance than others to escape the whirlwind. It too, will very likely be injured. He can eject any creatures whenever he wishes, depositing them wherever the whirlwind happens to be. He prefers doing this over the sides of cliffs, or from very high altitudes.\nIf the base touches the ground, it creates a swirling cloud of debris, known to most as a tornado. This cloud is centered on the elemental, and it will obscure all vision. It is difficult to cast a spell from near or within the tornado.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Air, and/or &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; may be children of Al'Akir, given their titles.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

In the wake of the Cataclysm, he has aligned with Deathwing and turned his godlike powers against many of the air elementals' ancient tol'vir nemeses.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: Your Challenge is Accepted!\nAl'Akir periodically casts Squall Line, Wind Burst, Ice Storm and Lightning Strike on random players. He casts Static Shock on any target in melee range and Electrocute on his primary target if that target leaves melee range.\nStage Two: Your Persistence Angers Me!\nAt 80% health, Al'Akir no longer casts Wind Bursts but continually brings down Acid Rain and spawns Stormlings.\nStage Three: Enough!\nAl'Akir shatters his platform and creates a zone-wide Relentless Storm, lifting all players into the air and giving them the Eye of the Storm buff as long as they remain near him.\nBerserk: Al'akir &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Berserk&lt;/a&gt; after 9 minutes from the beginning of the Fight in all Difficult settings.Increase Damage 900% and quickly wipes the raid.\nStrategy.\nAl'Akir is a three phase encounter that will require one tank on both 10 and 25 player difficulties.\nPhase One.\nLightning Strike is the main lethal mechanic in this phase. The raid needs to be spread out in groups of 2 (10-man) or 3 (25-man) in order to avoid healer range issues and lightning strike chaining to many players and instantly killing them. Players in the same group will stand on top of eachother, ensuring the damage is a healable 40,000 or 60,000 hit. Players must move into melee range for Wind Burst and avoid the rotating Squall Lines. Wind Burst is on a predictable 30 second timer and players should take into account its timer when moving to Squall Lines since they will need to be in melee to avoid being knocked off the platform. The tank need not fear moving out of melee to dodge Squall Line, Al'Akir will electrocute him instead of melee-ing other players. Lightning Strike is considerably more threatening on 25-player difficulty.\nPhase Two.\nThe raid should group up around the tank in phase two. You will still need to dodge Squall Lines. The primary mechanic of this phase is ensuring the Feedback debuff is stacked on Al'Akir. Since the duration of feedback is increased to 30 seconds up from 20 seconds and Al'Akir summons a stormling every 20 seconds, it's no longer needed to time kills but you will have to kill stormlings as soon as possible. Once Al'Akir is at five or six feedback stacks, you should bloodlust/heroism and have all DPS focus on Al'Akir to hit phase three before Acid Rain stacks too high and is unhealable.\nPhase Three.\nThe raid will be tossed into the Eye of the Storm, any Stormlings will remain up and the tank should taunt them and keep them out of melee with the raid. A successful strategy is to group up and 'jump' up as high as you can go. Then the raid will move down 10 yards whenever lightning clouds spawn. Players with lightning rod will move down 6 yards to avoid damaging other players. When you are wind bursted back you must move back to your original position, because if you get too far away (or too close) to Al'Akir you will be caught in the relentless storm and killed. You should be able to kill Al'Akir before you run out of room.\nNotes.\n /script RepopMe()\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

She is more welcoming of outsiders than her fellow elders and, by her own admission, is much more open-minded about how to honor the works of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nAra vouches for the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s when they first arrive in Haven and helps them open the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Waystone\"&gt;Ancient Waystone&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; after they defend the village from the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;.

The journey goes first to &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Esper\"&gt;Provis Esper&lt;/a&gt; where the two find some &lt;a href=\"Conduction%20Remnant\"&gt;Conduction Remnant&lt;/a&gt;s, then to &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Pilgrim's Grace&lt;/a&gt; in a failed attempt to use them to unlock the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Translocator\"&gt;Ancient Translocator&lt;/a&gt; to the Sepulcher, and then to the &lt;a href=\"Catalyst%20Wards\"&gt;Catalyst Wards&lt;/a&gt; to get help from &lt;a href=\"Feroz\"&gt;Feroz&lt;/a&gt;, a broker who knows how to restore the remnants but whose fellow pilgrims have been trapped by rampant &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; and plantlife.\nWith the help of &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements, the Maw Walker fights their way through the &lt;a href=\"Catalyst%20Gardens\"&gt;Catalyst Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Creation%20Catalyst\"&gt;Creation Catalyst&lt;/a&gt;, where Ara joins them and guides them on how to repair the Conduction Remnants with the Catalyst. Ara states that by doing this, she breaks the first law of her people\u2014a law she helped make\u2014but that her \"path has forked\" and that she must walk it. With the remnants restored, the pilgrimage concludes. Ara sends the Maw Walker back to the Translocator to the Sepulcher to open it and thanks them for an \"enlightening\" adventure.\nWhen spoken to back in Haven after this event, Ara states that she's been thinking about the pilgrimage and that it's time for her and the hero to part ways. She then heads through the Ancient Waystone to Oribos, where she rejoins Cartel Al, resumes her old name of Al'Ara, and can subsequently be found sitting in the northern room of the &lt;a href=\"Idyllia\"&gt;Idyllia&lt;/a&gt;.

This boss is more often than not skipped at first and attempted after &lt;a href=\"Void%20Reaver\"&gt;Void Reaver&lt;/a&gt; because of Void Reaver's lesser difficulty.\nLore.\nAl'ar is &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s precious pet &lt;a href=\"phoenix\"&gt;phoenix&lt;/a&gt; that he cares for deeply. Kael'thas summoned Al'ar to destroy the undead blocking the way into the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; during his mission to destroyed the tainted &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. \nHis &lt;a href=\"Ember%20of%20Al%27ar\"&gt;children&lt;/a&gt; reside near their father and aid in attacking those invading Kael'thas's sanctum. As with all phoenixes, he is reborn from his own ashes, so adventurers wishing to take him down may have to do so more than once during the encounter.\nKael'thas often boasted that death would never claim it. Perhaps he was right.\nSome of the &lt;a href=\"Dawnblade%20%28blood%20elves%29\"&gt;Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt; blood elves had heard that &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and his brethren were the ones who broke into the Eye and slew Al'ar, likely referencing the quest &lt;a href=\"Ruse%20of%20the%20Ashtongue\"&gt;Ruse of the Ashtongue&lt;/a&gt;, in which heroes disguised themselves as &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; while battling the phoenix god.\nStrategy.\nThis is a heavy mobility fight. Contrary to popular belief, no amount of fire resistance is generally needed for the fight. It may help certain individuals (e.g. the tank that handles the Embers) but you should avoid sacrificing more important statistics. Fire protection potions are helpful if their use is timed properly. Al'ar was (until &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.1.0\"&gt;Patch 5.1.0&lt;/a&gt;) immune to fire damage, but is no longer.\nPhase I.\nPhase I is straightforward.\nAl'ar will always fly to the left ramp when pulled. A tank needs to wait there to avoid Flame Buffet. \nDuring this phase it is impossible to draw aggro at range; like &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, Al'ar will not aggro on people outside melee range. Melee can draw aggro from tanks, however. \nAl'ar spends around 30 seconds on each platform, then moves on to the next, flying clockwise (W, NW, NE, E, repeat). Tanks should stay on the edge of their platform to maintain line of sight with the healers. Two tanks is enough for this simple rotation, but three makes it easier to react to Flame Quill.\nAdds.\nAl'ar will summon an add every time it switches position. This add spawns at the very position it just left. The adds need to be off-tanked away from the rest of the raid and DPS'd down as soon as possible to keep the total number of spawned adds to a minimum. The adds do not deal much damage but explode on death for a significant amount of fire damage (healers should be prepared to respond as the adds approach death). They are immune to crowd control and fire damage.\nThe adds will generally fly to the healers, particularly if a paladin keeps Righteous Fury up; have an off-tank waiting downstairs to pick them up. It is usually a good idea to have the melee DPS take care of these adds, since they can't move fast enough to keep steady DPS on the boss herself, but be very careful with the explosions. Note that these adds can be stunned, and a useful technique is for a rogue to save up 5 combo points, wait for the add to get low on health (around 4%), stun the add while everyone else moves away, and then use &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and finish off the add.\nFlame Quills.\nOccasionally when leaving a platform, Al'ar will fly to the center of the room and begin spinning, which signals the upcoming Flame Quills. Every person in the raid needs to be aware and fall down from the upper platform, especially the tanks, since anyone left there will take 6-8k fire damage per second. People standing on the outside of the room on the floor (south near the entry door) are also susceptible. Unobservant tanks will be killed very quickly by this ability, most likely causing a wipe (if no soulstone was set). So whenever Al'ar is about to leave a platform, rotate the camera appropriately to keep an eye on the movement. Don't just run blindly to the next platform, wait a bit to see where exactly Al'ar goes next.\nOnce the Quill ends, Al'ar will land on platform 1 or 4. One tank needs to be positioned on each side, at the base of the ramp, ready to quickly reach their platform before Al'ar does more than two buffets. Intercept is useful. A third tank can be helpful here; if you have only two tanks, and both are on the same side of the room as Al'ar leaves a platform to start Flame Quills, they may have trouble crossing the room to reach the far platform. Priests can summon their shadow fiend up to Al'ar if the tank is having trouble getting to the platform in time to minimize buffets.\nBetween handling adds and avoiding the Flame Quills, heavy DPS needs to be put out on the boss. In an ideal scenario, Al'ar should die within 2-3 flight cycles.\nKeeping the Adds.\nAlternatively, you can \"save\" the phase 1 adds for phase two (when the enrage timer becomes important). Have melee bring each add to 10% and have a warrior spam Demoralizing Shout and Thunderclap. If you have access to a Paladin tank, they can solo the adds from phase 1 to 10%-20% by spamming Consecration and Holy Shield. The tank will have about 10 adds on him by the end. The damage is difficult to heal through, but not dangerous if the healers pay attention. Once Al'ar has respawned at the start of phase 2, use AoE to kill all the adds simultaneously, and Al'ar will lose about 20% HP instantly. The add tank will usually be knocked away by the first explosion and should not take damage from any of the others; however it is possible to be hit by several and killed. Therefore, it is sensible to Soulstone him. The add tank could also use a &lt;a href=\"Major%20Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Major Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt; before the first add explodes, to avoid high peak damage.\nPhase II.\nPhase II begins right after Al'ar reaches 0%. At this point it will explode for ~5000 fire damage with AoE knockback and reappear roughly at the center of the room, where it will cast a powerful AoE knockback with fire damage. After this, it must be immediately tanked or it will start casting its flame buffets once again. Phase II is not an aggro wipe and Al'ar should fly to the top threat person. But it may decide to stay put and cast flame buffet if not picked up immediately. In case there are still some adds up from phase I, raid should focus on getting them down as soon as possible, preferably before Al'ar casts the first Dive Bomb. Other than that, phase II is all about survivability. Melee DPS should focus on the boss while ranged DPS focuses on the adds and then Al'ar if no adds exist.\nWhile being on the ground, it will occasionally spawn flame patches on random people that work in a similar fashion to void zones. People need to be aware and move away from the fire trails as soon as possible. Al'ar can charge people for 5000 damage leaving them momentarily stunned. It usually flies back to its previous target but can sometimes remain next to the charged target and cast flame buffet until taunted. \nIt also casts a Melt Armor debuff on the current MT every 60 seconds. The other tank must taunt immediately when this happens. Having both tanks wear a high amount of +hit helps a lot. Al'ar's melee damage is fairly weak, so reaching the hit cap is more important than damage mitigation. Note that the current MT can use &lt;a href=\"Moroes%27%20Lucky%20Pocket%20Watch\"&gt;Moroes' Lucky Pocket Watch&lt;/a&gt; every time the debuff is applied. After Dive Bomb, Al'ar sometimes targets the tank having Melt Armor, so the current MT should be ready to taunt, and never move too far away from the other tank. A Warrior MT can also Intervene. While most boss mods will announce when Melt Armor is cast and its duration, it will be beneficial to many to announce this over Vent or Teamspeak. Healers must be ready to change targets when needed.\nLast but not least, while airborne, it will cast Dive Bomb on a seemingly random target. The Meteor does about ~5000 fire damage on a single target and should be survivable or avoided by running from the area. Using consumables/abilities that can mitigate this sort of damage (fire protection potions, ice barrier, mana shield, barkskin etc.) is also recommended. People should be aware of the fact that Al'ar spawns with an AoE fire knockback where the meteor hits the ground as well as with two ember adds, so your raid should move away from that spot as soon as possible. The adds spawn immediately when the meteor hits the ground, whereas Al'ar spawns roughly 2 seconds afterwards, giving a small window to pull the adds out without accidentally hitting or taunting Al'ar. Failure to do so will result in them being knocked across the room taking both fire damage and potentially some falling damage. Also be sure to NOT kill adds during a meteor or Al'ar won't take the 2% damage from its death.\nNote: Everyone should stay off the ramps and in the room completely, if Al'ar targets a person for Dive Bomb while they are on the ramps, Al'ar will evade glitch and go back to full health.\nSoloing Al'ar.\nAl'ar is straightforward, so long as the room is clear before engaging him. Just stand in one spot (on the ground in the center of the arena) and nuke him. Remember that Al'ar must be killed twice, since it is a phoenix."}

Dodge out of the meteors, try to interrupt his volleys, and burst him down as quickly as possible to stave off the Omen.\nQuotes.\nI am Al'tabim the All-Seeing - an envoy of King Rastakhan.\nMy dealings are with priests, mages, and warlocks."}

In this vehicle, the passengers are exposed allowing them to be targeted and attacked \u2014 but also allowing them to do the same. The driver is also in control of both weapons.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; utilized their own version of the demolisher, which took the form of a large cannon powered by an &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nHorde demolishers use a &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt;-powered boiler to fling its projectiles."}

A demon is fundamentally a creature whose &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; is bound to the Twisting Nether, and as such returns to that plane upon death. They can be truly killed only inside the Twisting Nether or in places where its &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;chaotic energies&lt;/a&gt; leak. Most demons were once mortal creatures, who have been turned into demons (a state draenei demonologists call \"man'ari\", meaning 'twisted, unnatural, defiled') by being infused with large quantities of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, usually in the form of a gift or blessing such as the one Sargeras offered the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; or as with the case of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot all demons are sentient, various animals have been transformed into demons for instance, and some started as constructs such as &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s. Though most demons have a deep connection with fel magic, not all of them use it, such as the demons that joined &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and who fed upon his &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;arcane source&lt;/a&gt; of energy instead, freed of the dependence of fel, or &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, a nathrezim infused with &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; magic. Not all demons are evil either, many are neutral such as the &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;s, who serve anyone that would allow them to observe the mysteries of the universe and feed upon all sorts of magic, or the demons serving the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; against the Legion.\nHowever, the vast majority of them joined the Fallen Titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, with only one purpose: destroying all world-souls in the universe.\nOrigins.\nAs the universe formed, the most chaotic energies unleashed by the clash between &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; coalesced into an astral dimension known as the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Light and Void bled together at the borders of this realm, throwing it into turmoil with chaotic magics. Life would arise in the Twisting Nether too in the form of the first demons, born as a result of this clash between the two energies. The Twisting Nether became home to an infinite number of demonic beings, most of whom sought only to destroy life and devour the energies of the livings. Where the Twisting Nether bled into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, demons would pour and destroy civilizations and worlds.\nTo combat the demonic entities that made their way into the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;'s worlds from the Twisting Nether, the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; elected their greatest warrior, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, to act as their first line of defense. Sargeras, the most powerful warrior among the Pantheon, carried out his duties for countless millennia, seeking out and destroying the demons wherever he could find them.\nAfter realizing that the demons he defeated did not truly die and simply returned to the Twisting Nether to reform, Sargeras created the planet &lt;a href=\"Mardum%2C%20the%20Shattered%20Abyss\"&gt;Mardum, the Plane of Banishment&lt;/a&gt; to which he would bind all the souls of all the demons he'd defeat so when they would return to the Nether, they would reform on Mardum and remain imprisoned for all eternity.\nEventually, Sargeras learned about the fundamental flaw in the universe, a flaw that made his primary purpose an impossible goal. As long as the &lt;a href=\"Void%20lord\"&gt;Void lords&lt;/a&gt; tried to corrupt nascent titans, there could be no peace. Under these circumstances, the struggle was futile. The universe had to be destroyed utterly and remade without the underlying defect. World-souls needed to be gone or there would always be a risk for a &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt; to awaken. Only then could true order be achieved. Thus, Sargeras conceived of a sweeping campaign to bring about the end of all things: the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. To carry out his plan, he shattered Mardum and freed the demons to create the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, an infinite army who would annihilate all life in the universe.\nCharacteristics.\nDemons transcend &lt;a href=\"alternate%20timeline\"&gt;all realities&lt;/a&gt;, destroying their possible worlds. Their spirits are tethered to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and, as such, when demons are killed, their souls are sent back to the Twisting Nether, where they await for some time to be reborn in new bodies, with all the knowledge of their previous lives. Thus, demons can only be destroyed in the Twisting Nether, in places where it bleeds into the world of mortals, or in places utterly saturated with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;. Not all of a demon's power returns to the Twisting Nether, however.\nPhysical death for a demon is not a pleasant experience however for it still causes pain, even though they're temporary, as multiple demons have expressed anger and despair about their deaths. Since the recent story development of demons being immortal and being able to reform and return from the Nether, a phenomenon that is now often reflected through their quotes, this behavior has been more and more diluted. It is very common now for demons to refer to their future return or virtual defeat, and some demons have used this fact as a taunt. When a demon is killed in the Great Dark Beyond, their soul drifts calmly in the Twisting Nether, which &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; describes as a pleasant experience, before being dragged by &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; and reborn, although not before their soul is punished severely for failure.\nMost demons' hunger for life and magic can never be sated for long. Their innate cruelty makes a moot point of whatever temporary satisfaction they can know. As a result, destruction tends to follow these demons, whether or not they are part of the Legion. If a demon cannot maintain a source of magic, they will weaken and perish.\nChaos, however, does not come easily to all demons - some struggle with the ways of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. That is why some carry an enchanted orb that invokes the rage required of any good demon. It is not known how the orbs are made, or who makes them. Others decided to not follow the Legion at all and serve their own agendas, or band with like-minded people such as the &lt;a href=\"Shivarra\"&gt;Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; serving &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; against Sargeras. However rebellion against the Legion is heavily punished, normally with eternal torture, as was done to &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;; forced submission as was done to &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;; or death as happened to &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemon blood is a potent &lt;a href=\"demonology\"&gt;demonology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reagent\"&gt;spell component&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome demons slake their lust with coupling, just like mortals. The &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; prefer to do so with violence instead.\nDemonic traits.\nDemons can possess various characteristics, though they don't necessarily each possess all of them.\nAlteration.\nSome demons that were not born demons can be redeemed from their demonic forms into who they originally were. While there has long been speculation on this topic, one recorded example of complete demonic redemption exists: the satyr &lt;a href=\"Avrus%20Illwhisper\"&gt;Avrus Illwhisper&lt;/a&gt;. After assisting the player in curing a sick girl in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; as a toll, Avrus was purged of his demonic shell by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s blessing, turning back into a night elf and being renamed Avrus the Redeemed. Based on Avrus' experience, it seems possible that someone who is truly repentant and is willing to earn a powerful enough blessing can regain mortality even after corruption.\nDemons can also be altered magically, for example &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, a member of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Grand Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, is a Light-infused nathrezim. Demons altered by this way are also capable of traits such as altruism and compassion. There are also void-infused satyrs and imps in service of the Old Gods and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; freed many demons from the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s magic by feeding them the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy held within the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Shrine of Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemonic death.\nDemons killed outside of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; simply return to the Nether, where their souls drift until they are reborn. When Sargeras expressed displeasure with the time it took for his armies to regenerate in this manner, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; suggested that they could infuse a nascent &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; with Death energies to great a so-called \"resurrection engine\" that would allow slain demons to return almost instantaneously. The result of this scheme was the death titan &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, through whom all soldiers of the Burning Legion would return upon their deaths. Once slain, demons leave their old bodies behind to rot like any normal mortal creatures. The bodies can eventually be resurrected through &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;.\nDemons killed within the Twisting Nether however, or in areas saturated with fel, die permanently.\nThere is contradicting information regarding the regeneration of demons slain on the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. On one hand, it was established that:\nOn the other hand, on Argus:\nDemon souls thus seemed to survive even after being killed on Argus, which should be impossible as Argus is supposed to be situated in the Twisting Nether. When asked about this, &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Feasel\"&gt;Jeremy Feasel&lt;/a&gt; replied that \"[we were] free to speculate\", which was likely in reference to the audio-drama published not long after the tweet and which answered some questions.\nIn the RTS.\nIn \"Warcraft I\" and \"II\", demons were referred to as daemons, which is a variation of the term demon.\nIn the RPG.\nDemons (aka the demonspawn) are evil creatures that inspire dread and fear in mortals. Almost all demons are members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a group with phenomenal power, that roams the cosmos preying on worlds. All demons are evil.\nMost demons were once mortal creatures found on the worlds conquered by the Burning Legion, but have been transformed by their conversion into demonic beings. This change includes a powerful command of &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy. They define and control this arcane power with the force of their will, much as sorcerers and wizards do.\nThe demonic usage of magic will deploy &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic, which uses the blood of demons to create the most corrupt and ultimate type of arcane magic. This type of magic exists naturally in demonic blood. As a result, \"fel\" and \"demonic\" is often considered the same, and the trait of being affected by \"fel\" is one of the most distinctive attributes of the demonic. Fel magic used by other creatures (often acquired by drinking demon blood) will grant demonic powers and, if enough is applied, even &lt;a href=\"Fel%23Effects%20on%20beings\"&gt;transform&lt;/a&gt; them into demons.\nIn \"\" there is a distinct breed of demons which use the \"demonic\" subtype. This kind of &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; are described in \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt; and as told before the description doesn't match the demons described in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the \"Manual of Monsters\" the term \"demon\" refers to the minions of the Burning Legion, but in the section of \"demons\" of the Appendix Three they refer to the demons of . However, the validity of the Appendix Three is disputed."}

They made a pact, long ago, to fight against the forces of chaos using its own terrible powers against it. These mysterious warriors ritually blind themselves so that they develop 'spectral sight' that enables them to see demons and undead with greater clarity. They wield demonically charged warblades in battle and even call upon demonic energies to augment their formidable combat skills. Although they are counted as some of the mightiest warriors within the Night Elves' society, the Demon Hunters are always maligned and misunderstood for making their selfless pact with darkness.\nIn ', Demon Hunters can be switched to be Demon Huntresses instead.\nHero names.\nShadowsong, Shadowfury, Shadowstalker, Flameseeker, Darkweaver, Darkterror, Darksorrow, &lt;a href=\"Sindweller\"&gt;Sindweller&lt;/a&gt;, Painkiller, Hellbourne, Wrathbringer, Ragerunner, Firebrand, Bloodwrath, Terrorblade.\nInformation.\nThough the Demon Hunter is a rather uncommon Hero used by Night Elf players due to the attention he demands compared to a &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Keeper of the Grove&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the fact that he lacks an aura often means most players ignore him. However, when a Demon Hunter is used by an experienced player, he is one of the Night Elves' most dangerous Heroes.\nThe Demon Hunter is similar to the Orcish &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt; in physical attributes. Both Heroes specialize in Agility and come with very high starting damage compared to other Heroes, thanks to both their raw damage and Agility increasing the attack speed of the Hero. However, a Blademaster's skills primarily serve to hamper specific enemy units, while a Demon Hunter has more versatility with his skills.\nMana Burn is one of the Demon Hunter's most notorious skills on his list. Though he must get close to the target to combust their mana, it is an incredibly feared skill because at level 3, it burns up to 150 mana per each cast with little mana used on his own. It's extremely effective against other enemy Heroes, such as &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;s who have devastating skills but poor mana pools. Constantly using Mana Burn on Heroes also results in the enemy having to constantly buy mana potions to restore their lost mana, burning a considerable amount of their gold when constantly used.\nImmolation is a somewhat uncommon skill but it's rather useful in creeping because all enemy units next to the Demon Hunter take damage over time. A common creeping tactic with the Demon Hunter is to run in and use Immolation, kill all the Creeps and then return to base to restore health and mana off Moon Wells.\nEvasion allows the Demon Hunter to avoid incoming attacks (but not spells). This doesn't stack with the Talisman of Evasion, so sell those if the Demon Hunter manages to acquire some.\nMetamorphosis is the Demon Hunter's strongest skill - it turns him into a demon himself, granting him additional health, regeneration and a ranged attack that deals chaos damage and has a small AoE. Combined with the Demon Hunter's Agility base, this skill is perfect at taking out groups of clustered enemies.\nA Demon Hunter greatly benefits from health and attack boosting items. This ensures he has enough health to tank incoming attacks, because he has moderately low Strength. He doesn't need much Agility boosts because of his naturally high Agility growth, alongside the fact that an attack boosting item would compliment the Demon Hunter a lot more compared to a single item itself. If possible, try to get the Demon Hunter under the effects of Bloodlust and Unholy Frenzy so he can attack even faster.\nThe Demon Hunter needs lots of support with &lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Huntress&lt;/a&gt;es to distract the enemy so he can sneak in and clean up.\nSpells and abilities.\nMana urn.\nMana Burn is best used against enemy Heroes who rely heavily on their spells. You can also use Mana Burn against annoying enemy spellcasters such as &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;es, or &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIf you use this ability against enemy Heroes you will not get the full amount of damage due to Hero Magic Resistance. High level creeps and some units also have partial resistance if used against them.\nMake sure you check the Mana of the enemy unit before using this ability. Don't waste your mana if they barely have any to cast spells.\nThis spell has little chance of being countered, since it is instant and cannot be interrupted. The only way to properly counter Mana Burn is to have magic resistance or have a Banshee cast Anti-Magic Shell on core units.\nImmoation.\nNotes: Activating Immolation costs only 10 mana, but you need to have at least 20 mana to be able to activate it.\nUse the ability when the Demon Hunter is engaged in combat with the enemy - it drains an immense amount of mana.\nvasion (Passive).\nEvasion is a very powerful ability because it allows the Demon Hunter to avoid attacks and take no damage in return. Try to invest in this ability first so he can survive potentially fatal encounters. This ability will not stack with the Talisman of Evasion (the item is worse than the level 2 counterpart anyways).\nMeamorphosis (Ultimate).\nNotes:\nThe demon hunter will temporarily become a ranged hero that deals chaos damage, gives him additional health and improved health regeneration. The attack also has splash capability so it can be very useful when combined with attack speed boosting items.\nKill the Demon Hunter quickly with focused fire and Heroes who have spells that deal considerable damage."}

Dedicated to destroying the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer was asked to obtain powerful artifacts, the &lt;a href=\"Twinblades%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Twinblades of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt;, both created by the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and carried by the former Illidari, &lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;Varedis Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria Felsoul&lt;/a&gt; respectively.\nObtaining the artifacts.\nTo obtain the Twinblades of the Deceiver, the adventurer and his fellow Illidari wished to speak with a captured &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; lord named Taldath the Destroyer, held in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Warden Alturas was distrustful of the demon hunters, but the adventurer convinced him to let them enter the prison. The Illidari then fought the demon and gained knowledge of Varedis' location - &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Lyana%20Darksorrow\"&gt;Lyana Darksorrow&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illysanna%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Illysanna Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; were sent ahead to &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt;, shortly followed by the adventurer. The demon hunter made their way through the swarms of demons, absorbing their souls and destroying demonic barriers. On their way further, they found the bodies of Lyana and Illysanna. After dealing with &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Commander%20Igrius\"&gt;Fel Commander Igrius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fist%20of%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Fist of the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;, the demon hunter faced Varedis. Although he was encouraged by Kil'jaeden, Varedis was defeated and dropped his warglaives on the ground, before retreating through a portal to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer took up the warglaives and returned to Dalaran.\nTo obtain Aldrachi Warblades, the demon hunter needed a power source for &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Communicator%20%28Dalaran%29\"&gt;Legion communicator&lt;/a&gt; in order to communicate with a group sent to hunt down Caria. To that end, Khadgar was asked for help, and he provided them with a &lt;a href=\"%3ACrystallized%20Soul\"&gt;:Crystallized Soul&lt;/a&gt;. With it, Jace and the ranking Illidari contacted &lt;a href=\"Allari%20the%20Souleater\"&gt;Allari&lt;/a&gt; and learned that her group was overwhelmed by the Legion on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. The demon hunter then proceeded alone on the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Edge\"&gt;Shattered Edge&lt;/a&gt; where they found Allari and freed her. After killing demon soldiers as well as commanders, &lt;a href=\"Doomherald%20Ak%27vesh\"&gt;Doomherald Ak'vesh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doomherald%20Saera\"&gt;Doomherald Saera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Doomherald%20Taraar\"&gt;Doomherald Taraar&lt;/a&gt;, and destroying their portals, they faced off &lt;a href=\"Gorgonnash\"&gt;Gorgonnash&lt;/a&gt;. Then, they tracked Caria into &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Temple\"&gt;Lost Temple&lt;/a&gt; and defeated her. After claiming the warblades, the demon hunters returned to Dalaran."}

He'd known all there was to know about Lordaeron. He lived with his wife &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Fintallas\"&gt;Mina&lt;/a&gt; and daughter &lt;a href=\"Philia%20Fintallas\"&gt;Philia&lt;/a&gt; in their modest but comfortable chambers in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Sometimes, when Parqual was buried deep in tomes, Mina would send Philia to get him supper. When Philia got older, she would assist him by browsing in the library. He and &lt;a href=\"Princess\"&gt;Princess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; knew each other. Once Parqual became an undead, he was unsure what happened to his family, although he knew that his daughter should still be alive. One of few remnants of Parqual's old life was his daughter's teddy bear &lt;a href=\"Brownie%20Bear\"&gt;Brownie&lt;/a&gt;, which she had left behind in Lordaeron when she went to visit &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the Forsaken were strongly discouraged from revisiting their previous life, Parqual tried to smuggle books from his former lodgings, only to get caught and have his tomes confiscated. Over the years, he used the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to sneak his books into the Undercity. The establishment of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; by Parqual's friend &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Vellcinda Benton&lt;/a&gt; gave him a sense of camaraderie because not everyone was content with the ways of the Forsaken culture. He believed that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; should stop forcing them to live again if they did not wish to do so, as well as allow them to embrace their former lives alongside their undead status. As a member of the Council, he attended the ceremony for the Forsaken who experienced their Last Deaths. He spoke about a female warrior who died to a &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nParqual later participated in a meeting with Sylvanas. He wondered whether she ever took her armor off and listened to the rules of the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; that would take place in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. He immediately thought of his daughter Philia and asked Sylvanas if the Forsaken could exchange gifts with their relatives and friends at the Gathering. After Elsie closed the meeting, Parqual briefly spoke with her about the upcoming meeting and her husband &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe day before the Gathering, Parqual met with Elsie at &lt;a href=\"Galen%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Galen's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. He was very excited to meet his daughter, having brought Brownie Bear with him to present to Philia. They noticed &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Lansing\"&gt;Annie Lansing&lt;/a&gt; selling scarves and sachets and he went to take one. On the meeting day, overjoyed, he and his daughter reunited and even held hands. As they discussed their favorite topic, history, Philia suggested he write a firsthand account of the fall of Capital City, something he had previously contemplated, as a Forsaken historian would have a more detailed viewpoint than a Lorderon survivor that had to flee. When she asked about possible future Gatherings, he gently explained that this was likely the only meeting they would ever have, something which Philia refused to accept. This prompted Parqual to go to &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt;'s assistant, whom he had recognized was Calia, and whispered to her to \"be ready\", as \"we need you now.\" With the agreement of the Felstone family with his plan, Parqual attempted to defect to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces at &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, and as he had hoped, Calia realized what was happening and took action to do what she could to help them. Parqual was killed by Sylvanas' &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s as he was running toward Stromgarde. He was &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;buried&lt;/a&gt; by his daughter and the rest of the human attendees that lost friends and family during the bloodshed.\nQuotes.\nIt's always nice when someone wishes to speak to me. How are things with you, &lt;class&gt;?\nMemorial.\nParqual's tombstone at the &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;Gathering graves&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; carries the epitaph:\nPhilia's toy &lt;a href=\"Brownie%20Bear\"&gt;Brownie Bear&lt;/a&gt; sits next to the headstone."}

Parried attacks are negated - no damage is dealt. All melee &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es except &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s have this ability: &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s who specialize into &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20specs\"&gt;enhancement&lt;/a&gt; also gain the ability.\nChance to parry.\nYour chance to parry is based on the formula: % = 5% base chance + contribution from parry rating + contribution from talents + ((Defense skill - attacker's weapon skill) * 0.04)\nYour &lt;a href=\"Combat%20rating%20system\"&gt;Parry Rating&lt;/a&gt; is provided by items that have a Parry Rating bonus.\nIn combat, you will notice that your Parry percentage match what you see on your tooltips. Miss chance and Critical chance are unmodified by Parry, so you're not \"wasting\" Parries on misses nor are you able to Parry a Critical. This may seem odd to some folks if they are expecting a \"if hit, then check if Parry, then check...\" type system. WoW, like many other games, uses a &lt;a href=\"Attack%20table\"&gt;combat results table&lt;/a&gt;-based combat scheme (where one roll determines outcome of an attack), so percentages are absolute. Your parsed Parry won't necessarily match your tooltip if you're fighting creatures higher or lower in level to you.\nHistory.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; expansion, a redesign of parries was contemplated, where a successful parry would cause the next two melee swings from the attacker to deal only 50% damage. This change was apparently never implemented. Instead, parry was reimplemented to provide the same avoidance as &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, a parry also reduced the \"swing timer\" of the defender, effectively giving the defender additional haste. This effect occurred both for characters and mobs, including most bosses. Comments on the mmo-champion forums indicate that the swing timer reset (aka \"parry haste\") is still be in place for characters. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1359489-Blood-tanking-Wanting-more-DPS%3Fp%3D22793386%26amp%3Bviewfull%3D1%23post22793386\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1348361-blood-dk-and-crit%3Fp%3D22552774%26amp%3Bviewfull%3D1%23post22552774\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s were the only non-melee class that could parry. Hunters can no longer parry attacks in exchange for the removal of the minimum range for &lt;a href=\"ranged\"&gt;ranged&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nTrivia.\nParry is one of &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt;'s Basic Abilities in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Some events provide you the information about that event in compact easy-to-use arguments. For example, the REPLACE_ENCHANT event has two arguments, arg1 (the name of the enchant) and arg2 (the name of the item). Other events don't provide you the arguments in such an easy-to-use form. For example, the CHAT_MSG_COMBAT_HONOR_GAIN event has one big long argument, arg1, that looks something like \"Joe dies, honorable kill Rank: Commander (Estimated Honor Points: 10)\". What you really want to know, though, is\nIn order to get this information, you need to parse the big long string.\nWhat's the quick-and-dirty way to parse an event message?\nWell, you can look at how the event message looks, and you can manually write a string.find over that string to extract the information you need. For example,\n function MyHonorTracker_OnEvent()\n if(event == \"CHAT_MSG_COMBAT_HONOR_GAIN\") then\n start, end, killed, rank, honor =\n string.find(arg1, \"(.+) dies, honorable kill Rank: (.+) %(Estimated Honor Points: (.+)%)\");\n if(start) then\n MyHonorTrackingFunction(killed, rank, honor);\n end\n end\n end\n function MyHonorTracker_OnEvent()\n if(event == \"CHAT_MSG_COMBAT_HONOR_GAIN\") then\n if(GetLocale() == \"enUS\") then\n pattern = \"(.+) dies, honorable kill Rank: (.+) %(Estimated Honor Points: (.+)%)\";\n elseif(GetLocale() == \"deDE\") then\n pattern = \"(.+) german-for-dies, german-words: (.+) %(more-german: (.+)%)\";\n elseif(GetLocale() == \"frFR\") then\n pattern = \"french-words (.+) french-words (.+) french-words (.+)\";\n elseif(GetLocale() == \"koKR\") then\n pattern = \"(.+) korean-for-dies, korean-words: (.+) %(more-korean: (.+)%)\"; \n else\n pattern = \"who knows\";\n end\n start, end, param1, param2, param3 = string.find(arg1, pattern);\n if(GetLocale() == \"frFR\") then\n -- correct the order of the parameters\n killed, rank, honor = param2, param1, param3;\n else\n killed, rank, honor = param1, param2, param3;\n end\n if(start) then\n MyHonorTrackingFunction(killed, rank, honor);\n end\n end\n end\nWhat's the clean-and-easy way?\nWell, first, you should extract GlobalStrings.lua out of your WoW install. Then, you will want to look through that file for the variable that contains the template of the message you're looking for. In our case, it is\n COMBATLOG_HONORGAIN = \"%s dies, honorable kill Rank: %s (Estimated Honor Points: %d)\";\nThis variable is the key to this method. Basically, Blizzard has already done the work of creating translations for every language that WoW supports, and they have provided this GlobalStrings.lua to map those translations to common variable names. We just need to figure out how to harness this information.\nHarnessing this information yourself can be quite a task. You need to revise your code to look at this variable, transform the value of this variable into a value suitable for your pattern variable, run your pattern, and then be able to reorder the parameters correctly based on the value of this variable.\nHowever, each AddOn author should not have to do nearly this much work. There's a library called MarsMessageParser. I don't have a link to that file directly, but you will find it as a separate file inside of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//ui.worldofwar.net/ui.php%3Fid%3D291\"&gt;this AddOn&lt;/a&gt;. You can copy MarsMessageParser.lua out of MarsNeedyGreedy and put it in your AddOn, say MyHonorTracker. Make sure MarsMessageParser.lua is listed before MyHonorTracker.lua in your MyHonorTracker.toc file or your MyHonorTracker.xml file. Then, all of the above code can be trimmed down to just this:\n function MyHonorTracker_OnEvent()\n if(event == \"CHAT_MSG_COMBAT_HONOR_GAIN\") then\n MarsMessageParser_ParseMessage(\"MyHonorTracker\", arg1);\n end\n end\nWell, that isn't exactly true: MarsMessageParser also needs to be initialized. Fortunately, this can be done with just one line (put this line somewhere in your initialization area):\n MarsMessageParser_RegisterFunction(\"MyHonorTracker\", COMBATLOG_HONORGAIN, MyHonorTrackingFunction);\nThe parameters to the RegisterFunction function are as follows:\nThe parameters to the ParseMessage function are as follows:\nMarsMessageParser will take care of reading the GlobalStrings.lua, creating the correct pattern for the current locale, re-ordering the parameters accordingly, and finally calling MyHonorTrackingFunction with three parameters: killed, rank, and honor.\nWhat's the Clean-And-Not-So-Easy way?\nIf you don't want to download the MarsMessageParser and include it in your addon, the thing you're left to do is find a way to do it yourself. But rather than develop a ton of code, you just want to \"hardwire\" your addon for just the string you want to use, rather than the infinite amount of infinite variables in every string in GlobalStrings.lua.\nWell, let's look at FACTION_STANDING_INCREASED. According to GlobalStrings.lua, this says \"Reputation with %s increased by %d.\" Well, to make it work like the strings at the top, we'd need to replace %s and %d with (.+). But how do we do that? Here's how:\n newpattern = string.gsub(string.gsub(FACTION_STANDING_INCREASED, \"(%%s)\", \"(.+)\"), \"(%%d)\", \"(.+)\")\n start, end, faction, amount = string.find(string, newpattern)\nThis example will properly parse the string, and return all the information we need. How was this achieved? By using a % in front of the %s, it tells it to look for %s in stead of a space, which is what %s would normally be looking for. This way, even though we have to hardcode in the strings we want, we can also don't have to bother with translations."}

The leader cannot keep a member in the party if he wants to leave but can remove a member.\nLeadership.\nYou can identify the &lt;a href=\"leader\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; of a party by the small crown icon () by their portrait.\nIn a party created by manually inviting, the leader of the party can &lt;a href=\"invite\"&gt;invite&lt;/a&gt; new members to the party, &lt;a href=\"uninvite\"&gt;uninvite&lt;/a&gt; current members to remove them from the party, or &lt;a href=\"Promote%20to%20Leader\"&gt;promote&lt;/a&gt; another party member to be leader. The leader can set the &lt;a href=\"Loot%23Older%20looting%20methods\"&gt;settings and quality threshold&lt;/a&gt; to control how loot gets distributed.\nIn a party created with the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; tool, the party leader is instead the \"Party Guide\", with less powers. He cannot change the loot distribution mechanism, and cannot unilaterally remove members.\nAs with any party member, the leader can also &lt;a href=\"Leave%20Party\"&gt;leave the party&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, another player will be chosen at random to become the new leader.\nCommunication.\nParty members communicate with:\ncodice_1 \nor \ncodice_2.\nInvitation, removal, leaving and promotion.\nAnybody can form a party (thus becoming the leader) by inviting some who isn't already in a party.\nHow to invite.\nThe would be leader can invite members to a party with:\nHow to remove.\nA party leader can remove (also known as \"boot\" or \"kick\") members from a party with:\nHow to leave.\nA party member can remove themselves from a party with:\nHow to promote.\nA party leader can make another member the leader with:\nExperience.\nA way to increase &lt;a href=\"XP\"&gt;XP&lt;/a&gt; gain is forming a party of three to five players (the bonus does not apply to two-man parties). A multiplied amount of XP is shared by members in the same area when a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; is defeated by a member, the factor increasing with each additional player in the party. The division of XP among party members is an &lt;a href=\"Mob_experience%23Group_Experience\"&gt;unknown calculation&lt;/a&gt; based on the various &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;s of the party members, the level of the mob, and other factors.\nLooting.\nAlso see &lt;a href=\"Loot%23Looting%20While%20In%20A%20Party\"&gt;Looting While In A Party&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Loot\"&gt;Loot&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"This section is mostly stolen from the &lt;a href=\"Newbie%20Guide\"&gt;Newbie Guide&lt;/a&gt;. -\"\n&lt;a href=\"Looting\"&gt;Looting&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt;s in World of Warcraft are fairly straightforward. If the corpse of a monster has gold sparkles on top of it, it means there's something on the corpse that you can loot. Once you loot a corpse, if you don't take everything off it, everyone else in your group will have the option to loot.\nThere are a few different looting types in parties called the \"loot level\" or \"loot option\" that can be set by the party leader by right-clicking on his own portrait in the upper left. Two of these types are affected by the \"&lt;a href=\"Loot%20Quality%20Threshold\"&gt;loot quality threshold&lt;/a&gt;\", also set by the leader (the threshold can be set to Uncommon, Rare, or Epic). If an item is equal or higher quality than the loot quality threshold, party members are given the option to Roll (from 1 - 100) to get the item or Pass.\nMoney loot is always shared in a party regardless of loot type. However, if a party member is out of range when a monster is killed, and so did not contribute to the kill, he will not receive a share of any gold found on a corpse and will not be able to roll for any special items found. Thus it is important not to release if you die during a boss fight, as you will not be able to loot, and you can't re-enter the instance during the fight anyway."}

Major patches (Patch X.Y) can include new instances, zones and features. Minor patches (Patch X.Y.Z) can also add new game features, instances and scenarios, but tend to focus on updates such as balance changes. &lt;a href=\"Hotfixes\"&gt;Hotfixes&lt;/a&gt; are small, instant changes to the game, which are done server-side and require no download or server takedown (majority of the time).\nFAQ.\nAs of 31 January 2005, patches consist of \"content patches\" (x.y.x), a \"minor patch\" (x.x.y), &lt;a href=\"hotfix\"&gt;hotfix&lt;/a&gt;es, or a &lt;a href=\"localization%20patch\"&gt;localization patch&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarting with \"Legion\", medium-sized patches were introduced as \"x.x.5\" which may feature some new content such as events or questchains, with &lt;a href=\"patch%207.1.0\"&gt;patch 7.1.0&lt;/a&gt; being an example of these patches and continuing with the \".5\" going forward. \"Dragonflight\" extended the medium-sized patches by doing \"x.x.7\" patches as well such as &lt;a href=\"patch%2010.0.7\"&gt;patch 10.0.7&lt;/a&gt; with more planned.\nOn Wowpedia, the first patch (unless otherwise noted) of an expansion is called the systems patch but still classify as a content patch above."}

Raid groups will be able to fight together in instance dungeons and work together to accomplish tasks too difficult for five member groups. Once a group reaches five members, it can be converted into a raid group. Raid groups can support up to 40 members and can be accessed by opening the Raid group tab in the Social window. Not all raid group functionality is complete. However, we encourage our players to try it out and give us feedback on the new feature through the /suggest function.\nThe Deeprun Tram opens!\nThe Gnomish Engineering Corps has been hard at work building a subway to connect the great cities of Ironforge and Stormwind City. Final work on this new mass transit system was completed recently, allowing us to announce the Grand Opening of the Deeprun Tram! Two trains make round trip runs between Stormwind City and Ironforge regularly, allowing quick and easy access to all your shopping and training needs. If you happen to miss a train, you only need to wait a few minutes for a new one to appear. We only ask that you be careful during your trip as the run out of the tunnel can be long and uneventful should you happen to fall off the tram during transit.\nTrade Skills become Professions.\nMost trade skills are being renamed to \"professions,\" and the way in which players acquire and learn them is changing. You will no longer learn different professions by paying for them with skill points. You'll still learn them by speaking to the appropriate profession trainer. However, players will now be restricted to learning two professions. We decided to change the skill system to make it simpler, balanced, and more intuitive. The new system should allow everyone to participate in one to two professions, and create a much more vibrant market for goods generated from professions.\nThe professions are: &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"herbalism\"&gt;herbalism&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leatherworking\"&gt;leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"tailoring\"&gt;tailoring&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral old trade skills are being turned into secondary skills. These do not count toward your two-profession limit, so players can learn all three secondary skills, in addition to their two professions, without restriction. The survival skill is being removed and campfires have been folded into the cooking profession.\nThe secondary skills are: &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"first%20aid\"&gt;first aid&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo More Skill Points.\nWith the changes to trade skills, skill points (SP) will be removed from the game, and currency will be used instead to train skills formerly based on SP.\nMount trainers will now require you to have a certain level of reputation with their respective city in order to acquire a mount.\nCharacters that had trained in more than two professions have had excess professions randomly removed to meet the two profession restriction.\nLevel Cap Raised.\nThe level cap has been increased to 60. Some new zones, quests, items, and content have been added to accommodate the level increase.\nOther Changes.\nPublic Transportation:.\nNew Flight Paths\nThe Horde flight path node in Desolace has been moved to Shadowprey Village in the southwest of the zone.\nNew World Travel\nBecause of these changes, players now do not start with any flight node other than their starting city. On the Alliance side, Night Elves get Auberdine, Dwarves and Gnomes get &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and Humans get &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. On the Horde side, Tauren get &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, Orcs and Trolls get &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and Undead get &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;."}

Specifically, we have added hardware vertex shader support and a hardware cursor for those cards that support it. Because we are still transitioning to the new system you will experience some incomplete animation features or graphical glitches while playing this patch. Please report any issues you may find using the /bug command from within the game.\nWarlock Talents Added.\nWarlock talents have been partially implemented. Two talent trees, Destruction and Affliction, are now in the game. Changes continue to be made to Warlock talents, and include modification of the present talents and the addition of a third talent tree to be announced later. Warlocks can now utilize the talent interface by pressing the Talents button next to the Spellbook and Abilities button, or by pressing the N default hotkey."}

Item durability is an important aspect of World of Warcraft that will work to stabilize the economy, decrease inflation specifically in the high end game, and in general keep prices of player sold items lower than normally would occur without such a feature. Durability should also add additional depth to the game since players will have more variety in their items and more abilities will be added over time to interact with durability. Item durability is different from item decay in that players will never lose items through item durability.\nDurability key points\nRaid Groups.\nRaid groups will no longer receive quest bounties and collections. In the future, we plan to have raid-specific quests that will be possible to complete in raid groups."}

The real way to get them to play is by signing them up for the Alpha. See Below: \nRefer a Friend or Family Member to Join the Alpha! \nFirst of all, we are expanding the Friends and Family program. By e-mailing your Blizzard contact, you be able to refer a friend or two to join us in the Alpha.

This is due in part to all of the changes in our low level areas, the new combat system and the addition of the rest state. We feel that its important to test world advancement from the ground up and we want to take this opportunity to do so.\nSecondly, with the new skill system in place, we want to find a way to convert older characters to the new system without having to do a character wipe.\nRest State, Inns &amp; Hearthstones.\nTo broaden and balance some of the gameplay elements, we've incorporated a few new features. One of them is the Rest State modifier, which gives players a time-limited bonus to combat (PvE) experience. This frees up time for exploring other aspects of the game without penalty, such as tradeskilling and social activities, and helps players avoid level-grinding. We've also added Inns, which serve as a good place to hang up your sword or staff for the night because they confer special bonuses. Inns also act as home locations, which our third new feature, Hearthstones, take advantage of. Hearthstones provide a speedy way to travel back to an Inn when you need to take care of business in town or when you're ready to check in and call it a night. The basics of these new features are covered below.\nNew Skill System.\nThe new skill system is in place! Players now earn skill points based on experience points gained from killing monsters. Earned skill points can be spent on tradeskills, weapon proficiencies or to increase attributes.\nThe new skill UI is in place. You will be able to increase your attributes by spending skill points. Attributes will cost different amounts to increase depending on your class. Attributes with a green bar are your characters primary attributes and will cost the least, while attributes displayed with a red bar are less necessary attributes and will be the most expensive.\nNew Weapon skills will now be purchased with skill points allowing a wider variety of weapons being available to any given class. Different weapons will have different skill point costs associated with them.\nFinally, tradeskills will still be purchased with skill points. You will still need to buy the tradeskills at the tradeskill trainer.\nTalents Disabled.\nSome of the talent functionality, like increasing attributes, has been moved to our new skill system. The rest of the Talent system is being reworked and therefore disabled. Don't worry, you will get talents back, and they will be even cooler than before!\nMonster Claiming.\nNow the first player or group to damage a monster will \"tap\" them. When the tapped monster dies, that player or group will get the experience and loot from the kill. Other players will be able to tell if a monster is tapped because it's portrait will turn grey. Players are free to help kill the tapped monster, but they will receive no experience or loot from the kill. Even with help, the player or group who initially tapped the monster will gain full experience from the kill. In situations where a much higher level player helped with the kill, some of the experience reward will be reduced.\nExperience Distribution Changes.\nAs players become higher level, they will be able to receive experience from a large range of monsters. At low levels, you may get experience from monsters 5 levels lower than you, while at level 60 you will gain experience from monsters 12 levels lower. In the future we will add a user interface to monster portraits so you will always know which monsters give experience for your level.\nQuest Rewards.\nQuest rewards are now labeled as Bind on Acquire. Quest rewards can still be equipped or sold to a merchant, but you will no longer be able to sell or give them to other players. This has been implemented to deter these items from flooding the game economy.\nWorld.\nMany objects in the world such as buildings, dungeons and cities have undergone a significant data format change to reduce memory usage, increase render performance and minimize future patch sizes.\nCloaks.\nDue to popular demand, cloaks have been made visible. This will help players customize their characters even more than before.\nOther Changes.\nGuild System.\nGuild creation is now in the game as intended, and here is how it works:"}

{"id": "18860", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18860", "title": "Patch 0.7", "text": "Patch 0.7 was a &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; patch for \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" that released on 15 June 2004.\nToday's patch features the start of &lt;a href=\"Player%20vs.%20Player\"&gt;Player vs. Player&lt;/a&gt; testing for the World of Warcraft beta test, and we are pleased to announce the opening of an additional realm for this purpose. This new Player vs. Player realm is an all-out Horde vs. Alliance server, where the factions can finally battle! If this rollout is completed successfully, we will then officially begin the next phase of the World of Warcraft beta test and add the next round of testers. Due to the amount of changes and new content being implemented in this patch, we will be distributing the updated version of the beta via the Blizzard Downloader.\nPlease be sure to completely delete World of Warcraft from your computer prior to starting the download.\nWhen entering the character-creation/selection area, players will see a \"Realm Down\" message and notice that their characters appear to be gone. This is because there are two servers available now. Please click on the \"Change Realm\" button to select one of the two available servers. The regular beta server will contain all of the old characters, and the PvP server will have no characters available.\nMajor Changes.\nStandard Player vs. Environment Server.\nCurrently, players now have the ability to attack almost all opposing faction NPCs including vendors and quest givers. If a player attacks an opposing faction NPC, players of the opposite faction are then able to target and attack that player. Whenever an NPC is attacked, players who share the same faction as that NPC will receive a system message indicating that a specific town is under attack.\nPlease be aware that some quest NPCs might not always be available. If they have been killed, players should wait for the NPC to respawn. The development team expects there to be some bugs associated with this so be sure to /bug and /suggest whenever necessary.\nActions that will enable PvP on the standard player vs. environment server are: attacking an NPC of the opposing faction, attacking a player who attacked an NPC, and/or aiding a player engaged in PvP. Players will also have the ability to enable PvP on their own by using the /pvp command. Once PvP has been enabled by a player, no matter what the method, it will remain in effect for five minutes.\nIn time, all standard servers will include a consensual Player vs. Player system called &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. Once Battlegrounds has been implemented, players will have the ability to attack other players to defend their cities and towns from invasion. We expect the Battlegrounds system to be available later during the beta test.\nHorde vs. Alliance Race War Server.\nThe new Horde vs. Alliance race war server will establish a straightforward method for the development team to test and balance the races and classes in a PvP environment. PvP concepts will be gradually introduced on this server. This means that the initial implementation of PvP is not how our final model will work once World of Warcraft is released. This patch includes the fundamental ideas of PvP in order to tune and refine the very foundation of our PvP model.\nOn the Horde vs. Alliance race war server, territories will be indicated whenever a player enters a new zone. The zone name will now include additional information to inform the player of the territories status. Additionally, the mini-map will be color coded to indicate who controls the zone: Green = Friendly, Red = Enemy and Yellow = Contested.\nPlayers will be able to initiate player vs. player combat based on what territory they are in. Players in friendly territories are safe unless they decide to engage an opposing faction player in combat. Players in enemy territories will always be at risk and can be attacked by all players that belong in the territory. All players can be attacked in neutral (contested) territories.\nActions that will enable a player for PvP status on the Horde vs. Alliance race war server will be: entering or being in an enemy territory, entering or being in a contested territory, attacking an NPC of the opposing faction, attacking another player, and/or aiding a player engaged in PvP. Players will also be able to enable PvP on their own by using the /pvp command. Once PvP has been enabled for a player, no matter what the method, it will remain in effect for five minutes.\nRest State Changes.\nThe Rest State system has undergone several changes. There are now three tiers of rest states: Rested = 200% experience, Normal = 150% experience and Tired = 100% experience.\nThe rest timer is much more flexible than before, allowing players to gradually accumulate incremental rest credit for all time spent logged out. Additionally, people who do not log into World of Warcraft for several days will gain bonus rest credit. This will allow those who only play once or twice a week the added bonus of playing as rested (200% experience) for longer periods of time than those who play on a daily basis.\nPlayers also have the ability to rest anywhere in the world. This should help players who forget or choose not to log off at an inn. Resting at an inn is still the preferred method, as rest credit will accumulate four times faster for players logged off inside of an inn.\nLastly, the Rest State modifier is now level-based using a sliding scale to determine how much experience you can gain at each tier instead of the previous flat 20,000 experience per level.\nEnter the City to Rest.\nWhen visiting one of the six main cities (&lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Undercity\"&gt;The Undercity&lt;/a&gt;), players will no longer need to check into the inn to rest. Players will however still need to seek an innkeeper to receive a hearthstone or to bind themselves to the city.\nIn this initial implementation, there will be some areas close to the cities that will allow a player to rest without actually being in the city. There are also some areas within each city that are not currently activated for resting. Please be sure to check the character portrait to ensure that the character is resting before logging off. The team is aware of this and will continue to work through these areas.\nAs before, you will still need to rest at an Inn in smaller towns.\nSkill System Changes.\nThe focus of the skill system is to allow characters the ability to choose secondary skills. As such, attributes will now raise automatically when a character levels. As a result of this change, characters will receive fewer skill points than before.\nCurrent characters may lose some skill points to compensate for the redesign of the Skill System. In some instances, characters may fall into a negative skill point status if they have already spent more skill points than the new system will a lot them.\nOld Characters Unlocked.\nAll of the older characters from previous patches have been unlocked and are available once again. The older characters have all been assigned skill points as appropriate for their levels. Their talents have been disabled.\nItems Deleted.\nWith a few exceptions, all items and currency are being deleted for this patch. The following items will not be deleted: &lt;a href=\"Bag\"&gt;Bag&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Key\"&gt;Scarlet Key&lt;/a&gt;, all Shaman &lt;a href=\"Totem\"&gt;Totem&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;. Each character will be assigned funds based on their level.\nPlayers will be able to redo quests that have already been completed in order to gain back quest items.\nQuests Reset.\nAll quest progress for existing characters has been reset. Characters have the ability to go back and redo all quests if they wish. For players that were in the middle of a quest chain, those quests will need to be restarted from the beginning.\nQuests were reset to allow players the means for reacquiring lost quest items and to participate in the many quests that have been fixed and rebalanced.\nResistances.\nThe beginnings of the new resistance system are in the game. Players and some creatures now have the ability to resist damage from offensive spells and abilities based on their total resistance, their level and the level of the person or creature causing the damage.\nNew items, with better resistances, will be available in the future.\nIntroduction Cinematic For All Races.\nA cinematic is now available for each race and will be played after character creation takes place.\nPostal System Introduced.\nPlayers now have the ability to send and receive in-game mail through World of Warcraft's postal system. Every inn has a mailbox that players can right click in order to access mailbox functionality.\nThere are several types of mail:\nNormal Mail will arrive at its destination immediately while Packages and C.O.D items will take one hour to arrive.\nMail can be sent to players by NPCs.\nLevel Cap Raised.\nThe level cap has been increased to 45. New zones, quests, items and content have been added to accommodate the level increase along with the ability to purchase and ride mounts!\nMounts.\nRace specific &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s are now available. A player can train in any mount; however, the skill points necessary to train for a mount assigned to a different race will cost significantly more skill points.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; spell to summon the &lt;a href=\"Felsteed\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, a Warlock specific mount, is available as well. The &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s class specific mount, the &lt;a href=\"Charger\"&gt;Charger&lt;/a&gt;, will be available at a later date.\nWide Screen Support.\nSupport for wide screen ratios (16:9, 16:10 and 5:4) have been added as a fullscreen choice. The video options have been enhanced to list individual display resolution modes. At this time, windowed mode will still be limited to a 4:3 ratio.\nMacintosh OS Upgrade.\nWorld of Warcraft beta testers using the Macintosh version will need to upgrade their OS to OS X 10.3.4 or World of Warcraft will not run. OS X 10.3.4 is a free upgrade from any previous 10.3 releases and contains OpenGL drivers that are now necessary for World of Warcraft to operate on a Macintosh system.\nOther Changes.\nThe Barrens:.\nAs promised, many changes have been implemented in The Barrens with more to come in the future:"}

The Auctioneer's are faction specific, allowing Alliance characters to trade with other Alliance characters and Horde characters to trade with other Horde characters. Each city's Auction House is run independently; all Auctioneers that exist in the same city are all a part of the same Auction House.\nOne non-faction based Auction House is located in &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The Booty Bay Auctioneer NPCs have the same functionality as the aforementioned faction based Auction Houses, with the additional capability of allowing trade between Horde and Alliance characters.\nSellers are able to place items up for auction, set a starting price, set the auction duration and include a buyout price by speaking with an Auctioneer.\nAll auctions will be initially charged a deposit fee; the deposit fee is refunded upon the successful sale of the item. All successful sales are charged an auction consignment fee which is extracted directly from the final sale price. All fees are higher in Booty Bay.\nBuyers are able to search through items up for auction, place bids and purchase items that include buyout prices by speaking with the Auctioneer. Players are not able to place bids on items being sold by a character on their own account.\nAll items won at an Auction House will be delivered through the in-game mail system.\nTalent System.\nTalents are now available for the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt; classes! Players can open the talent interface by using the \"Talents\" button which resides next to the \"Spellbook and Abilities\" button, or by pressing the \"N\" default hotkey.\nTalents will eventually be available for all classes.\nPvP Changes.\nPlayers that die in PvP, either versus another player or versus a PvP-Flagged NPC must now wait 2 minutes before resurrecting at their corpse. This delay does not apply to players that are resurrected by other players or by using resurrection items.\nControl types of spells such as Charm, Fear and Stun will now be subject to diminishing returns. This means that if a second spell of the same type is used against the same player within 15 seconds of the first effect wearing off, the second spell's duration will be reduced by 50%, the third's duration will be reduced by 75% and the player will be immune to the fourth casting.\nClick to Move.\nA new option has been added under Video Options called Click to Move (by default this option is off). Players will need to turn it on to use this new functionality by clicking on Options, Video Options and then checking the radio box next to Click to Move.\nClick to Move is an auto-interaction feature that will allow players to do several things by using their mouse. With Click to Move turned on, a player can do the following:\nWe are aware of several problems with this new interface. Please use the /bug feedback form to submit any bugs that you find.\nRest State Changes.\nThe Rest State system has undergone several changes. There are now two tiers of rest states: Rested = 200% experience and Normal = 100% experience.\nAt level one, players will all start in the normal tier. When a player rests be it in a city or at an inn they will gain rest bonus at a very slow rate. Eight hours of rest will be needed for a player to gain one \"bubble\" of rest bonus. At any given time, players will be able to accumulate a maximum of 30 \"bubbles\" worth of rest bonus which translates into approximately 1.5 levels worth of rested play (before your character returns to normal rest state).\nThe changes to the Rest State have been made with the understanding that most players will be in the Normal experience tier most of the time. The Rested tier is primarily intended for players that take a day or more off from playing or are very casual with their play schedules. This has enabled us to greatly reduce the experience necessary for all players to level regardless of which rest state tier they play under.\nNew Guard System.\nA new guard system has been added. This new system will enable NPCs to call for guards when they see an enemy as well as when they are attacked. The guards will chase players and then return to the NPC that called for help once they lose track of, or kill the player. If a guard is killed, another guard will be called to take its place. There is a limit to how many guards each town can have which will recharge over time. The cities that currently have the new Guard System in place are: &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thelsamar\"&gt;Thelsamar&lt;/a&gt;. The Guard System will be implemented in other cities in future patches.\nLevel Cap Raised.\nThe level cap has been increased to 50. New zones, quests, items and content have been added to accommodate the level increase."}

Hunters track, tame, and slay all manner of animals and beasts found in the wild. Whether they rely on bows or firearms, Hunters consider their weapons and pets to be their only true friends. Races allowed to become Hunters are the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;Dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;.\nHunters are great for pulling monsters as they are able to set traps that hinder monsters that the Hunters pull to attack. Hunters are also able to use various beast-related special abilities, take on bestial traits that give them supernatural powers, control and tame beasts, and use a wide variety of ranged attacks complimented by a few melee abilities.\nHunters are closely related to their pets and must remember to always keep their pet's happiness in mind. When using a pet, Hunters will notice an icon in the top left corner of their screen that depicts their pet's happiness. The more Hunters use their pets, the lower their pet's level of happiness will become. Hunters should always remember to feed their pets to raise their pet's level of happiness or worry about their pet abandoning them or even attacking the Hunter! Hunters are also the only class able to name their pets.\nThe Hunter can use the following weapons: Axes, Daggers, Guns or Bows, Crossbows (with training), Fist Weapons (with training), Spears (with training), Staves (with training), Swords, (with training), Thrown (with training), Two-Handed Axes (with training), Two-Handed Swords (with training). The Hunter can use the following armor: Cloth, Leather, Shields, and Mail (at level 40, with training).\nBoats and Zeppelins.\nOur first pass at Boats and Zeppelins has been added to the world in two locations. A boat has been added between Booty Bay and Ratchet, and a Zeppelin has been added between Orgrimmar and Tirisfal. A second zeppelin has also been added between Grom'gol and Orgrimmar. The round trip on all three of these new transports is around five minutes, with a pause at each destination of one minute each. If you miss a transport, you will have a very short wait before it returns. If you log out or crash during your journey, you will log back in on the same transport you were on when you logged out, although you will likely be at a different location along its path. Because this was the original intention for our world travel, the instant teleport NPCs have been removed. Please do not jump off of Boats and/or Zeppelins when riding them. Keep in mind that the Goblin Transit Authority is not responsible for accidents of this nature and you may land in a place where you cannot reach your corpse.\nTalent System.\nTalents are now available for the Priest and Rogue classes! Priest and Rogue players can now utilize the talent interface by using the \"Talents\" button, which resides next to the \"Spellbook and Abilities\" button, or by pressing the \"N\" default hotkey.\nTalents for other classes will continue to be added as the beta progresses. Please note that all Mages and Warriors have had their talent points refunded. You will now start earning talent points at level 10.\nFinally, for the duration of the beta, you will be able to find an NPC in each city that will allow you to reset your talent points and experiment with different talent paths. (Note: this option is ONLY available in the beta).\nLevel Cap Raised.\nThe level cap has been increased to 55. New zones, quests, items, and content have been added to accommodate the level increase.\nItem Stats Changed.\nItems have had a major overhaul. Armor values, damage, stats, and resists have been modified to reflect current play balance. Some items have also had their level requirements changed. Items that were subjected to this change and that were equipped on a character prior to the patch have been placed in the character's bag. If a character did not have space in its bags, please make room in that character's bags and re-login. Below are additional changes to items in general.\nSharing Quests.\nYou can now share your quests with your entire party.

Each race receives at least 4 traits (several passive and at least one active trait per race). Undead racial traits have changed to be more consistent with the new traits and Undead players are now considered Humanoid targets rather than Undead targets. The following is a full list of traits:\nNew Raid Encounters.\nRumors of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, an enormous black dragon, have been heard through out &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Swifter and slightly smaller than their wild cousins, kodo &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s nevertheless demonstrate the same resilience and fearlessness found in their untamed brethren, traits that serve them well when bearing their equally resolute riders. It is said that only the most virtuous of tauren can win the affection of a kodo war mount, for these mighty beasts only serve those that approach them with honor and respect in their hearts.\nTauren players will no longer have the &lt;a href=\"Plainsrunning\"&gt;Plainsrunning&lt;/a&gt; ability, due to the availability of Kodo mounts. Tauren players can purchase the Kodo mount at &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof village&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeneral Changes.\nMiscellaneous:.\n[[Category:World of Warcraft patches|1.01.0]]\n[[es:Parche 1.1.0]]"}

This was done to prevent the economy from being flooded with overly valuable items, and to ensure that players weren't acquiring too much gold during what we'd consider a reasonable amount of play-time. We realize that many players enjoy repeated trips to their favorite dungeons, so we've made this new limitation as least restrictive as possible. Each character on a player's account may enter the same dungeon up to three times per day, and may visit a total of five dungeons over the course of a twenty-four hour period. Keep in mind, each character on your account is flagged separately so with eight characters, that's a total of 40 dungeon-runs per day!\nFlightpath Scenery Improvements!\nTired of seeing the same old flightpaths? We've completely reworked each flightpath in the game so that the angle and view are shifted just enough to give all of Azeroth's traveling inhabitants the feeling that they are headed to an all new destination. That's not all, each flightpath has been fleshed out to ensure that the player sees every single detail of the passing terrain, which means that for the same reasonable traveling cost, you'll purchase a ride that's twice the length, and in some cases three and even four times as long!"}

The cost for the riding skill will be significantly higher than it previously was, however this is offset by a drastically lower cost for the actual mount.\nFor current players with mounts there will be a seamless transition to the new system. You will continue to have your mount; you will continue to be able to use it, etc. What this change does for players who don't yet have a mount or an epic mount is take the emphasis off of the mount itself, and put it on the riding skill. This helps give players access to more variety without requiring a large monetary investment if they, for instance, just want to pick a different colored horse.\nPlayer-written FAQ.\nSource: &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D27683387%26amp%3Bsid%3D1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; \"link currently broken by search feature bug in official forums\"\nIn light of the recent changes to the mounts and the surrounding hysteria therein, I have written this F.A.Q. Please feel free to correct it.\nLet me say this first: After the changes in this patch, you will spend the SAME amount of money to learn to ride and buy a regular or epic mount as you did before the patch. The costs are merely reversed.\n 'What are the changes to the mounts and riding system?'\nIn a nutshell, the cost of learning to ride a mount and the cost of purchasing a mount have been swapped. Instead of paying 80g for a regular mount (undiscounted) and 20g (undiscounted) to learn riding for that mount, you will pay 20g for a regular mount and 80g to learn the riding skill. Instead of paying 1000g for an epic mount (undiscounted), you will pay 100g (undiscounted) for the epic mount and 1000g (undiscounted) for the riding skill.\n 'When will this come out?'\nPatch 1.12.1. Not the expansion.\n 'What is the current state of riding skill?'\nCurrently, there are various types of riding skill, one for each type of mount. Riding (Wolf), Riding (Nightsaber), and Riding (Ram) are each separate skills that allow you to ride an Orcish Wolf, a Night Elven Nightsaber, and a Dwarven Ram respectively.\nYou cannot learn the riding skill of another race or buy that races\u2019s mount unless you are exalted with that race. This is how Blizzard restricted cross-racial mounts. Therefore, in theory under the current system, an Orc could own a Swift Orange Raptor*, but would be unable to ride it unless that Orc had Riding (Raptor).\n 'But I thought you said that you could only purchase cross-race mounts if you were exalted?'\nCorrect. However, all standard mounts (non-PvP, non-drop) are BoU, or Bind on Use. They are not BoP. Under this system, an Orc could give his Troll friend 1000g (undiscounted), the Troll would buy the mount, and then trade that mount back to the Orc.\nThis was especially helpful for non-PvPers or those who were not yet honored with their own race. A non-honored, non-PvPing Human would spend 80g on his mount, while an honored human of rank 3 or above would spend 64g because of the two 10% discounts.\n'How does this change in the patch?'\nIn the patch, there will be only two riding skills, presumably one for the Alliance and one for the Horde. Purchasing that riding skill will allow you to ride all mounts of that faction, regardless of their race.\nHowever, there will now be two levels of riding. Apprentice riding will cost 80g (undiscounted) and allow you to ride regular mounts. Journeyman riding will cost 900g (undiscounted) and allow you to ride epic mounts.\n 'I already have my regular/epic mount and I know how to ride it. What happens to me?'\nBlizzard has suggested that you are going to be transitioned over with no additional cost. If you have an epic mount and can ride it, you will not need to spend extra money to relearn it. If you have a regular mount and can ride it, you will not need to spend extra money to relearn it.\n 'I have a PvP mount. What happens to me?'\nThis is somewhat less clear. According to &lt;a href=\"Hortus\"&gt;Hortus&lt;/a&gt;,\nRank 11 mounts, and the AV faction mounts should only require apprentice level riding skill.\nIf you choose to PvP up to rank 11 or to exalted with AV and get the mount, you will not need to purchase Journeyman Riding for 900g (undiscounted). You will only need to buy the mount and have Apprentice Riding for 80g (undiscounted). I am unsure at this time if the price of these mounts will drop.\n 'I have a special mount, such as the ZG raptor or tiger. What happens to me?'\nAgain, this is somewhat unclear. Presumably, because of the special nature of the mount, it will be treated like the PvP/AV mounts and only require the Apprentice Riding skill.\n 'I am a Paladin or Warlock. What happens to me?'\nEdit: I have been told that on the test realms, paladins and warlocks are being given Journeyman Riding if they already have their Epic Charger or Epic Dreadsteed. However, it is uncertain whether completing your paladin or warlock mount quest after patch 1.12.1 will cause you to automatically learn Journeyman Riding.\nWe shall see.\n 'Who does this hurt?'\nIf you have already purchased your mount, but are too low of a level to ride it when the patch comes through, you will be paying 2x what you would normally. Example: my 37 druid has her mount already, but is too low to use it. If I do not level her to 40 by this patch, I will be forced to pay another 72g (honored, no PvP discount) to learn to ride it.\n 'Who does this help?'\nAnyone who wants a mount of a different color. If you\u2019re sick of your Frostsaber, you can spend 100g (undiscounted) to buy a Mistsaber. Potentially PvPers, who will spend less overall.\nIn addition, if you already have gotten the reputation for a cross race epic mount, but have not yet bought one AND you already have your same-race epic mount, your new cross-race epic mount will only cost you 100g (undiscounted) instead of 1000g (undiscounted). This is good!\n 'What about cross-race mounts'\nAt the moment, as I described above, standard mounts are BoU. The limiting factor in cross-race mounts was the riding skill.\nIn the new system, mounts are BoP. You will only be able to purchase a cross-faction mount if you have the correct reputation with that race. The limiting factor in cross-race mounts will now be the mount itself.\n 'What about selling cross-faction in the neutral AH. Trolls on Rams?'\nNow that mounts are BoP, they cannot be sold on the AH. In addition, all mounts have racial restrictions on them. The tooltip for Mechanostriders, for example, says only Dwarves and Gnomes can ride them. Therefore, even if you could get a mount cross-faction, you couldn't use it.\n 'Why?'\nCynical view: someone at Blizzard chose the wrong color Kodo and was too lazy to spend 800g on a new one.\nLess-cynical view: Flying mounts in the expansion will probably require a different riding skill and be unifactional. This resolves that problem."}

These were issues that were clearly unintended by the design of the time, and are now fixed:\nAddon APIs.\nRecently, we've seen an increase in the chat traffic generated by addons that synchronize data between their users. While the vast majority of addons do this responsibly, some can be problematic to the point of degrading the game service for all players. We've previously hotfixed the server-side of the game to incorporate chat throttles that work to alleviate some of this, but during our investigations, we found common use cases that we can improve for addon authors.\nAuthenticator Bag Slots.\nSince before WoW Classic was first launched, we've been very concerned with replicating the original experience while eliminating as many ways that accounts could be compromised as possible. We can't eliminate them all, and unfortunately, many WoW Classic players have not yet taken steps to protect their account with an authenticator. That leads to difficulty for players when their account is compromised, and they need to contact Blizzard Customer Service to resolve the issue.\nIn this patch, we're activating an additional 4 bag slots for any player who has an authenticator and Blizzard Phone Notifications attached to their Battle.net account. In order to help preserve the new-player experience for players who are new to WoW Classic, this won't be advertised in-game until you've reached level 20. Any player with an authenticator and Blizzard Phone Notifications already attached to their Battle.net account will see the additional 4 slots on their backpack when they log into version 1.13.5, and any player who doesn't will see an in-game \"+\" on their bag to remind them to secure their account for this reward.\nWe recognize this is a notable change from original WoW. Account security is very important to us, and we want the reward for securing your account to apply to WoW Classic, as it has applied to World of Warcraft for many years."}

It released on 22 August 2023 with Hardcore realms launching on August 24.\nThe patch was deployed on the &lt;a href=\"Public%20Test%20Realm\"&gt;Public Test Realm&lt;/a&gt; on 29 June 2023.\nHardcore Realms.\nNew Classic Era Hardcore realms will open at 3:00 p.m. PDT on August 24.\nWhen a player-character dies on a Hardcore realm, they cannot resurrect or be resurrected by any other spell or ability. After death, the player-character continues to exist in the game world as a ghost to facilitate communication with in-game friends and resolve logistical matters. The character is not necessarily lost, however. After dying on a Hardcore realm, players will be able to choose to utilize the Free Character Move service and move their dead character to a non-Hardcore Classic Era realm. Once the move is complete to the non-hardcore realm, that character may resurrect as normal.\nOn Hardcore realms, players are not automatically flagged for PvP upon attacking another player. To flag yourself for PvP, you must type the command /pvp. You won\u2019t be able to take hostile actions against a flagged enemy player unless you flag yourself deliberately. PvP battlegrounds are completely disabled, as are all PvP Battlemasters. You may enter premade Wargames, but you may not gain honor or PvP reputations from Wargames. Various quests and objectives that cause players to become PvP flagged, such as the quest \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Attack%21\"&gt;The Attack&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Missing%20Diplomat\"&gt;:The Missing Diplomat&lt;/a&gt;\", do not cause players to become flagged for PvP.\nAll dungeons have at least a 24-hour lockout timer for players below level 60. Furthermore, level 60 players may never enter lower-level dungeons with players below level 60 for any reason. Additionally, group experience restrictions are in place, as they were on Season of Mastery realms. Players who are significantly higher level than the creatures in a given dungeon will cause those creatures to grant trivial experience to the other members of the group.\nThe 16 debuff limit and 32 buff limits have been removed on Hardcore realms. Paladins will not be able to use their Hearthstone while under the effects of Blessing of Protection, Divine Protection, or Divine Shield on Hardcore realms.\nA new feature is available on Hardcore realms: Duel to the Death. To issue a Duel to the Death, right-click the target\u2019s portrait and request a Duel to the Death from the context menu. A Duel to the Death can also be triggered by selecting the target and typing /makgora in your chat window. Before commencing combat, both parties must read and acknowledge a warning message and type \"I Agree\" to begin. Death in a Duel to the Death is permanent, just like any other death on Hardcore realms. The number of kills you receive in Duels to the Death are tracked and rewarded with a special cosmetic buff on your character called \"String of Ears\". Each time you win a Duel to the Death, you will receive a \"trophy,\" and the stack count on this buff will increase by 1. Anyone who clicks on your character will be able to see what a frightful combatant you are by the number of Ears you\u2019ve collected. You cannot earn the String of Ears buff before level 19, and you cannot earn the buff if you and your opponent are too many levels apart.\nHardcore realms will have all the original WoW Content phases unlocked and available right at launch.\nClassic Era PvP Ranking Update.\nOn Classic Era realms, the PvP Ranking system has been revamped. In the reworked system, Ranking Points have been eliminated, Honor is visible immediately after each Honor Kill (or Dishonorable Kill), and de-ranking is no longer a factor, making the system less punishing if you take breaks from ranking. Most importantly, your Rank is no longer determined by a comparison with other players, and the amount your rank increases each week during the weekly reset is solely determined by your PvP efforts in a given week.\nMaximum honor gains for the week are currently set to 500,000 Honor per week. If you earn 500,000 Honor in a given week, you will reach the maximum progress possible in a single week. Earning over 500,000 Honor in a given week will confer no other bonus nor cause you to rank faster."}

Keep an eye out for some fun and exciting surprises throughout the world!\nNew Dungeon - Maraudon.\nIn the vast gray of Desolace lies the earthen tomb of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;, fallen &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keeper of the Grove&lt;/a&gt; and son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;.

Travelers who come to Desolace have little trouble spotting Zaetar's tomb, for the blessing of nature that permeates his being transformed his resting place into a verdant paradise of flora and tranquil pools. Today, this tomb is now trodden by the hooves of Zaetar's children, who have claimed this great cavern as their sacred stronghold Maraudon.\n&lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;, a level 40-49 dungeon in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, is now open and ready for business\nCloak &amp; Helm Graphics.\nThere are now interface options that let you not display your helm and/or cloak on your character.

He is the twin brother of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the loving and beloved husband of the high priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the two have represented the highest leadership of the night elves ever since the fall of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; caste.\nThrough Malfurion's guidance, the night elves successfully halted the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s first invasion of Azeroth during the legendary &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. In its aftermath, he became the greatest of the world's &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt;s. Malfurion and his druids slept to protect the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; for 10,000 years to rebuild the world while his lover Tyrande was promoted to General of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and would protect &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion and Tyrande then led the night elves in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, defeating the Burning Legion as they had done in ages past at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He subsequently fell into a comatose state while in the Emerald Dream.\nAfter recovering in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion and Tyrande were wed and now lead their people as one. Malfurion is often referred to as \"&lt;a href=\"Shan%27do\"&gt;Shan'do&lt;/a&gt;\", which means \"honored teacher\" in &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. Connected deeply to the ebbs and flows of life on Azeroth and bearing ages of responsibility and wisdom, he is one of the mightiest and most venerated mortals of the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;\"Warcraft\" universe&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalfurion serves as one of the main protagonists in the \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" franchise.\nBiography.\nMalfurion and his twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, were born at &lt;a href=\"Lorlathil\"&gt;Lorlathil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; and grew up in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; as friends with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. As a young adult his home was located near a waterfall just outside of Suramar, chosen by him because of the tranquility and untouched nature of the falls.\nMalfurion and Illidan's parents died years before the coming &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nMalfurion was the most dedicated of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;' disciples, learning the art of druidism in the forest of &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;. Under the tutelage of wise Cenarius, he had become the first mortal druid on Azeroth. In the ancient world before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion was a respected scholar loyal to his admired &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. He was among the first to notice the distance Azshara and her followers were keeping from their people, and he began to suspect that the powers granted by the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; were not as pure as all had believed. Though he could not possibly fathom what was soon to come, Malfurion knew that the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; would be forever changed.\nAzshara and her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; were interested in the Well and ordered them to find as much as possible about the well. As time passed, the Highborne learned how to draw power from the Well and manipulate its energies. Finally, Azshara's reckless use of magic drew the attention of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Enemy of All Life and Lord of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. By opening a portal in Azshara's palace, Azshara's Highborne sorcerers, led by High Lord Counselor &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, let hordes of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s into Kalimdor, including the Legion's commanders \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 enabling them to run rampant among the lands and striking down all who opposed them. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; desperately fought them back, but too many were falling to lend them aid. The Burning Legion was winning. The highborne also managed to cast a bigger portal over the Well of Eternity to start the summoning of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut from the ranks of the desperate Kaldorei rose Malfurion Stormrage. Convincing his twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, to forsake the use of magic, Malfurion and his love, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, high priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, quickly went to seek out the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; Cenarius in the hopes that he might have reprieve for their beleaguered people.\nEven with the help of Cenarius and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Queen\"&gt;Dragon Queen&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion knew that his people could not stand up to the constant barrage of demonic invaders. Believing the Well of Eternity to be their gateway, Malfurion decided that it must be destroyed. Knowing that its destruction would render them mortal and without any magic, the night elves reluctantly agreed to storm Azshara's stronghold and bring an end to the invasion.\nHowever, Illidan, spurred by his addiction to magic and his frustrated love for Tyrande, refused to give up his power, and left their resistance to warn the Highborne. Knowing that Illidan would quickly reach them, Malfurion attacked immediately to retain some surprise.\nAzshara and her highborne were prepared for them, and her chaotic magics ripped Malfurion's forces to shreds. But it was the sight of Tyrande falling to the hands of Azshara's former Highborne, now transformed into &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s that gave Malfurion the strength for one final strike.\nAzshara's battle with Malfurion threw the portal out of its magical alignment, and the vortex grew unstable. Malfurion cast a spell to create a gigantic gale that would rip all the demons from the ground and send them on a one-way trip into the Well and to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The Well of Eternity then started to collapse on itself, pulling land, Azshara's palace and the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; into itself. Although Sargeras knew that the portal was closing, he tried to do the unthinkable - step into the portal to recreate it and enter Azeroth. The portal finally collapsed and trapped Sargeras in it. The Well of Eternity exploded in a catastrophic eruption that left the world sundered forever.\nHowever, Malfurion survived. Constructing crude rafts and sailing to what would become Kalimdor, Malfurion, Tyrande, and Cenarius agreed to lead their people to a new home. \nTo their horror, however, a lake atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; had become fouled by the magical energies of the Well of Eternity, which they had hoped was gone forever. Illidan, who had sought to preserve the arcane magic he was addicted to, had taken seven vials of the Well's waters and poured three of them into the lake, creating a new Well of Eternity. Knowing that Illidan's addiction to magic would always be a threat to the safety of the world, Malfurion imprisoned his brother in the caverns below Hyjal; the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the Sundering still fresh in their minds, Malfurion and the night elves dared not attempt to destroy the new Well. Malfurion would later note that sometimes he went to visit Illidan in his prison in the hopes of turning him from his fatal path.\nSeeking the counsel of the &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s, Malfurion requested the presence of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, returned from their hiding places, and they were shocked to hear of the new Well. All of them suspected that the Burning Legion would sniff out its energies once again and find &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; a second time.\nMalfurion agreed, and they all decided to safeguard this Well. To this end, they created the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, which they pledged to use to protect the Well of Eternity and the night elves themselves. Alexstrasza, the Life-Binder, grew the tree herself from an enchanted acorn of &lt;a href=\"G%27Hanir\"&gt;G'Hanir&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu, the Timeless, placed an enchantment upon the tree: for as long as it stood, the night elves would never die of old age or sickness. Ysera, the Dreamer, linked Nordrassil to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Through the tree, she would slowly rebuild the world. However, to maintain the Emerald Dream, she needed consciousnesses to roam its eternal pathways. To sustain it, all the druids agreed to sleep for centuries at a time, despite the years they would lose, and be linked to the Emerald Dream forever.\nMalfurion and Tyrande helped their people rebuild their society amongst the forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; surrounding Hyjal. Cenarius taught them the ways of the wood, and Malfurion grew considerably in power as he learned the art of the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, and he became a great Archdruid, first among his people.\nThough he dearly wished to remain with Tyrande, Malfurion and his druid kindred slept peacefully for many years until they were awakened by an attack by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar\"&gt;Dath'Remar&lt;/a&gt; and the Highborne survivors. He was quickly routed, but the druids refused to destroy them with so many lives already lost, so Malfurion decided that the Highborne were to be exiled. Dath'remar and his followers would later become the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. Though it pained his heart beyond belief, Malfurion left Tyrande to rejoin the Emerald Dream, settling into his long sleep in &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%27s%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Malfurion's Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;.\nCurse of the Worgen.\nWhile experimenting with the druids' shape-shifting abilities, Malfurion discovered the lupine &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;. However, its feral nature was far too much for him to control, and Malfurion lost himself to rage, even going so far as to attack Cenarius. The demigod healed Malfurion's anger by forcing him to slumber beneath the great tree &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt;, within the Emerald Dream. From that point, Malfurion banned all of his students from using the Pack Form, but despite his efforts a sect calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; appeared.\nSome years after the War of the Ancients, the &lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;Satyr&lt;/a&gt;s gathered the few demons that remained and engaged in a war across &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; fought for their shan'do to lift the ban on the Pack Form, but Malfurion was adamant, even when &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt; died because he promised he would not use the transformation.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;scythe&lt;/a&gt; crafted from a fang of &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; and a staff blessed by Elune, the druids who followed Ralaar eventually became the first &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to control the Pack Form and prove Malfurion wrong about its savagery. However, while the Worgen proved effective weapons against the Satyrs, they would often harm allies in their savage fights.\nMalfurion called the druids who did not follow Ralaar - now called Alpha Prime - to a meeting in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. They set guidelines for all future druids to follow and decided on actions to take against the Worgen, and with Cenarius's blessing formed the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. The priestess &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of Ralaar and the mate of the deceased Arvell, interrupted the meeting and brought the Scythe of Elune to Malfurion.\nMeeting Alpha Prime and his followers in a field of &lt;a href=\"peacebloom\"&gt;peacebloom&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion mournfully used the Scythe of Elune to seal the Worgen away in the Emerald Dream, forcing them beneath Daral'nir.\nCreation of the Emerald Nightmare.\n4,500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; took branches from &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the World Tree, and planted them over &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; that had begun to appear across the world, including a particularly large source of saronite in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Five of these became the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Trees\"&gt;Great Trees&lt;/a&gt;, and he named the World Tree he planted in the Grizzly Hills &lt;a href=\"Andrassil\"&gt;Andrassil&lt;/a&gt;, or \"Crown of the Snow\". Malfurion Stormrage and the rest of the Cenarion Circle became furious upon learning that these branches had been planted without their approval. They did, however, agree that the plan seemed to have worked, and for several decades and all seemed well, until it was discovered that the tree got corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\nEternity's End.\nTen thousand years later the second coming of the legion pushed &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; to reawaken the druids. After battling through the three enchanted keepers of the grove \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Protector\"&gt;Lightning Protector&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Protector\"&gt;Fire Protector&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Protector\"&gt;Ice Protector&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 she reached the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion was awakened to the sound of the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. He could sense the corruption and decay of his land, even in the Emerald Dream, and when he awoke, he summoned treants from the forest to dispose of the undead invaders who were closing on his &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%27s%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Den&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrande, responsible for his awakening, told him that &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; had returned to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and he had brought the Burning Legion with him. Malfurion immediately knew what the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; was after; he would assail Mount Hyjal, and attempt to drain the mystical energies of Nordrassil. Their mission was clear: they had to awaken the druids and stop Archimonde.\nWhen Malfurion saw the outlander races battling the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, he thought that perhaps they would make good allies in the coming conflict. But Tyrande immediately rejected the idea, stating that they had killed Cenarius, and deserved whatever fate the undead had in store for them. \nThis savage nature became more prevalent as they attempted to awaken the &lt;a href=\"druid%20of%20the%20talon\"&gt;druids of the talon&lt;/a&gt;, sleeping in the &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Talon%27s%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Druid of the Talon's Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande found a group of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, whom she had tried to help in Ashenvale, and who were now corrupted by the darkening shadow. Tyrande's forces killed them all. They fought their way through the undead, with orcs and humans fighting them at every turn, until they reached the &lt;a href=\"barrow%20den\"&gt;barrow den&lt;/a&gt;s, where Malfurion sounded the Horn of Cenarius. The druid of the talon awoke, and pledged to help Malfurion awaken the &lt;a href=\"druid%20of%20the%20claw\"&gt;druids of the claw&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon entering the mountainous caverns, Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; discovered gigantic spiders and other creatures, vastly mutated by the evil corruption, even within the sanctity of Hyjal. Soon, they came upon a doorway that led to the halls which held Malfurion's treacherous brother, Illidan. Despite Malfurion's protests, Tyrande entered the prison to free Illidan. Malfurion continued on, and found that the druids of the claw had forgotten themselves, and had embraced their feral bear forms as opposed to their night elven forms. The druids' minds were now identical to those of bears, making them impossible to reason with. But with the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion broke them free of this state. Grateful to have their minds restored, the druids of the claw agreed to participate in the fight against the Legion.\nMeanwhile, Tyrande had released Illidan, hoping that he could also make a significant contribution in the war effort. Still, after all these years, Malfurion refused to trust Illidan for his betrayal. Illidan pointedly reminded Malfurion that they fought the demons together once, but Malfurion was adamant; he would have nothing to do with this.\nIllidan took a force of night elves into the corrupted forests of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, and began to battle &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande and Malfurion immediately rushed to reinforce Illidan, but when they arrived, Illidan was already victorious, and in the form of a monstrous demon. Illidan had claimed the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; for his own in order to gain the power to slay Tichondrius. Malfurion and Tyrande both could not believe Illidan's dire choice, and Malfurion banished him from the forests forever. Illidan did not bother to argue with his brother, and left of his own accord.\nThat night, Malfurion received a vision. A great raven came to him and told him to bring Tyrande to the base of Mount Hyjal. Curious, he did as was instructed, and they met &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the outlander forces in Kalimdor.\nTyrande rebuked them and was about to battle them when suddenly the raven appeared, revealing himself to be &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the last &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh convinced the night elves to join forces with the outlanders in a last ditch effort to stop Archimonde's relentless assault towards the world tree. Tyrande reluctantly agreed.\nFrom \"The Sacrifice\" at Hyjal's summit, where the World Tree and the Well of Eternity rested, Malfurion formed a plan of attack. The defenders quickly built fortifications all the way up the mountain, and prepared for Archimonde's ascent. Malfurion knew what had to be done; in order for Archimonde to be defeated, he had to unleash the powers of the world tree upon the mighty demon lord.\nArchimonde, aided by three of his most powerful remaining lieutenants (the lich &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;, successor of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anetheron\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt;, successor of &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;) laid siege to Hyjal, ripping through Jaina and Thrall's bases. Finally, he came to Tyrande's last stronghold, and in turn, tore it to shreds, blew open the enchanted gates, and made his way to the World Tree. Tyrande and Malfurion watched as he approached, heedless of the Ancestral Guardians who had gathered during the battle, at the base of the World Tree. Archimonde's victory over the desperate defenders had made him overconfident, and he was completely unaware of the trap they had set for him.\nWhen Archimonde reached the Tree, Malfurion sounded the Horn of Cenarius. The thousands of Ancestral Guardians, roused by nature herself, stirred from the trees and attacked Archimonde, detonating in an explosion so large it unmade Archimonde and incinerated the forests atop Hyjal, shattering the world tree and ending the night elves' immortality.\nMalfurion and Tyrande would remain in Hyjal and began rebuilding.\nTerror of the Tides.\nWhile checking on Nordrassil one day, Malfurion and Tyrande were unexpectedly met by a runner from &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;, pleading for assistance against Illidan. The former &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; had resurfaced and recruited a race of amphibious snake-people known as &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; to aid him in his plans, which had come to include the &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Isles%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;attempted slaughter&lt;/a&gt; of Shadowsong and her troops. Malfurion immediately left with Tyrande to assist them.\nMalfurion brought &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s with him to aid in the &lt;a href=\"Balancing%20the%20Scales%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;, and they battled through hordes of naga to reach Maiev. When they did, she was upset with Tyrande since the priestess had killed many of Maiev's &lt;a href=\"Watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt; guards when she freed Illidan. Malfurion stopped the argument between the two women before it broke into a fight and advised them to set aside their personal feud until Illidan was dealt with. They battled fiercely against the naga, until they finally confronted Illidan when he captured Tyrande. But he let her go with a warning not to go after him, and fled before they could apprehend him. They followed him across the sea, and landed on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nTroubled by the corruption of the forests, Malfurion retreated into the woods to commune with the forest spirits, but commanded Maiev and Tyrande to forget their differences for the time being in his absence during their search for Illidan.\nAs he went into the woods, Malfurion felt the pain of the earth, and was met by benevolent spirits of the forest who granted him a vision of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, which was crumbling apart due to Illidan's reckless magics with the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion feared for the world and resolved to stop his brother.\nBut when he found Maiev, he could not see Tyrande. Maiev sadly reported that Tyrande had fallen in battle. Infuriated, Malfurion led his forces against Illidan's &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and with the help of Maiev and her new ally &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt;, they defeated Illidan's forces and captured him. Malfurion accused Illidan of causing Tyrande's death, but Kael chimed in, saying that it was premature to assume her dead, and that she had only been swept down a river. Realizing that he had been deceived, Malfurion entangled Maiev and left to look for Tyrande, with Illidan volunteering his naga to scour the river.\nWhen they found Tyrande, she and a small contingent of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; were desperately battling the undead. Illidan fought to get to her through the river with his naga while Malfurion fended off the undead attackers. Finally, they pushed through the undead forces and Illidan rescued Tyrande.\nWhen Illidan brought Tyrande back to Malfurion, he was grateful. He decided that Illidan had earned his freedom, but Malfurion warned his brother that if he ever disturbed the night elves again, he would not be so forgiving. Illidan agreed to those terms, and opened a mystic portal.\nAs he retreated, Maiev caught up with them, and furiously chastised Malfurion and Tyrande for allowing Illidan to leave. In a rage, she and her Watchers followed Illidan into his portal. Tyrande tried to stop her, but Malfurion let her go, knowing that nothing they could say would change her mind.\nWith a heavy sigh, Malfurion and Tyrande left to return to their own realm and people, for there was still work to be done.\nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath of the horrific conflict, Malfurion and Tyrande helped their people rebuild their shattered villages and briefly ruled their people. He also befriended &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; whom he began teaching in the druidic art and blessing him with the &lt;a href=\"touch%20of%20nature\"&gt;touch of nature&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward druids conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world. When Malfurion heard about this plan, he warned that nature would never bless such a selfish act. Shortly thereafter, Malfurion entered the Emerald Dream to replenish his strength but his spirit became lost within the depths of the Dream when &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; ambushed him in his barrow den. Though his fellow druids attempted to find his wandering spirit, only his body remained sleeping within his barrow den. With Malfurion missing, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, his top lieutenant with whom he had clashed and the leader of those who wished to plant the new World Tree \u2013 became the new Archdruid of the druids. In no time at all, he and his fellow druids and the convinced &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of Ancients&lt;/a&gt; from Darkshore had forged ahead and planted the great tree, Teldrassil, off the stormy coasts of northern Kalimdor.\nSomething went wrong with Malfurion's dreamstate, causing him to become trapped somewhere within the Dream, beyond even the reach of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s who control it. In-game quests during vanilla indicated he was fighting alongside &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;'s spirit against the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe details of Malfurion's condition were a state secret. Only the highest-ranking members of the Cenarion Circle and the Sisterhood of Elune were aware of it.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMalfurion was in a comatose state prior to the events of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, and remained that way through the events of the Burning Crusade and the invasion of Northrend, only awakening in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat. This did not stop him from trying to safeguard Azeroth.\nHe appeared via the Emerald Dream twice, once in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, and another time in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; during the Green Shard fork of &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; quest chain.\nDefeating any of the &lt;a href=\"Dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;Dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; yielded a &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Engulfed%20Object\"&gt;Nightmare Engulfed Object&lt;/a&gt;. When taken to &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; a vision of Malfurion, still trapped in the Emerald Dream, appeared and had a discussion with Keeper Remulos concerning the disturbing rise of the Four Dragons and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands%20quest%20chain\"&gt;The Scepter of the Shifting Sands quest chain&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion appeared again and confirmed the existence of an Old God corrupting the Emerald Dream.\nThe Nightmare Lord and the return of Stormrage.\nIn the novel \"&lt;a href=\"Stormrage\"&gt;Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;\", it is revealed that Malfurion was being kept in the Emerald Dream by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, who used the &lt;a href=\"Morrowgrain\"&gt;Morrowgrain&lt;/a&gt; collected by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to slowly kill his Shan'do's physical body. Malfurion was captured in the Emerald Dream and was being tortured and used by the Nightmare Lord for the purpose of conquering both the Emerald Dream and Azeroth. The Nightmare Lord was the ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the terrible plague that covers the Emerald Dream, and later revealed to really be Malfurion's old nemesis &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion gave &lt;a href=\"Thura\"&gt;Thura&lt;/a&gt; false dreams about her uncle Broxigar\u00b4s death in order to lure her to him in the Emerald Dream out of vengeance. Indeed Thura was able to enter the Emerald Dream and reach the tree where Malfurion was trapped. Unfortunately, Tyrande and her allies were in the Dream as well and despite his warnings to turn Tyrande away, she remained and wanted to stop Thura. Thura was eventually able to cut the tree form that kept Malfurion imprisoned, thus freeing him. However, he witnessed something unexpected. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; was lured into a trap by &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt; and the Emerald Nightmare. It was at that moment that Malfurion realized that Ysera was the Nightmare Lord's main target all along, where as Malfurion was trapped only because of personal reasons. Malfurion, alongside Tyrande, Broll, &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt;, and Thura escaped the Emerald Dream and Malfurion\u00b4s dreamform returned to his body in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, where the Nightmare was also present. From there he flew to Ashenvale, where he noticed the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs he neared he found druids trying heal the tree. However, Malfurion understood what they were really doing: they were inadvertently corrupting it even further. Malfurion got to the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, where he found a trapped &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately, he was attacked by a crazed &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, who was behind the corruption of Teldrassil. As they were battling, druids came to the Enclave where they had found Broll, who they believed to be a traitor; though Broll tried to explain that Fandral was the traitor. During the battle, Malfurion had freed Hamuul, Naralex and Shandris, and the tauren and female night elf confirmed Fandral's betrayal. At that moment, Fandral cast a spell, which started to kill the druids. Malfurion however, was able incapacitate Fandral by driving him into a state of near-catatonia after he destroyed a shadow masquerading as his late son, &lt;a href=\"Valstann\"&gt;Valstann&lt;/a&gt;. After this, Malfurion saw Broll's gold eyes, thus coming to the conclusion that he has met his true potential by helping the other druids. Afterwards, he then went to Teldrassil\u00b4s crown, where he discovered the true reason for Teldrassil\u00b4s corruption: a branch of Xavius grafted onto the World Tree. After removing the branch, Malfurion led all druids to healing Teldrassil from Xavius' corruption. The healing was successful; thus allowing &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; to bless the World Tree. From that moment on, the tree became the haven and monument it was meant to be. The Dragon Queen told Malfurion that all portals to the Emerald Dream were closed, all except for Fandral's hidden portal which Malfurion knew the location of. He then ordered Shandris to take care of Darnassus\u00b4 citizens and Broll and Hamuul to watch over him as he used his dream form to travel to all over Azeroth - to Stormwind, where he convinced Varian to lead an army against the Nightmare; to Thunder Bluff, where Baine Bloodhoof also aided him; and Dalaran, though there they all were dreaming. After calling the survivors of the Emerald Nightmare's attack to arms, he returned to his body, only to find &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, who told him about Tyrande's kidnapping and the theft of the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Axe of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion appointed Broll to coordinate the dreamform army while he and Remulos entered the Nightmare. When they got to the location where Tyrande and the axe were held, it became apparent that Xavius used Remulos as his pawn and has corrupted him. Malfurion had to defeat the Moonglade's keeper to release Tyrande. After which, they shifted to a safer location but was still attacked by &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s. While Tyrande called for Elune's power to hold off the satyrs' assault, Malfurion sent Broll to Thura and then heard Ysera's voice, who thanks to Lucan was able to speak and reveal where she was being imprisoned. Malfurion helped &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; to free Ysera, but in order to do so, Eranikus had to sacrifice himself. Though Ysera was freed, she could not save her consort and could not help Malfurion in his plan. So he decided to collect energy from both Azeroth and the Emerald Dream to cleanse Azeroth from the Nightmare. Then he attacked the tree of Xavius in Azeroth while Thura struck down Xavius' shadow tree in the Emerald Dream. With Xavius dead, what was left of the Nightmare receded into the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, where Xavius' master fought to keep its grip.\nThe Battle against the Nightmare was over and mortals battling in the Dream returned to Azeroth. Exhausted Malfurion then awoke in Darnassus. Without wasting any time and with the blessings of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, well wishes from the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and their friend and old compatriot &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the two were finally married in the capital city of the night elves, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nAfter King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s petrification, as the leaders of their people Malfurion and Tyrande attended the memorial gathering in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Ironforge\"&gt;Old Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeeds of Faith.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; caused Azeroth to be plagued by a series of natural disasters, Malfurion used his druids to survey the damage to night elf settlements. Though some settlements still stand, others such as the ones in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; were unapproachable due to strong wind currents and storms. Worst, there was a recent report of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; invading the area. Malfurion accompanied Tyrande Whisperwind in the search and rescue of General &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;. The two night elves dispatched the invading naga force stationed at &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt; and rescued the critically injured general. Malfurion and Tyrande later attended a memorial service for those who fell during the recent calamitous events and stood together against the tide of pain and loss.\nWolfheart.\nMalfurion Stormrage has tried his best to maintain unity within the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, but his duties as a druid caused him to focus more on the wilds. Both he and his mate, Tyrande, knew that someone else must take up the mantle of guiding the Alliance, especially since in the wake of the Cataclysm, they faced a revitalized &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; led by a &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;violent new warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Both Malfurion and his mate set up a summit not only to propose the induction of the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance, but also to see if one would arise to lead the Alliance in this new world. A task not easily done as King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; harbored animosity towards the now humbled King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion also faced other troubles. Aside from dealing with the politics of the Alliance, there have been sudden reports of &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; being murdered in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnbeknown to him, Malfurion had drawn the ire of &lt;a href=\"Maiev\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt;, who was outraged that he has forgiven the Highborne and welcomed them back into night elf society. Not only that, she despised Malfurion for not having &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; properly blessed, thus preventing the night elves from regaining their immortality. Malfurion felt that the night elves have grown too complacent and jaded with their immortality and that it was time for them to once again start living mortal lives to better appreciate the world. Maiev had planned on capturing Malfurion and giving him a slow rotting death. Yet her machinations were foiled by her own brother, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, who rescued him. Malfurion and Jarod then rescued the Highborne from being slaughtered by Maiev and drove her away. Later on, Jarod was appointed to lead a new security force, and Malfurion warned him not to follow the path of obsession as Maiev did. Malfurion then witnessed the worgen being officially accepted into the Alliance.\nCataclysm.\nMalfurion makes his formal in-game debut in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, standing next to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; as a co-leader of the night elves.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion is holding back a massive swirling vortex of air at its epicenter the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Vortex\"&gt;Eye of the Vortex&lt;/a&gt; giving every ounce of his power to prevent Darkshore's entire landmass from being shattered and swept into the ocean, while the night elves and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s attempt to stop the rampaging elementals and save the region and they recruit a furbolg, an ancient and a wildkin to aid Malfurion in dying down the elementals' anger to save Darkshore. He then took part in stopping the Naga and Twilight's Hammer threat at the southern end of the region.\nLater on, the adventurer is sent to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Horn of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that Queen Azshara was responsible for the troubles of the zone, in order to keep Malfurion's attention away from the work being done in Hyjal. Malfurion then leaves to join the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in stopping Ragnaros.\nIn Hyjal, Malfurion leads the charge against the &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and takes part, along with &lt;a href=\"Hamuul\"&gt;Hamuul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, in sending the &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt; back to the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Bonds.\nMalfurion met with his friend &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and Thrall's mate &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; to combine the powers of the druids and shamans in Hyjal. However, they are attacked by a mysterious assailant - who shatters Thrall's essence into the elemental planes. Malfurion swears revenge on the figure, who promptly reveals himself as none other than Malfurion's former pupil; the Archdruid of Darnassus in his absence -- &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;.\nRage of the Firelands.\nFandral begins to take druids into his new, corrupted sect in service of Ragnaros, named the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt; - Fandral's daughter in law, who had blamed Malfurion's neutrality with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for her daughter's death - attacks and seemingly kills Hamuul Runetotem, whose wounded body is brought to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; for healing. Malfurion later attempts to convince Leyara that Fandral's corruption runs too deep, though she disregards his words, only paying attention when Malfurion reveals Hamuul is indeed alive. He watches as a revitalized Hamuul disposes of her, and the two friends leave.\nFollowing Thrall's restoration, Malfurion is present alongside &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; to witness Aggra and Thrall become life-mates.\nDuring the raid into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, an enraged Fandral demands that his followers bring Malfurion to him alive. During the &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28Firelands%20tactics%29\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; in his most powerful form, Malfurion alongside Cenarius and Hamuul assist heroes in ending the Firelord's ambitions for good.\nWell of Eternity.\nHis past self appears in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, released in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.3\"&gt;Patch 4.3: Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. While the players aid &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; in battling &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20and%20Varo%27then\"&gt;Mannoroth and Varo'then&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion aids the aspects in closing the portal in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, forcing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; out of Azeroth.\nTides of War.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;When the Horde was about to attack Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina asked Malfurion and Tyrande for warriors and ships. The Archdruid and his wife sent Shandris and a group of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the defense effort.\nMalfurion and his wife were also willing to help Varian in the counter-attack by sending a few dozen ships.\nWar Crimes.\nAfter Tyrande was chosen as the Accuser in the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, during their dinner in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion told her that he was worried about how the trial might change her, as she was inciting hatred and a desire to condemn others, not using her beautiful heart.\nA Terrible Portent.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Archimonde held a fragment of power from the Rift of Aln that was supposed to have been sealed away, which disturbed Malfurion greatly, as it possibly meant that the Emerald Nightmare was apparently breaking free once again. Believing it to be , he set off for &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, where he was first trained as a druid.\nLegion.\nMalfurion attended the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and says the Alliance must find balance despite their shared grief. When &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt; arrives at the funeral to inform the assembled leaders that Stormwind's guards have been infiltrated by the Legion, Malfurion is uneasy about the demon hunters no longer being locked up.\nWithin the Moonglade, Malfurion gathers &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to open a portal through the Emerald Dream to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; in Val'sharah. After the adventurer retrieves an &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; of great power, Malfurion names them an Archdruid of the Cenarion Circle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; needed to close the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and stop the invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, is located in Val'sharah. Malfurion sends word to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; that retrieving it should be simple and he need only ask Cenarius for the relic. However, upon arrival at the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Grove of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; Malfurion discovers that his shan'do is afflicted by the Emerald Nightmare and will not wake. Distraught, Malfurion calls for three ancient archdruids \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Koda%20Steelclaw\"&gt;Koda Steelclaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thaon%20Moonclaw\"&gt;Thaon Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to join him at the Forest Lord's side. While Koda and Elothir are gathered, Thaon is corrupted by the resurrected &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately slain.\nMalfurion, Elothir, and Koda call on &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to ask for her aid, and the former Aspect believes the Tears of Elune can save Cenarius. However, the temple where they are held is under attack from Xavius. The Nightmare Lord steals the Tears of Elune before Malfurion can use them to save Cenarius. Without the Tears Cenarius succumbs to corruption, and Malfurion pursues Xavius in his rage at the loss of his shan'do. Unfortunately, Xavius is not done taking from Malfurion: when Ysera and an adventurer locate Xavius, he is able to corrupt the former Aspect herself, turning her into a dragon of Nightmare. Xavius and Ysera retreat with Malfurion held captive, followed by an adventurer and Tyrande, who had arrived after seeing a vision of her husband.\nWith Malfurion held captive, Xavius gives the High Priestess an ultimatum: she can pursue him and spend her husband's last moments at his side, or she can return to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and protect it from Xavius's forces which will be led by Ysera. Mournful and distraught, Tyrande chooses her goddess over her love, though the decision hurts her. After Ysera's death, Tyrande tasks adventurers with following Xavius and Malfurion. At the &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt; Malfurion is freed and Xavius's shade on Azeroth defeated, but his true form still lurks within the Nightmare.\nWithin the Emerald Nightmare, Malfurion aids adventurers against his fallen Shan'do. But with Malfurion's urging, they are able to get through to Cenarius and, while he is beaten, the great demigod is only unconscious. Malfurion focuses all of his energy into cleansing Cenarius. He dares not venture into the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt; himself, as while his bond to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; gives him great power it also makes him vulnerable to the rift's darkness; if Malfurion were to enter the Rift of Aln, he would be taken by the Nightmare just as Cenarius was. With Malfurion staying behind with his Shan'do, he entrusts adventurers to slay Xavius, cleanse the Emerald Dream, and save Azeroth.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Malfurion can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nMoments of Reflection.\nBefore he left for &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt; for the final battle with the Legion, a revived Illidan created a crystal with a message for Malfurion. He spoke of how the teachings of Cenarius were not for him as they were for his brother, and how all the power he sought was not to conquer or rule, but to save Azeroth, despite Malfurion's distrust--though Illidan admitted he did not make it easy for Malfurion to do so. With his fate becoming clear, Illidan wished to finally quiet the strife that had long divided them and entrust the safety of the world to his brother, for there was no one he trusted to face threats more than him. While Malfurion had spent a lifetime fighting for the dream of what Azeroth could be, he now must fight for what it is. With his final words, Illidan asked Malfurion to take care of Tyrande and listen to her counsel, for she was always the best of them. The road ahead would be long, but whatever came, he knew Malfurion would bring honor to the name Stormrage.\nMalfurion's response was to speak of how his brother made selfish choices, brought pain to so many, and his transgressions were difficult to forgive. And yet, he recalled the times when they fought together for a common cause and shared purpose, calling them good days. But with the wound &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; inflicted in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, it was not the time to ponder personal regrets. Malfurion declared that they must focus on healing the world.\nBefore the Storm.\nAfter being made aware of the dire condition &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was in, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and Malfurion Stormrage met with King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the night elves' progress in healing Azeroth and their investigations about &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion told him that the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to assess the damage. As they rode through the city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, Malfurion further elaborated that the druids of &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; were all killed by Sargeras' destruction and Tyrande had sent &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;priestesses of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to help when she got word of their deaths. Although the night elves thought to make &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s to heal the wounds of Silithus, their priestesses and druids were unable to finish creating one with the goblins plundering Azerite from the land. The night elves, however, found a vein of Azerite and took some samples to study. Malfurion told Anduin that although he cannot deny the magnificence of Azerite's power, he promised Anduin the night elves will do all within their power to prevent its misuse. Tyrande introduced &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt; to Anduin whose unit was providing protection to the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin commended Tyrande for her wise initiative and pledged some of his own men to guard further expeditions as well. During their discussion, a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; portalled in to deliver a message from &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos reported &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to him and informed Anduin she will be unavailable for the foreseeable future. Anduin revealed the message spoke of Jaina and all the leaders spoke of their hopes that Jaina will one day return to active duty in their coalition. With their business concluded, Anduin &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;d back to Stormwind.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nWhile the night elf fleet was en route to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; was in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde began to invade &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in Ashenvale sent a hurried warning to Malfurion in Darnassus. After being briefed of the situation, Malfurion sent Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Eriadnar\"&gt;Eriadnar&lt;/a&gt; to inform the Alliance leadership of the invasion and notified them that he will slow the Horde's advance until reinforcements arrive. He will also be evacuating the civilians of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and sending them over to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Malfurion also dispatched a druid trainee named &lt;a href=\"Teshara\"&gt;Teshara&lt;/a&gt; to recall the night elf fleet en route to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. With luck, the night elf defenders will buy enough time to evacuate the civilians and for the reinforcements to arrive in time to turn the Horde away. Malfurion sent a group of druids to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and ordered her to slow the Horde's advance until he arrives. As Malfurion made his way to the battlefront, he encountered a group of druids under attack by Horde assailants. He told the sole survivor, &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt;, to escape while he paid his respects to his fallen druid brothers and sisters.\nCaptain Summermoon managed to delay the Horde for a while at &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually the Horde overcame their defenses. When the Horde breached the night elves' side of the river, Malfurion arrived at the edge of the forests and ordered Summermoon's beleaguered forces to retreat while he and a few defenders covered them. As the night elves fell back deeper into the forests, Malfurion Stormrage spoke to &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; from the concealment of the woods. Saurfang proclaimed that the night elves' lands would soon belong to the Horde and offers the night elves a chance to leave in peace; Malfurion responded that the Horde will pay in blood for each step it gains. Malfurion ripped hard into the Horde in the northern borders of Ashenvale. As he tried to slow the Horde down, he was ambushed by a Horde rogue named &lt;a href=\"Lorash%20Sunbeam\"&gt;Lorash Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion was far too quick for Lorash however, and easily evaded his attack. He then summoned &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt;s to subdue the blood elf. Malfurion told Lorash that his animosity was senseless and tried to remind the blood elf that the kaldorei and the sin'dorei had once lived, fought, and died together. Lorash, however, responded that Malfurion was the one that created the division between their peoples by exiling his ancestors. Lorash blamed Malfurion for the suffering his people had to endure while trying to establish themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and had personally lost family from harsh winters, hostile trolls, and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion countered that his people had just repelled the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and lost their homeland, yet not once did he entertain the idea of attacking &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; despite the wars between their factions. When Lorash did not seem to regret his hatred and was taunting Malfurion about losing his home, Malfurion pitied him and said he is glad most of his kind is not as lost. Suddenly, their conversation was interrupted by an attack from &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. As Malfurion defended himself, he had his roots crush Lorash's throat while proclaiming that the Horde has not conquered his home yet.\nMalfurion evaded Sylvanas and continued to covertly wreak havoc on the Horde. Sometime later, he circled back south to &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, where Captain Summermoon was drawing &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; out into the open for an ambush. The moment Saurfang was lured out of his inn, he sensed a trap and was about to return to safety. However, Malfurion arrived just in time to suddenly strike at Saurfang, causing enough chaos for Captain Summermoon's forces to take the Horde guards by surprise. Malfurion pursued Saurfang to Astranaar's inn, where he summoned an overgrowth to consume Saurfang and the inn. Saurfang challenged Malfurion to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, but Malfurion did not care about orcish duels and simply tried to ensnare Saurfang. Malfurion eventually overwhelmed Saurfang and used roots to bind his legs. Trapped in a collapsing inn, Saurfang admitted to himself that there was nothing he could do against Malfurion's power. But as the inn began to collapse around them, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; fired an arrow of dark magic at Malfurion, distracting him from Saurfang. Sylvanas had rallied the Horde to route the night elf defenders and forced Malfurion to retreat with them. Although he last saw Saurfang being buried by collapsing rubble, Saurfang's appearance at &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar\"&gt;Zoram'gar&lt;/a&gt; revealed he had survived the ambush.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Vale\"&gt;Twilight Vale&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion held off the Horde forces, Sylvanas included, with &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;roots&lt;/a&gt; and a wall of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s. Among the wisps he had called were the spirits of Astranaar's dead. When &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; reported that Sylvanas had made her way to &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion told her to gather as many night elf troops from the surrounding outposts as she could. Malfurion tasked an adventurer with putting down the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20tribe\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s that had been driven into a frenzy by the Horde's destruction of Darkshore, and gathering druids to meet at the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Once the Horde forces at the grove were defeated, Malfurion blinded Sylvanas and her forces with &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime later Malfurion commanded the Alliance's forces in battle with the Horde at the &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt;, but with the Horde having superior numbers he decided to regroup in Darnassus. To bolster Malfurion's forces, an Alliance champion rallied the Priestesses of Elune, Sentinels, and Druids of the Claw. They met up with Malfurion at &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, where Malfurion welcomed back the recalled night elf fleet. Soon after, the night elves made their last stand. The battle turned, however, when the Horde somehow infiltrated Darkshore from the north and were luring the wisps to another front. With the wisps distracted, the wisp wall began to disperse, allowing the Horde army to breach Darkshore. Malfurion knew he could not save his people and could only mitigate the disaster. He told Teshara to give a missive he wrote to Tyrande, explaining that he was going to try to assassinate Sylvanas alone. As Captain Summermoon despaired, Malfurion comforted her and commended her for her efforts. He tasked her to take her troops to &lt;a href=\"Mist%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Mist's Edge&lt;/a&gt; and do what they could.\nMalfurion then traveled to face Sylvanas and her army, and when he found her, he told her that there would be no forgiveness for her atrocities; to which Sylvanas responded that she was well aware. Malfurion battled Sylvanas outside &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, and despite Sylvanas calling on several Horde soldiers for assistance, she was apparently nearly killed by Malfurion. However, Saurfang arrived and in a moment of quick thinking and desperation, he struck Malfurion from behind, catching him unawares and severely injuring him. Saurfang felt remorse for what he thought was a dishonorable act, despite Sylvanas praising him and offering him the final blow. Sylvanas tasked Saurfang with taking Malfurion's head shortly before departing for the World Tree, but Saurfang could not bring himself to kill Malfurion, whose last words were to inform him that he had led the Horde in the service of death, and that he would regret this day until his own death.\nWhen Tyrande arrived, she defeated Saurfang, but spared his life for not killing Malfurion, and then healed her husband and returned to Stormwind with him, via a &lt;a href=\"%3Ahearthstone\"&gt;:hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; from Anduin, although not before criticizing Saurfang for participating in this honorless war and darkly warning him they would return to reclaim their homeland. Tyrande tasked the Alliance adventurer with traveling to Darnassus to make the occupation more tolerable, but despite their efforts, soon afterwards &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; itself was burned down by the Horde, destroying most of the night elf race and severely weakening the Alliance's forces on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nMalfurion and Tyrande later relocated to Stormwind Keep, with him having fully recovered.\nTides of Vengeance.\nSometime later, Tyrande returned to Darkshore to undergo the ritual of the Night Warrior: the incarnation of Elune's fury. Legend said that long ago, the Night Warrior was used by the night elves to carve out their empire. None who have attempted the ritual since then have survived, for Elune's raw power tore them apart. Despite the danger, Tyrande managed to survive. Malfurion ran into his beloved at the &lt;a href=\"Ashwood%20Depot\"&gt;Ashwood Depot&lt;/a&gt; in Darkshore shortly after she dealt with &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; and his forces. Though Malfurion wanted to fight the nearby &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and his two &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; alongside Tyrande, Tyrande instead told him to wait on the sidelines until she gave the order.\nOn the beach where Delaryn had died outside &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, Nathanos was attempting to raise both her and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;, who Tyrande arrived just barely too late to save. Partway into her battle with Nathanos Tyrande was shackled by the Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Brynja\"&gt;Brynja&lt;/a&gt;, but she quickly broke free and shrouded the area in darkness with the Night Warrior's power. It was then that Malfurion joined her, battling Brynja in &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;bear form&lt;/a&gt; as Tyrande handled Nathanos. However, the Val'kyr succeeded in raising Delaryn and Sira. Despite Tyrande's efforts to convince them not to give in to darkness, they blamed both her and Elune for abandoning them and declared their allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande angrily slew Brynja as the Horde escaped, and while Malfurion wanted to hunt them down, Tyrande instead convinced him to pull back their forces for the time being.\nMalfurion later raided Horde supply caravans, killing most of their members in one ambush and warning a troll leader that he and his people were coming for Sylvanas and her Horde. In the subsequent &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, he spurred the &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s and spirits of nature to aid the Alliance in restoring the land and fighting their enemies at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nShadows Rising.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, Tyrande, and the night elven people made their new home in &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion and Tyrande had taken to ignoring any and all missives sent to them by the young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. In light of both the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; sensing something horrible within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion and Tyrande agreed for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to meet with them under the condition that the Earthen Ring &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; was to be present and for Thrall to bring what was owed.\nAfter Thrall and his companions (&lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;) arrived, Malfurion, Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; greeted them with frosty, rigid silence. Thrall formally apologized to night elves and explained how the Horde sought to change, causing Malfurion to give Thrall the smallest nod of understanding, showing that he was listening. Tyrande stated that she saw their words as empty pledges of justice, and then the moon grew darker and more menacing ready to assault Thrall and his companions. Fortunately, Malfurion soothed the Night Warrior and avoided bloodshed. Malfurion witnessed Thrall promising to give his wife the head of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nMalfurion was present in &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed Tyrande's speech about Horde's defeat in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Within the visions of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; while in the wildseed, Malfurion can be seen comforting &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nTyrande and Malfurion brought &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;The Sisters' Tear&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, the domain of the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing they held the hopes of souls of so many fallen night elves, they asked Ysera's daughter &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; if she was sure it would be safe there. Merithra told them to follow her and they stepped into the Emerald Dream portal.\nSome time later, Tyrande and Malfurion worked with &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt; on a plan to restore &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to life and thus traveled to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. In their absence the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; through the trickery and deception of &lt;a href=\"Rymek\"&gt;Rymek&lt;/a&gt; were able to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; portal upon the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;, successfully claiming the area and preventing the defenders from being able to breach the ice barrier around them. Though Rymek's magic prevented them from entering the grove, Merithra realized that there was a way in from death.\nThus Tyrande pleaded with Ysera to name any price for her return, as they and her flight needed her, but Ysera remained silent. Malfurion quickly realized however that in order for her to return to life, he must take her place in death, and thus he interrupted Tyrande and after a moment of silence, revealed this truth to Tyrande's shock. When Tyrande rejected this notion, Malfurion informed her that when Ysera gave her life for him in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn't her time, and that now balance could be restored. After a moment of hesitation, she accepted this and offered to stay as well, leaving &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris&lt;/a&gt; and the others lead the night elves. However, he remarked that if everything they hoped came to pass, their people will need her. Tyrande in return pointed out how tired she was after enduring so much, and requested that he not ask this of her. Soothingly Malfurion reassured her that she was the strength of their people, that they will follow her ever onward, and that she would never be alone.\nThus the group went to the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, who while initially hesitant ultimately agreed and switched her bounding from Ysera to Malfurion. As Malfurion takes Ysera's place and sleeps, he repeats the same words he spoke to Tyrande long ago at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;: that whatever comes, their bond is eternal. \nWith the Emerald Dream secured and Merithra chosen as the new Aspect of the green dragonflight, Ysera returns to Ardenweald and renews her bond to the Winter Queen. In the process, Malfurion awakens from his slumber and returns to Tyrande in Amirdrassil, sharing a kiss and a hug together with Shandris.\nPowers and abilities.\nThe founder of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion Stormrage is viewed as a &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt; and savior to his people, the greatest druid ever to live, \"arguably one of the most powerful beings in history\", and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; called him \"the wisest and most powerful of all the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s\". He has been described as \"unique\u2015the greatest druid the night elves had ever produced\" and so deep was his affinity for nature that he possessed a &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;'s antlers, feathers on his muscled arms like &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;wings&lt;/a&gt;, and feet resembling those of a great &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt;, in full command of whichever aspect of himself he manifested. The &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; also hold Malfurion in high esteem, with &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; believing that he has given them a chance to survive, and even &lt;a href=\"Var%27dyn%20Skyseeker\"&gt;Var'dyn Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; greatly respected the power of the legendary archdruid.\nMalfurion Stormrage's feats even during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when he himself was still a student of druidism under &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, are also considerable. Malfurion was able to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to bypass its defenses; summon massive roots from the earth forcing &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; to retreat after he witnessed &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; being killed; defeat &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; by turning him into a tree, vanquish &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; using a ferocious lightning storm, and instantly kill &lt;a href=\"Varo%27then\"&gt;Varo'then&lt;/a&gt; by drawing upon his world's natural energies. Towards the end of the war, he successfully healed &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; after one of her wings was badly wounded in aerial combat, and summoned a massive tornado at the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; which destroyed the Legion's portal and banished most of their ranks from Azeroth, resulting in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. At least in the original timeline, after seeing Tyrande suffer grievous wounds at the &lt;a href=\"Queen%27s%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Queen's Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, in \"a murderous rage\", tried to kill &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself, their devastating battle throwing the Highborne's spellwork into chaos and causing the Sundering. He also allegedly \u200bdestroyed the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; during the conflict.\nMalfurion was able to defeat Xavius once again in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; by drawing upon the primal connection between Azeroth and the Emerald Dream, saving the inhabitants of his entire world from being consumed and corrupted by its darkness, and seemingly ending the Nightmare's threat for several years. Using every ounce of his power at the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Vortex\"&gt;Eye of the Vortex&lt;/a&gt;, the newly reawakened Malfurion prevented &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;'s landmass from being shattered and swept into the ocean after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, with some assistance from others in the region, and summoned a cyclone to push back a flood at &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt;, calling down the wrath of a thunderstorm to sear dozens of &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; with lightning bolts. He later led the resistance efforts against &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; himself atop &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, planting the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tree\"&gt;Sentinel Tree&lt;/a&gt; to protect the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He was personally instrumental to the Firelord's ultimate defeat after helping fight him in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, where he notably protected others from his fire attacks using his Cloudburst ability, and with tremendous effort was later able to successfully cleanse &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; of the Nightmare's taint.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion was able to easily defeat &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, one of the mightiest and most experienced &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, within seconds after facing him in direct combat, and Saurfang himself had earlier privately expressed a belief that there was no doubt that he would lose were he to fight Malfurion. He served as an entire front against Horde forces all by himself, and appeared able to easily take advantage of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;'s environment against his enemies, tearing their ranks asunder as he struck, and evening the odds such that Saurfang realized that there would be more Horde casualties than kaldorei once the final numbers were tallied, despite surprising and outnumbering the night elves by an odds of eight-to-one. Malfurion was able to fight evenly with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, whom his student and fellow druid &lt;a href=\"Ferryn\"&gt;Ferryn&lt;/a&gt; described as \"arguably the most powerful member of the Horde\", after they clashed several times throughout the conflict, and even she at first seemed uncertain if she alone could match either him or &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; in open battle.\nIn times of great need and difficulty, Malfurion has been able to call upon the assistance of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, the departed spirits of his ancestors. His first instance, using the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, ignited the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; blessings upon &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, enabling the night elves to destroy &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and win the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. He beckoned their aid once again most recently in the War of the Thorns, where they were able to incinerate nearly a hundred armored Horde soldiers within moments, and then together form a massive protective wall acting as a formidable barrier capable of temporarily holding even Sylvanas and the entire Horde military at bay.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"bear%20form\"&gt;bear form&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion was able to simultaneously destroy several goblin-piloted &lt;a href=\"Sputtering%20Fleshrender\"&gt;Sputtering Fleshrender&lt;/a&gt;s using multiple Engulfing Roots, and single-handedly ambushed and slew an entire Horde supply party within minutes. He has also shown himself capable of flying using the &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%27s%20Lunarwing%20Form\"&gt;Archdruid's Lunarwing Form&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, he called upon several powerful &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Shadebough%20%28ancient%29\"&gt;Shadebough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gnarlroot\"&gt;Gnarlroot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elderbranch\"&gt;Elderbranch&lt;/a&gt;, to support the kaldorei's efforts to restore the land and rallying them against the Horde.\nMalfurion can also summon &lt;a href=\"Treant%20Ally\"&gt;treant allies&lt;/a&gt; to defend himself, call forth &lt;a href=\"Entangling%20Roots\"&gt;Entangling Roots&lt;/a&gt; to hold and constrain other powerful beings, temporarily blind and weaken others using &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;, and he once temporarily granted a young human orphan a pair of functional white wings. He is also proficient at certain druidic restoration spells, using &lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; to restore and rejuvenate his allies at the &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt;, but as he urged Jarod to bring &lt;a href=\"Shalasyr\"&gt;Shalasyr&lt;/a&gt; to his wife, his healing abilities seem to be lesser to those of Tyrande. While Malfurion was born with silver eyes, unlike his brother Illidan who had golden eyes signifying strong druidic potential, his eyes eventually acquired a golden incandescence, as his \"wholehearted dedication\" to the noble path of Cenarius gave him a power and skill far beyond most druids.\nHis powers are not without limits, however. He was unable to control the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;, nearly attacking Cenarius himself, has been defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Xavius\"&gt;Shade of Xavius&lt;/a&gt; after allowing his anger and rage to take control of him, and further stated that his bond with the Emerald Dream makes him vulnerable to the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;'s darkness. Despite his greatly enhanced senses and considerable knowledge as one of the oldest and most experienced Alliance leaders, he is not infallible, as he was defeated after Saurfang ambushed him from behind after throwing his axe into his back, and had he single-handedly fought the Horde army at &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, he would have inevitably fallen to them.\nIn the RPG.\nIllidan acquired &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Ring\"&gt;Nature's Ring&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful druidic ring, as a gift from his brother Malfurion long ago, before their rivalry.\nBrann and the druids.\nAfter speaking with the druids in Moonglade, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was given an explanation behind the mysterious circumstances of Malfurion's coma \u2014 that someone actually attacked Malfurion. \"An unknown assailant recently did \"something\" to the famed leader of the druids, Malfurion Stormrage, and he has been in some sort of catatonic state ever since. With the knowledge that the Cenarion Circle has an enemy powerful enough to incapacitate their leader, the druids have become increasingly worried and suspicious. After speaking with some of the druids here, I learned some unusual \u2014 and unsettling \u2014 facts.\" Brann believes that whatever did this may be one of the most powerful entities in the world. \"Prime suspects are Remulos and Fandral Staghelm, since they are the only druids powerful enough to potentially sabotage Malfurion's efforts in the Emerald Dream; but perhaps the betrayer wasn't a druid at all.\"\nPersonality.\nMalfurion is the wise and stalwart leader of the night elf druids. He has a fatherly air about him, and takes great pleasure in guiding people to discover insights about themselves and the environment around them. He prefers not to solve problems directly for individuals, or to give completely thorough answers, but rather provide useful hints and advice so that others may achieve discovery on their own.\nHe is grateful to the orc and human armies for their assistance against the Burning Legion and welcomes visitors of those races with open arms. He also holds great respect for tauren and dwarves. However, Malfurion considers high elves and goblins extremely distasteful, and will expel them from Ashenvale whenever he encounters them. Horde and Alliance politics hold little interest for Malfurion as, in his mind, the needs of his people and their environment transcend what he considers to be petty rivalries between the other races.\nVisitors who display a proper respect for the natural environment and its inhabitants will be greeted warmly by Malfurion and his druids. They welcome outsiders for short periods of time with offers of shelter and sustenance. However, Ashenvale is the sacred home of the night elves, and Malfurion does not appreciate or tolerate prolonged visits by members of the other races. Emissaries and adventurers are occasionally welcome, but settlers and those who attempt to wrest profit from the land are expelled immediately.\n\"Stalwart,\" \"wise\", and \"righteous\" are the words that best describe Shan'do Stormrage. He is set in his path of safeguarding his beloved forests and the sanctity of life on Azeroth. Malfurion's burden is a hard one to shoulder; he must safeguard both the forests of Kalimdor and the Emerald Dream, a nearly impossible task. Malfurion must sometimes be reminded that others may help him shoulder the burden \u2014 Cenarius was his teacher and the other druids and ancients are more than willing to aid their Shan'do. The one thing Malfurion loves above nature and life is &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, his beloved \u2014 to live without her is not to live at all.\nIn combat Malfurion calls on nature to aid him in battle. He relies on summoned creatures, treants, dryads, night elf warriors and other allies. He supports them with spells and acts as their general. If Malfurion is encountered alone, he usually uses his spells and abilities to escape into the forests and return later with help.\nAppearance.\nMalfurion generally looks like a normal male night elf, with the exception of a pair of stag antlers growing from his head. Unlike most other night elves with antlers (a blessing of Cenarius considered to be a sign of future greatness), he grew them later in life while other elves such as &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; had them at birth. Since Malfurion's spirit spent many years in the Emerald Dream while his body slept, it started to take on attributes of his animal forms: He gained the attributes of a bird (feathers on arms), a cat (feet), and a bear. There are also glowing blue bolts along his arms, shoulders, chest and stomach. His beard has also grown much longer than before. \nThere is some inconsistency as to the color of Malfurion's hair. In ' and ' it is shown to be blue. However, the \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;The Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\" cover shows it green. Furthermore the action figure, other colored images, the Warcraft III cinematic and his \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" model show it to be green. It seems most likely for it to be green as the most \"World of Warcraft\" and the RPG images were the last sources given.\nPersonality.\nHe feels remorse when he asks nature to sacrifice itself in order to heal others. After he realized how much Xavius had suffered he felt truly sorry for him.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nStanding in the way of nature is heresy. Even when nature's force is a destructive one.\nThe forces that would destroy Darkshore are not natural, however. I will not let this land be torn asunder.\nMy heart is heavy with the burden of this war. I lead my people to their deaths. But if we cannot stand against Ragnaros now, how will we withstand Neltharion?\nWe must fight with everything we have, or witness the destruction of our world.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIt is good to be back among the ancient trees of the Moonglade, even if only for a brief respite.\nLegion.\nCenarius, my mentor...\nWhat foul power could hold sway over him?\nWelcome to Lorlathil, sanctuary of the druids. Though this forest has aged, its spirits still remember me.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; will come to regret the day they stepped into &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Mark my words, &lt;Name&gt;.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nMalfurion is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nOne of his skins, \"Betrayer Malfurion\", depicts an alternate reality in which Malfurion became the Betrayer, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; became archdruid and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; became a &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;. The skin's description reads: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s whispers of power were impossible for the broken Malfurion to resist. She had called him \"Betrayer\"... Soon, they would all call him Master.\"\" Another skin, \"Storm Mantle Malfurion\", depicts a reality where &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; died protecting &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The description reads \"Although Broll Bearmantle had saved the Archdruid's life, it had cost him his own. Even now, Malfurion wears his armor to remind himself of the sacrifices that saved Hyjal.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

His companion is a &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Remnes\"&gt;Remnes&lt;/a&gt;. Formerly a drifter and lone wolf, Malgar preferred to stay far away from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and anything he perceived as a life of servitude or &lt;a href=\"slavery\"&gt;slavery&lt;/a&gt;, until he became embroiled\u2014and ended up playing a central role\u2014in the Garad'kra's mission to stop the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; threat after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nLife of solitude.\nMalgar was a soldier in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during their invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but he felt that he was a slave to the Horde's masters and to the &lt;a href=\"blood-curse\"&gt;blood-curse&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde's defeat, Malgar was placed in an &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt; with other survivors, an experience that gave him an intense hatred for slavery. After &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; led the orcs to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Malgar decided that he wanted nothing more to do with the Horde, preferring a life of solitude and freedom over having to serve others. He was content to hunt alone in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; with his &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Remnes\"&gt;Remnes&lt;/a&gt;, and he claims to have hunted or tracked \"just about every creature on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\". He preferred to stay far away from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, since the smell of the land reminded him of his past corruption.\nThe Garad'kra.\nOne day, Malgar saw a band of &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; raiders\u2014led by &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20ones\"&gt;larger centaur&lt;/a&gt; using unusual tactics\u2014laying waste to a small orc farm, giving him no choice but to return to the violent life he had left behind. The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironhoof\"&gt;Ironhoof&lt;/a&gt; joined him against the raiders, but Remnes was injured in the fighting. This caused Malgar to become enraged and leave an opening for a centaur to strike his back and destroy his rifle. Ironhoof defeated the remaining centaur, but as he questioned one of them, the centaur's new leader &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt; appeared and killed the survivor with a spear throw before disappearing. Despite the orc's protests, Ironhoof carried the injured Malgar and Remnes to Orgrimmar to recuperate in the &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%27s%20Tail\"&gt;Wyvern's Tail&lt;/a&gt; inn. While the orc slept, Ironhoof bought him a tauren bow to replace his lost rifle. When Malgar woke up, Ironhoof tried to convince him to join him in the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; militia. The orc balked at the idea of taking orders from others, likening it to being a slave, and left the city, though not before telling the tauren that he owed him a blood debt for saving his life.\nMalgar returned to the farm to inspect Aratas' hoofprints\u2014which were unlike any other centaur's\u2014and decided against better judgment that he needed to pursue the creature to see how dangerous he was. He and Remnes found Aratas' camp in the Northern Barrens and pursued a nightly patrol of centaur, which turned out to be a death march: a group of the larger centaur planned to execute the runt &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt; for being impure. Malgar killed them and interrogated Dorthar, who told him of the larger centaur\u2014the \"perfect ones\"\u2014and their plan to take over Azeroth. Malgar left Dorthar alive and returned to Aratas' camp, where he came face to face with the high khan and his soldiers. The orc was saved by the arrival of the Garad'kra: Ironhoof, &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rada%27jin\"&gt;Rada'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Felgrim\"&gt;Felgrim&lt;/a&gt;. Malgar and Remnes left the ensuing battle to pursue Aratas, but he mocked the orc for leaving his allies' side when they were fighting a losing battle. Malgar returned to the fight and helped turn the tide, prompting Aratas to try to kill him with a spear throw. Dorthar saved the orc's life by jumping in front of him with his shield. The centaur were defeated, but Aratas escaped. Malgar intervened on Dorthar's behalf to keep Ashra from killing him, and the centaur revealed that Aratas had created an army of centaur and orc slaves in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; in order to invade &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and Orgrimmar.\nMalgar, Dorthar, and the Garad'kra set out on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; journey to Desolace. During the voyage, Malgar argued with Shagara, telling her that her disorganized team had no chance against the centaur army and that they should focus on freeing the slaves instead. Shagara shot back that the lone wolf Malgar knew nothing of teamwork.\nMaraudon.\nOn arrival in Desolace, Shagara and Ironhoof formed a plan to stop the centaur army by killing Aratas, even if it meant their own deaths. Malgar protested against this, to no avail. While the Garad'kra confronted Aratas outside &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;, Malgar and Dorthar freed the orc slaves. Dorthar then offered to lead the slaves to safety and encouraged a reluctant Malgar to join the others. The Garad'kra started to lose against the perfect ones, and Aratas taunted that they would die since they had no harmony of purpose and therefore no \"heart\". Malgar arrived and saved them with his arrows and Remnes, causing Aratas to realize that it was Malgar who was the Garad'kra's \"heart\". The khan threw a spear at the orc's back, but Rada'jin jumped in front, sacrificing himself to save the orc. Aratas retreated into Maraudon with the unconscious Shagara to sacrifice her to his &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;elemental father&lt;/a&gt;. Before Rada'jin expired, Malgar promised him that he would tell everyone about the troll's sacrifice.\nRada'jin's death caused the Garad'kra to immediately fall back into disagreements until Malgar declared that he was going after Shagara, which convinced the others to follow him. Inside Maraudon, Aratas summoned his \"father\", and the Garad'kra stopped to fight it while Malgar and Remnes followed the centaur. Aratas revealed that he'd hoped Malgar would follow him, so he could kill the orc as revenge for killing the other perfect ones. Aratas easily held Malgar and Remnes off until Shagara revealed that she was conscious and used an earth totem to root the centaur in place, allowing Malgar to decapitate him. The two orcs ran back to the main chamber and Malgar tossed Aratas' head at the elemental to distract it. Shagara gave Aratas' spear\u2014the elemental's only weakness\u2014to Ashra, and after the others used their abilities to give him an opening, he used it to destroy the monster.\nTheir victory ended the centaur threat. Malgar returned to Orgrimmar with Remnes and the Garad'kra and reflected that he might've been wrong about the Horde. He sought out Shagara and offered to take Rada'jin's place in the Garad'kra. He admitted that while he would be a challenge to command and was still unsure about his place in the Horde, he had realized that he wanted to fight alongside his friends. Shagara replied that she accepted the challenge. The friends then gathered to witness Dorthar joining the Horde."}

During the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Malkorok was infused with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; but was ultimately slain by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nTides of War.\nFormerly a member of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; in the service of &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, he renounced his former warchief and vowed allegiance to Garrosh. He is shown to be just as radical as Garrosh, if not more so, possibly a trait he has retained from his service in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; under Rend. He believed that anyone who questions Garrosh should be executed.\nWhen the leaders of the Horde gathered to hear Garrosh's plans for Kalimdor, Malkorok was present as he opened the meeting. He was ordered to stand down by Garrosh when he got in &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s way when the tauren showed his displeasure with Garrosh's planned attack on &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Malkorok was also present during the private meeting between his Warchief and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; where Garrosh praised Lor'themar for his loyalty to the Horde's Warchief. When Garrosh became unnerved with Lor'themar's declaration of loyalty to the Horde, due to him not outright stating his loyalty is to Garrosh, he declared to Malkorok that Lor'themar should be watched. In turn, Malkorok declared that they all should be watched: not necessarily all of the leaders, but the entire Horde. \nSometime afterwards, Malkorok and group of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; soldiers went to &lt;a href=\"Kor%27jus\"&gt;Kor'jus&lt;/a&gt;'s shop within the &lt;a href=\"Drag\"&gt;Drag&lt;/a&gt;, to punish him for merely disagreeing with Warchief Hellscream's plans. When Kor'jus said his shop was closed, Malkorok replied that they were not there for supplies; they were there for him. He was then taken into custody where he was beaten and then returned to his shop looking worse for wear. Malkorok's abductions are an unspoken truth in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;; sending out a rather dark warning to vocal dissenters.\nWhen the time came for the attack on &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, Malkorok personally accompanied Garrosh to &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and participated in the destruction of Northwatch. While others were horrified by the Horde's use of &lt;a href=\"lava%20elemental\"&gt;molten giants&lt;/a&gt;, Malkorok saw no problem with it. When Baine, who had learned from &lt;a href=\"Kador%20Cloudsong\"&gt;Kador Cloudsong&lt;/a&gt; that the molten giants were enslaved, confronted Garrosh about the use of such tactics, Malkorok quickly got in his way and ended up challenging Baine to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; for constantly questioning Garrosh's actions and not showing him the respect Malkorok feels he deserves. Malkorok, who privately feels that the tauren are too soft and felt that the death of &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; was a good regardless of how it came to be, was disappointed when Baine refused the challenge.\nFollowing the destruction of Northwatch, Garrosh kept the Horde army in place instead of marching directly to Theramore, much to the chagrin of those within the Horde ranks. When members of the Horde gathered to discuss what Garrosh was thinking by waiting, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Zixx%20Grindergear\"&gt;one of them&lt;/a&gt; tipped off Hellscream of their meeting. When Baine pointed out that they were all merely questioning the reasoning behind his choices and not plotting against Garrosh, Malkorok coldly noted that questioning the Warchief is questioning the Horde. \nMalkorok is irritated by the brazen displays of discontentment in the Horde's ranks, and later on privately grumbled to Garrosh that he should have let him kill or punish a few of them. In turn, Garrosh told him that they were fine soldiers and that fear would keep them in check. Vol'jin and Baine were granted a meeting with Garrosh and both noticed that Malkorok was also present. The three leaders of the Horde had a polite conversation before Baine began to address his concerns and questioned Garrosh why it seemed he only listened to the Blackrock orc. After witnessing Malkorok being told to stand down, Garrosh mentions he had orders for the fleet while turning to Baine and Vol'jin. Feeling hopeful that Garrosh was either beginning the attack on Theramore or letting them in on his plan, both the troll and tauren were stunned when Garrosh's order was for the fleet to withdraw. As they left to carry out his order, Baine told Garrosh he hoped a Horde would be left after this debacle. As they were leaving the Darkspear and tauren leaders heard loud laughter from both their Warchief and his bodyguard.\nWhen Hellscream finally gives the order for the army to march upon Theramore, they were attacked by the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and later attacked the Alliance forces in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;. After Fort Triumph's fall, they reached Theramore Isle itself. Malkorok was dispensed to personally lead his Horde forces in an attack at the west gate. However, while marching to their destination, Malkorok's forces were taken by surprise by Alliance forces under the command of &lt;a href=\"Pained\"&gt;Pained&lt;/a&gt;, whom Malkorok personally fought with. After a fierce battle, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces retreated and Malkorok was angry that not only had he been taken by surprise but that he was unable to kill the night elf.\nMalkorok appears privy to the knowledge of Garrosh's tailor-made &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; and observes as the bomb itself, augmented by the stolen &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt;, is dropped over Theramore. Elated, Malkorok cackles in triumph as Theramore and its defenders are utterly annihilated. \nFollowing the successful campaign, the army journeyed back to Durotar where it experienced a split: those who approved of the use of the mana bomb headed to Orgrimmar, and those who did not journey to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. Malkorok and those heading to Orgrimmar were greeted at the entrance by the orcish people who chanted Garrosh's name. After Garrosh gives a rousing speech of the past, present, and future of the Horde's dominion, those present all joined into a \"Death to the Alliance!\" chant.\nWhile Garrosh and others celebrated in Orgrimmar, Malkorok led Kor'kron forces to Razor Hill. There, he scrutinized and for speaking against Garrosh and casually murdered the two with frag grenades after leaving. \nWhen the Alliance led by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Malkorok was quick to join his &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; in battle. After the Horde controlled &lt;a href=\"Kraken\"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; pushed back the Alliance fleet and were subsequently destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, Malkorok witnessed Garrosh's rage against the fact that the Alliance had been able to escape and reclaimed Northwatch. After being informed that the Alliance intended to end the Horde blockade with the rescuing of the captured port, Garrosh ordered Malkorok to order a full retreat.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter the Horde found &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Hellscream journeys to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; and is soon joined by Malkorok and a &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; guard, along with &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and the regent lord's own presumed bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Ellendra%20Palescorn\"&gt;Ellendra Palescorn&lt;/a&gt;. Malkorok informs Garrosh that the tome of pandaren history had written the &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt;, the former rulers of Pandaria, as a cruel, relentless people who ruled by fear and not love. In turn, Garrosh remarks that he has much to learn from these Mogu.\nMalkorok accompanies Garrosh during his quest to find the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; and is later seen with his Kor'kron forces when Garrosh uses the Divine Bell at &lt;a href=\"Emperor%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Emperor's Reach&lt;/a&gt;.\nEscalation.\nGarrosh has not given up on his desire to wield Pandarian artifacts and sends an excavation force to find and unearth a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;mysterious artifact&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Grizzle%20Gearslip\"&gt;Grizzle Gearslip&lt;/a&gt; and his team find the mysterious artifact, Malkorok and some Kor'kron forces arrive. Malkorok tells the goblin to step aside, as they have found exactly what Garrosh hoped to find in the vale. When Grizzle wants to collect the money from Malkorok Garrosh promised them, he is confused as he received barely a fifth of the promised payment. Malkorok tells Grizzle that he is paid for all workers currently alive, as the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; does not compensate the dead, reasoning the low payment. Grizzle tries to remind Malkorok that there was a contract and its stipulations state that he simply has to pay them properly. However, Malkorok loses his patience, grabs Grizzle by the neck and yells at him; stating that dying in the service of the Horde should be a great honor but Grizzle just sees the dead as an opportunity and uses them to make more money, disgracing the honorable death in the service of the Horde his (now dead) workers had. After Malkorok lets go of Grizzle, the goblin mumbles how Garrosh will see who will have his back when it counts but distracts Malkorok with flattery and runs away before Malkorok fully notices his treasonous comment. Malkorok and his Kor'kron then secure the chamber with the mysterious artifact and a titan-made Watcher named &lt;a href=\"Norushen\"&gt;Norushen&lt;/a&gt;.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nMalkorok has been Garrosh's most loyal and trusted lieutenant throughout the Pandaria campaign. When the Warchief needed a volunteer to infuse with the power of Y'Shaarj, it was only natural that Malkorok would offer without hesitation.\nMalkorok resided within the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;'s death above ground, Malkorok took over the defense of Garrosh's compound and attempted to hold the line. He was killed in the ensuing battle.\nIn Hearthstone.\nMalkorok appears as for the Warrior class in the &lt;a href=\"Whispers%20of%20the%20Old%20Gods\"&gt;Whispers of the Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"\"&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s best buddy. It's true. Look it up.\"\"\nSpeculation.\nIt is unknown to what extent Garrosh has ordered the subjugation of those who question him, or how much of it is Malkorok acting on his own. What is known, however, is that Malkorok truly believes in the necessity of his actions, and that Garrosh gives it at least tacit approval. This was even presented by &lt;a href=\"Baine\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; during the trial of Garrosh.\nHowever, his dialogue reveals that he is indeed being tasked by Garrosh personally: \"This is the task you set me to, great warchief. To root out those who would defy your leadership and thus become traitors to the glorious Horde.\" Furthermore, during Garrosh's trial, he was just watching Malkorok and his Kor'kron beat up Kor'jus with disinterest."}

The encounter is a high-damage &lt;a href=\"Gear%20check\"&gt;Gear check&lt;/a&gt; and contains an interesting healing mechanic due to the Ancient Miasma. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Malkorok has been Garrosh's most loyal and trusted lieutenant throughout the Pandaria campaign. When the Warchief needed a volunteer to infuse with the power of &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, it was only natural that Malkorok would offer without hesitation.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Players who stuck around after the completion of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Dark Heart of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; scenario may have had some inkling that they would be facing off against Malkorok someday in the near future. This is our \u201cPatchwerk-style\u201d boss of the zone, though of course he does have a couple more mechanics than Patchwerk did.\"\nOverview.\nMalkorok's platform begins covered with a dark miasma that absorbs all healing done to players, converting it into an absorption shield instead. Malkorok strikes the ground with a large cone smash three times in sequence, and then causes the same three areas struck to erupt simultaneously with dark energy. Malkorok draws in the miasma, entering a Blood Rage and empowering his melee attacks but allowing players to heal normally for a time. Malkorok then exhales the dark energy, and the cycle repeats until he is defeated.\nStrategy.\nMalkorok is a simple, but extremely brutal, gear check encounter. The fight alternates between two phases on a set timer, and has both a soft enrage (Relentless Assault) and a six minute hard enrage timer.\nPhase 1.\nAt the beginning of the phase, Malkorok will apply Ancient Miasma which converts all heals into absorption shields with an upper limit of 100% of the target's maximum health (similar to the shields on heroic &lt;a href=\"Tortos\"&gt;Tortos&lt;/a&gt;). This mechanic makes it important that players avoid taking unnecessary damage, as players who lose their absorption shield and take damage cannot be healed up in this phase. It is also to note that any damage event greater than 100% of the target's maximum health will still one-shot raid members, irrespective of the strength of the absorption shield. Ancient Miasma does additionally do low ticking damage which the healers should be mindful about.\nThe raid will need to spread out to minimize raid damage from Seismic Slam. Healers should try to top up the absorption shields for this, as the shields will soak fall damage.\nTanks will need to watch their Fatal Strike debuff and swap when necessary. The first swap should occur at 12-15 stacks; thereafter, the tank not on the boss should taunt whenever his stacks drop.\nMalkorok will regularly cast Arcing Smash, with Imploding Energy immediately following. Avoiding Arcing Smash simply requires raid members to move, while Imploding Energy requires that one player (and only one player) stand in each void zone to prevent significant raid damage. 10-man groups will have 3 pools, scaling up to 7 pools in 25-man groups.\nAround 10 seconds after the third Arcing Smash, Malkorok will cast Breath of Y'sharrj. This will cause the three locations previously struck by Arcing Smash to erupt again, and one-shot anyone caught within. There is no ground-effect warning and no time to move, so the raid leader or a raid assist should throw raid markers on areas affected by Arcing Smash, and the raid should avoid these areas as much as possible until the Breath of Y'sharrj cast.\nAfter two minutes, which will be shortly after the second Breath cast, he will enter Phase 2.\nPhase 2.\nMalkorok will apply Blood Rage to himself, causing his melee attacks to deal an insane amount of damage split amongst all targets. The entire raid will need to stack in front of the boss to split the damage, and chain any available defensive cooldowns in order to survive. Players who have experienced the &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Staghelm\"&gt;Majordomo Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; may find this mechanic familiar.\nRaid members affected by Displaced Energy must move out of the raid, and wait until either they are dispelled or their debuff expires, at which point they may move back in.\nAncient Miasma will no longer be in effect, but any leftover absorption shields will soak any incoming damage until they run out.\nAfter 20 seconds, Malkorok will gain a stack of Relentless Assault, permanently buffing his damage, before re-entering Phase 1. Notably, there will be a short window of time before Ancient Miasma comes back into effect, giving the healers their only chance to top the raid off before their healing is absorbed.\nAchievement: Unlimited Potential.\nTo earn &lt;a href=\"Unlimited%20Potential\"&gt;Unlimited Potential&lt;/a&gt;, the raid will first need to locate the Corrupted Skullsplitter; this mob is located at the bottom of the stairs leading to Malkorok's platform. This mob will need to be kited to Malkorok and kept alive until Malkorok casts Breath of Y'shaarj, at which point the raid needs to make sure it gets hit by this ability (using stuns or knockbacks). If the Corrupted Skullsplitter is hit by Breath of Y'shaarj, it will transform into a Corrupted Amalgamation; the raid must kill this mob quickly, then proceed to finish the fight normally.\nThe Corrupted Skullsplitter has abilities that mirror Malkorok's Arcing Smash and Breath of Y'shaarj abilities in both effect and potency, and the raid needs to handle these abilities in the same way as Malkorok's. However, the Corrupted Skullsplitter can be crowd controlled, and a raid with good crowd control should keep the mob CC'd until it needs to be placed in Malkorok's Breath of Y'shaarj.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Gamon%20Will%20Save%20Us%21\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;previous fight&lt;/a&gt;, the achievement mob will reset if the raid wipes."}

The result - Maloriak - is a bumbling minion who possesses only a dull glimmer of his former intelligence.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: Mustn't Fail Again!\nPeriodically, Maloriak throws various vials into his cauldron, causing different effects. The first two Vials will be Red then Blue or Blue then Red, followed by Green, then the cycle repeats.\nRed Vial.\nMaloriak throws a Red Vial into his cauldron, giving him flaming breath. The effects of the Red Vial last for 40 seconds.\nBlue Vial.\nMaloriak throws a Blue Vial into his cauldron, granting him freezing magic. The effects of the Blue Vial last for 40 seconds.\nGreen Vial.\nMaloriak throws a Green Vial into his cauldron. The mixture explodes and cancels the Growth Catalyst on the Aberrations. The effects of the Green Vial last for 40 seconds.\nLord Victor Nefarius throws Dark Magic into the cauldron, causing Vile Swill to spew from the cauldron. The effects of the Dark Magic last for 90 seconds. The Dark Magic also grants Maloriak immunity to Taunt effects.\nStage Two: Unpredictable Results.\nAt 25% remaining health, Maloriak stops throwing vials into the cauldron. He deals more melee damage, gains a new set of abilities, and immediately frees all remaining experiments in the growth chambers.\nStrategy.\nThe Maloriak encounter has some rather unusual mechanics. He switches between several sets of abilities depending on which vial Maloriak throws into the Cauldron. There is a pattern to his vials, with every third vial being a Green one, and the two before it are either Red then Blue, or Blue then Red. Each Vial lasts 40 seconds, after which Maloriak will cast a new one. He also has adds, that he summons in packs of 3 with an interruptable cast, twice every Red or Blue Vial phase.\nThere is a limited amount of adds he can summon; 18 Aberrations and 2 Prime Subjects, which he will only summon in his final phase from 25% to 0. Because of the adds' Growth Catalyst ability, they need to be tanked away from Maloriak, so he won`t get the buff as well. By the time 9 adds are up, they will be dealing tank-killing damage, which can only be survived by a) popping cooldowns, b) kiting, or c) having a third tank pick up a couple of adds.\nThe Red Vial gives him a flame breath. Unlike other flame breaths, that you want to stay out of, this one does shared damage to everyone in the breath, meaning that if only the tank is in the breath, he will get one-shotted. So, when he throws a Red vial into the cauldron, everyone but the off-tank(s) should stack up in front of him.\nThe Blue Vial gives him a spell which randomly freezes a random member of the raid and everyone within 10 yards of that person in an iceblock with 5k hp. One player, preferably a fire mage (for fire blast) should be assigned to breaking these immediately. The raid should spread out for this phase.\nThe Green Vial wipes the Growth Catalyst buff given by the adds, and puts a debuff on everyone including both adds and players increasing damage taken by 100%. During this phase all dps should be focused on aoeing the adds down before the green phase is over, as he will immediately follow up the green phase with an add summon.\nThroughout the fight he will also randomly start to channel Arcane Storms, which must be interrupted, so as to mitigate raid damage. When he reaches 25%, he will release all remaining adds (hopefully only the two Prime Subjects, or you will likely wipe) and enter a Soft Enrage-like phase, where he deals more damage, summons Magma Jets (void zones of fire in a line in front of him), ice orbs that will explode if dpsed down or if they reach a player, and does high raid damage through Acid Storm. Pop all cooldowns, and nuke him through that last phase as quickly as humanly possible. The main tank must avoid the Magma Jets, either by kiting Maloriak around the outside of the room or by dodging out of the way when he performs the casting animation for it. \nThe main mechanic of the fight is actually the adds, because of their absurd damage. There are a number of ways to deal with this:\n10 man: He has a 6-minute enrage timer. To beat this fight, you will have to face two sets of three phases (Red/Blue, Blue/Red, Green). DPS has to be careful, as you don't want to push him to 25% until the second Green Vial is thrown in the cauldron, or you'll likely wipe due to not being able to take down your remaining Aberrations.\nHeroic Mode Changes.\nMaloriak Heroic Mode undergoes a couple of changes. First of all, he gains an additional phase called the Dark Phase in which Nefarian will throw a dark potion into the cauldron. During this phase, several slime adds called \"Vile Swill\" will spawn and must be killed. Each slime can cast an ability called dark sludge which puts a dark puddle on the ground under one raid member dealing damage to anyone that stands in it. This \"dark phase\" lasts for 90 seconds before Maloriak goes back into his normal Red/Blue/Green Phases and ideally the slimes need to be dead before it happens. He also casts a shadow breath at the main tank that reduces healing done to the tank and tank healers need to heal when the breath is not happening.\nThe Aberrations also have more life requiring higher AOE dps to kill during green phases as well as hitting harder.\nDue to the addition of the \"Dark Phase\" Maloriak's enrage timer is increased to 12 minutes but you are still required to push him into his sub 25% phase after 2 green phases.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He was one of the first living beings on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and long ago, he roamed the land as protector of nature. His power lay in nature itself and he is responsible for the creation and nurturing of nature in the world. He is the father of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, who inherited his dominion over nature. Though the great stag was killed by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lord &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, he was resurrected following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in battling the forces of the Fire Lord, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Malorne became trapped by &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; until he was freed by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest record of Malorne is in the &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren myth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20White%20Stag%20and%20the%20Moon\"&gt;The White Stag and the Moon&lt;/a&gt;. It describes how Malorne, being hunted by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, bargained with &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for help. Malorne accepted Elune's help and loved her as part of the deal.\nAnother version of the tale says that Malorne fell in love with the goddess of the moon during the world's first nightfall. Her light guided him through the woods and showed him he was not alone. It banished fear and brought hope. Many creatures have loved the moon and pursued her to madness. She grants light as she will, on her own timetable, and moonlight cannot be captured or possessed. Even so, night after night, the White Stag chased her across the skies. He grew so swift and strong that at last, he succeeded in reaching her. She was so moved by his devotion and beauty that she made him her consort. To this day he loves the wilds best when they are lit by her radiance.\nWhatever the truth may be, eventually Malorne became Elune's consort. Elune gave birth to &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; from that relationship.\nBecause &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera the Dreamer&lt;/a&gt; agreed to act as Cenarius' foster mother, she has often been mistaken for the demigod's true mother. As a result, there are also rumors that she and Malorne had a romantic relationship. However, such rumors are baseless, though Ysera had a deep affection and respect for the demigod. He was one of nature's mightiest champions and a frequent visitor to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nDuring the War of the Ancients, Cenarius appealed to Malorne and the other demigods of Azeroth to join the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After much debate, Cenarius persuaded them to unite under the command of &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Captain Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, who was leading a large army of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and other creatures against the Legion. Cenarius had gone into a frenzy seeing &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt; die. Cenarius crushed hundreds of &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"felhunter\"&gt;felhunter&lt;/a&gt;s. The demons finally got hold of Cenarius, but before the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s could slay him, Malorne came into the fray blinding all demons with his majestic white flashing body. Malorne's hooves crushed many demons, while his antlers killed many others. Malorne defended his son Cenarius, and with a look toward the elves as if telepathically commanding them to come for his son, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and others dragged Cenarius to safety.\nMalorne's fury might have begun to turn the tide against the Burning Legion, had &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; not appeared. Black lightning struck the land around Malorne, baking it, then green fire from the ground engulfed Malorne, burning at his coat, while the land and rock formed giant hands that pinned his four legs to the ground. Archimonde swelled in size matching Malorne's height. Malorne freed himself from his magical trap, and charged Archimonde with his antlers, causing tremors and lightning as demons and Azeroth' races nearby shook and fell to the ground flat on their backs with astonishment. Malorne and Archimonde battled for some time, until, finally, Archimonde managed to seize Malorne and with great force snapped his neck. Cenarius's brave rescuer and father, limp and lifeless, was tossed aside by Archimonde. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; knowing Cenarius was unconscious and that Archimonde had just slain Malorne, cast a spell that engulfed most of Archimonde's body with vines. The Archdemon, analytical as always, decided to retreat by vanishing in a green flare of flames that consumed the vines.\nShortly thereafter (a few moments, in fact), &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, along with their dragonflights, joined the War of the Ancients. Ysera came to a screeching halt at the sight of Malorne and opened wide her brilliant jade eyes (one of only a few times she did so in recorded history) with a deafening shriek. As she tore through the carnage to her friend, thousands of demons were thrown in all directions with her paws and wings. Her rampage continued, making her way through to her goal, until she became still, her chin on Malorne's head. Sobs could be heard as She of the Dreaming mourned the White Stag's end.\nResurrection.\nAt the end of the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Sanctuary%20Must%20Not%20Fall\"&gt;The Sanctuary Must Not Fall&lt;/a&gt;, introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2\"&gt;patch 4.2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; successfully resurrects Malorne. After being resurrected, Malorne joins the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and defeats &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhyolith\"&gt;Lord Rhyolith&lt;/a&gt; and the other enemies attacking the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He then runs off towards &lt;a href=\"the%20Regrowth\"&gt;the Regrowth&lt;/a&gt; and is nowhere to be seen till after the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Power%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;The Power of Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, after which he appears at the Sanctuary once again.\nLegion.\nThousands of years ago, Malorne gave the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Idol of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; to the mortal druids and they kept it at &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Malorne's Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; returns during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; attempt to retrieve the Idol only to find it has been stolen by &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s. The Dreamgrove's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sylendra%20Gladesong\"&gt;Sylendra Gladesong&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of Malorne's own &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Antler\"&gt;Druids of the Antler&lt;/a&gt;, retrieve the Idol and bring it to the Dreamgrove, where the Cenarion Circle intends to use it to commune with Malorne at &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt Nordrassil, the druids gather to call upon Malorne, where the white stag reveals that his mind has grown clouded. When he sensed the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Malorne ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare's&lt;/a&gt; source. But when he reached the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, he saw the Nightmare's true strength, that it will fester and grow like a disease until it engulfs all of Azeroth. With Malorne trapped and no longer able to see the way back into the Dream, Remulos resolves to open the sealed portal to the Rift of Aln at the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; and save his grandfather.\nWithin the Emerald Nightmare, Malorne has become trapped in a recreation of his darkest nightmare: his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The druids enter the Nightmare and help the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s to fight off the demons, culminating in aiding Malorne against a figment of Archimonde himself. After being freed from the Nightmare, Malorne travels to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; and grants the grove's Archdruid his blessing and the duty of using Malorne's power to serve and protect the wilds.\nAbilities.\nMalorne was one of nature's mightiest champions and a frequent visitor to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, Malorne possessed a strong link to the Dream that was similar to that of a &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;. He, too, had dreamsight, and so simultaneously perceived both the Dream and the current state of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Malorne also possessed healing powers, along with a calming aura that sometimes stopped battles before they began. Furthermore, he was one of the first living beings in the world. By the time of his death, he had become one of Azeroth's most beloved and powerful demigods, and he was renowned for his wisdom.\nIn the RPG.\nMalorne the Waywatcher showed up to help the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; when a great crisis affected the world or the night elf civilization. Although he has great magical power, he is never shapeshifted into any other form. The stag prevented two civil wars among the night elves simply by making himself present before the astonished eyes of the night elves. Malorne was an excellent diplomat, opening dialogue between and pacifying conflicting parties.\"\nIn Hearthstone.\nMalorne appears as for the Druid class in the \"&lt;a href=\"Goblins%20vs%20Gnomes\"&gt;Goblins vs Gnomes&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion of \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"When Malorne isn't mauling hordes of demons, he enjoys attending parties, though he prefers to go stag.\"\nSpeculation.\nThere is some confusion as to the accuracy of the tauren tale, \"The White Stag and the Moon\". It seems unlikely that a being of Malorne's power would fear the tauren, much less be hunted by them. The question is not about the parentage of Cenarius, but rather, about the circumstances that led to this liaison. Some think it unlikely that the tauren could have posed a threat to him, and thus question the hunt that chased Malorne into the sky. There are likely explanations for the story:\nGiven the tauren's reverent attitude towards demigods and other natural powers, however, it seems unlikely that they would even be hunting Malorne in the first place.\nAn explanation for this would later come from the tauren druid &lt;a href=\"Matoclaw\"&gt;Matoclaw&lt;/a&gt;, who stated that Malorne was tracked by the \"greatest tauren hunters,\" as supposedly catching even a glimpse of his shimmering hide would bring great fortune to their tribe for a generation."}

Greydon and Charnas began conversing, but Silverlaine wasn't interested in that, so he left them alone.\nThe two brothers were members of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Seven%20Suns\"&gt;Order of the Seven Suns&lt;/a&gt; before Silverlaine betrayed the order and his brother. Wanting to own the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt;, given to Greydon by a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, and to prove his worth, he stole the blade and went to fight &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt;, the order's main enemy. Instead, Xaraax convinced him to &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;join him&lt;/a&gt;. When Silverlaine returned, he killed the naaru, shattering the blade and sending its shards across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\nMalus and the Hidden worked with the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; to locate Captain Greydon Thorne and his compass with whom he already had a certain history. As the Hidden were leaving, he noticed the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; warrior &lt;a href=\"Throgg\"&gt;Throgg&lt;/a&gt; and asked him to come with him. The ogre refused, so the human approached &lt;a href=\"Garamok\"&gt;Garamok&lt;/a&gt;, a Shattered Hand orc and asked him about the ogre and the orc stated that they want him for carrying supplies as the ogre can't be a true Shattered Hand. Malus then offered 30 silvers to Garamok and he released Throgg from his oath. The ogre then swore loyalty to his new brother, Malus and the Hidden.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Malus and his companions with the help of the traitor &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20Cobb\"&gt;Jonas Cobb&lt;/a&gt; attacked Greydon's ship the \"&lt;a href=\"Wavestrider\"&gt;Wavestrider&lt;/a&gt;\" on the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Sea\"&gt;Veiled Sea&lt;/a&gt; and slaughtered most of the crew, the only survivors being the second mate &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; and the cabin boy &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, Greydon's son and new keeper of the compass.\nLanding in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, the Hidden tracked Aram and Makasa throughout the forest, almost getting them and the compass when they caught the boy's new friend, the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Murky%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Murky&lt;/a&gt;, whom the Hidden wanted to trade for the compass. Aram, however, was captured by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20clan\"&gt;Gordunni clan&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving learned of this, the Hidden entered Dire Maul and Malus challenged &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt; to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; fight. The King refused saying that the opponent is no ogre, so Throgg challenged Gordok, and Malus offered to fight in Throgg's stead as his champion. The two entered the pit where Aram was previously fighting, but after a difficult fight, Malus took hold of the ogre's &lt;a href=\"morningstar\"&gt;morningstar&lt;/a&gt; and ended the King's life. He then fought against king's former guard and even rushed to get to Aram but was held and knocked out by the wyvern &lt;a href=\"One-Eye\"&gt;One-Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Aram and his companions escaped. As Malus saw them taking off, he shouted to stop them and Zathra responded by firing two bolts which hit the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thalyss%20Greyoak\"&gt;Thalyss Greyoak&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was then challenged by another, a single-eyed ogre named &lt;a href=\"Kor%27lok%20%28Traveler%29\"&gt;Kor'lok&lt;/a&gt; who acknowledged him as the new King Gordok. Malus thus accepted the challenge but chose Throgg to fight as his champion, and the one-handed ogre immediately killed the one-eyed ogre. Malus ordered his new ogres to leave Dire Maul and find the boy and the compass.\nThe Spiral Path.\nAramar coincidentally met &lt;a href=\"Charnas\"&gt;Charnas&lt;/a&gt; who revealed to him the existence of Silverlaine. The goblin told him that Greydon had been very proud of his brother, but that he only met Silverlaine once, so he wasn't sure what happened to him. Charnas knew that Greydon didn't mention him much, but when Charnas did ask about Silverlaine, Captain Thorne said that they hadn't seen each other recently.\nWhile Charnas and Aram's group were traveling to &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Charnas told Aram that on his last visit, Greydon told him that Silverlaine was somewhere in northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shining Blade.\nUnder the guise of Morris Wheeler, an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; infantry officer serving at &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expedition%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Northwatch Expedition Base&lt;/a&gt;, claiming to have known Silverlaine Thorne, sent a message to Thal'darah Overlook, inviting Aramar to meet him at the base. Unbeknownst to Aramar, it was an ambush, during which Malus killed Taryndrella and revealed his true identity, capturing Aram and taking his broken compass and the hilt of the Diamond Blade. With his new prize, he teleported to the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and remained there with his Gordunni guards and his master Xaraaax until Makasa led an Azerothian army against the Hidden. As the battle raged, Malus came to Xaraax to his sanctuary, but the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; turned on the human and attacked because he ran out of its usefulness. The demon took the hilt of the Diamond Blade from his body and proceeded to get the Hidden to the top of the citadel.\nVarious events unfolded, with Xaraax discarding his &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; sword and picking up the reclaimed Diamond Blade. As the demon prepared to destroy the naaru and release the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt; upon Azeroth, he did not expect that the broken Malus would hurry to take the dropped fel sword and stab Xaraax into his back and through his chest. Losing the Diamond Blade, Malus tossed the impaled dreadlord into the altar with the Darkstorm that swallowed the Highlord, hoping it would send him into the Twisting Nether. Malus kept the demon blade and ordered Ssarbik to summon him ogres and &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s to feed the Darkstorm while they will wait for Greydon to feed it. Throgg shouted in protest, but the fel-corrupted Malus ignored him. Soon, the Gordunni in shadowy shackles were brought to Malus by a &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20%28demon%29\"&gt;jailer&lt;/a&gt;. A portal, the swirling vortex of the Darkstorm, emerged and sucked them and the imps, stunning &lt;a href=\"Karrga\"&gt;Karrga&lt;/a&gt; in shock. She had been holding Valdread, but now the Forsaken slipped her and kicked the Diamond Blade towards Makasa. She quickly grabbed the weapon of the Light and blocked Malus' attack. The twisted human now called reinforcements and continued fighting. As fel and Light clashed, the roof exploded, the black vortex of the Darkstorm growing quiet for a moment.\nIn the meantime, Aram was freed, along with his father, Greydon and joined the chaotic fray. Reigol threw a small dagger at Malus but soon redirected his target at Ssarbik. Soon, the tide turned in favor of the children, defeating most of the Hidden and the demons. The two Thorne brothers faced each other, with Malus almost gaining the upper hand over Greydon, but ultimately it was Makasa with her Diamond Harpoon, and with the assistance from Aram, that ultimately faced Malus - the defeated Malus gathered his last strength to toss his fel sword at Makasa, but Aram used his new-found druidic power to blast the blade away, giving Makasa the opening to leap and strike Malus fatally.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; learned about Malus leading the Gordunni. When the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; visited Dire Maul, he confirmed that Malus no longer held the Gordok title.\nIdentity.\nBefore the revelation of Silverlaine's identity, there are several hints throughout the books that Malus could be someone else:"}

She's been described as \"really one of the ones that's out there, twisting the forest, cursing the things so that everything becomes kind of a creepy monster\". The ancient forest surrounding &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; was never entirely safe, even before it was cursed and transformed into the Witchwood, and entities like Glinda Crowskin are the reason why. For as long as anyone in Gilneas can recall, there have been tales of a sinister crone in the woods who can grant one's fondest desire \u2014 for the modest price of a human heart.\nIn the days since &lt;a href=\"Hagatha%20the%20Witch\"&gt;Hagatha&lt;/a&gt;'s curse began afflicting the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Witchwood&lt;/a&gt;, strange rumors have begun to spread, including ones that citizens have turned to a doomsaying \"Crowskin\" cult that operates in shadowy back rooms and cellars. It's very likely that Glinda Crowskin is the mastermind behind the \"Crowskin cult\" that has sunk its claws into the city's underbelly. Her deluded followers believe that Hagatha will grant them power in exchange for devotion. They break King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s curfew, sneaking into the forest in the dead of night to drink strange concoctions and perform mysterious rites. More disturbing still: somehow, more of the cultists return to the city after these nightly sojourns than had snuck into the woods in the first place. King Greymane has sent &lt;a href=\"Houndmaster%20Shaw\"&gt;Houndmaster Shaw&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the cult."}
