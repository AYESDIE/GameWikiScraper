Some of them showed signs of intelligence, with the ability to use &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;- or &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;-like abilities like &lt;a href=\"Reincarnation\"&gt;Reincarnation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Force%20of%20Nature\"&gt;Force of Nature&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Digging%20up%20the%20Dead%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;Digging up the Dead&lt;/a&gt; campaign mission &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; can come upon a \"secret society of Sasquatch\".\nIn the RPG.\nThe species of monstrous humanoid known as sasquatch is a cousin race to the &lt;a href=\"wendigo\"&gt;wendigo&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. These massive humanoid stands 9 feet tall. It looks vaguely ogre-like but is covered in a furry, sandy-colored pelt. It has long, sharp claws and a hungry gleam in its eye. They are huge beings of limited intelligence and even less personality. They roam singularly and prefer solitary hunting. Sasquatch are incredibly strong and fiercely territorial. They have sharp claws and are very fond of human and orc flesh. Though they will eagerly kill elves who encroach on their territory, it is well established that sasquatch will not eat elven flesh, instead leaving their night elf victim's corpse where it falls, untouched. (Sasquatch seem to be able to distinguish between night and high elves, perhaps by smell, and have no problem devouring high elf flesh.)\nLike &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, sasquatch tend to solve problems by smashing them. Unlike ogres, they tend to avoid other creatures, unless it is to smash or eat them. They prefer forests but will occupy any convenient location that provides them with food, treasure, and things to smash. Fortunately, Sasquatch mate only rarely. In groups, their aggression can be devastating to unprepared heroes. Sasquatch are matriarchal, and as a result, bands of Sasquatch typically represent a mother with her young, often only a single litter. Sasquatch are non-discerning in combat. They tend to use their claws and great strength in melee combat to rend their opponents."}

The Harvester earned its name as Sataiel methodically drained all life from the hapless inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, creating a potent magical nexus there in the process. Hunting down Sataiel, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; turned the scythe on her, sending her soul to join those of her victims.\nBiography.\nThe scythe's origins.\nBefore his fall from the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; defended creation from demons, imprisoning untold numbers of them in &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;, the Plane of Banishment. Over the millennia, these demons were not idle. The dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt; ruled the pocket dimension with an iron fist, plotting for the day when he would exact vengeance. \nWhen Sargeras shattered Mardum to recruit forces for the Burning Legion, he offered his former prisoners an ultimatum: join him or be cast into oblivion. Most of the demons accepted, but scores refused, rallying around Ulthalesh. In answer to the challenge, Sargeras forged a great felsteel scythe from the fires of Mardum's destruction, and he used it to harvest the souls of the recalcitrant demons, confining them in a new prison. Ulthalesh, strongest of will, was the last to be devoured. Sargeras named the scythe Ulthalesh, after the dreadlord who had risen up against him. Ulthalesh's spirit gave the weapon unfathomable strength, but with that strength came a curse, for those who bore Ulthalesh were inevitably consumed by it. The scythe would obey its masters' commands until they were mortally wounded; then Ulthalesh would feast on their souls. Over the centuries, Sargeras bestowed the blade upon cunning nathrezim, ferocious doomlords, and even potent demigods, only to see their spirits devoured by Ulthalesh after they fell. The scythe grew stronger with each master it absorbed, and it became difficult for Sargeras to find servants who could control the weapon.\nWielding Ulthalesh.\nMillennia ago, Sargeras gave Ulthalesh to Sataiel and commanded her to reap the souls of Azeroth's rebellious denizens, starting with the area that would later be known as &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;. No one knows what the land was called before the coming of Sataiel. Most would rather not think of it at all. It is the burial site of countless &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s who were methodically slain, their spirits consumed by Ulthalesh, fueling its power to murder more. The scythe would feed and feed until all of the inhabitants were dead. But Sataiel knew this was just the beginning, a promising start that only hinted at what Ulthalesh was capable of. Sargeras had dispatched her to break the will of Azeroth's denizens. It was not enough simply to kill them; bodies could be buried and forgotten. She decided to strike at the very heart of the land so that no new life could take up residence. With Ulthalesh, she would see that Deadwind Pass stood as a monument to the Legion's wrath.\nAfter she used Ulthalesh to consume the souls of all living creatures in Deadwind Pass, she turned the blade on the land itself, draining it of life. The trees were reduced to withered husks. The marshes became a desiccated waste. The sky turned a sepulchral gray, the sun covered in a burial shroud. Sataiel relished the despair of the scythe's new prisoners as they unwittingly assisted in the annihilation of their home. The destruction was absolute. Even Azeroth's slumbering &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; quailed.\nLike all who presume to wield this pernicious blade, Sataiel was ambitious, strong willed, and supremely confident. She had come to Azeroth to prove herself to Sargeras, but when she saw the heights of power she could reach with Ulthalesh, she wondered whether she'd set her sights too low. She had massacred thousands, turned the land into a tomb, and ripped open a magical nexus of unspeakable force. Her destiny was bright, and she needed no one's patronage to achieve it. Ulthalesh whispered to Sataiel from the scythe, infecting her mind. She decided to keep the magical nexus for herself, and she cast potent wards to hide it from the outside world. Then she cut off all contact with the Legion, biding her time until she and Ulthalesh had the strength to challenge the Dark Titan.\nWhen Sargeras discovered her deception, he was furious. The fount of power was his by right, and Sataiel was keeping it from him. Not only that, but his spies informed him that she was harboring delusions of grandeur, conspiring with the spirit of Ulthalesh to slay Sargeras. Such arrogance could not go unpunished. The upstart eredar had to be eliminated. Sargeras found his champion in &lt;a href=\"Scavell\"&gt;Scavell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. He sent the Guardian visions of a dangerous entity lurking in Deadwind Pass, a demon awaiting the return of the Burning Legion. Scavell boldly took up the charge, hunting down Sataiel and, after an epic battle, slaying her with her own weapon. Her soul was cast screaming into the scythe."}

They are created through the spreading of the ancient satyr curse, an affliction which originated with &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer who was destroyed and remade into a demonic form as a punishment for his failures by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. In modern times, satyrs mostly live in various sects throughout &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and exist only to harry their hated night elf cousins and obey the will of the Legion, though others have instead sworn fealty to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s and work to spread the influence of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWar of the Ancients.\nThe history of the satyrs started with &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the first &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Xavius was the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and loyal to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and the Burning Legion, tasked with opening and securing a portal connecting the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and Azeroth, a portal that &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; later managed to seal. Sargeras, creator of the Burning Legion, was enraged by Xavius' failure and tortured his disembodied spirit before deciding that Xavius might, after all, still prove useful. To that end, Sargeras created a new body for Xavius, who became the first satyr in existence. From the waist up, Xavius resembled his former &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; form, but his fingers now sported a set of sharp claws, and his head bore two horns. His goat-like lower body, however, had hooves and a long leonine tail.\nPleased with his creation, Sargeras sent Xavius back to Azeroth to further the Legion's ends. Xavius spread the demonic curse to other creatures--at first primarily other power-hungry Highborne who lived in &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that Malfurion ultimately destroyed Xavius again, satyrs worship Xavius to this day in the hope that he will one day return and lead them.\nThe satyrs are not the only ones who invoke Xavius' name. Scattered individuals venerate Xavius because they hope to become satyrs themselves. Fortunately, such practices are not widespread.\nAfter the War of the Ancients, many surviving satyrs were rounded up. &lt;a href=\"Thaon%20Moonclaw\"&gt;Thaon Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt; argued to execute them all but was overruled, and they were placed in an eternal sleep deep beneath the roots of &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Satyr.\nAfter the Legion's defeat, remaining demons and satyrs later rallied against the night elves in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;. The demons proved a powerful opponent to the night elves, but proved especially vulnerable to the uncontrollable &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;. The satyrs were ultimately defeated by the newly formed &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;. The war completely decimated any semblance of central leadership for the satyrs, forcing them to live in small sects to this day.\nThird War.\nThousands of years later, during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the satyrs played a small, but still important role in the Legion's invasion. They first appear after &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; spilled his blood into a fountain in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and corrupted the surrounding area. The satyrs tried to defend the fountain from the orcs that arrived to consume its energies in order to defeat &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. As a result of this confrontation, this small group of satyrs was slaughtered by the orcs.\nLater, the satyrs reappeared serving &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and the Burning Legion. They tried to stop the night elves, led by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and Malfurion, from awakening the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt;, but they were killed by the night elven raid. Later the satyrs faced and tried to stop &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to not only cleanse the land known as &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, but also to consume the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, the source of fel energy that was corrupting the land. They failed to defend the Skull, and were murdered by Illidan's army.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nA small group of satyrs joined Illidan's ranks alongside the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. This group, located in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, tried to stop the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; from reaching their master, near the night elf docks. They also manage to capture and torture a few night elves. Luckily for the night elves, Maiev manages to free them all and kill all satyrs who tried to stop her group.\nIt seems that not all satyrs led by Illidan were slain. During the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan has some satyrs under his command, who probably joined his ranks during the aftermath of the Third War based on the fact that that was the only moment when Illidan was seen in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; (the only place where you could find satyrs by that time).\nAfter the Third War, satyr raiders were igniting small conflicts across night elven territory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nFive years after the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, a great number of Satyrs could be found living in the lands of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They lived in small groups, each group with its own leader, and each group with its own goals. The ultimate goal of all the groups was still the same as the first satyrs to ever wander &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;: corrupt the land and its creatures. Some groups still remain in contact with the Burning Legion, while others act independently, but one thing is certain; they are not fully independent beings at all. When the Legion calls, they will answer.\nSome satyrs work by themselves, spreading the corruption amongst groups of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s and even giving missions to anyone who accepts them. All the groups of satyrs of Kalimdor suffered great losses by members of both &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and most of their leaders were killed, but it's likely that most of these groups still exist.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nSome satyrs served &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, their new master. They were the first occurrence of satyrs cutting their ties with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and serving a new master. They were very few and located in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. This group shared territories (old &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; ruins) with other servants of Illidan, such as &lt;a href=\"Sayaad\"&gt;succubi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dread Lords&lt;/a&gt;, while others lived in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and helped with its defense against the &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; offensive against the Temple.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nA small group of Satyr, known as the &lt;a href=\"Unbound\"&gt;Unbound&lt;/a&gt;, lives in the &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. They were turned into \"&lt;a href=\"crystal%20satyr\"&gt;crystal satyr&lt;/a&gt;s\" as the dragons of the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; launched a devastating attack on the high elves that had stolen their artifacts, turning the entire forest and its inhabitants into crystal. Evidence showed that they were trying to corrupt &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;s wandering there.\nCataclysm.\nWith the threat of the Twilight's Hammer some night elves called on the help of their imprisoned satyr brethren, though very distrustful. A quest chain of this nature can be completed in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Tyrus%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Tyrus Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;, and there was one who sought redemption from their wretched demonic form: &lt;a href=\"Avrus%20Illwhisper\"&gt;Avrus Illwhisper&lt;/a&gt;, who was eventually saved by &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and turned into &lt;a href=\"Avrus%20the%20Redeemed\"&gt;Avrus the Redeemed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Xaravan\"&gt;Archdruid Navarax&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Circle\"&gt;Emerald Circle&lt;/a&gt; in Felwood, was a disguised satyr.\n&lt;a href=\"Xorothian%20Satyr\"&gt;Some satyrs&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Xoroth\"&gt;Xoroth&lt;/a&gt; also tried to invade &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; alongside other &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nLegion.\nWith their master Xavius returned once again, satyrs broke out of their imprisonment under Shaladrassil. They had overrun both &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; as they spread the corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, helping the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; along the way.\nDescription.\nMasters of &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;demonic magic&lt;/a&gt;, all satyrs have been transformed into their current shapes by inheriting the demonic curse that originated from &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-based. These immortal &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s delight most in inflicting emotional and physical pain upon their enemies. These bestial demons have increased physical strength and an incredible talent for manipulation.\nLike Xavius, all satyrs have the ability to pass their curse on, and they have gleefully done so. The curse has therefore continued to spread, although it has weakened over time, and so very few satyrs are still being created. New satyrs can only be created by preexisting satyrs.\nOver time the satyrs discovered that they could pass their curse on to races other than the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. According to scattered reports, there are both male and female satyrs; however, researchers have failed thus far to secure irrefutable evidence of female satyrs on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Priestess%20%28satyr%29\"&gt;Fallen Priestess&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20Driana\"&gt;Priestess Driana&lt;/a&gt; is a female satyr but uses an in-game model entirely identical to the male satyrs.\nSatyrs corrupt lands and drain its magic. They feed off its purity, leeching and corrupting. The magic is stored in their hooves; the satyrs that have drawn the most magic are distinguished by their swollen, uncloven hooves.\nThey were described as &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;'s blessed servants.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;\nSects.\nSatyrs are organized into small sects.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe Satyrs of \"Warcraft III\", most of the times, appear as members of a faction called &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ancients\"&gt;Corrupted Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, a faction made of satyrs, &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"corrupted%20treant\"&gt;corrupted treant&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nUnlike most Highborne who aided the Legion simply to gain access to more magic, those who would become satyr embraced demonic power for its own sake and swore their allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, the first satyr. Xavius had been corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself and had the power to turn other willing &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; into satyr.\nThese former &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; were taken by the demons and twisted into shapes that more accurately reflected their nature. In place of their former sinewy elven bodies, they now possessed massive hairy forms, standing upwards of 9 feet tall. Their hands became claws, their feet replaced by cloven hooves and horns sprouted from their head. Even after the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the satyr continued to serve the Legion, working to corrupt the land and pave the way for a second invasion. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the satyr fought with the Legion and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Satyr are often found guarding corrupted &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s. The satyrs tend these moon wells corrupted with demonic energy. It is said that these pools are the source of new satyrs, transforming night elves into the twisted minions of the Legion. No one knows if corrupted moon wells work similar transformations in other species. Though &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; satyrs are rare, they do exist. Non-elves may not differentiate between high elf and night elf satyrs, but elves and satyrs claim the differences as clear as night and day. In the years since the War of the Ancients, other races have also joined the ranks of the satyrs, including; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Half-elf\"&gt;half-elves&lt;/a&gt;, high elves, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt; speaking races. It may be possible for members of nearly every race to become satyrs. A critical hit from the &lt;a href=\"Xavius%23Dirk%20of%20the%20Beast\"&gt;Dirk of the Beast&lt;/a&gt; can transform others into satyr, regardless of race. The black magic invoked in the transformations is known as the &lt;a href=\"shadow%20curse\"&gt;shadow curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe satyr still work to spread corruption and death, and are especially prevalent in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, though they inhabit most of regions of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Most satyr are capable of using &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; magic and are described as masters of demonic magic and so incredibly dangerous. But the satyr seem to still have connections to &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;. This can be seen at the corruption of plants they often create, and the fact that &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Melenas\"&gt;Lord Melenas&lt;/a&gt; can turn into a black &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alzzin%20the%20Wildshaper\"&gt;Alzzin the Wildshaper&lt;/a&gt; turns into a &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;. They are the most hated enemy of the night elves, but are hostile to just about every other natural race in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as well. Satyrs are &lt;a href=\"immortal\"&gt;immortal&lt;/a&gt;.\nCulture.\nSatyrs possess little culture. Their society is loosely hierarchical, and they are organized into groups. Each group is called a \"sect\". A sect of satyrs lives in the same geographical region and has a specific mission. Satyrs of different sects get along only some of the time. They live in ruins scattered throughout northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;; satyrs prefer places of corruption to make their homes, such as &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and certain areas of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Their sects are small, usually no more than a hundred individuals. Satyrs are cruel and sadistic creatures. They enjoy tormenting other creatures, particularly intelligent ones. Satyrs patrol their territory, hoping they can find travelers they can eviscerate in the most bloody manner possible. They operate at a faster level than their former selves \u2014 while before they may have been stately and calm, they now burn with feverish energy. Their movements are swift and jagged, like predators sensing prey.\nOrganization.\nSatyrs are organized only loosely, into a variety of sects. When the alarm sounds, all members of a sect throw themselves into battle. Like all demons, when the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; calls, they scramble to obey.\nFew creatures clash with satyrs on their own territory, however. Satyr camps are well hidden and often located in areas already dangerous, like &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. They are also well protected; only army divisions or powerful adventurers could hope to rampage through a satyr community. Thus, most encounters with satyr forces occur elsewhere \u2014 often on the roads and paths through the forests.\nSatyrs have no sense of honor, especially concerning warfare. They do whatever is necessary to destroy their opponents, preferably causing a good deal of pain \u2014 both physical and psychological \u2014 at the same time. They prefer ambushes and scare tactics, perhaps stalking a group for several days, leaving subtle clues to their presence to make their prey more and more paranoid and fearful; then they strike. They enjoy incapacitating their enemies with nets and dark magic so they can carve them up at their leisure; they also enjoy the fear and panic they cause when they weaken and capture and bleed instead of outright kill.\nFew satyrs become &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s, so they do not possess the tough, front line soldiers that other forces do. In their strongholds, they must rely on &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20ancient\"&gt;corrupted ancient protector&lt;/a&gt;s to serve in this capacity; but when they strike out at others, they are weak in this area. Many satyrs become &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, and this disparity is one reason they prefer ambushes and guerilla tactics \u2014 hopefully, satyr rogues can incapacitate enemy &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s soon after combat is joined, thereby leaving them free to strike at vulnerable spellcasters and war machine crews.\nSatyr &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s who distinguish themselves \u2014 or show a certain penchant for painful traps and ambushes \u2014 are called &lt;a href=\"Satyr%20trickster\"&gt;satyr tricksters&lt;/a&gt;. Satyr ranged support usually comes from magic. A few satyrs become &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s; some become dark spellcasters called &lt;a href=\"Satyr%20soulstealer\"&gt;soulstealers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Satyr%20hellcaller\"&gt;hellcallers&lt;/a&gt;. Satyr rogues are fairly common. Some rogues take some training as &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s in order to add some curses to their repertoire; these individuals are called &lt;a href=\"shadowdancer\"&gt;shadowdancer&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hellcaller\"&gt;hellcaller&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s work well together; the rogues dart in to disembowel their enemies while the spellcasters summon reinforcements, enhance their allies, hamper their enemies, and call up blasts of entropic flame.\nEncampments.\nMost of the Satyr's camps, if not all of them, have no large buildings\u2014most of them are made of small tents and a few firepits. Some encampments are built in the ruins of former &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; settlements. \nIn some camps there can be found corrupted &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Well\"&gt;Moon Well&lt;/a&gt;s, sacrificial altars and wooden walls to defend themselves from outsiders. One structure that can be spotted in many Satyr camps is a strange red monument, a defiled night elf shrine of some kind. While its use is unknown, it looks like an important structure for the satyrs, since it's not uncommon to be seen.\nNames.\nSatyr naming practices are similar to those of their original race, but focus on their unique and corrupt natures. Their surnames often develop from their evil deeds, while some go without surnames. A few satyrs don\u2019t change their names after their transformations.\nLanguages.\nSatyrs speak &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;, and whatever was the primary &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; of the satyr's former life. &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20%28language%29\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; are often secondary languages (unless one of these was the satyr's primary language in his former life then it remains one of their primary languages). Satyrs pick up the languages of their enemies and those creatures who they might find useful.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s are said to be reborn in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and return upon death. Satyr are described as immortal demons and are classified as such in the game, but none of the killed named satyr have returned yet. It could be thus speculated that satyrs are not true demons or that they are just an exception to the rebirth."}

Satyr hellcallers are warlocks (or, occasionally, other &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt; classes) who manipulate &lt;a href=\"entropic%20fire\"&gt;entropic fire&lt;/a&gt;. As &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, satyrs hunger for life and magic, and they delight in cruelty. Many members of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; are skilled wielders of fel magic. Furthermore, unlike arcane magic, the use of fel magic corrupts the user\u2019s body and soul. By contrast the chief danger of arcane magic is that using it inevitably leads to the desire to wield greater power: power that only &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic can provide. Some satyrs become hellcallers \u2014 arcanists who, rather than summon demons, manipulate the entropic fire of fel power. Entropic fire is fel energy given substance: it is entropic fire that burns on &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s, and it is entropic fire that ran down the body of the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20the%20Destructor\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;. Entropic fire burns, as does normal &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, but it is more sinister still: it feeds on life, including the life of its wielder. The iconic satyr hellcaller is large and imposing. He stands close to the &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s who fight at his side, allowing them to benefit from his spells. The green-yellow flames he summons immolate flesh and consume life."}

They are found across &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, in dungeons and in the open. They also attacked &lt;a href=\"The%20Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;The Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; from the sea, led by &lt;a href=\"Vordraka%2C%20the%20Deep%20Sea%20Nightmare\"&gt;Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nCreation and rebellion.\nThe saurok were likely created in the &lt;a href=\"Saurok%20Creation%20Pit\"&gt;Saurok Creation Pit&lt;/a&gt; during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, as the Throne of Thunder was abandoned afterwards.\nIn the search for shock troops to consolidate their hold over ancient Pandaria, the mogu turned to an unlikely source: the fauna of the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. The mogu chose several particularly sturdy varieties of local reptiles, and &lt;a href=\"Flesh-Shaping\"&gt;twisted them in body and mind&lt;/a&gt;, imbuing them with an upright gait and sufficient intelligence to wield weapons A saurok culture of superiority and hatred for weakness developed, fueled by the ego of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; masters. Soon, saurok guards began to plunder the very people they were supposed to police. They grew disobedient, turning on their own mogu commanders whenever they were displeased with the spoils of war.\nRebellion.\n&lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dojan\"&gt;Emperor Dojan&lt;/a&gt; responded in the traditional mogu way: the souls were ripped from every living saurok in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, and he demanded the same fate for the legions still in the field. So began the great &lt;a href=\"Purge%20%28war%29\"&gt;Purge&lt;/a&gt;. Defiant to the last, the saurok stood their ground against the mogu in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;swamp of Krasarang&lt;/a&gt;. It was here they had a fighting chance, drawing the imperial forces deeper in to unfamiliar territory. The mogu death toll began to climb as the rebels poisoned water supplies and sabotaged structures. In his fury, the Emperor Dojan continued to send troops, slaves, and weapons to Krasarang in an effort to eradicate what remained of the saurok. They were never successful. &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dojan%20II\"&gt;Emperor Dojan II&lt;/a&gt;'s maniacal drive to finish his father's work and complete the Great Purge against the rebellious saurok legions drove him to leave his court in disarray while he set out on a doomed military campaign. From his perch high on the cliffs overlooking the Krasarang Wilds he oversaw the slow clear-cutting of the jungle, the establishment of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Dojan\"&gt;Dojanni Dungeons&lt;/a&gt;, and the gradual genocide of the saurok race. What he didn't expect was for the remains of the saurok fifth and seventh legions to scale the enormity of the cliffs in the dead of night, ambushing his imperial pavilion from the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; and forcing him over the edge. His body was never found. And the resulting disarray in the capitol left the empire in chaos for over two years while the saurok melted back into the wilds and disappeared.\nModern saurok.\nAfter the mogu withdrew from the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20empire\"&gt;Pandaren empire&lt;/a&gt;, their creations, the Saurok, survived by scrounging and hiding in the wild places of Pandaria. As lone bandits possessed of brute strength and innate aggression, the Saurok can be dangerous enough \u2013 but they have slowly begun to organize in roving warbands. Unburdened by \"civilized\" notions of property, these raiders charge into battle, seeking the spoils of softer races. The ruthless saurok now roam Pandaria, stealing what they can and harassing the island's other inhabitants. The &lt;a href=\"Glintrok\"&gt;Glintrok&lt;/a&gt; can be found on a daring mission to plunder &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt;. The most infamous of these reptilian pillagers are &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Salyis\"&gt;Chief Salyis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Salyis%27s%20Warband\"&gt;his warband&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Vordraka%2C%20the%20Deep%20Sea%20Nightmare\"&gt;Vordraka, the Deep Sea Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; leads the saurok attacking both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; encampments upon the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt; faces off against him within the wreckage, aided by players. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Skumblade%20tribe\"&gt;Skumblade tribe&lt;/a&gt; are led by the s, who promote the idea that the saurok were not created by the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, but instead were created by &lt;a href=\"Kros\"&gt;Kros&lt;/a&gt;, the invisible &lt;a href=\"devilsaur\"&gt;devilsaur&lt;/a&gt; in the sky. is held to be a gift from Kros and and a glimpse at the Skumblade's future.\nSaurok form.\nThe buff \"Skin of the Saurok\" comes from doing the quest &lt;a href=\"Skin%20of%20the%20Saurok%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Skin of the Saurok (quest)&lt;/a&gt;. You only need to complete this quest once to start getting the buff; it will be applied on each subsequent return to &lt;a href=\"Ihgaluk%20Crag\"&gt;Ihgaluk Crag&lt;/a&gt;. The buff transforms you into a Saurok that runs quickly on all fours, travels very far when jumping, takes no fall damage and is friendly to all Saurok unless in combat.\nIf you have a &lt;a href=\"combat%20pet\"&gt;combat pet&lt;/a&gt; with you, it will also get this buff, and randomly transform into of one of the following creatures:\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion \"\" features a group of saurok living in the humid swamps of &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;. While saurok are not previously known to exist in Un'Goro, \"Hearthstone\" Game Designer has stated that with the saurok's mogu creators having been created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and with Un'Goro being such a heavily titan-influenced location, it's not so unrealistic that similar beings were created there. Blizzard originally planned to introduce an all-new reptilian race that would have resembled crocodiles or alligators more than lizards, with the reasoning that the nearby &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; would have had to create a bulkier version of the saurok to combat the &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s of Un'Goro. However, it was eventually decided to simply use the pre-existing saurok instead.\nWhile traveling through an Un'Goro marsh, &lt;a href=\"George%20Herbert%20Doyle%20IV\"&gt;Professor Doyle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eddie%20Malone\"&gt;Eddie Malone&lt;/a&gt; were briefly captured by saurok before they were rescued by a group of &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s.\nNotably, the &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Madness\"&gt;Un'Goro Madness&lt;/a&gt; micro-holiday in \"World of Warcraft\" features a lone saurok &lt;a href=\"dinomancer\"&gt;dinomancer&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Akaridal\"&gt;Akaridal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Progenitus\"&gt;Progenitus&lt;/a&gt; may have been the first saurok created by the mogu, judging by his name and his title, &lt;The Firstborn&gt;."}

{"id": "319896", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=319896", "title": "Completionist", "text": "A completionist, aka completist, is a person who attempts to obtain everything in a collection, thus completing it. The terms are not World of Warcraft-specific.\nProfession completism.\nThe most common meaning of \"completionist\" in World of Warcraft is a player who attempts to learn every &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; in a specific &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Categories_of_professions\"&gt;production-profession&lt;/a&gt;. Being able to do so will \"differ\" that player from other players with the same profession, as it is somewhat uncommon to know every recipe. In short, it is one of many ways to prove one's skill in the game. On a more practical side it may increase the player's potential when it comes to money - being able to produce items which most other players cannot will often create a market (see &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trade%20chat\"&gt;trade chat&lt;/a&gt;) with very little competition. Also, knowing many recipes may improve a player's standing with other players; &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt;s will often require players with a moderate to high skillfulness in different professions to support its members. \nThere are several reasons why acquiring every recipe in a profession is a challenge:\nDrops.\nA recipe may &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; from one or more &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s. There are many reasons why this can be a problem:\nReputation.\nA recipe may be sold by a &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt; which is difficult to and/or extremely time-consuming to gain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;rep&lt;/a&gt; with.\nVendor.\nA vendor which sells the recipe may be hard to access:\nRestriction.\nSome recipes are only available to specific classes, such as . While this kind of recipe can be \"discarded\" by the classes who cannot learn it, it will still be a recipe other players may learn (which is slightly bitter). Another - somewhat infamous - example is which after &lt;a href=\"patch%201.3.0\"&gt;patch 1.3.0&lt;/a&gt; has been &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt;. Copies of the non-BoP version are extremely valuable.\nAchievement.\nA recipe may be rewarded from completing a specific &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; which very well may be hard and/or time-consuming to complete. One example is which is rewarded from (&lt;a href=\"Guild%20achievements\"&gt;Guild achievement&lt;/a&gt;). Another example is the &lt;a href=\"Wispcloak\"&gt;Wispcloak&lt;/a&gt; which is taught by tailoring trainers if the player has completed .\nQuest.\nA recipe may be rewarded from a quest which is hard to complete. One example is rewarded from &lt;a href=\"A%20Binding%20Contract\"&gt;A Binding Contract&lt;/a&gt; which requires a &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Ingot\"&gt;Sulfuron Ingot&lt;/a&gt; to complete. These ingots will only (and not always) drop from &lt;a href=\"Golemagg%20the%20Incinerator\"&gt;Golemagg the Incinerator&lt;/a&gt;, a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;. Another prime example is before the quest was removed from the game.\nRemoval from game.\nRecipes that for some reason has been removed from the game pose perhaps the largest threat to completionists, as these recipes are no longer available by any means (except from ranting about it on the official WoW forums). One example is which was removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%204.1.0\"&gt;patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; was revamped. Some of these recipes may later return, such as &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Spider%20Kabob\"&gt;Kaldorei Spider Kabob&lt;/a&gt;.\nOther types of completism.\nAchievements (in general).\n&lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Achievement&lt;/a&gt;s are notifications, proofs and rewards for performing different actions. Many of them are part of a category, such as \"&lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"Professions\". Many players are very enthusiastic about completing achievement, and completing all achievements within a category is often an impressive feat. The most extreme players are going for as many achievements as possible. Three of the most \"completism-like\" categories are instances, exploration and guild (notice that these do also have their own sub-categories).\nInstances.\n&lt;a href=\"Instance\"&gt;Instance&lt;/a&gt;s (aka \"dungeons\") make up a large amount of the entertainment in World of Warcraft. As such, many players devote themselves to experience (explore, overcome, etc) the different instances. There are several achievements which also will track this progress, such as , and .\nExploration.\nTraveling all over World of Warcraft will take some time and reward exploration-achievements such as and . They will eventually join together, ultimately yielding &lt;a href=\"Universal%20Explorer\"&gt;Universal Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuild.\nMany &lt;a href=\"guild%20achievements\"&gt;guild achievements&lt;/a&gt; focus on different types of completism, usually (if not always) signalizing, encouraging and rewarding cooperation among the guild members. Examples are and .\nKey factors for success.\nEach recipe and achievement has its own instruction for obtaining/fulfilling. There are however some key factors which all players who could be called \"completionists\" should possess:"}

They are the masters of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and embracers of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; - for light cannot exist without darkness, and darkness without light. They fought the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; alongside the other &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class orders&lt;/a&gt; during the demons' &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; came into contact with a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; by sending a &lt;a href=\"Hooded%20Priestess\"&gt;Hooded Priestess&lt;/a&gt; to invite them at &lt;a href=\"Faol%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Faol's Rest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, in order to organize a stronger resistance to the Legion threat. There, the priest hero met Alonsus Faol accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the undead introduced himself as having formerly been a leader of &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;a church&lt;/a&gt;, a mindless minion of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and a commander in a secret war, but always as a priest first. As the Legion poses a threat that cannot be ignored, he decided to step out from the shadows, believing that they must unite priesthoods of all denominations against their common enemy, before asking them if they were ready to act as their champion.\nAfter the priest hero agreed, Alonsus Faol sent them on a mission to obtain the legendary artifacts that are &lt;a href=\"T%27uure%2C%20Beacon%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;T'uure, Beacon of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath%2C%20Blade%20of%20the%20Black%20Empire\"&gt;Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, in order for them to face the trials ahead.\nAfter successfully recovering them, the priest hero met &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; who want to take them somewhere, but before that, he explained that over the long years of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;'s flight from the Burning Legion, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; helped them, sometimes at the cost of their very lives, and they would have perished without their aid. At last, they found a way to repay their kindness, after discovering a naaru that had turned to the void, they decided to build a prison to contain the &lt;a href=\"Void%20god\"&gt;Void god&lt;/a&gt;, known as &lt;a href=\"Saraka%20the%20Lighteater\"&gt;Saraka the Lighteater&lt;/a&gt;, and study the fallen creature. A place to commune with the naaru and ponder the nature of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;. There the draenei sought to devise a ritual that could turn the naaru back to the Light, to aid their quest Alonsus Faol called together many priests to work in unison, purifying the naaru &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the priest hero, and bringing it back to the Light. Following this success, Alonsus Faol announced the creation of the Conclave as every priesthoods from all over Azeroth have agreed to donate time and resources to this new order, with a singular purpose: the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the Conclave transformed the prison into a temple that will serve as the headquarters of their campaign, Alonsus Faol notably managed to borrow one of the dwarves' foremost experts on artifice and enchanting, &lt;a href=\"Betild%20Deepanvil\"&gt;Betild Deepanvil&lt;/a&gt;, in order to empower their artifacts. The Conclave then began to mobilize their priests on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, where they notably save &lt;a href=\"Archon%20Torias\"&gt;Archon Torias&lt;/a&gt;, a skilled researcher whose knowledge extends far beyond light and shadow who agreed to lend his expertise to their cause. Subsequently the Conclave organized the recruitment of champions, especially &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Ishanah\"&gt;High Priestess Ishanah&lt;/a&gt;, but also the recruitment of new troops such as Group of Acolytes and &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Paragons\"&gt;Netherlight Paragons&lt;/a&gt; formed by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Anchorite%20Gesslar\"&gt;Grand Anchorite Gesslar&lt;/a&gt;, who pledged his service to the order, Band of Zealots and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Zealot%20%28Netherlight%20Temple%29\"&gt;Dark Zealot&lt;/a&gt;s formed by &lt;a href=\"Vicar%20Eliza\"&gt;Vicar Eliza&lt;/a&gt;, who commanding countless devotees that do her bidding without question, and finally &lt;a href=\"Hooded%20Priest\"&gt;Hooded Priest&lt;/a&gt;s recruited by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Mourn\"&gt;High Priestess Mourn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter one of their &lt;a href=\"shadow%20priest\"&gt;shadow priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilner%20Greymoss\"&gt;Gilner Greymoss&lt;/a&gt;, fell into madness within the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Void\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Void&lt;/a&gt;, the priests of the Conclave learned from the latter that the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; had warned him of their fate, a gruesome death. Despite Alonsus' reluctance to believe the gnome, Velen asked the priest hero to join &lt;a href=\"Zabra%20Hexx\"&gt;Zabra Hexx&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, so that they create an elixir to induce a vision in order to find out whether the shadow priest is lying or not. After saving Zabra caught by a &lt;a href=\"basilisk\"&gt;basilisk&lt;/a&gt;'s gaze and Yalia captured by a herd a &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, while they were delivering antidotes to the front lines of &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt;, the priest hero brought the &lt;a href=\"Felbat%20Toxin%20Salve%20%28use%29\"&gt;Felbat Toxin Salve (use)&lt;/a&gt; to cure the demon hunters at &lt;a href=\"Faronaar%20Front\"&gt;Faronaar Front&lt;/a&gt;, before bringing the elixir and the &lt;a href=\"Lens%20of%20the%20Tide\"&gt;Lens of the Tide&lt;/a&gt; to the Prophet. In his vision, the Conclave learned that the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; intended to attack the Netherlight Temple with his armies of demons, but that the hero priest would guide them to victory, all unite under the Light.\nSubsequently, the Conclave began to prepare for the demon assault, notably with the &lt;a href=\"Spark%20of%20Light\"&gt;Spark of Light&lt;/a&gt;, recovering from an ascending &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Hyrja\"&gt;Hyrja&lt;/a&gt;, and then five &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Pure Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; gleaned from the holiest places in Azeroth, in order to release them into the Netherlight Temple to creating the champion &lt;a href=\"Sol\"&gt;Sol&lt;/a&gt; with other &lt;a href=\"lightspawn\"&gt;lightspawn&lt;/a&gt;. Later, the Conclave sent its troops to figure out who among their enemies could be a potential ally and discovered that there are a few defectors among the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;. The priest hero traveled to &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to investigate and see if these defectors can be brought to the Light. They managed to stop and save &lt;a href=\"Mariella%20the%20Heretic\"&gt;Mariella the Heretic&lt;/a&gt; from her execution, while the latter decided to prove that she was worthy of a second chance by rallying and freeing other supporters of his cause, and killing a large number of members of the Scarlet Onslaught. After having managed to escape, Mariella Ward went to the Netherlight Temple with the priest hero, begging the forgiveness of Alonsus Faol by claiming to want to support the cause of the Conclave against the Burning Legion as new allies, what Alonsus ends up accepting in the face of the crisis they are facing. At the same time &lt;a href=\"Delas%20Moonfang\"&gt;Delas Moonfang&lt;/a&gt; urgently presented herself to them, explaining that she has been working with &lt;a href=\"Aponi%20Brightmane\"&gt;Aponi Brightmane&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; of her &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;order&lt;/a&gt;, and that they have translated a codex that details the Legion's plans to establish an invasion point at &lt;a href=\"Felblaze%20Ingress\"&gt;Felblaze Ingress&lt;/a&gt;. She then requested permission to be able to take a small group of priests to accompany the paladins in their search of this demon world, in order to find Balnazzar, which Alonsus also approved.\nAfter fulfilling the first part of the prophecy, Alonsus Faol sent the priest hero to the &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill%20Cemetery\"&gt;Raven Hill Cemetery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, in order to restore the Cult of Forgotten Shadows by helping few remaining followers of the cult near the grave of their fallen leader. They met &lt;a href=\"Micah%20Belford\"&gt;Micah Belford&lt;/a&gt; who explained that they were never been ones to follow the Light, at least not in the way that most would want them to, as they embrace the Shadows, finding their faith in the balance between both extremes. Micah Belford subsequently requested the help of the priest hero to recover &lt;a href=\"Natalie%27s%20Journal\"&gt;Natalie's Journal&lt;/a&gt;, in which she noted a spell to sent her spirit to an unknown location of the Void when she knew about her inevitable death for her beliefs, however, the tome has since fallen into the hands of those who wished her dead in the first place.\nFollowing their victory, the Conclave joined the other orders, represented by Alonsus Faol, to form the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;. Their priests were present to repel the legion's assault on &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and to fight alongside their allies during the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. They were also present on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying the High Priest to fight the demons and protect the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\".\nAt some point during the invasion, &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; attained the title of Archbishop of the Conclave.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; sent someone to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; to ask the Conclave priests to aid them. He felt certain that &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Archbishop Faol&lt;/a&gt; would be glad to help. It's unknown if the Conclave answered this call.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Conclave makes its appearance in the priest section of the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Patrice%20Lancaster\"&gt;Patrice Lancaster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elton%20Campbell\"&gt;Elton Campbell&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Goodchilde\"&gt;Martin Goodchilde&lt;/a&gt; as priest trainers.\nNotable members.\nTroops.\nThey deploy Group of Acolytes, &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Paragons\"&gt;Netherlight Paragons&lt;/a&gt;, Band of Zealots, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Zealot%20%28Netherlight%20Temple%29\"&gt;Dark Zealot&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hooded%20Priest\"&gt;Hooded Priest&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Although they are spread out, engaging one djinn in combat engages them all. While they will not leave their platforms, each of the individual lords will put a significant debuff (such as reducing &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; by 500% with increasing frost damage over time) on all players if at any point there is no attackable target on their platform.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"With Siamat, Lord of the South Wind, imprisoned by the Neferset tol'vir, Al'Akir's lieutenants are vying to fill the power vacuum that now exists in the Conclave of Wind. The remaining conclave members are Anshal, Lord of the West Wind, whose gales can heal allies and poison enemies; Rohash, Lord of the East Wind, whose tempests can grind the mightiest mountains to dust; and Nezir, the Lords of the North Wind, whose frigid storms have claimed more lives than all other cardinal wind lords combined.\"\nLegion.\nSeveral years later, after &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; became the new &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt; of Air, the Conclave of Wind objected to his rule, believing that &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; was the rightful heir to the throne. Thunderaan asked for his new ally, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, to convince them otherwise. Eventually the Conclave relented and Thunderaan declared that, united, they were a cyclone of power, never to dissipate again. It is unknown how they are still alive, as dying in &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; during the Cataclysm should have meant they died for good.\nAbilities.\nEnrage.\nBosses enrage after 8 minutes in 25-man normal mode.\nOverview.\nEach of the Djinn has an &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; bar that slowly approaches 90. All three gain energy at the same rate, and all three reach 90 at the same time, at which point all three cast their most powerful abilities. \nIf any Djinn is left alone on his platform with no player in range, it will cast a raid-wiping ability:\nAll three of these abilities include a zone-wide AoE damage tick that increases over time.\nYou can move between their platforms by jumping into a wind bridge that connects the platforms. However, the bridges disappear when the Djinn are at 90 energy and using their special abilities.\nBoth Anshal and Nezir do normal melee damage, while Rohash does not require a tank.\nWhen one Djinn dies, it begins to cast Gather Strength, which resurrects it to full health after one minute. Thus, all three Djinn need to be killed within one minute of each other.\nStrategy.\nThe fight itself does not start until someone actually attacks one of the bosses. Thus, you can hop around all the platforms and set up without fear of an early and unwanted aggro.\nThe encounter consists of two alternating phases:\nThe general goal is to kill Rohash and Anshal at as close to the same time as possible, while having done enough damage to Nezir during full energy phases to burn him down within the one minute resurrection timer.\nRecharge Phase.\nDuring the recharge phase, split DPS between Rohash and Anshal, while assigning just a tank and the tank's healers on Nezir.\nThe Rohash group requires fewer DPS and healers, and generally favors ranged DPS due to the Tornadoes that it summons. No tank is needed since it has no hard-hitting melee attack. Instead, he casts randomly at anyone on the platform. This group needs to watch for Tornadoes and Wind Blast, which can knock you off the platform. The Wind Blast mechanic is similar to the Spout spell from &lt;a href=\"The%20Lurker%20Below\"&gt;The Lurker Below&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;. Rohash starts at a random direction and moves clockwise for 10 seconds, blasting anyone in its line of sight. Everyone on the platform must move clockwise to avoid the blast or be knocked off and most likely killed.\nThe Anshal group requires a tank and slightly more healing compared to the Rohash group. This group also needs extra DPS, due to adds and Anshal's healing ability. When Anshal summons Ravenous Creepers, the DPS must split these up and burn them down quickly before the Toxic Spores stack too high on everyone. An extra tank or high armor DPS can help to separate them. Avoid the Soothing Winds healing circle on the ground, as it heals the boss and Creepers, and pacifies any player in it.\nThe Nezir group requires only a tank and healing. During the recharge phase, do not DPS Nezir. The tank needs to face the boss away from anyone else to avoid excess damage from Permafrost. The healers must move out of any Ice Patches that appear, and take care not to stand on the pathways coming in to the platform. During the full energy phase, players from the other platforms will move to Nezir's platform, and they don't want to land in a patch of ice. Wind Chill will stack on the Nezir group and damage will increase throughout the phase.\nThe tank and tank healers for Anshal and Nezir will swap positions every other recharging phase to deal with the stacking Wind Chill debuff.\nFull Energy Phase.\nAt around 80 energy, most of the raid should swap to the Nezir platform to handle Sleet Storm. The bridges to move between platforms disappear at 90 energy, so players should allow enough time to make it over to their new platforms.\nThe entire Rohash group, except for a single healer, must now move to the Nezir platform. The single healer left behind at Rohash needs to handle the Hurricane, which works much like the Vortex ability in the &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; encouter. This healer should be able to heal himself through the Hurricane with instant abilities, and survive the moderate fall damage at the end.\nThe entire Anshal group, including the tank and tank healers, then move to the Nezir platform. The DPS should be sure they've finished off any remaining Creepers before transferring, or they will be healed during Zephyr.\nThe tank and tank healers at Nezir's platform then move to Anshal's platform to tank him through Zephyr.\nDuring the Sleet Storm, burn down Nezir as much as possible. The raid will be taking constant damage from Sleet Storm during this phase. As long as enough people are still alive and the damage is split sufficiently, the raid healing should be manageable.\nOnce Sleet Storm is finished channeling, DPS move back to their previous platforms, Anshal or Rohash, and continue to bring them down evenly. The tank and tank healers for Nezir and Anshal remain at their swapped positions. This is to allow enough time for the stacking Wind Chill debuff to fade from the tank group that just handled Nezir.\nNezir Burn Phase.\nAnshal and Rohash should die at as close to the same time as possible. Once one dies, the one minute resurrection timer begins, and you need to be able to finish off Nezir before they resurrect. If one is almost dead while the other is behind, call to stop DPS and let them catch up. If one is consistently far behind by the time they are almost dead, then re-balance your DPS groups for the next attempt. It's also possible to re-balance DPS mid-fight after full energy phases when everyone is at Nezir's platform.\nOnce Anshal and Rohash are dead, everyone moves to Nezir's platform to finish him off. By this time, he should be well below 50% health from previous Sleet Storm phases. Save Heroism/Bloodlust abilities and big DPS cooldowns for this final burn phase. You need to kill him before Anshal or Rohash resurrect, and also before the Wind Chill debuff stacks too high for your raid healers to manage.\nIf the burn phase is not working out, consider intentionally delaying the death of Anshal and Rohash to add an extra full energy phase to bring down Nezir a bit lower. Note that this approach will bump you closer to the enrage timer. Alternatively, consider staying on Nezir for a few more seconds after a Sleet Storm, before moving back to Anshal and Rohash, to bring him down a bit more. However, staying on Nezir means increased raid damage from Wind Chill, possibly falling behind on adds summoned by Anshal, and increased damage to the lone healer still at Rohash.\nThe key to this fight will be finding the right balance of DPS for each group assignment, and making the final burn phase doable.\nAlternate Strategy: No Rohash healer.\nIn normal 10 man mode, it is possible for two casters with self-healing damage abilities to fight Rohash without a full-time healer. If they can use instant casts and defensive cooldowns during Hurricane, and avoid falling damage afterward, so much the better. The lack of healer on Rohash frees a spot in the roster, which could be used for an add tank for Anshal, another damage dealer, or simply more heals on the other platforms.\nWarlocks and/or shadow priests are ideal for the Rohash casters, since they have draining / vampiric abilities for survival, and &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Circle\"&gt;Demonic Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Levitate\"&gt;Levitate&lt;/a&gt; for a soft landing after Hurricane. Shadow priests can use direct heals to bring either caster back to even if one is unlucky enough to receive a number of Slicing Gales in a row (targeted randomly), but should only do so sparingly due to their mana inefficiency. Similarly, they should avoid the trap of burning up mana healing themselves from low health, only to have insufficient mana to use vampiric abilities to keep from falling to low health again! In general, those casters should call out for a healer to briefly visit their platform and top them off if they start to get low.\nIt is usually best for both casters to stay for the Hurricane. If one leaves, than the other will take several Slicing Gales in a row during both the departure and return, and the self-healing strategy relies on the damage being fairly evenly distributed. One other complication can arise if they find themselves ahead of the other groups on boss health: since they rely on dealing damage to heal themselves, they will be unable to stop DPS safely. Careful attention to the three bosses' health bars should tell them at which point to reduce damage outputs (to a minimum of using only those abilities that maintain their mana and health). Healers should be prepared to visit the platform and top them off more frequently if those casters are forced to stop damage entirely.\nDiagrams.\nThe exact number of DPS on Rohash/Anshal can be varied to account for your raid's strengths and weaknesses. Some raids only have two DPS on Rohash for the first recharge phase and reassign one of them to the Anshal/Nezir team afterward. Some raids have DPS start on Nezir and go back to Anshal just before the first adds are summoned. As you get a feel for how your raid performs you will find a way to tune your assignments.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

It connects the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Promenade\"&gt;Grand Promenade&lt;/a&gt; in the northwest to &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of the city further south. A series of stairways on the bridge allows one to traverse Suramar's various levels, while a teleportation elevator provides access to the &lt;a href=\"Aetherium\"&gt;Aetherium&lt;/a&gt; below.\nThe Concourse of Destiny is decorated with a great many statues, vegetation, and benches, suggesting its function as a meeting place for the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; people. The bridge itself is a part of a major road highway that runs from the city through the wider &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; region to &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;another Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually on to &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nRunning through central Suramar and connecting much of the city, the Concourse of Destiny is thus a major feature utilized by &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; residents. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the bridge was guarded and patrolled by forces of the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, Suramar's main peacekeeping force.\nEventually, the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; erupted in the &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; region, and Suramar City became the focus of increased tension between those loyal to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, and those who supported the revolution. At the conflict's climax, the city itself was assaulted by &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; and their allies, who succeeded in seizing and holding a foothold. Battling to reach the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, the attackers clashed with &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; defenders for control of the Concourse of Destiny. &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; notably engineered a mass teleportation spell to forcibly force Duskwatch troops off the plateau.\nUltimately, the Nightfallen were successful in reaching the Nighthold. &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s were subsequently left behind to hold the Concourse's upper level and keep the path cut through the city open."}

The &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20Northshire\"&gt;Brotherhood of Northshire&lt;/a&gt; notably employ the &lt;a href=\"%3AInvisibility\"&gt;:Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; spell to make the confessing of secrets that weighed heavily upon the souls of worshipers easier to speak. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, it was the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; who ministered the duties of the clergy in the churches of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, the priestess &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress\"&gt;Paletress&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; offered to the faction's champions to hear their confessions if they had any doubts, any worries, or any uncertainties, even if they are not devotees of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. She answered their questions and guided them with her wisdom to ensure that the tournament went smoothly.\nIt is also the duty of the confessors to ensure the rites for the dead, in order to allow the spirits to rest in peace.\nNight elves.\nAs members of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; have a duty to listen to the confessions of those who need to confess their mistakes and ease their conscience.\nZandalari trolls.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; split off from the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, other &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s came to regard the Zandalar tribe as an overarching priest caste for all trolls.\nThe Zandalari invest power in those who speak with the authority of divinity. Their priests are more than just &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s - they are also confessors. Evil comes both from outside threats and from within the tribe, and the confessors act as the judges amongst the tribe, preserving them from evil. The confessors not only keep the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; in tune with the spirits, but they also preserve the flesh.\nThe confessors of the Zandalar all wear a distinctive mantle, marking them as the preservers of the tribe. These mantles are woven with powerful &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; that aids them in judging those who would threaten the tribe.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27ai\"&gt;Dazar'ai&lt;/a&gt; are a group of fanatics tasked with defending &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt; and cleanse it of the corruption brought by &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, among them are &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27ai%20Confessor\"&gt;confessors&lt;/a&gt; who use the powers of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;.\nVenthyrs.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Halls of Atonement&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; confessors have the duty to listen and encourage the &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s of the dead to confess, as they must confess their sins and mistakes in order to reach repentance, otherwise they would have been sent to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nIn spite of the fear that even other members of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; feel toward them, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20inquisitor\"&gt;Scarlet inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s retain the role of confessor, moral support, and other responsibilities that one might expect from a priest of the Church of the Holy Light."}

And then you can have a single light addon that just calls all of these functions.\nIt is \"not\" meant as a way to open configuration dialog boxes. The purpose is to quickly show and unlock all movable/sizeable frames so the user can arrange them.\nThe idea evolved in &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.wowace.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D14765\"&gt;this WoWAce forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpecification.\nAt its core, an addon supports ConfigMode by simply creating an entry in the global CONFIGMODE_CALLBACKS table:\n -- Create the global table if it does not exist yet\n -- Declare our handler\n CONFIGMODE_CALLBACKS[\"MyAddon\"] = function(...) ...code... end\nThe \"MyAddon\" name will likely be visible in controller addons implementing this spec.\nNote that you not are restricted to a single entry per addon. You can have multiple entries if it makes sense for you (e.g. multiple modules in an addon). We \"strongly recommend\" that you follow a pattern of \"\"addonName\" - \"moduleName\"\" when you do so, including the spaces. This may then be used by controlling addons to group your modules.\nSimple handler.\nThis handler, let's say myHandlerFunc, can be called in two ways:\n * myHandlerFunc(\"ON\"): the addon should enter configuration mode,\n * myHandlerFunc(\"OFF\"): the addon should leave configuration mode.\nHere is a simple handler sample for an addon named MyAddon that provides two methods to lock and unlocks its frames:\n -- Create the global table if it does not exist yet\n -- Declare our handler\n CONFIGMODE_CALLBACKS[\"MyAddon\"] = function(action)\n if action == \"ON\" then\n MyAddon:UnlockFrames()\n elseif action == \"OFF\" then\n MyAddon:LockFrames()\n end\n end\nModules.\nPlease follow the below syntax for an addon with modules; it will allow controller addons to group them if they so desire.\n CONFIGMODE_CALLBACKS[\"MyAddon - ModOne\"] = ...\n CONFIGMODE_CALLBACKS[\"MyAddon - ModTwo\"] = ...\n CONFIGMODE_CALLBACKS[\"MyAddon - ModThree\"] = ...\nMultimode handler.\nSome addons can have several different layouts and thus different test modes. This is the case of several unit frame addons.\nSuch addons can publish a more elaborated handler that supports the following calls:\n * handlerFunc(\"ON\", mode): enter configuration mode \"mode\"\n * handlerFunc(\"OFF\"): leave configuration mode\n * mode1, mode2, mode3, ... = handlerFunc(\"GETMODES\"): list available modes.\nHere is the sample of a unit frame multimode handler:\n -- Create the global table if it does not exist yet\n -- Declare our handler\n CONFIGMODE_CALLBACKS[\"MyUnitFrameAddon\"] = function(action, mode)\n if action == \"ON\" then\n MyUnitFrameAddon:EnableTestMode(mode) -- note: mode can be nil!\n elseif action == \"OFF\" then\n MyUnitFrameAddon:DisableTestMode()\n elseif action == \"GETMODES\" then\n return \"party\", \"raid\"\n end\n end\nLoD addons.\nIf your addon is load-on-demand, you may want to give controlling addons a hint that your addon can/should be loaded. If so, add the following line to your .toc file:\n X-ConfigMode: true\nImplementation notes for controller addons.\nYou are of course free to \"not\" call all handlers listed in the table. You can e.g. allow making sets of addons that are config-enabled and disabled. Or know about circumstances where it makes sense to not show some addons. That is beyond the scope of this specification.\nYour addon can certainly also handle unlocking and showing blizzard frames, and/or frames of addons not implementing the ConfigMode spec. That is also beyond the scope of this specification."}

After the events of the last arc, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt; must return home. But who will return with them? And what role will &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; play in this next quest?\nPlot.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, Varian, Anduin, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; celebrate &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s death. Varian tells the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; guards that accompanied him that they have earned their king's gratitude and will return home as heroes, after which a national fete will be held to commemorate the defeat of the dragon and the restoration of Stormwind's ruler. Varian then decapitates Onyxia's corpse so her colossal head can be delivered back to Stormwind via &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; as proof of their victory. The king tells Thargas that he needs to return to Theramore for a short while. The &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; replies that he'll be accompanying the guards back to Stormwind as he has arrangements to make regarding &lt;a href=\"Hjalmar%20Anvilmar\"&gt;his brother&lt;/a&gt;'s death and his own estates. Varian thanks Thargas for his help and friendship and promises that Stormwind will lend its aid to &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar%20family\"&gt;Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt; should it ever be needed. After the king and his companions exit the dragon's lair, Broll summons roots from the earth to seal away the opening and destroy Onyxia's unhatched offspring.\nMeanwhile, far away in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stasia%20Fallshadow\"&gt;Stasia Fallshadow&lt;/a&gt; enters the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Vision\"&gt;Pools of Vision&lt;/a&gt; with a scroll in her hand. Months earlier, an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; discovered the parchment inside a casket of pure &lt;a href=\"khorium\"&gt;khorium&lt;/a&gt; in a small cave between &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing its importance, he brought it to Stasia, whose specialty is the translation of ancient tomes. After disposing of the orc's body, Stasia journeyed to the Pools of Vision with the scroll, which contains a potentially world-shaking prophecy about a foretold savior of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Using her powers and the magic in the pools, Stasia begins conjuring visions to find the location of the prophesied hero. She sees a &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;newly pregnant half-orc female&lt;/a&gt; standing over the body of a &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;dead king&lt;/a&gt; and later giving birth to a hybrid son. The half-orc leaves the infant in the care of her friend, the ancient &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Meryl%20Felstorm\"&gt;Meryl Winterstorm&lt;/a&gt;, as she considers herself to be a danger to her child. She tells Meryl that the boy's name is &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; and asks him not to tell him anything about his mother. For a moment, Stasia is shaken by the sight of the mage, whom she realizes is not a recent victim of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; like herself but instead keeps himself alive by his own magic and strength of will. As the visions continue, Stasia sees Meryl carrying Med'an away from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;a burning city&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, where he trains the growing boy to defend himself and control his burgeoning power. After considering what she has learned, Stasia exits the pools and tells her &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;hooded companions&lt;/a&gt; that the boy is in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and that they'll leave for &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt; immediately.\nWhile Varian, Anduin, Broll, Jaina, and Valeera are traveling through &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina suggests rescheduling the diplomatic summit with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; that was interrupted by Onyxia's meddling months earlier. Varian is reluctant as he still deeply distrusts orcs. However, Jaina reminds him that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; is the true enemy of orcs and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s alike and that Thrall wants to lead his people to peace. Anduin tells his father that establishing peace is something a king should do if he can, and Valeera points out that the meeting would also be about what Varian wants and that it's wise for a king to know his enemies, real or otherwise. Varian relents and agrees to attend the meeting, even if he doesn't expect anything to come of it. He then formally offers Broll and Valeera a permanent place by his side in Stormwind. Broll reacts in a grouchy manner, but Valeera is excited at the prospect of having a home, something she hasn't had since she was younger than Anduin.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;'s Brightwood Grove, Meryl and Med'an are seen gathering wood while a group of cultists watch them from behind some nearby bushes. The entire scene is in turn observed by a shadowy figure seated high up in the canopy above. The cultists suddenly charge out of the shadows to attack Meryl and the boy, who do their best at defending themselves. When an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; clobbers Med'an over the head and a hooded orc begins to carry him away, Garona leaps down from the trees and kills both of the thugs. She tells Meryl to get Med'an to safety while she provides cover by killing the rest of the cultists. Med'an recognizes the woman as someone who once sheltered him when he was very young, but Meryl tells him that she is just \"A half-orc. An outcast. No one.\" Suddenly, a word that sounds like &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt; rings out, paralyzing Garona. Med'an rushes back to help her, but finds that the half-orc has disappeared and that all of the thugs lie dead.\nIn Theramore, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; welcomes Jaina, Varian, and Anduin back. However, Jaina is quickly off again, using her amulet to contact Thrall before teleporting to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; to meet with him and discuss the upcoming summit.\nAt the same moment in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall listens to two of his advisors \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 loudly arguing with each other. Garrosh considers it to madness to suggest to Thrall that the orcs should cooperate with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, while Rehgar insists that it's common sense for orcs and humans to try to peacefully coexist as they have common enemies. Thrall interrupts the discussion when he notices his amulet glowing and states that he'll be leaving the city for a short while. While the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; is walking out, some of the orcs in the room whisper about how he rushes off to meet \"the human female\" as soon as she summons him, that his alliance with the humans is a sign of weakness, and that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; needs new blood like Garrosh.\nThrall arrives in Razor Hill via zeppelin and meets with Jaina, who informs him of Varian's return and that the king has agreed to meet with the warchief in a new summit in Theramore. Thrall worries that some of his people are growing impatient both with the current peace and with him as its author, and that now is not a good time to be away from Orgrimmar for long. Jaina assures him that it'll only be for a couple of days, that Varian is no more thrilled about it than Thrall, and that a real alliance would benefit both the Alliance and the Horde. Thrall reluctantly agrees to attend for Jaina's sake but prays that the occasion doesn't turn itself into the biggest catastrophe of his career.\nPreview.\nA seven-page preview of the issue is available &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/wccomic/issue-15-sneakpeek.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

It shimmers like a chained sun. Unleashed, A'dal's power might destroy cities or topple mountains.\nIt is a &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located in the central dome of the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; next to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"neutral\"&gt;neutral&lt;/a&gt; city of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn Shattrath.\nAs with most of the naaru, little is known of A'dal personally, though it appears to count Khadgar and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; as personal friends. Right before the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt; began, Khadgar and Velen reached out to the naaru independently, both seeking aid against the dark forces amassing on Outland. The &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; heard their pleas but the Army's battles with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; were costly and ceaseless, so they could not spare soldiers to protect Outland. Instead, A'dal, &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to help the people of Outland and arrived with &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;. A'dal and his compatriots, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;, arrived and assisted the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; in reclaiming the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. A'dal also approved an alliance between Shattrath's forces and the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, to the extent that Khadgar moved to Shattrath to assist the Sha'tar.\nAt some point after &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s victory over Magtheridon, an army of blood elves marched on the city. But instead of laying siege to Shattrath, their leader, &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Voren'thal the Seer&lt;/a&gt;, kneeled before A'dal and pledged the support of his forces, the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, to the cause of A'dal and the Sha'tar. &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; attempted to get A'dal and the Sha'tar to fight the forces of Illidan alongside her, but A'dal stated that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was a greater threat and because Illidan also fought the Legion he was not an enemy of the Sha'tar. A'dal did, however, try to convince Maiev to ask the Scryers for aid. Maiev turned down this offer.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt some point prior to the blood elves' assault on Tempest Keep, Velen made a cryptic prophecy concerning the redemption of a people cursed by blood. A'dal and the other naaru realized what was to come, allowing &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; to be captured by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s forces and sent back to Silvermoon to power the Blood Knights. Ultimately, the prophecy was proven true when M'uru was again kidnapped by Kael, this time stealing him away from his own people. With the entirety of Kael'thas's betrayal now exposed, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to Shattrath City to beg the naaru's forgiveness. A'dal revealed the nature of the prophecy and assured the Blood Knights that the naaru harbored no ill will towards them. Liadrin promptly re-dedicated the Blood Knights to furthering the cause of the Sha'tar and stopping their former Prince once and for all.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Med%27an\"&gt;Med'an&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; visited Shattrath, A'dal urged Med'an to meditate on his decisions, cautioning that his choices could lead him to become a weapon against evil or a bringer of doom.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Bridenbrad\"&gt;Crusader Bridenbrad&lt;/a&gt; is struck with the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; during the assault on &lt;a href=\"Scourgeholme\"&gt;Scourgeholme&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; sends willing adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually A'dal in an attempt to save Bridenbrad. After completing the quest, Crusader Bridenbrad ultimately dies, only to have A'dal appear along with two other naaru: &lt;a href=\"K%27uri\"&gt;K'uri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"M%27ori\"&gt;M'ori&lt;/a&gt;. A'dal personally tells the adventurer that \"\", and instead of becoming a mindless undead &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Bridenbrad \"shall taste only paradise\".\nTides of War.\nLikely under &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s request, A'dal sent &lt;a href=\"General%20Tiras%27alan\"&gt;General Tiras'alan&lt;/a&gt; and other draenei to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, commanding them to protect and defend the port city against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;."}

Release one at a time in case the spirit beasts turn hostile.

It occupies the right-most &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slot\"&gt;slot&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Interface%20Bar\"&gt;interface bar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe amount of &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt; (, , or ) the character possesses is shown at the bottom right of the backpack window.\nSeveral additional currencies, such as &lt;a href=\"%3ADarkmoon%20Prize%20Ticket\"&gt;:Darkmoon Prize Ticket&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"%3ATimewarped%20Badge\"&gt;:Timewarped Badge&lt;/a&gt;s, can be set to be displayed at the currency window.\nThe backpack has 16 slots by default, though &lt;a href=\"Vulpera%20%28playable%29\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; characters have access to 8 additional slots for a total of 24 thanks to their &lt;a href=\"Alpaca%20Saddlebags\"&gt;Alpaca Saddlebags&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;. The backpack can be expanded with 4 extra slots, for a total of 20 slots (28 for vulpera), by adding an &lt;a href=\"authenticator\"&gt;authenticator&lt;/a&gt; to the account.\nTechnical difficulties.\nWhen asked in 2011 &lt;a href=\"Ask%20the%20Devs\"&gt;Ask the Devs&lt;/a&gt; about increasing the size of the backpack or replacing it, the answer given was that it was technically challenging due to the manner in which the slot was coded and could cause major breaks in the game (such as loss of players' gear). This is because the backpack is into the game, making any modification a very risky proposition. This was later expounded upon during the &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202015\"&gt;BlizzCon 2015&lt;/a&gt; Engineering Community Amphitheater Discussion:\nThis was directly contradicted the following &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt; during the \"World of Warcraft\" Q&amp;A panel. According to Lead Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Goss\"&gt;Matt Goss&lt;/a&gt;, the difficulty of upgrading the backpack had been \"almost a myth\" that even the design team themselves had believed. The reality is that it actually isn't nearly as difficult and hopefully will be \"&lt;a href=\"Soon\"&gt;Soon&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDuring &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202017\"&gt;BlizzCon 2017&lt;/a&gt;, it was announced that the number of slots could be increased by adding an &lt;a href=\"authenticator\"&gt;authenticator&lt;/a&gt; to one's account. How many slots would be added was not mentioned at that time but, when the first &lt;a href=\"PTR\"&gt;PTR&lt;/a&gt; build for &lt;a href=\"patch%207.3.5\"&gt;patch 7.3.5&lt;/a&gt; became available, it would turn out to be four."}

Only the hardiest of creatures can survive in the arid wastes, such as feral &lt;a href=\"coyote\"&gt;coyote&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"cougar\"&gt;cougar&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"buzzard\"&gt;buzzard&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; have a pronounced presence in the area, mainly in the &lt;a href=\"Lethlor%20Ravine\"&gt;Lethlor Ravine&lt;/a&gt; and, later, in the &lt;a href=\"Dustbowl\"&gt;Dustbowl&lt;/a&gt;. Scattered across the Badlands are camps of the &lt;a href=\"Dustbelcher\"&gt;Dustbelcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe region is often mistaken for being an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; territory. It is an extreme environment, it is imperative to have an excellent map of the ruins and surroundings to survive, the sandstorms sweeping the region can confuse the landmarks. It is advisable to travel at night, to sleep during the day, to protect your face from sand and winds, and to provide plenty of water, or a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite its position between &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, the Badlands have traditionally been &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; territory, though the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; have recently established the encampment of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Mouth\"&gt;Dragon's Mouth&lt;/a&gt; in the western part of the region. To the north of Dragon's Mouth lies the Horde stronghold of &lt;a href=\"New%20Kargath\"&gt;New Kargath&lt;/a&gt;, built after its &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;predecessor&lt;/a&gt; was buried by an avalanche during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. In the east is the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Fuselight\"&gt;Fuselight&lt;/a&gt; and its sister port town, &lt;a href=\"Fuselight-by-the-Sea\"&gt;Fuselight-by-the-Sea&lt;/a&gt;, both controlled by the neutral &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. In the west, a massive, charred ravine called the &lt;a href=\"Scar%20of%20the%20Worldbreaker\"&gt;Scar of the Worldbreaker&lt;/a&gt; was formed when &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; passed through the area.\nIn the northeast, near the border with Loch Modan, lie the ruins of a &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; fortress known as &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;, home to titan-forged &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, savage &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, and much information about the origins of the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; race, while the smaller &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Watchers\"&gt;Tomb of the Watchers&lt;/a&gt; has recently been unearthed in the center of the region. As a result, the Alliance-affiliated &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarven &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; are fighting for control over the ruins and any &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts that may lie within.\nHistory.\nSecond War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; were tasked with escorting &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and his entourage of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; through the Badlands in order to have him personally inspect the &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refineries&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. A taskforce of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; warriors were present in the area despite the occupation of Khaz Modan by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s were killed by the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nYears later, &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt;, the only &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; at the time, was located here. The &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Expeditionary%20Force\"&gt;Kargath Expeditionary Force&lt;/a&gt; was sent by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; himself to slay &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; of the renegade &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;. The fort was destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and replaced by nearby &lt;a href=\"New%20Kargath\"&gt;New Kargath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a large number of dwarves, mostly prospectors and other members of the &lt;a href=\"Explorer%27s%20League\"&gt;Explorer's League&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt; also built two towns, &lt;a href=\"Fuselight\"&gt;Fuselight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fuselight-by-the-Sea\"&gt;Fuselight-by-the-Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nGetting there.\nPlayers can access the zone by using a rocket from &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; that goes to the goblin port, &lt;a href=\"Fuselight-by-the-Sea\"&gt;Fuselight-by-the-Sea&lt;/a&gt;, with the quest &lt;a href=\"Fuselight%2C%20Ho%21\"&gt;Fuselight, Ho!&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is also accessible on foot by a mountain pas from the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, or alternatively, from &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, by a ramp that leads down the chasm between the two zones and another one back up.\nGeography.\nThis desolate wasteland is cracked and dry, consisting mostly of flat stretches of land enclosed by the surrounding mountains. A few hills dot the landscape, and the eastern part of the zone is a large canyon.\nThe instanced dungeon &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this area. In addition, there are a few &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt; in the Badlands. There are no battlegrounds in this zone.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Badlands are a cracked desert of dry earth, scattered boulders, and winding canyons. &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s trundle across the cracked ground, looking for victims. &lt;a href=\"Lion\"&gt;Lion&lt;/a&gt;s prowl the canyons, and &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s hunt across the evening sky while &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s man a fortress to keep a watch on their renegade brethren in the eastern lands. Add to this &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;'s old enemies\u2014 &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and it is clear why this region is called the Badlands. Yet in all this chaos stout Ironforge &lt;a href=\"prospector\"&gt;prospector&lt;/a&gt;s shrug off the danger and search this desolate land for &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; artifacts, inspired by the recently unearthed &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly one permanent settlement exists in the Badlands, but numerous interesting sites draw dwarven prospectors and other explorers. Ogres, &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, vicious animals and Dark Iron dwarves threaten the tiny dwarf and orc enclaves.\nHistory.\nAges ago, the Badlands were a verdant valley, lush with natural resources. Three hundred years ago &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' arrival blasted this region, scorched the land, and transformed it into what it is today \u2014 a desolate, barren wasteland. The area is inhospitable, and was rarely visited until recently.\nIn the northern Badlands there is a canyon, in which lies the entrance to Uldaman's ruins \u2014 a massive, ancient Titan city. Ironforge prospectors discovered the ruins only a few years ago and they contain markings bearing secrets of the dwarves' true ancestry. Unfortunately, after months of digging and uncovering amazing finds, including scrawls in the ancient tunnels that gave them the first hint of the dwarves' true genesis, the prospectors also unearthed another Titan remnant: the vile and primitive &lt;a href=\"Stonevault\"&gt;Stonevault troggs&lt;/a&gt; who had been sleeping within. These foul creatures drove the dwarves from the site and claimed Uldaman as their own, now bitterly defending their stolen city. If not for the troggs, the dwarves would have all sorts of Titan powers at their disposal, with the interesting &lt;a href=\"Stoneform\"&gt;stone flesh thing&lt;/a&gt; being just the beginning. Some would think the Titans, being as smart as they were, could have found a better place to put these vile creatures.\nSome Ironforge prospectors discovered a small cave system that would eventually wind into one of Uldaman's recesses. &lt;a href=\"Ooze\"&gt;Ooze&lt;/a&gt;s and monstrous &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s infested the cave system, and troggs ruled the underground Titan city. Yet the caves leaded directly to a massive room, at the far end of which is a block inscribed with spidery runes. Troggs worshiped this strange altar. They nevertheless noticed the prospectors and attacked the dwarves, who fled their vast numbers. Only one prospector managed to survive. Now, he hopes to hire a band of mercenaries to assist him in sneaking into the Uldaman temple and claiming the altar.\nPeople and culture.\nFew people live in this realm, and \"culture\" is nonexistent. &lt;a href=\"Drysnout\"&gt;Drysnout gnolls&lt;/a&gt; are more numerous than the other factions, due mainly to the fact that their birth rate is higher than that of randy rabbits. The gnolls are easy prey for the Dark Iron dwarves, drakes and ogres that roam the Badlands. You can tell a Drysnout because he wears brown clothing, simple leather armor, and is running for his life.\nThe Badlands holds few cultured races. Ironforge prospectors brave the dangers to search for Titan relics. These brave dwarves keep themselves well defended, carrying axes and rifles as well as picks and shovels. Small teams and wagons move carefully across the baked earth. If you see a dwarf in the Badlands that is not a Dark Iron, he is a prospector. These dwarves often hire mercenaries for additional protection. If you wish to travel in the Badlands it is suggested joining one of these expeditions for mutual protection.\nThe Horde has an outpost in the Badlands called &lt;a href=\"Kargath\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt;, and the orcs within are strong and noble. They are a bit suspicious, but so is everyone in the Badlands. Kargath's citizens are almost all &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, and they welcome any good soul who enters, whether Horde or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe Badlands is a high desert valley, bone dry and hot. The &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; is to the west, while the lush &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; is located in the mountains to the north. Searing winds blow the heat around but do nothing to cool this sweltering land. The harsh environment allows only the heartiest plants \u2014 cacti and shrub brush \u2014 to survive. You can bring plenty of water, but it still might not be enough. It is advised for you to read up on your desert survival skills before coming here, travel at night and sleep during the day.\nThe Badlands are rocky and flat. Mountains to the north block cool air and moisture from Loch Modan. Canyons surround the Badlands, and they are rife with &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;s and vicious humanoids. Only the hardiest plants and animals survive \u2014 withered trees, cacti, scorpions and &lt;a href=\"bobcat\"&gt;bobcat&lt;/a&gt;s. The landscape also hides &lt;a href=\"Earth%20elemental\"&gt;rock elementals&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller ones are easier to kill. Run from the bigger ones unless you want to see what you look like as a pasty smear on the ground.\nSpeculation.\nThere seems to be a buried &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; temple to the northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Dustbowl\"&gt;Dustbowl&lt;/a&gt;'s middle part.

Dark Iron dwarves clash with ogres and drakes, while Horde orcs man a fortress to keep watch on their renegade brethren in the eastern lands. Ironforge prospectors search this desolate land for Titan artifacts, inspired by the recently unearthed &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an immense ruin that held the first clues to the dwarves\u2019 lofty origins. Stonevault troggs, released after millennia of slumber, slaughtered the explorers and viciously defend their stolen city.\nOnly the hardiest of creatures can survive in the arid wastes, such as feral coyotes, cougars and buzzards. In the far east is a region inhabited by black dragon spawn. Scattered across the Badlands are camps of &lt;a href=\"ogres\"&gt;ogres&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dustbelcher\"&gt;Dustbelcher&lt;/a&gt; tribe. In the northwest is a tiny &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; outpost. The northern reaches of this rugged land are home to ruins that were the workings of the ancient race, the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. These ruins are known as &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; also have a large fortress just south of Uldaman.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, warriors of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; escorted &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, and his entourage to &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; through the Badlands. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s rightfully expected an ambush by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, notably by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThis desolate wasteland is cracked and dry, consisting mostly of flat stretches of land enclosed by the surrounding mountains. A few hills dot the landscape, and the eastern part of the zone is a large canyon full of &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe instanced dungeon &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this area. In addition, there are a few &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt; in the Badlands. There are no battlegrounds in this zone.\nNotable Characters.\nThe Badlands are home to several characters of note. At his camp in the Dustbowl, &lt;a href=\"Lotwil%20Veriatus\"&gt;Lotwil Veriatus&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in his latest experiment. South of Hammertoe's Digsite, &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Ryedol\"&gt;Prospector Ryedol&lt;/a&gt; attempts to cleanse Uldaman of the evil Dark Irons. And at Kargath, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Goretooth\"&gt;Warlord Goretooth&lt;/a&gt; and his men send bold adventurers into the dark Blackrock Mountain in search of retribution.\nQuests.\nThe following items are used to complete various quests within the Badlands. Therefore, it is advised to retrieve the following items before going to \"Badlands\":\nResources.\nThis is an area rich in Minerals and Herbs. The minimum level of mining is around 125-150, but within a few hours you can rise to the 200 area. Even &lt;a href=\"Gold\"&gt;Gold&lt;/a&gt; veins appear rather frequently.\nSpeculation.\nThere seems to be a buried &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; temple to the northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Dustbowl\"&gt;Dustbowl&lt;/a&gt;'s middle part.

The dwarves later increased their military due to dealing with various rogue elements, and were thinking of asking the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army to establish a military presence in the area as it was also of strategic importance.\nThe group is separated in two parts - the scientific and the military one. The scientific branch under &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Khazgorm\"&gt;Prospector Khazgorm&lt;/a&gt; cares for the excavations, while the military branch, led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Twinbraid\"&gt;General Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt; secures the digsites and fights intruders. Therefore the dwarves built &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Keep\"&gt;Bael'dun Keep&lt;/a&gt; and stationed a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; there. They have two known digsites, &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Digsite\"&gt;Bael'dun Digsite&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBael Modan was once a part of the lands that served as home and provider to the &lt;a href=\"Stonespire%20tribe\"&gt;Stonespire tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Then the dwarves came and began their excavation operations, forcing the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; out and killing many innocent who opposed. &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Khazgorm\"&gt;Prospector Khazgorm&lt;/a&gt;'s own journal says they drove out the tauren because they were being a nuisance to the operations, as for the dwarves it was more important their work than the \"comfort of the local inhabitants\". Not only that, but Bael Modan's strategic position might be of value to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tauren tried to approach the dwarves of Bael'dun to reach a diplomatic resolution but it failed. Tired of waiting and angered about his people's persecution, &lt;a href=\"Gann%20Stonespire\"&gt;Gann Stonespire&lt;/a&gt; sent a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champion to reclaim the journal of Prospector Khazgorm and retaliate against the dwarves, killing Khazgorm in the process. After gathering supplies to make explosives, the champion was tasked do use them to destroy a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; to show the dwarves a lesson. \nHere the dwarves use heavy explosives to break through even the most dense masses. During their excavations, they found the &lt;a href=\"Tear%20of%20the%20Moons\"&gt;Tear of the Moons&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient artifact, but &lt;a href=\"General%20Twinbraid\"&gt;General Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt; locked it away. &lt;a href=\"Feegly%20the%20Exiled\"&gt;Feegly&lt;/a&gt;, exiled for becoming obsessive and trying to use the Tear, retrieve them with the help of a Horde champion.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Digsite\"&gt;Bael'dun Digsite&lt;/a&gt; is a small excavation operation west of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. They disregarded the pleas of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; who said it was angering the spirits of the earth. He sent his people to steal and smash the dwarven tools in order to stop them.\nCataclysm.\nIn the end, Baine was right as after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Bael'dun Digsite became empty as the occupants were killed by the angry spirits of the earth.\nDuring the Alliance offensive against the Horde settlements in the Barrens, &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed and other areas occupied by the Alliance military. Gann Stonespire was one of the mortally wounded. During their last raid to Bael'Dun Keep, Gann and his party managed to smuggle a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; saboteur inside: &lt;a href=\"Weezil%20Slipshadow\"&gt;Weezil Slipshadow&lt;/a&gt;. An Horde champion was sent to assist him. After finding the plans of the keep and location the ammunition room, the two sabotaged the artillery shells and tried to escape while the keep was destroyed in the explosion. Although the adventurer survived, Weezil did not.\nSometime before the destruction of the keep, General Twinbraid, who was scouting the Barrens, sent an Alliance adventurer to the excavation site at Bael Modan. There the adventurer was met by Twinbraid's son, &lt;a href=\"Marley%20Twinbraid\"&gt;Marley&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarf sent him to finish off &lt;a href=\"Feegly%20the%20Exiled\"&gt;Feegly the Exiled&lt;/a&gt;, who had turned into a &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt; after so much contact with the Tears of the Moons. Afterwards, the Horde raid Bael Modan. The champion defended the excavation site while retrieving artifacts and helping Marley repair his own flying machine. The two got onto it, tried to fly back to General Twinbraid, but were struck down near Bael'dun Keep after the keep's explosion. Not long after Marley died. Despite the loss, several &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Survivor\"&gt;Bael'dun Survivor&lt;/a&gt;s were rescued.\nGeneral Twinbraid heard the bad news and stated this time the Horde had made things personal. After finding out a goblin corpse inside the ruined fortress, they mistakenly came to the conclusion it was the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; who did that. Raging with vengeance, Twinbraid sent the Alliance champion to &lt;a href=\"Frazzlecraz%20Motherlode\"&gt;Frazzlecraz Motherlode&lt;/a&gt;, a Bilgewater goblin mining operation not far from Bael Modan. There he was tasked in killing some mine workers, and bury the rest alive. Although Twinbraid was happy to hear the news, the champion knew this wouldn't be enough to quench his thirst for vengeance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAlliance forces reoccupied Bael Modan during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. Whether they are part of Bael'dun or not is unknown."}

While he visited Thunder Bluff he suggested to &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; that he send a group of his own people to work with the dwarves in exchange for making sure that the land was properly cared for. Cairne agreed to bring up his offer to his council of elders for discussion. Apparently, it worked, as &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; asked a group of young tauren to act as emissaries to the dwarven excavation of Bael\u2019dun to convince the dwarves to cease their careless digging. Given enough effort, the tauren apparently convinced the dwarves to allow a shaman to oversee their site to make sure that the land is properly cared for during the excavation, and that the dwarves return to the land as much as they take.\nExternal links.\n "}

When Feegly got his hands on the stone, a curse was placed on him, turning him into a trogg.\nCataclysm.\nAlliance adventurers killed Feegly as he had been \"sniffing around the dig site again\".\nThe dwarves of Bael Modan hired &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; to firebomb &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;. In the initial Horde counter-attack, &lt;a href=\"Gann%20Stonespire\"&gt;Gann Stonespire&lt;/a&gt; led an angry mob of Horde civilians to raid the dwarven digsites in Bael Modan. Gann was wounded in this attack by &lt;a href=\"Marley%20Twinbraid\"&gt;Marley Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt;. With help from a dying Gann Stonespire and a goblin rogue called &lt;a href=\"Weezil%20Slipshadow\"&gt;Weezil Slipshadow&lt;/a&gt;, Horde players sabotaged a dwarven artillery shell for the giant cannon erected around &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Keep\"&gt;Bael'dun Keep&lt;/a&gt; causing the whole place to blow up.

The Horde champions and a tauren warparty with &lt;a href=\"Ruk%20Warstomper\"&gt;Ruk Warstomper&lt;/a&gt; attacked it and encountered &lt;a href=\"Borim%20Goldhammer\"&gt;Borim Goldhammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nBael Modan Digsite.\nBael Modan is a dwarf &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nBael Modan is heralded by some as the new home of the dwarves and gnomes on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.

With a population of 800, it is the largest &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; stronghold in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. It is marked by the sturdy stone walls and guard towers blocking the mouth of a cavern into the mountain. An encampment just inside the wall offers shelter to Alliance caravans and travelers crossing the Barrens. The stores of food and supplies at Bael Modan are a tempting target to &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; warbands and &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; raiders, but thus far the dwarves' trusty rifles and mortars have proven more than able to withstand such attacks. \nThose who visit discover that the dwarves have not forgotten their traditional weapons since the invention of gunpowder. The dwarves of Bael Modan have established a midwinter tournament, with the highest prizes - elaborate bronze helms - given to those most skilled with the axe and the hammer.\nWhen the Ironforge dwarves learned of their old friends, the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, arrival in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the Ironforge dwarves invited the gnomes to settle in their new home, Bael Modan, and take up their inventing and tinkering where they left off. The gnomes found Theramore too crowded and politically charged, and gladly took the dwarves up on their invitation. For a while, most gnomes on Kalimdor remained secluded in Bael Modan (still reeling from the loss of their city &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;), having yet declared their presence on the continent. So for a while, a traveling gnome on Kalimdor was a rare sight to see. The few gnomes living in Bael Modan were loosely organized much like most of gnome society living back in Ironforge.\nThe gnome &lt;a href=\"Ace%20%28class%29\"&gt;ace&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gaeval%20Thunderblast\"&gt;Gaeval Thunderblast&lt;/a&gt; also spends his time in Bael Modan working on his ship, the \"Greased Lightning\", while teaching new aces the art of aerial combat.\nTitan ruins.\nOver 100,000 years ago, beings known as &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s built great laboratories throughout Azeroth. Bael Modan was one such site. The titans encrypted their research on banded platinum disks in a runic language now forgotten to mortal races. The site at Bael Modan served the titans as a storage facility for these discs before they packed up most of their gear and left. &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; was the facility overseer and ran the facility nearly 100,000 years ago when the titans ceased the facility operations A few guardians remained to protect the site for eternity and the titans sealed off the main entrance. One such guardian was &lt;a href=\"Acheras%20the%20Custodian\"&gt;Acheras the Custodian&lt;/a&gt; who was left in charge of the facility's maintenance and awaits his master's return.\nThe facility was once a multi-level complex above and below ground surrounded by a fortress wall. Geological forces and instability slowly sunk the facility into the ground. Over the millennia titan ruins sunk deeper and deeper under the mountain. Earthquakes and shifting ground broke the ruins into several large areas and separated them, sometimes hundreds of feet apart and at many different elevations in the mountain. Natural tunnels and caves developed around the ruins as erosion and time took their toll. The area is now a great wilderness inhabited by fierce creatures, including the mighty &lt;a href=\"Kolkar\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt; centaur tribe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Makers\"&gt;House of the Makers&lt;/a&gt; can be found in Bael Modan.\nConflicts with the tauren and centaur.\nBael Modan has seen conflict with other races which share the Barrens. Each day that passed saw Bael Modan grow stronger as the inhabitants built up defenses and new dwarves and some other &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; members came to settle.\nThe dwarves and gnomes suffer constant attacks from the Horde, especially nearby tauren from Mulgore. \nCentaur.\nNative dangers have not stopped the Ironforge dwarves from establishing the stronghold near the titan excavation site of Bael Modan. The centaur have made forays against it but were repelled decisively each time. Scouts claimed that the centaur were amassing other tribes to launch a major attack, but the dwarves were unconcerned."}

After Muradin's disappearance and supposed death, Baelgun led his forces into the depths of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, where he was ultimately killed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Baelgun accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Expedition\"&gt;Dwarven Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s second-in-command. When &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked Muradin and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' combined camp, Baelgun organized the dwarves' defenses while his counterpart &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; organized the humans.\nFollowing Muradin's supposed \"death\", Baelgun took command of the remaining dwarves and led them to take shelter in the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Web%20Caverns\"&gt;Shadow Web Caverns&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. The tunnels of the city were later shaken by earthquakes caused by the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, freeing the long-forgotten &lt;a href=\"N%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt; in the depths. Baelgun and his men sealed the gates to the , vowing to keep the monsters locked inside. When Arthas and &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces entered Azjol-Nerub, they were attacked by the dwarves and fought through them until they confronted Baelgun at the entrance to the Inner Kingdom. Baelgun refused to let Arthas through and warned him about the horrors locked inside, but Arthas paid the dwarf no heed and killed him with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; before proceeding into the Inner Kingdom.\nBaelgun's soul was freed from Frostmourne's grasp when the blade was destroyed several years later. His soul started roaming &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, forced to repeat the moment of his demise for eternity. &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s seeking to reforge the shards of Frostmourne into the &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;Blades of the Fallen Prince&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Baelgun's spirit in order to claim the shard that he was guarding.\nMuradin has since expressed interest in retrieving Baelgun's remains from Azjol-Nerub.\nIn the RPG.\nBaelgun and many of his dwarves survived, and &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; visited him at &lt;a href=\"Doorward\"&gt;Doorward&lt;/a&gt; when he came to Northrend.\nThis dwarven &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; is short and stocky, even for one of his race. His flame-red beard looks like it would brush the top of his boots when loose, though a double braid hangs only to his knees. He scowls beneath his thick red eyebrows, and his battered nose is all but lost between brow and beard. In battle Baelgun is a fierce and wily opponent, leaping into the fray and swinging from side to side, deliberately using his braids to distract opponents from his whirling hammer. Baelgun is smart enough to retreat when the odds turn against him, and he is not above attacking from behind \u2014 though with his bulk and coloring, he is not built for stealth. Since Muradin Bronzebeard's death, Baelgun was the leader of the Bronzebeard Expedition. He and the other survivors are camped near the entrance to Azjol-Nerub and guard it to ensure that nothing escapes from within."}

Baenan and his sister were also friends with &lt;a href=\"Vyrin%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Vyrin Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt;, who often spoke about &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; relations and her unnamed husband who she expressed a longing for.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; was forced overboard the \"Elwynn\" picked her up and Baenan bonded with the girl. When negotiations opened up between the Horde and Alliance each side sent a diplomat to the other side- &lt;a href=\"Nita\"&gt;Nita&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the Alliance and Baenan was sent to the Horde. However soon after arriving Baenan was made a prisoner where he was watched over by &lt;a href=\"Talithar%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Talithar Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt;, who stumbled upon the knowledge that Talithar knew Vyrin. Baenan spitefully told him that Vyrin hated the blood elves and all they stood for. Enraged, Talithar physically threatened Baenan with a ferocity that astounded the dwarf, though relented and broke down into tears, throwing the couple's wedding rings on a chain at the dwarf's feet and revealing that he was Vyrin's husband.\nLater &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who been picked up by the Horde, came by to break the dwarf out of his captivity, and Talithar did not attempt to intervene. Baenan apologized for what he had said and informed him that though Vyrin never mentioned him directly, Baenan now realized that she could only have been talking about Talithar, and though still angry over the matter also misses him dearly. Talithar asked the dwarf to give the rings back to his wife and tell her that he had never stopped loving her. Baenan promised to do so, and during their escape, Chen and Baenan were caught by &lt;a href=\"Karrig\"&gt;Karrig&lt;/a&gt;. However, Talithar reappeared to assist them in their escape from the warship, distracted Karrig, who was furious that Talithar had betrayed his duty. Talithar reiterated his proud loyalty to the Horde, though also said that the Horde does not claim all of it. As they were in the munitions hold, Talithar detonated all the gunpowder for the ship's cannons with his fire-based magic, which gave Chen and Baenan a chance to flee in the aftermath.\nThe two quickly headed over to the \"Elwynn\" and saw Heller's body being thrown overboard, the two preceded to aid their families against those attacking. In the aftermath of the \"Elwynn\" sinking into the sea Baenan, Trialin, Lintharel, and Atropa shared a lifeboat while Chen and Li Li returned to their quest to reach Pandaria. Baenan, possibly due to exhaustion, was unable to fully heal Lintharel with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, who had been run through by Captain &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Heller\"&gt;Heller&lt;/a&gt; for defending Nita. Fortunately, he had kept her alive long enough through the night that Nita was able to find them after dawn in &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;Flight Form&lt;/a&gt; and completed the healing. After healing the others of their minor injuries, Nita informed them where land was closest. Discovering the Swiftwinds' rings were still on his person, Baenan vowed to safely return them to Vyrin and inform her that her husband died a hero, with Trialin indicating that she would join him in doing so."}

{"id": "14093", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14093", "title": "Bag", "text": "Bags are &lt;a href=\"container\"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt;s to increase inventory carrying capacity for holding other &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. Players also frequently say bags when referring to their entire inventory space including the actual bags and base 16-slot &lt;a href=\"backpack\"&gt;backpack&lt;/a&gt; together.\nInventory space (or \"slots\") is a limited resource so inventory management forms an important aspect of gameplay. Using more and larger bags to increase available inventory space furthers character development by providing the convenience to pick up more loot or carry more quest items. As the game has evolved, newer expansions have introduced larger bags to ease this burden.\nMost normal bags can hold any sort of item, but differ in quantity of inventory slots. Special bags only hold specific types of items, usually related to a &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Herb%20Pouch\"&gt;Herb Pouch&lt;/a&gt;), but carry a larger quantity than normal bags of comparable cost. This disparity was greatest in , but has narrowed in recent expansions as larger normal bags become available.\nEquipping and using.\nPlayers equip bags by placing them in the &lt;a href=\"bag%20slot\"&gt;bag slot&lt;/a&gt;s at the right-most end of the interface bar adjacent to the &lt;a href=\"backpack\"&gt;backpack&lt;/a&gt;, a special bag that is neither movable nor replacable. Doing so provides added inventory slots based on the size of the bag.\nAlthough bags are tradable and might sit unequipped within inventory, they are empty in this state and therefore do not contribute to inventory management until equipped. In addition to four bags worn on a chartacter (and always accessible), characters may also purchase up to seven &lt;a href=\"bag%20slot\"&gt;bag slot&lt;/a&gt;s to expand &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; capacity (limited accessability).\nSimilar to equippable gear, most bags become &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20equip\"&gt;untradable&lt;/a&gt; once worn in a bag slot (character or bank) and large bags from unique sources tend to &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt;. However, bags may be freely unworn if are empty or replaced by another large enough to hold any remaining contents. Some bags are also &lt;a href=\"unique\"&gt;unique&lt;/a&gt;, preventing more than one of the same kind from being worn simultaneously.\nFortunately, unlike most equippable gear, bags do not have minimum level requirements so they may be traded or sold to lower-level characters to provide a quality of life boost for beginning players or &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBags are not visually displayed on the character in the game; other players cannot know how many bags you have equipped nor their contents.\nManagement features.\n\"These features are not present in World of Warcraft: Classic\"\nAside from managing bag contents, subsequent expansions introduced new interface designs to manage ever-expanding clutter:\nBags by type.\nNormal bags.\nNormal bags come in a variety of sizes and are used to store all the items you obtain through your adventures. They come in sizes ranging from 1 to 34 slots, and typically they are widely available on the Auction House because many bags are created and sold by &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;tailors&lt;/a&gt;. Their prices, particularly in smaller sizes, are constrained by the wide availability of many vendors who also sell normal bags to adventurers. (See table at right.) New players unwilling to pay even these prices will also find that bags can &lt;a href=\"drop\"&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; in the normal course of playing the game.\nAmmo bags.\nAmmo bags like &lt;a href=\"quiver\"&gt;quiver&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ammo%20Pouch\"&gt;ammo pouch&lt;/a&gt;es can only hold ammunition (&lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"bullet\"&gt;bullet&lt;/a&gt;s respectively). Of course, this is only useful to characters who use ammunition: &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and with &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Master\"&gt;weapons training&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. \nIdentical ammunition stored in multiple slots in an ammo bag will be automatically re-equipped when a stack of ammo runs out. Ammo that is different in any way is not automatically equipped. This can lead to confusion or delays, so many players only store one kind of ammo in an ammo bag at a time.\nAmmo bags display the number of shots remaining on their action bar icons, whenever the number of shots falls below 10000 (10 stacks).\nEssentially, an ammo bag is a hunter item. While rogues and warrior can, with weapon training, benefit from an ammo pouch, the truth is that they will probably choose to forgo carrying an ammo pouch. Hunters burn though quantities of ammunition. Rogues and warriors shoot occasionally to call an opponent out of a group. Since ammo bags are less versatile than conventional bags, rogues and warrior will generally prefer to have general purpose bag space holding a stack or two of ammo.\nHunters start with a six-slot quiver, &lt;a href=\"Light%20Quiver\"&gt;Light Quiver&lt;/a&gt;, or ammo pouch, &lt;a href=\"Small%20Ammo%20Pouch\"&gt;Small Ammo Pouch&lt;/a&gt;, that holds the ammo of their starting ranged weapon. \nQuivers and ammo pouches follow a similar size progression, ranging from the six slot hunter starting quiver or ammo pouch to the 24 slot gear, which is only usable by level 70 characters. Ammo bags with 10 slots and above have increasing level requirements to equip. Ammo stacks in stacks of 1000, so even a beginning ammo bag can hold 6000 rounds of ammo.\nAmmo bags can be made by &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworkers&lt;/a&gt;, purchased from the auction house and vendors, or obtained as quest rewards. The source of each size increment of ammo bag is unique or a unique type ('crafted' or 'vended'), with minor exceptions. For the eight-slot quiver and ammo pouch, there is a vendor version ( at &lt;a href=\"Neutral\"&gt;Neutral&lt;/a&gt;), and a crafted version. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; quest, &lt;a href=\"Vyrin%27s%20Revenge%20%282%29\"&gt;Vyrin's Revenge (2)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, rewards the character with a choice of a ten slot quiver or ammo pouch.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, ammo bags generally gave a &lt;a href=\"Rate%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rate of Fire&lt;/a&gt; bonus of between 10 and 15 percent, shortening the cooldown on the &lt;a href=\"Shoot\"&gt;Shoot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Auto%20Shot\"&gt;Auto Shot&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nSoul bags.\nA &lt;a href=\"soul%20bag\"&gt;soul bag&lt;/a&gt; was a bag usable only by &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s to hold &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shard\"&gt;Soul Shard&lt;/a&gt;s. Although a warlock was not required to use a Soul Bag, they could hold more Soul Shards than they would normally be able to carry in conventional containers.\nSoul Shards harvested by the Warlock were automatically stored in an equipped Soul Bag when acquired, making tedious Soul Shard housekeeping a thing of the past.\nOnly Soul Shards could be stored in Soul Bags. If you wished to convert a Soul Shard into any other type of inventory item (such as a &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Soulstone\"&gt;Soulstone&lt;/a&gt;) you would need extra space in your normal bags to hold the new item.\nAs Soul Shards are no longer physical items, all Soul bags have been converted to normal bags with fewer slots.\nProfession bags.\nThere are a number of profession-specific bags to hold larger quantities of certain materials and products. Players do not need to actually have the profession to equip these, so they may benefit from using bags intended for other professions. For example, &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; uses lots of gems that can fit inside a &lt;a href=\"mining\"&gt;mining&lt;/a&gt; bag.\nLike general purpose bags, craft bags have no explicit level requirements. Currently, all craft bags are &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt;.\n reintroduces profession bags as Reagent Bags, which can contain everything that counts as a reagent. It also introduces a special bag slot that only Reagent bags can be equipped to."}

{"id": "14240", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14240", "title": "Loot", "text": "In \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", loot can mean a couple of things:\nLooting while solo.\nWhen soloing, looting is easy \u2014 a \"lootable\" corpse emits a \"glittering\" effect, and the cursor will change to the \"trade\" cursor when you mouse over the corpse. Simply right-click (or Command-click on a Mac with 1-button mouse) on the corpse of the mob you just killed, and a window will pop up containing any loot the mob was carrying. (If the loot window is empty, this normally indicates a bug, as corpses that have no loot on them simply cannot be right-clicked.) Using Shift-right/Command-click \"autoloots\" the corpse, which picks up all items except \"&lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt;\" items. For Bind on Pickup items, you will be prompted to accept the item, binding it to you, or turn it down, leaving it in the corpse. You can return and loot the corpse of any remaining items until it disappears.\nLooting while in a party.\nPersonal Loot.\nIntroduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", Personal loot is the default for all group content. Under personal loot, the game chooses a number of players (based on group size) and awards them a random item for their spec, while everyone else receives an amount of gold specific to them. Mounts can also be won via this method from bosses that drop them. Like solo looting, the drops are retrieved by directly looting the corpse of the boss, with the chat logs showing who's won something. Loot from Personal Loot is tradeable to anyone in the group, as long as it is also not an ilvl upgrade for yourself.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Roll\"&gt;Bonus Roll&lt;/a&gt; system, also introduced in \"Mists of Pandaria\", uses this loot type as well. Players in possession of a specific token, such as the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Broken%20Fate\"&gt;Seal of Broken Fate&lt;/a&gt;, will be given a chance to spend the token for another try at loot from a recently defeated boss. This can be done on any difficulty as well as on world bosses. The chance of obtaining loot from a boss drop is currently theorized to be approximately 15% (equivalent to an average of 3.75 items from a 25-player kill), but this has not been confirmed.\nFinally, \"Legion\" legendary and artifact quest items are treated as what's called 'personal push loot', meaning these items do not need to be directly looted from the boss' corpse and are instead directly placed in the player's inventory.\nThis loot method is preferred by developers and, with \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", has replaced the &lt;a href=\"%23Older%20loot%20methods\"&gt;other methods&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy Loot Mode.\nIntroduced in the \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"8.0.1\"&gt;pre-patch&lt;/a&gt;, Legacy Loot Mode is automatically enabled when a player enters an instance at 11 levels or more above the maximum level of the content. Under Legacy Loot rules, drops will include a chance for all items that would drop for a full party or raid at the instance\u2019s level.\nQuest loot.\n&lt;a href=\"Quest\"&gt;Quest&lt;/a&gt; loot is on a separate loot distribution and there are two common modes for this to occur.\nBattlegrounds.\nIn battlegrounds, players can loot enemy corpses. This will remove their insignia so that they must revive at the &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, and give the looter a small sum of money. Note that if the player's ghost is running toward the corpse when its insignia is removed, he'll have to run all the way back to the graveyard to resurrect, so it may be wise to wait a moment before looting. Looting the player's corpse will also force its spirit to release, if they have not already done so, thus preventing their ghost from spying on the area around their corpse.\nNotes.\nThere is a common misconception among game mechanics analysts that the applies to the case of getting a specific loot item to drop at least once from a mob by repeatedly farming said mob. This is not exactly true. It is correct that every single time you kill said mob, the chance of the desired loot dropping is constant. However, the probability of getting the desired loot to drop at least once in a collective set of multiple kills is not constant. Rather, it is a normal probability density function centered on the expected number of kills for the loot to drop at least once.\nIn some situations, however, developers have implemented what's known as 'bad-luck protection' which does actually increase the chances of a certain item dropping. However, the uses of this system are sporadic and specific, tied to things such as Hidden Artifact Appearances.\nOlder loot methods.\nThe other loot methods available to parties before &lt;a href=\"patch%208.0.1\"&gt;patch 8.0.1&lt;/a&gt; were vastly more complicated. The leader of the party could set the group looting parameters, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Quality%20Threshold\"&gt;threshold&lt;/a&gt; where items of particular quality are automatically &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt;ed for. There are five group looting parameters:\nIn all loot settings, money on the corpse is distributed as evenly as possible among all the party members. \nThe group leader may set an item quality threshold. Items below this threshold are handled in a round-robin way preventing people from wasting time rolling for &lt;a href=\"vendor%20trash\"&gt;vendor trash&lt;/a&gt;. By default, &lt;a href=\"uncommon\"&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt; and better items are rolled for. In raids, it's common to raise the threshold to &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt;, since uncommon items are insignificant to players equipped enough to raid.\nLoot options: Need, Greed, Disenchant and Pass.\nItems of &lt;a href=\"Uncommon\"&gt;Uncommon (green) quality&lt;/a&gt; or higher might not be immediately lootable, depending on the &lt;a href=\"Loot%20Quality%20Threshold\"&gt;loot rolling threshold&lt;/a&gt; established by the party leader. When an item is available that falls within that rolling threshold, the looter is prohibited from taking the item and a 'roll window' pops up for all party members with an image of the item and three or four buttons \u2014 a pair-of-dice button, a coin button, and a red circle with diagonal line button, and possibly a button showing a disintegrating sword. \nThe high-roller among those who roll is awarded the item, and it goes in that character's backpack. If their backpack is full, that person, and only that person, may loot it by clicking on the monster's corpse after first clearing up space.\nIf everyone passes on a rollable item, the item becomes freely lootable to anyone in the party.\nThe roll window has a timer shown as a shrinking bar; if the timer expires before you choose \"need\" or \"greed\", you will \"pass\" on the item. This is generally the recommended action for &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;Bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt; items that you cannot equip.\nFor very valuable &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt; items - which nearly any player can be expected to sell on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; - it is sometimes customary for everyone to click Greed unless someone really needs it for equipping. Need should not be used unless the player really needs it. In &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; groups, a BoE item will generally become &lt;a href=\"Soulbound\"&gt;Soulbound&lt;/a&gt; if the player rolls Need, so this is generally a safe policy \"for BoE items\".\nOn the other hand, if one person rolls Need when everybody else has rolled Greed, the Needy player will automatically win. This is commonly referred to as \"ninja looting\", though Blizzard does not see it as such and generally will not intervene. To prevent arguments, you may wish to discuss a looting policy beforehand if you know that the instance has a chance to drop a rare item, whether BoE gear or a vanity item such as the &lt;a href=\"Fiery_Warhorse%2527s_Reins\"&gt;Fiery_Warhorse%27s_Reins&lt;/a&gt;. If a player agrees to such a policy, then violates it, you may be able to find a sympathetic GM who will restore the item.\nSince &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, when a player wins a loot roll, a new pop up window (similar to achievements) appears letting the player know they won the roll and also displays their winning roll number.\nGroup policies and other loot options.\nNote that loot from containers \u2014 chests, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; crates, and the like \u2014 as opposed to corpses, also uses the party loot threshold (if one is in effect), although the container will always be lootable by any party member. If the container holds a high-quality item, that item will be rolled on (or not), the same as if it were looted from a corpse.\nSecondary rolls.\nIn the event of two or more rolls being equal (for example: if 2 players have a 'greed' roll with the number 56 for a certain item), the system performs a hidden secondary roll to determine which player will receive the item.\nLoot systems.\nGroups and guilds that party regularly go beyond the built-in loot distribution mechanisms that Blizzard provides. There are numerous &lt;a href=\"loot%20system\"&gt;loot system&lt;/a&gt;s that can be used to distribute loot, with their own set of trade-offs."}

After the game client receives a response regarding the loot, it would show a loot window from which the player may loot some or all of the items. During high latency or heavy server traffic, the game client may have a delayed or non-existent response from the server. In this situation, the player's character would be stuck in the crouched position and the player will not be able to cancel the looting process or receive the appropriate loot by normal means.\nSymptoms.\nDepending on the severity of the problem, the player may or may not be able to continue with his/her game. During the worst situations, the game would not update until it receives the content of the loot. The player would not even know what is going on around them. However, more often, the game would update and the player would be able to engage in combat. However, after performing any actions, the character will awkwardly return to the crouched looting position. \nComplications.\nThis problem also occurs when attempting to use gathering skills. However, this was worsened by the fact that some herb or minerals in the game are bugged such that the player will become stuck even during normal latency and server load. This is often referred to as \"cursed ore\" or \"cursed herb\".\nRemedy.\nDuring certain conditions, the player will be able to unstuck by looting another corpse or gather another herb or mineral. Unfortunately, the only surefire remedy for this problem was for the player to reconnect. \nThe game mechanism has improved since then, although loot lag still exists. During recent months, when the problem occurs, it would often timeout and the player's character would return to standing position without receiving any loot. "}
{"id": "16721", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=16721", "title": "Loot ninja", "text": "A loot ninja, AKA ninja looter or simply ninja, is a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; who takes &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; to which he or she is not entitled. The act is referred to as ninja looting or ninjaing. The term predates World of Warcraft and originated with the notion of looting as \"quickly\" as possible. The common synonym for this behavior is greeder, though that term has &lt;a href=\"greed\"&gt;ironically fairer play connotations&lt;/a&gt; specific to WoW.\nDefinition.\nThe term originates from prior-generation MMO's, where loot was often contained in a chest or other container guarded by a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;. Players could potentially sneak around the mob and the rest of the party, taking the item without having contributed to the fight. Within World of Warcraft, the term seems to have a few different meanings depending on whom you ask, such as:\n&lt;a href=\"Gold%20farmer\"&gt;Gold farmer&lt;/a&gt;s also try to join instance groups in order to ninja/pirate loot items and sell them.\nLoot ninjas are understandably not well liked by other players. Often, a ninja will get a bad reputation on a &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; which eventually prevents them from being invited to participate in any high level instances. Many guilds also have rules stating that ninjas/pirates should be kicked from the &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; on their first offense.\nDealing with Ninja Looters.\nWith the advent of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Need%20before%20Greed\"&gt;Need before Greed&lt;/a&gt; was implemented as the standard looting system, the ability to ninja loot has been significantly reduced, so long as everyone hits 'need'. Unfortunately, this also means that players with legitimate off-specs are often denied needed gear. Additionally, this patch has provided the ability to trade &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt; items with other players that were eligible for the loot. Therefore, if a player acquires a &lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt; item unfairly - it is possible to discuss this and trade the item between players (this is a good way of telling the difference between genuine mistakes and a loot ninja).\nThere is also an ongoing debate as to whether rolling \"Need\" for a player's off-role is considered ninja-looting, especially when another group member needs the item for their own role. An example of this would be a shaman, present in a group in the role of Healer, rolling Need on an Agility ring which a rogue who is present needs for his current role of DPS. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions-22/main-spec-gt-off-spec-always/120/\"&gt;An MMO-Champion forum discussion on the topic can be found here.&lt;/a&gt; This debate has fueled argument that the Need roll should be split into Main Spec and Off Spec rolls, with Main Spec rolls getting priority. The general consensus so far seems to be that out of courtesy, a player should only roll Need on an item for offspec (or off-role) if nobody present needs it for their current party role. Sometimes, those will also ask if they can Need for an item and why they want it to prevent the thought of ninjaing. Though some people might be suspicious if the reason is legit, many feel this is good etiquette in this situation, since those that usually ask such are not usually viewed as those that would ninja loot items.\nBlizzard's Official Policy.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/support/en/article/ninja-looting-blizzard-s-stance\"&gt;Blizzard's official stance&lt;/a&gt; is that unnecessarily rolling Need, Master Looting, or leaving an instance after winning an item do not constitute ninja looting, and as such the GM's will not intervene. Blizzard will usually only take action for a blatant scam, such as a raid leader declaring free rolls in chat and then master-looting everything to himself. They will not intervene if there was no prior agreement (and cannot if the agreement was made over &lt;a href=\"Ventrilo\"&gt;Ventrilo&lt;/a&gt; or a private forum- it has to be in game, where they can check logs). In any &lt;a href=\"PuG\"&gt;PuG&lt;/a&gt; raid, ask the raid leader to state the loot policy explicitly in chat.\nWorld of Warcraft Game Design.\nSeveral features in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; were designed to minimize the opportunities for players to ninja/pirate loot, addressing problems which had occurred in earlier games."}

Whenever two or more players share some reward, they participate in a loot system, even if it's only the default roll system from Blizzard. Frequently, the terms &lt;a href=\"DKP\"&gt;DKP&lt;/a&gt; and \"loot system\" are used interchangeably, because DKP based systems are the most widely used type of formal loot systems.\nLoot System Categories.\nThere are two basic methods to earn DKP income: standard and zero-sum. There are also two basic methods to determine loot order (who gets items first): bidding and non-bidding. Each income method can in theory be combined with each loot order determination method (although a combination of zero-sum with bidding would be highly unusual). A third grand variety of loot systems use no DKP at all.\nLoot System Discussion.\nLoot systems are frequently the subject of heated debate, adherents advocating their own preferred system with something approaching religious fervor. Players sometimes choose to leave or to join a guild primarily on the basis of its loot system. This debate is so widespread and returns so consistently in forums that it deserves a deeper look. The following section is based on the massive thread \"I will tear apart your Guild loot system\" by Angelie (human priest from US Ner'zhul) in the official forums. The original thread has vanished, but returned as a sticky . Unfortunately that new version lacks a few of the finer points. The quintessence remains the same: \"No loot system is perfect\".\nWhy use a formal Loot System at all?\nWhen not using a formal system, loot distribution is basically random, which sooner or later leads to regular players getting unhappy. Players like to plan their gear, and want to be compensated for not getting an item.\nFormal loot systems can help to solve this problem. Their basic function is to provide a memory for past achievements and rewards gained. They give some compensation for raid members who didn't get some item by increasing their chance to receive future loot. The grand goal is to provide an automatism which leads to \"fair\" loot distribution over a longer timespan.\nTwo fundamental system-inherent issues pester any formal loot system: the DKP Gap and Collusion.\nCharacteristics.\nThe following is a list of fundamental desirable characteristics which all loot systems strive to achieve:\nStandard.\nThe most widely spread loot system uses standard DKP on the income side, and a bidding system when it comes to loot distribution. This offers the maximum flexibility for both sides - guild and raid leaders may reward whatever they feel appropriate, and raid members pay exactly what they think the item is worth. In an ideal world, such a system would fulfill all of the above requirement perfectly.\nThe DKP Gap.\nThis effect is also known as \"Inflation\", which is not quite appropriate. Inflation in a real economy means rising prices and devaluation of income, while in a DKP system, the effect means that new members have too low DKP scores to buy good items. A whole genre of DKP systems was invented to counter this effect, the &lt;a href=\"Zero-sum%20DKP\"&gt;Zero-sum DKP&lt;/a&gt;. They guarantee that inflation in the real world meaning cannot occur. Unfortunately, as Anglie pointed out in her article, the actual problem in loot systems has nothing to do with real-world inflation, but deserves a different name - the DKP Gap exists in Zero-sum systems too.\nAssume that in a zero-sum, fixed-price system some veteran has (after maybe 30 MC runs) luckily won his full Tier 1 set, and now a current score of -100. The 8 pieces had a value of 460 points. A newbie (equipped in &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%201\"&gt;Dungeon Set 1&lt;/a&gt;) enters the system at 0 points. Although the visible difference in DKP between the two is -100, and the newbie seems to have a point lead over the veteran, the real gap is actually 360 points. The newbie has to equip himself, paying the fixed prices for his gear, while the veteran accumulates points, and only rarely takes an item. When the newbie finally acquires his 8 pieces of Tier 1, the veteran meanwhile either has some Tier 2 items, or a very obvious point lead. This game of hare and hedgehog can continue indefinitely - on top-of-the-line drops, the veteran will always have priority over the former newbie, even after both players contributed the same for several months.\nIn effect, the zero-sum, fixed price system fails to achieve its set goal, it is by no means \"fairer\" to the new raid member as a traditional system, where the veteran has an obvious point lead. In a bidding system, after a few runs the newbie actually has a chance to win an item by bidding, and can gradually close the gap by getting items cheaper than the veterans.\nThe DKP Gap is probably the single biggest problem which loot distribution systems use to have. Many people have objections against all formalized loot systems because they fear to find themselves in this very situation - being behind in the priority list, with no possibility to do anything about it. In a zero-sum fixed price environment, it may even be the best possible course for a newbie to run with his initial group until his chance to get meaningful drops becomes very low, and then simply look for another guild where he can enter the system at zero, and his chances for good loot are better.\nThis problem is by no means accidental, it's rather a case of a job too well done. Loot systems are meant to provide a memory. A fixed and unattainable DKP gap means that the memory is too good. Some people actually feel that such a situation is just, and doesn't really need a solution - the veterans did contribute more to the guilds progress after all.\nCollusion.\nIn real world economics, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collusion\"&gt;collusion&lt;/a&gt; means price fixing. This very effect can easily happen in a bidding system. There's quite a large number of drops which is interesting only for a certain combination of class and build (e.g. plate items with int are useful only to holy paladins), while there are other items which are wanted by a large number of raid members (e.g. a necklace with int and spellpower may be wanted by any healer). Now assume the raid has only two holy paladins. It would be natural for the paladins to agree on the plate items to simply take turns - whenever they're both in the same raid, one bids the minimum amount, and the other passes. This saves them a lot of points, which they can use to bid on the cross-class items, therefore gaining an advantage over the other healers which may have more competition for class specific items. Another example for collusion is if some high-profile raid member (e.g. an officer) bids, and all others interested in the item pass out of courtesy.\nThese two cases are explicit collusion, people willingly agree to a lower-than-appropriate price. There's also implicit collusion, for example if by chance some item drops many times, or if one class is all alone (e.g. tree or moonkin druid). Items are too cheap in these cases by accident, the players paying these too-low prices gain an advantage over other members of the system nonetheless.\nNon-bidding systems make collusion systematically impossible, usually at the price of disenchants. By setting a pre-defined price for each item, it's simply impossible to manipulate. Unfortunately, this leads to situations where an item which is only a minor upgrade, sidegrade or situationally useful is disenchanted, because the fixed price is considered to be too high. Disenchanting is always bad, because even a fractional increase in efficiency sums up over time, and some players happiness is greatly increased if they have a nice collection of off-spec epics sitting in the bank. Some raids offer such items at a discount, but this immediately brings back the collusion problem (and/or lengthy discussions whether some item really is an upgrade or not). Discounts may even lead to the perverse situation that in the long run players have better gear for their off-spec than for their main spec (because they are reluctant to pay high prices for main items, and get offspec items cheap). A second big problem of fixed price systems is to find and maintain an appropriate price for hundreds of items (although this can be solved rather elegantly by using one standard price for all items).\nTaxes.\nThe DKP gap can be traced back to the system having too good a memory. Collusion is caused by peoples wish to save their points for some later time. Both of these reasons can be solved by introducing a DKP decay over time. A good starting point would be to deduce 5% from all raid members DKP score every week.\nBy this, the memory of past achievements slowly fades away, and after a few months of consistent raiding, new members are able to compete for top items. At the same time, the willingness to spend DKP is increased, thus collusion is less interesting. Additionally, any advantage gained by collusion also fades away sooner or later.\nThe problem with taxes is that DKP rich longterm members may feel treated unfairly when they wait for a certain item which by bad luck simply doesn't drop, and feel punished when their hard earned points just melt away for nothing. In practise though, most DKP systems are reset regularly (frequently when entering a new instance). This DKP reset is actually a rather crude form of tax, and also leads to longterm members losing their points."}

Kael'thas' plans were foiled and he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt; for his treachery, leaving Lor'themar to guide the fate of the blood elves alone. With the Sunwell reborn, a bright future now lies ahead for Quel'Thalas.\nLor'themar, who had weathered many of the kingdom's darkest days, now leads his people toward their new destiny. In light of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s then-increasing paranoia and lack of scruples, the Regent Lord had aligned himself with the growing &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; to overthrow the Warchief after dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;'s return. Lor'themar pledged his loyalty to the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Following the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar was among those present when Vol'jin named Sylvanas Windrunner the new Warchief with his dying breath. Windrunner's tenure as Warchief was ultimately tumultuous, with Lor'themar concerned for the direction she was leading the Horde. He eventually stood alongside other leaders in rebellion against her, and when she deserted the Horde following the death of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar helped pick up the pieces of the faction. He ultimately became a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, which was formed to replace the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; position, representing the blood elves.\nBiography.\nBackground.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar Theron frequently clashed with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. On one such outing, his three-man-party was ambushed and attacked by Amani raiders, and Theron was brought into a sacrificial chamber. Here, he met the elves &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt;, and the four attempted to free themselves before the torture began. The Amani chieftain &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; himself confronted them and planned to interrogate them over the elven &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s scattered around the land. Zul'jin personally submitted Lor'themar to a gruesome torture, slicing him below the navel and thrusting his fingers into the wound, then painting his face with Theron's blood. After a struggle, Lor'themar freed himself from his bonds, and fought off the trolls long enough for a replenished Dar'Khan to warp the group to safety.\nLor'themar served under &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lireesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, whom he respected deeply. Lor'themar often upheld her duties when the Farstriders' ranger-general was absent. He was close friends with &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and Lireesa's middle child, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;; the three constant companions were known as \"the Trio\": pensive Lor'themar, merry Halduron, and mischievous Sylvanas.\nWhen his ranger-general was slain in Lordaeron, Lor'themar and several Farstriders departed to investigate. As the highest-ranking Farstrider besides Sylvanas herself, it fell to Lor'themar to formally anoint Lireesa's chosen successor as their new ranger-general. At &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Retreat\"&gt;Farstrider Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, he led the rangers in a eulogy to their fallen leader and a pledge to acknowledge Sylvanas as their new one.\nLor'themar opposed Sylvanas' induction of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; into the Farstriders. He, Halduron, and other high elves had never warmed to their ranger-general's \"human pet\", and though they'd fought as comrades \u2013 Marris had even saved Theron's life upon their first encounter \u2013 Lor'themar did not consider doing one's duty an act worthy of exceptional treatment. Their concern was not purely born of prejudice: the Farstriders had already been splintered by Alleria's abdication and departure to join the Alliance, and Sylvanas' friends worried the appointment would fuel slanderous rumours that might imperil her position at court.\nLor'themar rose steadily through the Farstriders' ranks over the years. He was made a ranger captain some time before the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, became &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s second-in-command, and spent at least part of his career as a warden of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar was second-in-command to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar joined his brethren in the battle against the invading &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces after &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; resolved to crush the &lt;a href=\"Amani\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. Lor'themar, his armor coated in the blood of his enemies, met with &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; during an aerial invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; and their subdued &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; mounts. Alleria introduced him as one of the elves' finest rangers, and Theron and Turalyon, who shared the rank of second-in-command to the military leader of their respective races, developed a mutual respect during the conflict.\nLor'themar noted that he and his warriors had managed to escape the inferno wrought on by the rampant red dragons, but that they cannot breach the flames to save their people just yet. Though Alleria favored fighting on in spite of the unfavorable odds, Lor'themar was able to convince her that retreat was the wiser option. Lor'themar then accompanied &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, Turalyon, Alleria, and &lt;a href=\"Kurdran\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, and fought in its defense. The capital was under siege by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, though Doomhammer quickly abandoned this battle upon learning of great treachery at the hands of his chief &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. While Theron and Alleria battled in Lordaeron, the elves in Quel'Thalas sortied troops to destroy the Amani for good. Zul'jin was captured in the chaos by Lor'themar's close friend and comrade, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, in whose custody the Amani chieftain was tortured mercilessly. Halduron had intended to drag him back to Silvermoon so that Lor'themar could decide his fate, but Zul'jin escaped during an Amani raid and fled into hiding.\nFollowing the Second War, Lor'themar was promoted to the rank of ranger lord (\"Alar'annalas\" in &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;) by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; in a grand ceremony and draped with the Fora'nal cloth to symbolize his progression. He was congratulated by King Anasterian Sunstrider himself.\nThird War.\nYears later, following &lt;a href=\"King%20Anasterian\"&gt;King Anasterian's&lt;/a&gt; secession of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance, Lor'themar had become a chief commander of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 specifically, tasked with watching over the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and safeguarding those who, in turn, would watch over all of Quel'Thalas. During this time, Lor'themar was approached by &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, a disillusioned face from the past who craved the recognition he felt he had never received.\nDar'Khan used his friendship with Lor'themar to gain intimate knowledge of Quel'Thalas' defenses, ostensibly to bolster them after the Hordes invasion during the Second War, and informed the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; and scion of Lordaeron, the evil Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; (whom Dar'Khan had sold his loyalty to), of how to bypass them. Lor'themar and his company had been patrolling near the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; when he began to notice hints of an &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;. They rushed to &lt;a href=\"An%27owyn\"&gt;An'owyn&lt;/a&gt;, whose invisibility had been dispelled and whose hidden mooncrystal\u2014one of three which empowered the grand shield, &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt; (\"Gatekeeper\" in Thalassian), around Silvermoon\u2014had been stolen. Lor'themar, reasoning that even if the crystals had been displaced, the magi could still empower Ban'dinoriel themselves, made haste to &lt;a href=\"An%27daroth\"&gt;An'daroth&lt;/a&gt;, the second resting place of the mooncrystals. It became gradually apparent to Lor'themar that treachery was at work, but with the kingdom in imminent danger, he had little time to speculate on it.\nAt An'daroth, only corpses and strangely decayed ground remained. To Lor'themar's disbelief, the dead were reanimated and butchered many of his rangers. Lor'themar deduced that decapitation would fell the risen elves, and dealt with several in such a manner, though his wounds and fatigue slowed him down. After a struggle, Lor'themar was brutalized by several undead guardians, one of whom raked his face and damaged his left eye. Forcing the ranger lord down, the undead prepared to deal Lor'themar killing blows, though &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and his rangers arrived and fettered the risen guardians with arrows. Theron and Brightwing then rushed back to the capital, hoping it was not too late.\nDespite Lor'themar's belief that the situation could still be salvaged, it was already too late. The &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Corps\"&gt;Ranger Corps&lt;/a&gt; fought Arthas at every turn, but were pushed further and further back towards their capital. Sylvanas Windrunner was slain by Arthas outside Silvermoon, the city was sacked, and &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; and the entire &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; were also slain. Theron fought his way to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, but the well had already been defiled by Arthas.\nWith the deaths of Anasterian, the Convocation, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, and Sylvanas, Lor'themar assumed temporary leadership of the high elves and, along with his much-reduced forces, remained in Quel'Thalas after the fall of Silvermoon as a resistance to the Scourge remnants. Lor'themar reclaimed &lt;a href=\"The%20Bazaar\"&gt;The Bazaar&lt;/a&gt; from the Scourge, and made it a makeshift base for any elven survivors he could find. Soon after, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; returned to his homeland, and surveyed the damage done to his kingdom. He sent the archmage &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to confer with Lor'themar, and to prepare for his arrival. Lor'themar showed the prince to the body of his father and was present when the king was cremated on a funeral pyre. Lor'themar accompanied Kael, Rommath, Halduron, Liadrin, and several others to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; once more, to destroy the tainted &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; before the Amani could seize it.\nThe group returned triumphantly to Silvermoon, freed from the threat of the Sunwell's corrupted state, though the loss of the Sunwell led to a withdrawal-based lethargy for the survivors, who had become dependent on the well's arcane energy. Kael'thas then proclaimed the high elves reborn as the blood elves, in honor of all those perished. Appointed as Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar was commanded to safeguard the land and seek a cure for their people while Kael'thas took a group of the blood elf forces to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; against the Scourge in Lordaeron, led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Garithos\"&gt;Lord Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. His old friend &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, Ranger-General of Silvermoon, aided him in this task.\nThe Sunwell.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; pursued &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, the current avatar of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, into Quel'Thalas. Leading a group of blood elf rangers and employing guerilla tactics against the Scourge forces, Lor'themar, along with his close friend &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, sought to relieve his ravaged and shattered homeland from the Scourge's grasp. After a skirmish, Lor'themar orders his fallen comrades to be burned \u2014 to ensure they are not re-animated. Lor'themar learns of Dar'Khan's presence in Quel'Thalas, and in a conversation with Halduron, explains his history with Quel'Thalas' greatest traitor.\nFollowing Dar'Khan's betrayal, Lor'themar had fought desperately to protect the sight of the Sunwell; and though he survived the onslaught of the Scourge, he personally observed the annihilated sight of the once glorious font of power. That day, he resolved to protect the remains of Quel'Thalas from being further tainted by the Scourge, and especially by Dar'Khan. Lor'themar rallies his rangers, and they leave to destroy the treacherous Dar'Khan.\nLor'themar observes Dar'Khan speaking with Anveena. Lor'themar arranges an ambush, and his forces encircle Dar'Khan; though the great traitor summons the skeletons of fallen high elves to protect himself. Lor'themar and his rangers are overpowered, and are forced to retreat. During the march back to safety, Lor'themar is shocked to hear a voice echoing loudly in the distance, which he identifies as belonging to his former ranger-general \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; Queen, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar approaches &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his companions, suggesting the outsiders drop their weapons and surrender to him. Lor'themar offers them but one chance to live \u2014 to inform him of Sylvanas' location. Kalecgos reveals Anveena's current predicament to Lor'themar, and that Dar'Khan is as much their enemy as he is his.\nThough Lor'themar is apprehensive to trust the word of a half-blood, Kalecgos states that he is no such thing \u2014 but in fact, a &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;, albeit currently without the ability to transform. Lor'themar and Halduron are amused by such an unlikely story, and Lor'themar mockingly notes that they might actually believe him if he could prove it. At that point, &lt;a href=\"Tyrigosa\"&gt;Tyrigosa&lt;/a&gt; reveals her dragon form to the shocked blood elves. Stunned, Lor'themar drops to one knee, and apologizes for his disrespect.\nLor'themar converses with his new companions and reveals to them the history behind Sylvanas Windrunner's demise. Unsure as to whether the banshee would be friend or foe, they at least acknowledge that she would forever be an enemy of Dar'Khan. The group travels to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Grove\"&gt;Sunwell Grove&lt;/a&gt;, and Kalecgos reveals that Anveena is, in fact, the mortal avatar of the Sunwell itself. Lor'themar splits with the group after this and joins with Halduron and company while Kalecgos deals with Dar'Khan. Lor'themar takes to the field once more to attack Dar'Khan, though the traitor chides him for his consistent failures and turns his attention to Kalecgos. Anveena herself is able to awaken and annihilates Dar'Khan with the great power of the Sunwell.\nIn the wake of Dar'Khan's defeat and the revelations surrounding Anveena by Korialstrasz, Lor'themar placed her under the protection of the blood elves \u2014 her true identity to be kept a closely guarded secret.\nReclaiming Quel'Thalas.\nAfter Kael'thas' abandonment of the Alliance resistance, Kael'thas had traveled to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to claim a new home for his people, taking 15% of the sin'dorei with him. Kael'thas, however, had not forgotten his people on Azeroth: &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and a number of &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; were sent back to Quel'Thalas, arriving with orders from the blood elven scion - Lor'themar was to protect Quel'Thalas in Kael'thas' stead, and prepare their people to join the prince in the promised haven of Outland. Rommath also brought word of a new method to sate magical addiction, and to become more formidable as a result, smoothly attributing it to being one of Kael'thas' teachings. This process was the harvesting of arcane magic, including the mana-bearing creatures maddened since the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction. The elves of Quel'Thalas generally took well to this efficient method, though a minority did not.\nAs the highest figure of authority in Quel'Thalas, ruling conjointly with his scion in Outland, Lor'themar was forced to exile several of his former comrades who refused to accept Rommath's teachings, reasoning that he could not lead a nation divided. This decision would come to weigh him down deeply, during the tribulations to come.\nThe Scourge threats that Lor'themar and his rangers had harsh troubles with proved little match for Rommath and the magisters, who quickly went about reclaiming and rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; \"almost overnight.\" Ruling as the Regent of Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar presided over the much-restored city of Silvermoon. Lor'themar was assisted in this daunting task by his two primary advisors: his good friend &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; and the prince's most loyal advocate, &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;.\nLor'themar was horrified by the fate that befell Sylvanas Windrunner; unaware of her break from the Scourge, he considered the monster wearing her face nothing but the Lich King's cruel instrument, and hoped the ranger-general their people had loved so well had found peace in death. Overhearing this, Sylvanas \u2013 who had returned to Quel'Thalas in the hope of reuniting with her people upon recovering her corpse \u2013 knew she would find no acceptance among her living brethren, at least not as the leader and friend she'd once been. When Sylvanas revealed herself to Lor'themar, it would be as leader of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;free-willed undead&lt;/a&gt;. And though she would call her offered aid a gesture of love for her homeland, an equal motivator would be the recruitment of yet more vengeful souls to further her vendetta against the Lich King.\nBlood of the Highborne.\nLor'themar remained in infrequent contact with &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; over the next few years. He made sure she was supplied with enough &lt;a href=\"mana%20crystal\"&gt;mana crystal&lt;/a&gt;s to sate her arcane hunger (the rangers were not as affected by the onset of magical addiction as much as more magically-inclined elves), and while initially skeptical of the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight Order&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar believed they would overcome their critics and prove a valuable asset to Quel'Thalas. Around that time, Theron began thinking about negotiating with the Horde. Liadrin once visited him and she noticed letters with the Horde seal.\nThe switch in lifestyle from that of a ranger to a politician was a daunting one for Lor'themar, who would never truly eschew the passion he had for his old life, and continuing to think of himself as a Farstrider on some level. His close friendship with Halduron helped him greatly in this regard, acknowledging his ranger-general as his closest and most loyal ally through this turbulent time in history.\nLor'themar was troubled by the emergence of a figure named Thadirr, and quickly deduced his true identity: Dar'Khan \"Drathir\", thought destroyed by Anveena, but still active and plotting to subvert Quel'Thalas for the Lich King. The traitor had lured the Blood Knights into a trap at &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Theron and &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt; arrived to aid them, joining forces with Halduron and the rangers. Lor'themar confronted Dar'Khan personally, though was set ablaze and left to die. The combined healing of the Blood Knights revitalized him, and Lor'themar, arming his bow with a fragment of the Stone of Sparks, loosed at Dar'Khan and \"killed\" him once more. Noticing Liadrin was not present, Lor'themar left to find her, tracking her to the old troll den they had been held captive in so many years before. There, he found her distraught over the near-wretched corpse of Galell, whom Liadrin was forced to slay.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nNew allegiances.\nLeading the blood elves conjointly with Prince Kael'thas, Lor'themar watched over &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; as its regent. However, Quel'Thalas was still in turmoil, and Lor'themar had few resources to protect the kingdom: its military was still in tatters, the &lt;a href=\"Amani\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; had been making bolder strikes in the south, and the emergence of the &lt;a href=\"Wretched\"&gt;Wretched&lt;/a&gt; had further weakened the elves. To make matters worse, Kael'thas had still not returned from Outland, and the latest news Lor'themar heard of his prince did not bode well. Kael'thas had suffered &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;considerable defections&lt;/a&gt; from within his ranks, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was amassing for reasons unknown. The prince was vulnerable, but Lor'themar could not leave Quel'Thalas undefended while he led a campaign to assist Kael'thas on Outland.\nThe blood elves needed allies, and they would no longer find them among the humans, dwarves, gnomes, and night elves. Kael'thas' alliance with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had soured relations between Quel'Thalas and the Alliance, and the kingdom's secession during Anasterian's rule still left bitter memories; the Alliance had no interest in fighting for Quel'Thalas, to the point that their &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Anvilward\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt; was actively working with several &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;night elven spies&lt;/a&gt; to sabotage the blood elves' arcane sanctums.\nThe blood elves were offered support from an unlikely source: the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, under the former ranger-general &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Though initially skeptical of a trick, the blood elves allowed the Forsaken to assist them in terms of manpower in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Through the Forsaken, Lor'themar was introduced to the wider &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors circulated that some lingering part of her still sympathized with Quel'Thalas and its hardships. Other stories hinted that Sylvanas had ulterior motives. Whatever the truth, she arranged for Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; to convene with Lor'themar and discuss such a possibility. Despite the elves' history of bitter warfare with the orcs, Lor'themar was receptive to the idea. He knew this Horde was different than the one that had ravaged Quel'Thalas in years past. He was also painfully aware that time was running out for his kingdom and his prince. The Horde's leaders also saw great promise in Lor'themar's people and considered it an act of honor to offer another race facing extinction their support. Thrall and Cairne extended the hand of peace, and Lor'themar accepted.\nThough thought destroyed, &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; once again managed to elude death, and again he had intentions to steal the power of the Sunwell. &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Kaendris\"&gt;Magister Kaendris&lt;/a&gt; sent troops to defeat Dar'Khan and sent the great traitor's head to Lor'themar. Pleased with this turn of events, and confident that a major &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; would prove the sin'dorei's power to their critics, Lor'themar sent a letter to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in which he requested an equal seat with the rest of the Horde. With the strong endorsement of Sylvanas, and revealing to the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Silvermoon's Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt; had received word back from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; about what is hinted to of a &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;clan of uncorrupted orcs&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall officially accepted the sin'dorei into the Horde.\nThe fallen sun.\nThe Sunwell's mortal avatar, Anveena Teague, continued to reside in Quel'Thalas under Lor'themar's protection. Only Lor'themar himself and a handful of others were aware of her presence and of what she truly was; they'd kept this information a secret even from Kael'thas. Lor'themar and his followers understood that the prince was desperate to save their people, but feared that if Kael'thas learned of Anveena, he might act without considering the consequences. The elves did not know what would happen if the avatar's power was infused into the site of the Sunwell. Quel'Thalas was already a wounded nation, and another disaster might destroy it forever.\nOver time, however, Lor'themar's opinion about this secrecy changed. He and his people constantly worried about Kael'thas's fate on Outland, and Lor'themar knew it was time for him to come home. Lor'themar believed the only way to bring him back was by telling him about Anveena. After Kael'thas had dispatched M'uru to Azeroth, messengers from Lor'themar set out to inform the prince about Anveena\u2014but they never reached him. Demonic agents of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%20the%20Deceiver\"&gt;Kil'jaeden the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; had infiltrated Quel'Thalas' highest circles and made sure that no word of Anveena reached Kael'thas. The prospect of restoring the Sunwell would give Kael'thas hope, and that was not what the demon lord needed. He wanted the prince to be desperate and uncertain about the future until he was firmly under control.\nWith the Horde's support, the blood elves were able to reach Outland, but what awaited them was not the paradise Kael'thas had promised. In &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, some learned of their prince's fate: Kael'thas had fallen into despair and a damning addiction to &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic while sojourning on the shattered planet, and had betrayed Illidan in favor of Kil'jaeden, lord of the Burning Legion, who had targeted Kael'thas for a specific purpose: access to the Sunwell. The &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; worked tirelessly to prove that in allying with the demons the prince had betrayed them all, but some blood elves did not believe these stories. It was not until gathering in &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; that they saw the truth for themselves.\nWord of this discovery reached Lor'themar and the other ranking elves in Quel'Thalas. The news broke their hearts, but they came to a consensus. Kael'thas was lost, and it was their duty to vanquish him and end his treachery. The Horde made war on Kael'thas and his followers, the battle spreading into &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; and engulfing every corner of the dimensional fortress. It was there where the prince made his final stand. It was there where some of his own loyal subjects spilled his blood and ended his reign. Yet unbeknownst to the Horde, Kael'thas did not die. Kil'jaeden had expected the prince's defeat, and he had prepared accordingly. Kael'thas's demonic allies spirited him away and brought him back from the brink of death, leaving little of his sanity. He was now Kil'jaeden's loyal servant, and he would do whatever his master asked of him. As the war on Outland reached a climax, Kael'thas finally journeyed home to Quel'Thalas, but it was not the homecoming Lor'themar had hoped for: his prince returned at the head of a demonic army, kidnapped Anveena, briefly assaulted Silvermoon itself with his &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;felblood elves&lt;/a&gt; to kidnap M'uru, and entrenched his forces on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFury of the Sunwell.\nKael'thas, twisted by demonic energies, used the vast arcane resources he'd acquired on Outland to revitalize the Sunwell. Leeching Anveena's power, the well would be transformed into a gateway through which Kil'jaeden could at last enter Azeroth. Lor'themar told his people that they would endure despite the betrayal of Kael'thas, and that like &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; before him, Kael'thas would not crush the spirit of the sin'dorei.\nAfter a bitter battle, Kael'thas was slain and Kil'jaeden was banished back through his would-be portal. The world was spared from the Legion once more, but there were consequences: Kael'thas's meddling had tainted the Sunwell. As before, corruptive energies coursed through the fount, and they would soon spread throughout Quel'Thalas and engulf the blood elves. Lor'themar and his followers considered destroying the Sunwell again, but another solution presented itself. The &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; prophet, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, had come to the Sunwell to pay his respects to M'uru, who had fallen in the battle. Little was left of the naaru save its heart, but Velen sensed a glimmer of power in what remained of M'uru. He used the naaru's heart to cleanse the Sunwell and transform it into a fount of Holy Light and arcane magic. Its brilliant energy blazed across land and sky for all in Quel'Thalas to see. The Sunwell was reborn, and its return heralded a promising future for the blood elves. Lor'themar personally gazed upon the restored Sunwell after its revitalization, and despite being shocked to the core, could not help but \"feel nothing\" in the face of the sole leadership role that now lay ahead for him, his scion branded a traitor and his people turning to him for answers in Kael'thas' stead.\nThe sin'dorei have generally accepted Lor'themar's rule in the absence of surviving royalty, and the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Guardian\"&gt;blood elven sentries&lt;/a&gt; that had once announced that Kael'thas would lead them to power and glory now speak of Lor'themar fulfilling this role.\nWith the death of Prince Kael'thas, and no surviving members of the &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20dynasty\"&gt;Sunstrider dynasty&lt;/a&gt; to claim the elven crown, the future of Quel'Thalas has thus become Lor'themar's alone to guide. Kael's betrayal and the involvement of blood elven forces among Illidan's (and more damningly, the Legion's) army severely hampered relations abroad, and Lor'themar must now also work to repair his people's connections to the other races while he restores Quel'Thalas and governs its people.\nIn the Shadow of the Sun.\nLor'themar, still with the fresh scars of Kaelthas' betrayal and the civil war that ran concurrent, had become the sole leader of the blood elven people. Despite his status, and despite &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt;'s support in taking on a more prestigious role and attire, Lor'themar maintained that he was merely the regent lord - not the king - citing Anasterian's status as the last king of Quel'Thalas as reason enough not to stake that claim.\nAfter receiving numerous letters from &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, all of which Lor'themar had chosen to ignore, Aethas announced that he would be visiting Silvermoon City. After a brief encounter with Halduron regarding the contents of this visit, the ranger-general likened Lor'themar's professional attitude towards such political matters to that of a king's. Halduron went as far as to offer Lor'themar the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Tabard\"&gt;Silvermoon City Tabard&lt;/a&gt; to better look the part, though Lor'themar wrote the notion off as unnecessary. Halduron reminded him that his role as a &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; was long behind him now, and that their head of state had to look the part. After observing his stoic &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar reflected that for all the thorn Rommath had been in his side, he could feel nothing but sympathy for the shattered man after Kael'thas' great betrayal. Lor'themar personally greeted the newly-arrived Archmage, impressed with his ambition and rank for such a young elf, and decides to hear out his plea.\nAethas revealed that &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; the Spellweaver had resolved to destroy all mortal spell-casters and requested the aid of his people in dealing with the threat the crazed aspect poses, on behalf of the Kirin Tor. Though Lor'themar remained neutral in the matter, Rommath immediately denied the request, citing the Kirin Tor's refusal to assist the sin'dorei as they faced execution in the dungeons of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Aethas persisted, though Rommath assured him that none of his &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; would assist the Kirin Tor with this task. He coldly noted that only the regent lord can overrule the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister&lt;/a&gt;'s judgment.\nLor'themar asserted his authority on the matter and silenced their bickering. He mentioned that he had business in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;south&lt;/a&gt;, extended his hospitality to the Archmage, and retired to his quarters. After conferring with Halduron, he concluded that perhaps aid would be acceptable if Aethas was given a boundary to work within - reporting back to Quel'Thalas directly, though not representing it officially. Halduron took amusement in the thought and likened his words to that of a king's once more.\nDays later, atop his &lt;a href=\"hawkstrider\"&gt;hawkstrider&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar, and several &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; honor guards begin the journey south. Halduron expressed disdain for Lor'themar's decision to partake in the journey, though Lor'themar continued on. As he traveled through the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar's ranger roots couldn't help but force repulsion upon him as he observed the fate that befell southern Quel'Thalas\u2014the fate that would befall more of it were it not for the tireless efforts of those who had perished to protect it.\nLor'themar arrived at his destination, the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Lithien Lodge&lt;/a&gt; that he and his fellow Farstriders had many a time visited as heroes of their people. He was greeted by the cold response of the quel'dorei rangers present, and after a harsh exchange with them, he threw down his weapons. Lor'themar requested an audience with a former comrade - one &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Lord%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Ranger Lord Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aurora%20Skycaller\"&gt;Aurora Skycaller&lt;/a&gt;. It was granted, and Lor'themar came face-to-face with the embittered Hawkspear and Skycaller. Lor'themar revealed that a number of the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt; had returned to Quel'Thalas, and Hawkspear asked as to whether the return of the prince's forces meant Lor'themar was here to apologize on behalf of Kael'thas. Lor'themar said that would likely be so, if the prince was still alive. As a shocked Hawkspear heard the tale, Lor'themar painfully told the story of the fate that befell their scion, and Aurora concluded that the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; had thus been returned to its people.\nHawkspear inquired about who would take the crown of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and Lor'themar\u2014referencing Prince Kael'thas' royal decree that &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; would be the last king of Quel'Thalas\u2014stated that there were none alive with any right to it. Having informed them of this turn of events, Lor'themar mentioned that now the Ghostlands have become far more secure with the Sunfury's input, he could offer the battered quel'dorei aid and supplies. Despite Lor'themar's good intentions, however, Hawkspear was furious at the notion. He revealed that Lor'themar had banished those few who opposed Rommath's radical teachings from their home rather than lead a nation divided and that they have been forced to scrape a living within the harsh plaguelands rather than their homes. In addition, he mentioned that &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; agents on behalf of one &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; had attacked the lodge, ransacking their documents for a &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20Registry\"&gt;registry&lt;/a&gt; and killing several rangers in the process. Hawkspear stated that these Forsaken were Lor'themar's allies, and that by rights he should kill Lor'themar in retaliation, and send his head to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLor'themar attempted to mend their bridges, assuring them that he was entirely unaware, though it was to no avail. Hawkspear couldn't bring himself to order his death; instead, he outright demanded that Lor'themar begone from the lodge and that any \"aid\" he dared send to Quel'Lithien would be returned to him wrapped around its bearers' hearts. The regent lord immediately left with his Farstriders and found himself wounded far deeper than he had expected. Reflecting on Hawkspear's words, he made the journey back to Silvermoon in the chilling snowfall. One of his Farstriders suggested he don his cloak, though Lor'themar only lamented that he could not possibly feel any colder.\nUpon his return, Aethas inquired about how his journey was conducted - specifically, if as a ranger he could find some common ground with one who opposed the blood elves being allowed entry to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; - another ranger named &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. After Rommath and Halduron concluded that the journey was a failure, Aethas deduced that such a thing is thus unlikely, and Lor'themar informed him that his deduction was correct. Later, Lor'themar reiterated the tale to Halduron, and reasons that he had no choice but to banish them; that he could not possibly afford to lead a nation violently divided at that point. They spoke of Nathanos, and Lor'themar couldn't bring himself to believe that their former comrade could have turned on the quel'dorei so. However, Halduron encouraged the embittered regent lord, and reasoned that while trusting the Forsaken was a risk, no one else would fight for Quel'Thalas.\nLater, Lor'themar began to consider how to deal with Aethas' request. He was interrupted by a courier, who stated that an individual of importance was here to see him. Lor'themar noted that he was unavailable, though the courier informed him that the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20Queen\"&gt;Banshee Queen&lt;/a&gt; would not wait. Lor'themar quickly ventured into &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the Dark Lady; Halduron and Rommath flanking him. He stared upon Sylvanas with a listless interest; the wounds of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion coming back to him after looking upon her face. Sylvanas informed him that the Horde has declared war on the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and insisted that as fellow members of the Horde, the sin'dorei dedicate troops. Lor'themar was apprehensive, citing that he had only just overcome the civil war at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas reasoned that if the sin'dorei do not mobilize, they would certainly lose Horde support - specifically, Forsaken support in their lands. With his arm twisted, Lor'themar relented, and agreed to send troops to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, though Rommath was less willing to give into Sylvanas' orders. Lor'themar silenced a brief argument between his enraged Grand Magister and the Dark Lady and bid his former ranger-general a &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; farewell.\nRommath was outraged and confronted Lor'themar for giving in to what was essentially blackmail. Lor'themar stated that he did what needed to be done for the survival of Quel'Thalas, even if that meant playing the role of a pawn. Rommath simply informed him that &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;another leader of the sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; had once said something similar to him and that Rommath did not challenge him; indeed, at the time he thought him right - and that they had buried him on Quel'Danas. He left to inform the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; leadership of the Regent Lord's decision.\nLor'themar informed Halduron of what had been decided and ordered him to prepare the Farstriders for battle. Halduron also appeared somewhat disheartened by Lor'themar's decision, treating him with an uncharacteristically cold courtesy, though unlike Rommath, he did not vocalize his concerns. Lor'themar then finally agrees to support Aethas' endeavor, though not on behalf of the Kirin Tor. He sent Aethas to confer with Rommath, and Lor'themar, seething, noted that Quel'Thalas was still ruled by his will alone.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s restoration and the monumental events that transpired on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar Theron has opened the sacred site as a place of worship for his people; the Sunwell itself now heavily guarded with &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Guardian\"&gt;Arcane Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Honor%20Guard\"&gt;Sunwell Honor Guard&lt;/a&gt;s. He has also allowed pilgrims - both blood elven and high elven - to visit it directly. Lor'themar himself was seen standing before the Sunwell during the quest to restore &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt;. He was initially skeptical of the blade's authenticity, though quickly changes his opinion upon inspection.\nFor a non-blood elf, Lor'themar thanks the player for returning Quel'Delar to \"its rightful owners,\" and attempts to take it. However, the blade does not recognize him as its wielder and hurls him back across the plateau; cutting off a large portion of his health. Rommath and the Sunwell's guards move to intercept and seize the player and Auric for this apparent treachery, though after some defusing Auric is able to salvage the situation. Rommath instead demands the player begone with the blade, if it is truly not meant to be theirs.\nFor blood elf players, Lor'themar simply observes Quel'Delar as it is purified in the Sunwell. Lor'themar, Rommath, and Auric all give words of support for the sin'dorei player's part in restoring the blade, and Lor'themar bows before them. Lor'themar names the player a hero and inspiration to the sin'dorei, a \"symbol of our endurance in the face of tragedy and treachery,\" and Rommath instructs them to take the reforged blade to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; restored, a new path to glory now lies ahead for the blood elves. After presiding over &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; through its darkest days, Lor'themar has resolved to lead his people into their prosperous future and has openly encouraged them to turn to the Sunwell to sate their magical addiction. While many blood elves are heeding the regent lord's words, a few are still reluctant to break their dependency on arcane magic.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Amani\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; empire declared itself reborn, &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; left to do battle with them in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Atal-Mhuto\"&gt;elite forces&lt;/a&gt;. Overstretched, the ranger-general also called upon &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her rangers to lend their aid to the battle, and protect Quel'Thalas from the Amani invasion. Lor'themar learned of Vereesa traveling to the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, a turn of events that he appeared to be irritated by. He sent a &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Messenger\"&gt;messenger&lt;/a&gt; to Halduron, also stationed in the Ghostlands, demanding to know the meaning behind her presence. After a brief confrontation with Halduron over his decision to invite an \"exile\" into their lands, Lor'themar's messenger learned of the three-way assault being put into motion by Vol'jin, Halduron, and Vereesa against Zul'Aman, and was sent back to Silvermoon with word of their plans for battle.\nTides of War.\nLor'themar was present during the Horde leader meeting between &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; himself, sitting to Garrosh's right. While most of the other leaders were prone to scrutinizing the Warchief, Lor'themar appeared more geared towards (or at least tolerant of) Garrosh's side, who in turn has developed a certain respect for the regent lord.\nLor'themar was impassive regarding Sylvanas' worries pertaining to the fall of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, despite Sylvanas believing the Forsaken and the sin'dorei would be most at risk of retaliation. Lor'themar ignored her repeatedly during the meeting, despite Sylvanas' attempts to play upon the regent lord's sympathy and get him to back her up.\nGarrosh later summoned Lor'themar for a private audience, thanking him for his loyalty. When prompted to discuss the nature of said loyalty, Lor'themar made it clear that he was loyal to the Horde, though Garrosh reminded him that he \"is\" the Horde. Lor'themar corrected him, stating that he was merely its leader. As Garrosh observed the sin'dorei retinue leave Orgrimmar, he uneasily concluded that Theron, in particular, was worth watching.\nLor'themar and Sylvanas were later expected to aid in the Theramore attack, though neither do so. Instead, Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; opt to send &lt;a href=\"Kelantir%20Bloodblade\"&gt;Kelantir Bloodblade&lt;/a&gt; and two ships of blood elven warriors on their behalf.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nLor'themar was summoned to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; and left with a &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; excavation and a retinue of &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; for protection. Lor'themar was first seen in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; alongside his bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Ellendra%20Palescorn\"&gt;Ellendra Palescorn&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh, and &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar clashed with Garrosh after the warchief failed to warn him of a strong &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; presence in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;, though pushed on with his orders to uncover mogu artifacts in the area. Later, Lor'themar sent &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde agents&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Orestes\"&gt;Ranger Orestes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aenea\"&gt;Blood Knight Aenea&lt;/a&gt; to discreetly fight their way through the mogu-controlled &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Emperors\"&gt;Valley of the Emperors&lt;/a&gt;, and to capture and interrogate the mogu leaders before Garrosh \u2013 who Lor'themar concluded is skeptical of his loyalty at this point \u2013 could hamper their chances of a subtle victory.\nLor'themar became increasingly wary of Garrosh's emulation of the mogu, a race of belligerent conquerors whose brutal reign saw them overthrown by the more moderate &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;. After the meeting with Garrosh and Baine in the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20Mercantile\"&gt;Imperial Mercantile&lt;/a&gt; in the Shrine of Two Moons, Theron returned to Silvermoon and was ordered by Garrosh to uncover the secrets of a certain mogu device. Lor'themar put &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to the task, and called upon &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; to assist him in figuring out this quandary. Rommath made considerable progress with its understanding, though a rampant &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; was released in the chamber, compelling the grand magister and Aethas \u2013 their emotions heightened by the sha \u2013 to come to blows. Horde heroes and the Silvermoon guards were able to contain the threat, and Lor'themar arrived to bear witness to it.\nLor'themar reiterated his past as a &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;, and why the sin'dorei were part of the modern Horde. However, coming under the same disregard and scrutiny on behalf of Garrosh as the blood elves had suffered under &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt; years before, Lor'themar considered looking into \u201c&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Old Alliances&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d Rumors of Lor'themar's dissatisfaction with Garrosh's leadership began to spread within the Horde's ranks, and Theron himself entered into talks with &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; back into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheron then waited in Garrosh'ar Advance while Garrosh and Baine interrogated &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Kien\"&gt;Shan Kien&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh organized a heist in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; that led to the blaming of the blood elves and thus sabotaging Theron's diplomatic efforts. With &lt;a href=\"Fanlyr%20Silverthorn\"&gt;Fanlyr Silverthorn&lt;/a&gt;'s help, members of the Horde took the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance and sent it to Silvermoon. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Kirin Tor, was quickly able to discover that someone within her organization helped the Horde circumvent her wards. Enraged at what she believed to be another &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;betrayal&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;led a purge of the Sunreavers from Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, with many being imprisoned while others killed. Rommath himself led a rescue mission that saw Aethas and a number of Sunreavers rescued, though many more were said to still be imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar and Halduron quickly moved to oversee the return of the rescued elves in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Court of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter giving a speech about how Jaina's purge was inexcusable and her actions reaffirmed his belief in supposed Alliance bigotry, and the fact they also had led the blood elves back to Hellscream's Horde to &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aethas\"&gt;Aethas&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar concluded that Garrosh had bought his &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;new treasure&lt;/a&gt; with the blood of Lor'themar's people, and hoped dearly that it destroyed him. Lor'themar ordered Rommath to summon the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20mage\"&gt;blood magi&lt;/a&gt; and add the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;' strength to his own, and for Halduron to assemble the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;. Rommath commented that Lor'themar would make \"a fine Warchief\", and noting that it might come to that. Theron demanded his blades and vowed that the next move would belong to him.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nLor'themar took command of the Horde forces moving against the newly-returned &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, christening his force (a coalition of &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;, among others) the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Garrosh focusing solely on attacking the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar mobilized the Onslaught against the threat &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; posed to all of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar's reasoning was twofold: for justice, and to claim the emperor's weaponry for himself, as leverage against Garrosh. Lor'themar suspected that a Horde uprising was on the cards, and believed it was best to be prepared for it. The conflict on the isle posed the first major martial affair Lor'themar had engaged in since being named regent lord, and Theron expressed that it would be good to find himself in the midst of battle again.\nFrom his &lt;a href=\"destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Treader\"&gt;Crimson Treader&lt;/a&gt;\", Lor'themar went about forming an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar oversaw the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt;, directing agents of the Horde to strike against the Kirin Tor's base camp and to back up Halduron's attempts to battle the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;. As the war effort progressed, Lor'themar personally led the Sunreavers' attacks against the Thunder King's stronghold, the regent lord's presence on the front lines posing a danger to his person that &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Captain%20Elsia\"&gt;Scout Captain Elsia&lt;/a&gt; was fearful of; however, Lor'themar maintained that getting his hands dirty was long overdue. Lor'themar commandeered the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%20Vein%20Mine\"&gt;Lightning Vein Mine&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; finished off its defenders, and Theron planned to have Horde metalsmiths study mogu fabrication techniques for his own ends.\nLater, the Regent Lord met with &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt; who prepared the attack on Stormsea Landing. When Lor'themar saw &lt;a href=\"Choker%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Choker of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, he immediately recognized to be a powerful artifact and claimed that Aethas would examine it.\nLor'themar ultimately led the Horde advance into the &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Crossing\"&gt;Bloodied Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, aiding Lord Taran Zhu's assault on the Thunder King's stronghold. Both &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Captain%20Elsia\"&gt;Elsia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aethas\"&gt;Aethas&lt;/a&gt; aided him in this task, along with a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar's forces were not alone, however -- &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; herself led the Alliance advance into the courtyard. Lor'themar stated that he would deal with Jaina himself if need be, and the Horde and Alliance groups focused on dealing with &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt;'s legions before turning to one another.\nLor'themar and Jaina faced off after Shan Bu was dealt with. Lor'themar demanded the release of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, professing their innocence in Garrosh's raid on Darnassus. Jaina rebuked him with the notion that they were prisoners of war, and that she would let him leave alive if Aethas was handed over to her. Theron refused this demand, though the parties were interrupted by an injured Taran Zhu, who ordered both Lor'themar and Jaina to stand down and move on from this conflict.\nAfter some convincing (Jaina citing the Horde's lack of effort with peace, Lor'themar stating his duty to protect his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;sovereign people&lt;/a&gt;), Lor'themar and Jaina agreed to retreat bloodlessly. Jaina made it clear that no true peace would be achieved while Garrosh Hellscream rules the Horde, though to her surprise, Lor'themar stated that \"that\" is precisely why he wished to conserve his strength today. Jaina's expression softened at his answer, and the two leaders left their \"parley\" with courteous bows.\nUltimately, Lor'themar acquired the leverage he had sought to find on the isle: heroes of the Horde delivered to the regent lord a crystal charged with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Animus\"&gt;Dark Animus&lt;/a&gt;, which Lor'themar used to re-empower a dormant &lt;a href=\"Animus%20Golem\"&gt;Animus Golem&lt;/a&gt; at the promontory. Lor'themar put his top archmages to the task of extensively studying it.\nEscalation.\nLor'themar came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; and threw his support behind Vol'jin's &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;burgeoning rebellion&lt;/a&gt; to overthrow Garrosh. However, with the Warchief oppressing, arresting, and executing members of the Darkspear as Lor'themar was still finishing up on the Isle of Thunder (and across the sea besides), Vol'jin was forced to take a more immediate approach and declared open rebellion against Garrosh.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt; was unearthed in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; fled the scene to get help, returning with both Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;. Jaina told the Regent Lord that she was not surprised that Garrosh's arrogance unleashed the Sha upon the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. They also noticed that Garrosh left &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; behind. Lor'themar, along with Sylvanas's Forsaken and most of the Alliance, returned from Pandaria and stormed the &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn board, Theron and Sylvanas discussed if she could raise dead elves. He forbade it but did not care about the human ones. After capturing the bay and docks from the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs led by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt; atop of &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt;, he and his blood elves made contact with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; at the front gates of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and arrived to aid them. Theron brought all his people's resources to the Siege of Orgrimmar, Blood Knights included.\nLor'themar was present along with the rest of the Horde's leadership (barring &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, who was injured earlier in the siege) at the defeat and arrest of Garrosh. When Thrall named &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; the new Warchief, Lor'themar bowed in respect.\nWar Crimes.\nLor'themar, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt;, was present during &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s trial on &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, along with the other leaders of the Horde and Alliance. He took an issue with the &lt;a href=\"Celestials\"&gt;Celestials&lt;/a&gt; serving as Garrosh's sole judges, jury, and executioners, though &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; assured his friend that would not be the case. Lor'themar agreed with Vol'jin's proposition to seat Baine as Garrosh's defender, thinking him suitable for the role, though believed it was a mistake to veto Varian as their former leader's accuser. Theron and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; exchanged positive courtesies during the trial, to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' surprise.\nIn a &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; conversation, the regent lord and the dark lady discussed the day's outcomes; acknowledging Lor'themar's lingering &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;resentment&lt;/a&gt; towards her from their past conflict, Sylvanas &lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20War\"&gt;again&lt;/a&gt; tried to foster a \"partnership\" between them, to no avail. After Garrosh escaped, Theron and many others heard the verdict from the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestial\"&gt;August Celestial&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegion.\nLor'themar was present among the gathering of faction leaders in neutral &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; once more returned to ravage Azeroth. He was not eager to return to the Violet City after the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, but Warchief Vol'jin, who trusted Khadgar as much as he concurred with Theron's wariness, decided the Horde would attend.\nLor'themar witnessed the death of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; and was present at his funeral ceremony in the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;. He fought against the &lt;a href=\"Felblade%20Assassin\"&gt;Felblade Assassin&lt;/a&gt;s that infiltrated the place.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Theron can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar Theron was present at the Orgrimmar parade. He rode a red-plumed hawkstrider and was accompanied by the blood elves living in Orgrimmar. He and Sylvanas briefly gazed at each other and nodded. Afterwards, he attended a dinner with the Horde leaders after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nLor'themar agreed with Lady Liadrin's positive opinion on the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, considering their kingdoms much alike. He invited the nightborne leader, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, to Silvermoon for a visit. Concurrently, he entertained another guest, his old Farstrider comrade &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to try and convince the regent lord to have Quel'Thalas leave the Horde and rejoin the Alliance. Lor'themar reacted curtly to Alleria's offer, stating only that he'd hoped she would return to Silvermoon out of love for her homeland, not as the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;boy-king's&lt;/a&gt; messenger. Alleria asked whether his words were truly his own, or if the noble ranger she'd known had simply become her sister's mouthpiece; Alleria's link to the void was also an issue between them, and Alleria accepted that her offer had been anticipated and spurned. Before leaving, she requested to visit the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, as it had been a thousand years from her perspective since she'd last laid eyes on it. Rommath, suspicious, was opposed to it, but Lor'themar overruled him, claiming that whatever else she'd become, Alleria was a daughter of Quel'Thalas and he would not deny her a pilgrimage. Lor'themar's first contact with Thalyssra was more positive; the two quickly endeared themselves to one another.\nThe group took Rommath's portal to the Sunwell, but the holy site was shortly after attacked by void beasts who had been brought forth by Alleria's presence. Lor'themar took part in fighting off the void's agents, including a massive void horror attempting to contaminate the Sunwell directly. After the battle, Lor'themar dismissed Rommath's attempt to have Alleria seized as a saboteur, but banished her on the grounds that her presence posed a direct threat to Quel'Thalas. Lor'themar apologized to Thalyssra for the unexpected turn of events, but the nightborne leader dismissed this, considering the battle a display of his dedication to his people and traditions. Thalyssra then pledged &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; to the Horde's cause, and Lor'themar assured her that Silvermoon's gates would be open to her.\nLor'themar was one of the leaders of the Horde that fought in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; defending the Ruins of Lordaeron. In the end, he escaped with Sylvanas and Baine.\nLor'themar alongside Liadrin helps blood elves who are level 60 and Exalted with Silvermoon City to go through an annual ritual remembering the losses of the blood elves to the Scourge, earning their &lt;a href=\"heritage%20armor\"&gt;heritage armor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLor'themar was present at the coronation of &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, along with other leaders of the Horde.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Lor'themar worried that Sylvanas may have just set the Horde down a ruinous path.\nRise of Azshara.\nLor'themar later joined the Horde fleet under the command of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, who used the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt; to guide the Horde fleet and the pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both would be attacked by the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas opened. Following the attack, Nathanos departed to complete his own mission and in his absence, Lor'themar rallied the Horde forces together. He directed the Speaker of the Horde to aid &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and ordered for his rangers to provide what aid they could to the Speaker. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Tidemistress%20Ethendriss\"&gt;Tidemistress Ethendriss&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker, Lor'themar, and Thalyssra ventured further into Nazjatar where they encountered &lt;a href=\"Neri%20Sharpfin\"&gt;Neri Sharpfin&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;. As they ventured together, they were confronted with an astral projection of Queen Azshara, who boosted that Nazjatar would be the last thing they would see and promised that she would hold the waters around Nazjatar at bay as long as she remained entertained.\nDeciding to work together, the Unshackled allowed the Horde to reinforce their base of &lt;a href=\"Newhome\"&gt;Newhome&lt;/a&gt;. As the Horde established itself, Lor'themar sent scouts to check out &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's palace&lt;/a&gt;, however, the scouts never returned. Seeking to discover what became of them, Lor'themar turned to &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ussoh\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ussoh&lt;/a&gt; who used his abilities to discover that the scouts were dead. Recognizing that his troops were weary and needed rest, Lor'themar turned to the Unshackled who offered to aid them. Realizing that the best way to survive against Azshara's forces was to support the Horde's new allies, Lor'themar entrusted the Speaker to join with &lt;a href=\"Combat%20allies\"&gt;one of their hunters&lt;/a&gt; and aid them in their tasks, as he plotted the Horde's next move.\nLor'themar later turned to Neri in order to discover what insight she could provide against the naga, and Neri and the Speaker would set out against them in order to rescue enslaved members of the kelfin. Lor'themar would later regroup with his allies and revealed to them that the Azerite weapons used by the naga were created by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ashvane\"&gt;Lady Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;. Informed of Ashvane's rescue by Azshara causes Lor'themar to realize that he had underestimated Azshara's influence and was content in securing the Azerite weapons for his allies. Despite this victory Lor'themar knew that their situation remained perilous. As he considered the Horde's next move he encouraged the Speaker to further improve relations with the Unshackled as they would need their aid in the battles to come. By showing them unity, Lor'themar believed that it would teach them that there were no obstacles that could stand in the Horde's way.\nLor'themar was informed by Spiritwalker Ussoh that the tauren had received a vision in which Sylvanas ordered Baine's death, causing Lor'themar to declare that they must stop the vision from coming to pass. Though Lor'themar followed her orders through peacetime and war, he found he couldn't follow her orders now. Declaring that Baine's execution would drive a blade into the very heart of the Horde, he then directed the Speaker to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;meet&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;with allies&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; in order to save Baine. He further declared that Baine represented the best of the Horde but warned that when Sylvanas learned of their defiance her wrath would be swift and terrible. Following the successful rescue, Lor'themar thanked the Speaker for saving Baine's life and voiced surprise that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; came to his aid as well. In turn, Thalyssra was surprised by Lor'themar's shock, as she recalled the Horde and Alliance &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;working together&lt;/a&gt; to liberate Suramar from the Legion, which caused Lor'themar to reveal that cooperation between the sides was more the exception than the rule. Thalyssra countered that their animosity only strengthened Azshara and that divided neither Horde or the Alliance would be a match for her. Lor'themar retorted that as long as Sylvanas had the loyalty of the people and as long as she was Warchief, the war would never end in their hearts, causing Thalyssra to muse that it might enough to simply direct their attacks against Azshara over the Alliance. After &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Shan%20Bu\"&gt;recalling Taran Zhu's words&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar declared that Thalyssra was correct and that they needed to focus their attacks on Azshara but warned that if the Alliance undermined their efforts the flames of war would rise again.\nSeeking to gain control of the Tidestone away from Azshara, Lor'themar directed Thalyssra and the Speaker to investigate the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; for anything potent enough to counter Azshara's sorcery. After Lor'themar learned that the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt; were obtained, he declared that the javelins would allow them to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. Declaring that now was the time to act, Lor'themar directed the Horde to take the fight to the naga. En route, however, the Horde encountered Alliance forces led by Jaina and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and after a brief argument, both sides agreed to fight together against Azshara's forces, where during the fighting Lor'themar fought side by side with Genn. After the Javelins of Suramar were used to shatter the Tidestone's protective barrier around &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Zharessa\"&gt;Lady Zharessa&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar joined the fight against Azshara's champion. After Jaina and Thalyssra combined their magics in order to use the Tidestone to open the way to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar warned that they couldn't underestimate Azshara as she was one of the most powerful sorceresses alive but declared, nevertheless, that she must be defeated. However, Lor'themar and Jaina argued about which side would deal the final blow to the Queen only to be interrupted by Azshara herself, who formally invited all of them to enter her palace.\nAccepting Azshara's invitation, Lor'themar was among the forces to strike at the heart of Azshara's power. He and Jaina ventured deep into the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;Last Prison&lt;/a&gt;, where the queen prepared a ritual to free her benefactor &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. As Thalyssra, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and heroes of Azeroth made their descent into the prison, Azshara taunted them with news of Lor'themar and Jaina's fall, but her words proved false: Lor'themar and Jaina, along with Thalyssra, Shandris, and the heroes, fought together to defeat Azshara. After the battle, Lor'themar and Jaina approached the fallen queen with weapons drawn, but the chains binding N'Zoth shattered and the Old God subsequently rescued Azshara. Though triumphant over Azshara, Lor'themar considered it a hollow victory as not only did Azshara survive but N'Zoth was freed. He also agreed with Jaina's assessment that the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; has kept them distracted and that divided they had no hope against N'Zoth. Thus Lor'themar vowed to tell his people of what transpired in Nazjatar, of how Azshara fell because the Horde and Alliance stood together, and of the rising threat of N'Zoth. Then he vowed to take his place besides Saurfang and Thrall.\nLor'themar and Thalyssra met Saurfang's loyalists, and the regent lord bluntly revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; has been costly and that battle against Azshara drained what little resources the Horde had left. He further revealed that Sylvanas was now in position to destroy her enemies and he no longer believed that Sylvanas would see reason. Thus, Lor'themar honored his word and joined Saurfang in his revolution and warned that Saurfang had some &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;unlikely allies&lt;/a&gt;. After the revolutionaries and Alliance secured the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, Varok's sought to attack &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; from all three entrances at once. Thus, he directed Lor'themar and Shandris to lead their forces to attack the city from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, before the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as their brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately ended in Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's abandonment of the Horde. Lor'themar was stunned by Saurfang's death and wondered what Sylvanas gained by abandoning the Horde. Lor'themar then ordered for &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; to be informed of what transpired and that it was time them to stand united as the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; once more. Declaring that Saurfang gave his life to heal the rift in the Horde, that his death was that of a hero, and that they shall honor his sacrifice. Thus, Lor'themar attended Saurfang's funeral. Lor'themar admitted that a part of him will now always wonder if he could have stopped conflict within the Horde if he had confronted Sylvanas after &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and lamented that it was not an easy thing to watch friend tread a dark path. Lor'themar remarked that though he had ordered for the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; with tracking down Sylvanas and Nathanos, he was unsure if they could find them.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar and the other Horde leaders received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, Lor'themar Theron addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was created, with Lor'themar representing the blood elven people. In the aftermath of the council's formation, Thalyssra invited Lor'themar to visit her in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and revealed that both &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; (who promised to keep &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; secure) and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; (who threatened to just teleport Lor'themar to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;) endorsed this visit. In response, Lor'themar said that his closet allies had conspired against him which caused Thalyssra to ask if it required a conspiracy for them to spend time alone together. However, Lor'themar was quick to reassure her that it would be his pleasure to visit.\nWith the war against the Alliance to end, Lor'themar believed that the Horde must look to its future.\nA Moment in Verse.\nLor'themar noted that both Rommath and Halduron had taken an unusual interest in his journey to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar believed that Rommath possibly uttered \"Go, you love-addled buffoon, or I will strangle you myself\" as Lor'themar departed. After arriving to Suramar, he was personally greeted by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and later the pair competed with another in a friendly poetry contest. She found Lor'themar's poem &lt;a href=\"The%20Adder\"&gt;The Adder&lt;/a&gt; to be marvelously done and recognized that it was about &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;'s betrayal of the blood elven people. Meanwhile, Lor'themar was so moved by Thalyssra's poem &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Moment\"&gt;Spirit of the Moment&lt;/a&gt; that he found himself standing in applause. Following their friendly competition, the pair conversed. During the conversation, Lor'themar admitted the recent events had made his thoughts linger on the past, and on Kael'thas's betrayal in particular. For her part, Thalyssra asked if he was truly healing from the wounds or merely simply reopening the wounds because they are his. As they reflected on things, they grew closer together only to be interrupted by a messenger revealing that Lor'themar was requested to return to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After Lor'themar ordered the messenger to depart, he and Thalyssra shared a kiss, where Lor'themar remarked to himself that the world outside their kiss could wait.\nShadows Rising.\nIn light of &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s call for the Horde to respond to the Zandalari &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;wounds&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; meeting, Lor'themar reminded her that the Horde's resources were stretched thin and that they must be thoughtful if they were to commit their navy to her struggles. Thus, he voiced that they could open negotiations with &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, which was soundly rejected by Talanji and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and the meeting was soon adjourned by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; as it fell into bickering. After a failed assassination attempt on Talanji, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; queen and a key ally, prompted Lor'themar and the rest of the Horde leaders to act. They empowered the young &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her.\nUpon learning that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, another meeting was held. Upon learning that &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; was arrested by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar was of the opinion that the tales of &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s on Zandalar were a stretch and voiced that the Alliance was abusing their civility. However, in light of the possibility of the tales of dark rangers being true, Lor'themar voted in support of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; to meet &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; due to his hopes that if Sylvanas was in Zandalar, then they could have her in their snares.\nWhen the Horde rallied to aid the Zandalari against the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; sailed to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; to prevent any possibility of retreat by sea.\nLor'themar granted &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; access to his library, scrolls, and occasionally explains to him the meaning of words. In turn, Zekhan was grateful as it is thanks to him that he knows how to read and write.\nDeath Rising.\nLor'themar alongside his &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;fellow council members&lt;/a&gt; convened atop of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; where they informed Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, which Lor'themar saw as being done to undermine the council's stability. They also learned from &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had also been abducted, and that an attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who neutralized her attackers. These champions were subsequently sent to unite with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the returning enemy.\nLor'themar is later informed about the death of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, where his only regret is how he was unable to witness it personally. While not begrudging &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; for claiming the killing blow, Lor'themar was worried and hoped that her rage remained fixed upon &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Upon hearing this &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, reminded him of how she had given counsel to the kaldorei who were raised into undeath after the battle for Darkshore. She further explained how she hoped to give them a path forward and to share this knowledge with Tyrande, would help ease her spirits, if only a little. In response, Lor'themar revealed that &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; had informed him of her efforts and hoped that fate would offer her the chance to see her kin offer bear fruit.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, the champions returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to inform the council about the events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark powers&lt;/a&gt; that Sylvanas had allied with. Acknowledging that Sylvanas had taken Thrall, Baine, and the others beyond the shattered veil, Lor'themar vowed to send word to the Knights of the Ebon Blade, and devise a strategy to rescue them from &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;the realms of Death&lt;/a&gt;. He then instructed the champions to remain vigilant, fight back the Scourge wherever they saw them encroaching, and promised to call upon them once a rescue plan was set in place. \nShadowlands.\nLor'themar was among the Horde leaders to convene with the leaders of the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. While desiring to rescue his friends, Lor'themar knew that he couldn't risk the stability of the Horde and send their fellow leaders on what might well be a suicide mission. In light of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s hostility when he encouraged the Alliance to do the same, he prepared himself for battle but stood down when Bolvar called for it. He then witnessed the ritual to open the doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and watched as &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and even Tyrande Whisperwind enter to rescue their comrades and seek out Sylvanas. He subsequently departed from Icecrown.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s freed Thrall and Baine from &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who had gone with the heroes to the Shadowlands\u2014sent word back to Lor'themar on Azeroth.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar and Thalyssra traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to attend Sylvanas Windrunner's trial, which ended with Tyrande sending her to the Maw to free all of the souls trapped therein. Lor'themar expressed regret that he had stood by during the Banshee Queen's atrocities and reflected that judgment might come for him as well in the end. Before going home, Lor'themar and Baine stayed for a time in the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt; atop Oribos. Lor'themar asked the tauren if there were any souls he'd like to visit before he returned to Azeroth. Baine understood that Lor'themar was asking about his father &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne&lt;/a&gt; and replied that he didn't need to, since he felt that Cairne's spirit was always with him. Baine then turned the question on Lor'themar, who stated that he'd always wondered if he was truly suited to lead the blood elves and that he'd like to visit the soul of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, to ask if he regretted the choices he'd made and get a chance to feel that the torch of leadership had truly been passed. Baine told his friend that he understood the feeling and wished him luck.\nLor'themar also approached &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, who had come to the Crucible as well, to tell him that he hoped Sylvanas' fate would bring the Alliance some peace. Genn replied that the regent lord should ask the souls of Sylvanas' victims if they felt peace and that peace was something he himself would never know as long as &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt;'s killer endured. He then sardonically asked Lor'themar if he hoped Sylvanas would come back from the Maw to serve as his ranger-general or warchief again. Lor'themar defended himself by saying that although he'd once admired Sylvanas as his hero and friend, the banshee that almost led the Horde to ruin had been neither of those things. Genn replied that, if so, Lor'themar shouldn't have followed her commands. The king and regent lord then curtly bid each other good day.\nSometime after, Lor'themar returned to Azeroth, and there was a resurgence of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. In a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Hall of Blood&lt;/a&gt; they learned that &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; was in danger of falling to the Scourge, with Aethas noting that the Scourge was too focused for it be a random attack, and voiced calling upon the Horde for aid. However, Rommath countered that they couldn't wait and had to deal with the Scourge immediately. Liadrin agreed with Rommath's assessment and was able to convince Lor'themar that it would be best to call upon those still in training to hold the line and keep Quel'Thalas safe. After the &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt; was slain and the Scourge beaten back, Lor'themar promised to inform the &lt;a href=\"Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; of what transpired in Quel'Thalas, and he suspected that matters in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; may even be worse. Lor'themar then lauded the efforts of his people, as they stood strong and held the line.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nA few years later, Lor'themar and Thalyssra invited a number of Azeroth's leaders to the wedding at the &lt;a href=\"Lunastre%20Estate\"&gt;Lunastre Estate&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. During the ceremony itself, they had &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; serve as their official officiator and exchanged their vows through poetry. After &lt;a href=\"Kurog%20Grimtotem\"&gt;Kurog Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; caused a scene with &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and was being kicked out, the Black Prince formally apologized to the newlyweds for his role in it. In response, Lor'themar declared that there was no need to apologize and brushed off the manner by joking about there being plenty of cake.\nDragonflight.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; had accepted the call of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to explore the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar went to the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, where he seemed prepared to see the expedition depart. It was there that he and his wife mused on how they were fortunate to have had a brief respite and playfully bantered about who proposed to who.\nTactics.\nThe battle with Lor'themar, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron&lt;/a&gt; can be intimidating for a small raid, and is somewhat comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; encounter. Rommath and Halduron can prove a serious threat to the raid, and killing all three may seem daunting at first. However, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28blood%20elf%29\"&gt;Royal Guards&lt;/a&gt; have not been updated since WotLK, so they are dispatched quite easily. It is vital that the raid keep in mind that their respawn timers, like Garrosh Hellscream, are only 10 minutes, unlike other city leaders.\nRaids should devote a few players to keeping an eye out for players teleporting in from behind Lor'themar's chamber as well as the mage trainer's room so as to be ready to quickly dispatch horde players who come to Lor'themar's aid from the Undercity and Pandaria respectively. Your tank should hold Lor'themar to one side of the room to give healers adequate distance to avoid Lor'themar's Mana Burn ability. PVP trinkets are a must for this fight in order to deal with Lor'themar's Mass Charm spell.\nThe combined HP levels of the three Silvermoon leaders can make this a long boss fight, their total HP pool nearly being 1.85B and with several mechanics to take into account for each boss. This is countered by players only needing to kill Lor'themar and the relatively low chance of a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; defense force gaining swift knowledge of a Silvermoon raid. Thus, player interference is much less likely than in some of the more populated cities.\nHalduron strikes swiftly when in melee range, and will periodically use a &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multi-shot&lt;/a&gt; ability similar to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;', hitting up to ten members of the raid and will also hit random raid members with a regular &lt;a href=\"Shoot\"&gt;Shoot&lt;/a&gt; ability. Rommath will rely on fire-based attacks - &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; on his current target and &lt;a href=\"Flamestrike\"&gt;Flamestrike&lt;/a&gt; on a certain location, but is immune to any interrupts. Rommath's &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Armor\"&gt;Molten Armor&lt;/a&gt; can be dispelled, but he will immediately recast it. Focussing on Halduron, Rommath, and Lor'themar respectively will allow more breathing space, as without Halduron and Rommath's abilities to consider, the battle drops in difficulty.\nLike Halduron, Lor'themar strikes swiftly in melee range, and generally alternates between his &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shock\"&gt;Arcane Shock&lt;/a&gt; abilities. His &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; has increased in potency, though he will only infrequently cast his &lt;a href=\"Mass%20charm\"&gt;Mass charm&lt;/a&gt;. With luck, subtlety, and enough concentrated DPS, Lor'themar will fall.\nLor'themar's downfall is the objective of &lt;a href=\"Killed%20in%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Killed in Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nLor'themar's appearance has changed considerably in each piece of media he has appeared in. For his debut in the \"&lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Trilogy\"&gt;Sunwell Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\", Lor'themar was shown to sport a regal-looking outfit complete with outward shoulderplates, a longsword, and a rugged cape, fitting his role as a ranger commander. He had fairly long and slicked hair, and most notably was missing his left eye. During the \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", Lor'themar had undergone a drastic change of appearance - he now had two functional eyes, his hair was put into a topknot, and his attire was incredibly simplified. Lor'themar used a warglaive complete with a shield, both of which he had not been seen with prior.\nIn the \"Battlecry mosaic\", Lor'themar's attire had completely changed once more - his outfit was painted as far more extravagant (also in mail or plate), with eagle portraits on his shoulders and decorated in a collage of red and gold. He was also seen holding a new shield, and its design was similar to the ones &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Guardian\"&gt;Silvermoon City Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s are seen with. Here, he was also portrayed with a goatee.\nDuring his debut in \"&lt;a href=\"Tides%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Tides of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;\", Lor'themar was described as having dark brown eyes and hair the color of corn-silk. In the \"Trading Card Game\", Lor'themar is depicted as a dark blonde, though all of his other appearances from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; onwards show him with pale-white hair.\nLor'themar's model introduced for \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" is again unlike his previous incarnations. It appears to be an elaborate and recolored mix of the final &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tier%206\"&gt;tier 6&lt;/a&gt; sets, found in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt; raid. Though still of a strikingly different design, his \"Cataclysm\" model seems to somewhat resemble his appearance in the mosaic. In &lt;a href=\"patch%208.1.0\"&gt;patch 8.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar obtained an entirely new model, unlike any art of him before.\nThe most logical reason for his changes of appearance in the lore can be put down to the strong clash of culture that Lor'themar has experienced - from a ranger, who fought from the front to protect his country, to a ruler now forced to play his hand at politics. His common attire being replaced by an outfit that exerts regality seems to illustrate this.\nFinally, his official artwork for \"&lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Shadow%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;In the Shadow of the Sun&lt;/a&gt;\" seems to combine aspects of all of his past appearances. His eye-scar is visibly noticeable, his outfit is truly resembling his in-game model (&lt;a href=\"Greatsword%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;blade included&lt;/a&gt;), and subtle parts of his \"Battlecry Mosaic\" picture are carried over, such as the avian emblems emblazoned on his shoulders.\nFrom his in-game introduction in \"The Burning Crusade\" up until the launch patch of \"Mists of Pandaria\", Lor'themar had two functioning eyes despite having only one in his depiction in \"The Sunwell Trilogy.\" An eyepatch was added to Lor'themar's model in patch 5.1, correcting the error after nearly six years. The eyepatch was soon after replaced with one based on the &lt;a href=\"Jeweler%27s%20Ruby%20Monocle\"&gt;Jeweler's Ruby Monocle&lt;/a&gt;, and at various points the eyepatch was mistakenly placed over his right eye.\nIn \"Battle for Azeroth\" &lt;a href=\"patch%208.1\"&gt;patch 8.1&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar was given a unique, high definition model that displays his scar and blind eye as it appears in previous artwork, along with regal new attire consisting of golden armor with a phoenix motif worn over a red and gold surcoat. In &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2\"&gt;patch 8.2&lt;/a&gt;, he was additionally given a unique greatsword based on the one in his new concept art.\nPersonality.\nLor'themar has become a ruler balancing a fierce love for his kingdom together with the weight of his peoples' burdens, though his responsibilities were not always so heavy. Years before his regency, Lor'themar was a patriotic and passionate ranger, with a talent for both battle and strategy. Lor'themar took pride in his role as a &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; and a warden of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, which the great traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; exploited for his own gain. Lor'themar holds guilt for his inability to see through Dar'Khan's betrayal, and his early years as regent were marked by several hard decisions and many difficult battles to bring his people back from the brink. Theron was hit hard by the betrayal of Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, with the future of Quel'Thalas falling into his hands alone. This experience has led him to oppose tyranny and injustice wherever he finds it, always putting the good of his people first.\nAs the regent lord of Quel'Thalas, Lor'themar has become highly versed in the world of politics, able to quickly deduce hidden meanings and often see through the masks of those within (and out of) his sphere of influence. Though authoritative (and not afraid to exert that authority), Lor'themar values the opinions of &lt;a href=\"Halduron\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;advisors&lt;/a&gt;, in matters of state and beyond. The life of a politician is not something Lor'themar ever craved, however; ever the ranger at heart, Lor'themar enjoys a good fight, longs for his lost life as a Farstrider, and finds politics exhausting.\nLor'themar places the safety of Quel'Thalas and its people high above all else. Lor'themar's loyalty is clear in this regard: he will not suffer allies who would harm his people, and will not shy from &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;negotiating with his enemies&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;plotting rebellion&lt;/a&gt; to secure his people a future.\nThough the burdens of leadership have weighed heavily on Lor'themar's shoulders in the wake of Prince Kael'thas' betrayal, under his leadership Quel'Thalas has survived many of its darkest days. He has resolved to see his people overcome their struggles, and lead them into a prosperous future.\nLor'themar doesn't have a family, nor does he want to start a new dynasty. He was implied to be romantically interested in &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he has shared several close moments; Liadrin, in turn, has some amorous feelings toward the regent. However, he later fell in love with &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.

Lor'themar is more than capable of playing the part of the statesman, unnerving others with how well he controls his thoughts and masks his meanings; but in much of \"&lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Blood of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;\", the \"&lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Trilogy\"&gt;Sunwell Trilogy&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\"\u2013when he isn't playing politics\u2013he is shown to be passionate, outspoken, and with a dry wit.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;, he is a calm and steady individual and describes him as a reliable leader as Regent Lord, a master diplomat, and a shrewd negotiator who always has the best interests of his people at heart.

But I did lie to &lt;a href=\"Aethas\"&gt;Aethas&lt;/a&gt;, and he knows it, and I know it, and anyone who heard me say it knows it. My will means very little, in fact. I can pretend my power is real, but in the end, it is all an act, and none of it is honest. I can wash my hands of it, play martyr, be victimized, and accomplish nothing, or I can fight and victimize others in my turn and thus become the essence of all I have battled. If I have ever rationalized my choices using any other logic, I was certainly lying to myself. &lt;a href=\"Renthar%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt; was right: I deal with the devil indeed, but the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; may never have been restored had we not sunk to those levels. He and Aurora can sleep soundly, knowing they have never compromised their ethics, but if they deny that they prosper in the wake of those who have, then they delude themselves as much as I.\"\n\"Here I find myself so close to believing that the ends justify the means. But the ruins of the &lt;a href=\"Magisters%27%20Terrace\"&gt;Magisters' Terrace&lt;/a&gt; will haunt me forever, reminding me of the fate I tempt with that thought. This is the line I walk, finally knowing that the actions I take in necessity are nonetheless indefensible. Those truths can never be reconciled, but sometimes I can hold them both side by side and almost understand. I might call this revelation profound if I were ignorant enough not to realize that I am only learning what &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anasterian\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; before him, had also learned in their turns. All we can do is walk the road we are given with such dignity as we can muster, each to our own glory or demise, and pray that there yet remains something of our own hearts when all is said and done.
