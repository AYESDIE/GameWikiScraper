Some tribes and individuals aren't hostile and are tolerant of outsiders, with tribes such as the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20tribe\"&gt;Timbermaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stillpine%20tribe\"&gt;Stillpine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Longclaw%20tribe\"&gt;Longclaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn northern Kalimdor, the furbolgs were old allies of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves concerned by the once peaceful race's condition have attempted to help the furbolgs settle their tensions, but the mighty bear-men retreat ever further into their territories and fall deeper into the rage that is overtaking their race, they turned into fearsome new enemies of the night elves.\nHistory.\nFurbolgs have oral traditions that say they have ancient origins. They descend from an ancient race of bear-men known as the &lt;a href=\"jalgar\"&gt;jalgar&lt;/a&gt;. The jalgar warred with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, but when the Dragonflayers gained the upper hand by learning to ride &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, the jalgar were pushed south into the central forests of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe furbolgs were abundant before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar of the Ancients.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s first invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, furbolg packs led by &lt;a href=\"Unng%20Ak\"&gt;Unng Ak&lt;/a&gt; were convinced to join an alliance consisting of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, or alternately by the dragon-mage &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; when he traveled in time. It was a reluctant truce, since many night elves were xenophobic towards other races. During the war in the region that would later become &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, Unng Ak's &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20tribe\"&gt;Blackmaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs were reinforced by &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and his tauren, also in the region, the demons were being fought by night elves including &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and Jarod Shadowsong, &lt;a href=\"Eche%27ro\"&gt;Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt;, Krasus, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and summoned &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter the Sundering.\nAfter the war, the furbolgs formed positive relations with the night elves and tauren, though they preferred to live in peaceful isolation. After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; as the centuries passed the furbolgs reappeared and flourished in the land.\nA young furbolg found the &lt;a href=\"titansteel\"&gt;titansteel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"%3AClaws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;:Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; recognizing whom they had belonged to he took them to his tribe, the claws were all that remained of the bear god &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; in the physical world after his death in the War of the Ancients. For generations, those furbolgs worshiped the claws as the final sign of their bear god. Few furbolgs had the courage to try to wield Ursoc's claws in battle, but every time they did the results were horrifying. Ursoc had spent untold years mastering the claws' power and unlocking their potential; in the hands of an untrained mortal, they inspired an uncontrollable bloodlust that lashed out at friends as easily as enemies. After a number of attempts, the claws ceased to have any effect at all on the furbolgs, no matter what rituals they tried, as the power in the claws had become dormant as Ursoc's spirit standing guard in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; had simply seen enough, the furbolg tribe was not capable of controlling his power, so he withdrew it from the claws. Eventually, members of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; brought the claws to Ursoc in the Emerald Dream.\n4,500 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, night elf druids created a &lt;a href=\"world%20tree\"&gt;world tree&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; that became corrupted and was cut down by the druids, but the stump that was left behind was eventually taken over by the furbolg tribes, who built the settlement that became &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a tribe of furbolgs stationed near the borderline of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; sent by &lt;a href=\"Neeloc%20Greedyfingers\"&gt;Neeloc Greedyfingers&lt;/a&gt; because they had been harassing the goblin. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s killed their chieftain and several members, and Neeloc hoped that the tribe would disperse by the death of their leader. In Ashenvale, in a clearing housing a pool that was surrounded by furbolgs had &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; teleport there, the furbolgs fleed at their approach, but one who was slow was killed, the furbolgs continued to inhabit the surrounding forests as the orcs came into that area.\nIn Ashenvale, &lt;a href=\"Felwood%20Furbolgs\"&gt;a furbolg tribe&lt;/a&gt; was preparing to leave the place from the evil corrupting the lands, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; located ten wandering tribesmen after which they were ready to evacuate their village with a &lt;a href=\"Furbolg%20Champion\"&gt;furbolg champion&lt;/a&gt; given to serve her as a reward. In &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande encountered the furbolgs that left Ashenvale, but it seemed they did not escape the corruption after all, with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; never seeing furbolgs so aggressive before, so they killed them. Later in the &lt;a href=\"Barrow%20Deeps\"&gt;Barrow Deeps&lt;/a&gt;, an ill &lt;a href=\"Furbolg%20Shaman\"&gt;furbolg shaman&lt;/a&gt; of a small band of cave-dwelling furbolgs was saved by Tyrande as she brought a vial from a &lt;a href=\"Fountain%20of%20Health\"&gt;fountain of life&lt;/a&gt;, the shaman a &lt;a href=\"Talisman%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;talisman&lt;/a&gt; that was able to summon furbolgs for aid in a fight. Also in the Barrow Deeps, a hidden trio of furbolgs was found that joined Malfurion's group.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barkskin%20Furbolgs\"&gt;Barkskin&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs that inhabited &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; fought the Burning Legion.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nWhat once were believed to be only whispers and rumors of attacks by savage and cruel bands of furbolg in the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' enchanted forest have become an increasing concern for the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s. It is thought that the passing of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and the vestiges of its demonic taint drove the simple and peaceful bear-men to madness. Their aged and wizened leaders have been replaced by ruthless firebrands who lead the crazed furbolgs to prey upon the denizens of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Where the furbolgs coexisted peacefully with the night elves for ages, with claw and fang they now seek to carve out their own home in the endless forest.\nIn the hills and forests of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; where the peaceful furbolgs used to dwell, they deserted their homes and amassed under the name of the &lt;a href=\"Gnarlpine%20tribe\"&gt;Gnarlpine tribe&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ursal%20the%20Mauler\"&gt;Ursal the Mauler&lt;/a&gt;, the Gnarlpine chieftain, is using the evil powers of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Moss\"&gt;fel moss&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt them and drive them mad. The Gnarlpines invaded &lt;a href=\"Ban%27ethil%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Ban'ethil Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Starbreeze%20Village\"&gt;Starbreeze Village&lt;/a&gt;, driving out or slaying the local inhabitants.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, a satyr &lt;a href=\"Xabraxxis\"&gt;Xabraxxis&lt;/a&gt; held sway of the &lt;a href=\"Blackwood%20tribe\"&gt;Blackwood tribe&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs via talismans that channel magic that perverts the balance of nature. Xabraxxis was lured out and slayed by an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; adventurer in a war to reclaim the forest from the forces of corruption.\nIn Ashenvale, the &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20tribe\"&gt;Thistlefur&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Foulweald%20tribe\"&gt;Foulweald&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bloodtooth%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtooth tribe&lt;/a&gt;s have been corrupted, but some furbolgs still live and try to protect the forest, as during their corruption, they weren't all corrupted, some of the furbolg fled, many were killed, and others were forced out of their tribes, such as uncorrupted &lt;a href=\"Krolg\"&gt;Krolg&lt;/a&gt; who was cast out by the Foulweald. The furbolgs' corruption has caused Ashenvale to become a fraction of its former glory, with the night elves of Ashenvale being under constant threat from the furbolg. Thistlefur furbolgs had their numbers grow greatly over a few months which led an Alliance adventurer to cull their numbers so they wouldn't attack &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; directly. The Horde killed Thistlefur furbolgs to thin them out as their village was on a path that circumvents Alliance's Astranaar. Foulweald furbolgs had been attacking travelers along the road heading east before the &lt;a href=\"Falfarren%20River\"&gt;Falfarren River&lt;/a&gt;. Issuing a challenge to the Foulwealds and defeating their leader &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Murgut\"&gt;Chief Murgut&lt;/a&gt; was a show of force by the Horde to remove them as a threat. The corruption had made the evil, power-hungry and lusting &lt;a href=\"Ran%20Bloodtooth\"&gt;Ran Bloodtooth&lt;/a&gt; stronger, and the fiercest furbolg threat in Ashenvale.\nIn Felwood, the &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20tribe\"&gt;Deadwood tribe&lt;/a&gt; had been driven mad by the taint of the woods as their minds were polluted by the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, they're found in &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20Village\"&gt;Deadwood Village&lt;/a&gt; in the south and &lt;a href=\"Felpaw%20Village\"&gt;Felpaw Village&lt;/a&gt; in the north of Felwood. In Winterspring, the &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20tribe\"&gt;Winterfall tribe&lt;/a&gt; had fallen under the same corruptive sway as the furbolgs of Felwood, a hidden satyr &lt;a href=\"Xandivious\"&gt;Xandivious&lt;/a&gt; located in the tribe's leader's personal cave dominates the tribe and is responsible for their corruption, they're corrupted by &lt;a href=\"%3AWinterfall%20Firewater\"&gt;:Winterfall Firewater&lt;/a&gt; that's mainly made of elements from corrupted creatures in Felwood in the &lt;a href=\"Deadwood%20Cauldron\"&gt;Deadwood Cauldron&lt;/a&gt; at Felpaw Village, with &lt;a href=\"Winterfall%20Runner\"&gt;Winterfall Runner&lt;/a&gt;s passing through Timbermaw Hold bringing the firewater to Winterspring.\nIn the interconnecting parts of Felwood, Moonglade, and Winterspring, the &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20tribe\"&gt;Timbermaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; remains uncorrupted and has a base of underground tunnels &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Hold\"&gt;Timbermaw Hold&lt;/a&gt;, they've escaped the darkness that had fallen on Kalimdor in the safety of Timbermaw Hold and were only taking careful steps outside of the safety of their base, they become wary of all strangers fearing that any outsider may mistake them for their corrupted brethren and attack. The Timbermaw's main concerns became putting an end to their corrupted brethren's suffering and finding a cure to heal the wounds the corruption of Felwood has inflicted upon the land, with the threat of corruption for the Timbermaw coming from the Deadwood furbolgs to their south and the Winterfall furbolgs to the east. Adventurers who sought out Timbermaw Hold in northern Felwood and proved themselves as friends of the Timbermaw tribe by driving back the corrupted Deadwood furbolgs could then pass through the hold to Winterspring. Both the Alliance and Horde tried to make contact with Timbermaw furbolgs previously but were only able to broker a peace with them after valiant actions of adventurers in Winterspring, after the peace further diplomats were dispatched by both factions. In northern &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, in a separate region from the rest of their tribe there were Timbermaw furbolgs near the closed entrance to &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20Hold\"&gt;Blackmaw Hold&lt;/a&gt; and in the settlements of &lt;a href=\"Bear%27s%20Head\"&gt;Bear's Head&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursolan\"&gt;Ursolan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, there is a war between the &lt;a href=\"Stillpine%20tribe\"&gt;Stillpine&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bristlelimb%20tribe\"&gt;Bristlelimb&lt;/a&gt; furbolg tribes. A prophecy of the coming of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and their alliance with the Stillpine tribe was foretold by &lt;a href=\"Kurz%20the%20Revelator\"&gt;Kurz the Revelator&lt;/a&gt;. During the crystal storm when the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; crashed the &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Stillpine%20Hold\"&gt;Stillpine Hold&lt;/a&gt; and brought a beast of myth &lt;a href=\"The%20Kurken\"&gt;The Kurken&lt;/a&gt; that laid waste to the village. The Exodar draenei aided the Stillpine tribe against their enemies freeing them.\nThe Comic.\nThe furbolgs of &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20Hold\"&gt;Thistlefur Hold&lt;/a&gt; retrieved the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; which corrupted them. &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; learning this flies with &lt;a href=\"Lo%27gosh\"&gt;Lo'gosh&lt;/a&gt; to Ashenvale, fights the corrupted furbolgs and cleanses the corrupted idol of its fel energies. After the cleansing, the &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20tribe\"&gt;Thistlefur tribe&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs were released from corruption and gave the idol to Broll.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, although the gentle furbolgs have grown accustomed to living in relative peace, recent incursions have forced the ancient tribes to engage in battle. &lt;a href=\"Trappers\"&gt;Local human trappers&lt;/a&gt; are encroaching upon furbolg hunting grounds, and the goblin &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; has begun large-scale deforesting operations throughout the region, but the most imminent threat comes from the north where &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s have begun pouring from &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The two races had previously survived for centuries without conflict, but the furbolgs found themselves in a desperate struggle to hold their land against the steadily increasing numbers of undead trolls.\nThe furbolg deity &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt;, who died in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, was horribly twisted by a rebirth performed by the &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs. For centuries, the furbolgs who worshipped Ursoc tried to devise a way to resurrect him. Finally, they decided to attempt to regrow the failed world tree &lt;a href=\"Vordrassil\"&gt;Vordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and use its magic to bring back Ursoc. For thousands of years prior, the furbolgs of the Grizzly Hills had been peaceful, but as the evil of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; which caused the ancient druids to tear down Vordrassil manifested itself in the new sapling it turned the furbolg of Grizzlemaw into monsters filled with bloodlust. Tribal war has broken out amongst them after years of peaceful coexistence. The best of intentions didn't count for much when the result was tainted by such strong a corruption. A Timbermaw tribe furbolg &lt;a href=\"Tur%20Ragepaw\"&gt;Tur Ragepaw&lt;/a&gt; came to Northrend and together with an adventurer was instrumental in defeating the incarnation of Ursoc and freeing his spirit of taint.\nCataclysm.\nIn Teldrassil, the Gnarlpine tribe's corruption has returned, even after the cleansing of Teldrassil. Ursal the Mauler the Gnarlpine furbolg leader seems to defy death itself in his pursuit of further corrupting Teldrassil. As Teldrassil purged itself of the corruption that has perverted its growth for years, a malevolent growth has formed near the tree's edge, the source of the fel moss the &lt;a href=\"Bough%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Bough of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; that has tainted the Gnarlpine, and everything else, which would be struck down by a hero.\nIn Darkshore, the Blackwood furbolgs have been sickened by &lt;a href=\"Jadefire\"&gt;Jadefire&lt;/a&gt; satyrs of Felwood who started to introduce their poison into Darkshore, an Alliance adventurer cleansed the afflicted Blackwood of corruption and killed the satyr responsible &lt;a href=\"Sharax%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Sharax the Defiler&lt;/a&gt;. With most of their tribe losing their way to madness or corruption the uncorrupted parts of the Blackwood tribe had to ally to an Alliance adventurer to help in killing the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s that attacked their village, and in return &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brownpaw\"&gt;Elder Brownpaw&lt;/a&gt; assisted Malfurion Stormrage at the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Vortex\"&gt;Eye of the Vortex&lt;/a&gt; to die down the elementals' anger to save Darkshore.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, the furbolg &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20tribe\"&gt;Blackmaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; who have broken rank with their &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20tribe\"&gt;Timbermaw&lt;/a&gt; brethren tried to make an agreement with the night elves as the Horde began to aggressively settle Azshara. But the furbolgs' efforts were sabotaged by the Horde, as one of them doned an enchanted robe to take on the appearance of a night elven ambassador, deceiving and killing Blackmaw furbolgs and so turning them against the Alliance.\nIn Ashenvale, the Thistlefur furbolgs that have been through corruption before were now corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Charm\"&gt;troll charms&lt;/a&gt;, most of which they've hoarded in &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20Hold\"&gt;Thistlefur Hold&lt;/a&gt; above their village, the charms themselves have a property to their carving that slowly corrupt those that aren't trolls. There are conflicting stories whether the Thistlefur attacked and killed the trolls and stole their charms or whether the charms were gifted to the Thistlefur by the trolls as a sign of friendship. Thistlefur furbolgs had expanded to the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ordil%27Aran\"&gt;Ruins of Ordil'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, attracted by three moonstones that the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Dark%20Strand\"&gt;Cultist of the Dark Strand&lt;/a&gt; had uncovered, with the killed cultists corpses littering the area in the aftermath as victims of their own curiosity. Foulweald tribe allied with the Horde when they took &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt; from the night elves, only for their &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Murgut\"&gt;Chief Murgut&lt;/a&gt; to sell his own people into slavery. &lt;a href=\"Krolg\"&gt;Krolg&lt;/a&gt; who was cast out by the Foulweald had an Alliance adventurer slay Murgut and for the power of modifying &lt;a href=\"%3ADartol%27s%20Rod\"&gt;:Dartol's Rod&lt;/a&gt; also had them slay &lt;a href=\"Ran%20Bloodtooth\"&gt;Ran Bloodtooth&lt;/a&gt;, who was the king of all of the Ashenvale furbolg and the chieftain of the Bloodtooth tribe, the most powerful tribe which keep themselves secluded in &lt;a href=\"Bloodtooth%20Camp\"&gt;Bloodtooth Camp&lt;/a&gt;, after which Ran's skull with his tainted essence was fashion upon Dartol's Rod, giving the rod power to influence furbolgs, with Dartol's Rod's power the captured furbolgs penned in Silverwind Refuge by the orcs including Krolg's brother &lt;a href=\"Ota%20Wen\"&gt;Ota Wen&lt;/a&gt; were convinced to rise up and break out of their cage and attack the Horde.\nIn Timbermaw Hold, the Timbermaw tribe stopped being hostile to unknown members of the Alliance and Horde allowing them free passage in their tunnels.

Shamanism is much more common among the free-willed furbolg tribes. Furthermore, some free-willed furbolg are even capable of basic shapeshifting, much like a trained &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe furbolg tribes worship the twin bear &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;, as gods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sonova%20Snowden\"&gt;Snowden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; family are specialists in furbolg &lt;a href=\"furbolg%20%28language%29\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; and culture.\nFurbolgs have a long history of brewing, and tend to bees for honey.\nIn Warcraft III.\nPolar furbolgs.\nPolar furbolgs are white-furred furbolg who live in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote: Although polar furbolgs appeared in \"Warcraft III\", the term is not used in \"\".\nIn the RPG.\nDescription.\nA shamanistic race of humanoid bears, furbolgs have lived peacefully on Kalimdor and Northrend for millennia. Furbolgs live in isolated villages or in burrow-like tunnel systems, some of which are complex and extensive. They make their homes in secluded glades and wilderness idylls; many live in Ashenvale Forest and are friends of the night elves. Furbolgs are physically powerful but somewhat lacking in mental prowess.\nThe center of every furbolg tribe is the shaman. Those furbolgs who show skill in divine magic are singled out to become leaders of the tribes, as furbolgs society is organized into tribes, and an elder shaman leads every furbolg tribe. Shamans act as leaders both in spiritual matters and in war, and are often the most powerful combatants in the tribe, they consult with forest spirits to provide leadership and guidance to their tribes. Furbolgs venerate their shamans and have a very intimate relationship with nature. Unlike many other intelligent races, furbolgs feel that they are a part of nature - it is not some outside force to tame, exploit or revere.\nFurbolg trackers are also important members of furbolg society. They, along with younger shaman, move through their tribe's domain, marking game trails and keeping track of migrations. Furbolgs are hunters, moving in predictable patterns as their prey travels with the change of the seasons, tribes migrate to and from their set hunting grounds. A typical hunting ground has hunting furbolgs erect small temporary villages, which will have a central lodge constructed of sturdy logs, or a single log building in the center and a number of less permanent structures surrounding it. Furbolgs also forage; they can eat almost anything, but they have a particular fondness for berries.\nFurbolgs naturally have a peaceful society and avoid combat rather than seek it out. They survive in the wild places mostly by keeping to themselves. They are peaceful creatures, but savage and dangerous when angered. A furbolg who must fight is terrifying to behold, and most intelligent creatures take steps to make sure that furbolgs in the area remain happy and content. Strong furbolg warriors are proud to face their enemies and prey with only their claws; other furbolgs use primitive weapons such as spears, often decorated with feathers.\nSince the Third War, The Burning Legion's arrival profoundly impacted furbolg society. The demons' invasion drove many furbolgs to madness and rage. Now, furbolg have a reputation as dangerous and feral creatures. These corrupted and dangerous furbolgs roam the wilderness, destroying and killing in a haze of burning fury. The uncorrupted furbolgs look sadly at their altered brethren, but know that they must slay them if they happen upon them. Uncorrupted furbolgs find it easiest to distance themselves from other races because members of both the Alliance and the Horde take it on faith that all furbolgs are evil and must be destroyed. Despite this fact, uncorrupted furbolgs remain allies of the night elves and, by association, humans, dwarves and gnomes as well. They are not members of the Alliance, but are certainly friends of it. Uncorrupted furbolgs look sadly at their corrupted brethren and, if they make friends with members of the other races, seek help clearing tainted furbolgs from the land or discovering ways to heal them. Before the war their peaceful existence in their forests, concerned with the everyday trials of tribal life, shamanistic culture and cultivating the forests.\nConcerned more with communing with the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; and protecting their settlements, few furbolgs pursue the more intellectual paths, although some have been known to attempt them. Some furbolgs rarely venture from their secluded villages, with a few of them seek the companionship of other races and thrill to the prospect of adventure and travel beyond their forest home, they thirst for adventure and want to learn about the newcomers to their continent these furbolgs will be found traveling around Kalimdor, visiting the cities of the other races and enjoying the new cultures, their neutral stance benefits them in this exploration, and furbolgs are allowed in any city without prejudice.\nCorrupted furbolg.\nCorrupted furbolgs are furbolgs twisted into savage and violent versions of their more peaceful kin through the Burning Legion\u2019s evil influence. They are hunched like their normal kin, standing about 9 feet tall and weighing between 300 and 400 pounds. They have strange markings in their fur and indulge in scarring and piercing to enhance their savage appearance. They are also known to decorate themselves in the remnants of those they have killed. Some corrupted furbolgs display additional demonic characteristics, such as horns, the ability to generate fire, and so on. These are unique individuals who often end up as the leaders of their own war parties. Unlike a standard furbolg, corrupted furbolgs are violent and survive by raiding and looting the communities they come across. They are willing to cooperate with other corrupted creatures to further the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s aims.\nCorrupted furbolgs have abandoned the worship of nature and with it the structures of their past. Instead, they are driven by the most powerful among them. Should more than one furbolg achieve power, the corrupted furbolg band will split into smaller groups and each will go its separate way. The ranks of the corrupted are filled by the taint of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Corrupted furbolgs have no taboos against biting, and use their powerful jaws as weapons. They do not usually wear armor or use weapons. If possible, a corrupted furbolg will charge in preference to other maneuvers.\nCorrupted furbolgs speak &lt;a href=\"Furbolg%20%28language%29\"&gt;Ursine&lt;/a&gt;, and sometimes the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; tongue. Their alignment is always &lt;a href=\"chaotic%20evil\"&gt;chaotic evil&lt;/a&gt;.\nEarly history.\nFurbolgs originated from Northrend. They lived on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;s came to the world. Their oral histories speak of the first time Titans stepped on the world and roamed the wilds. Furbolg may have descended from early &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; who settled up in Northrend, becoming more feral; or furbolg of Northrend may have discovered &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and their culture became more contemplative.\nRecent history.\n\"\"Faced with the unexpected attacks by &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and their own people, the furbolgs joined the fight, putting their generations of hunting experience to more violent purposes. Formidable warriors, they\u2019ve always been. Formidable &lt;a href=\"soldier\"&gt;soldier&lt;/a&gt;s, well, that is a newer concept. Some furbolgs hired themselves as mercenaries to forces on both sides.\" \n\"\"After the war, emissaries from both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; (advised by the night elves and the tauren, I expect) approached the furbolgs and invited them into the affiliations, but they declined both. Perhaps it was their reluctance to choose between their friends, the night elves, and the tauren. They do seem to be closer to the night elves, but I don\u2019t think they want to claim themselves the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; simply by association. Perhaps they simply felt their problems had always been their own, and they would make their current problems their own as well. They are a proud folk.\"\n\"\"When not attempting to heal their forests or their own people, furbolgs focus on hunting the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s agents, who they blame mostly for their plight. You do not want to get between a furbolg and a demon. To keep life on track, more young furbolgs than ever are training to become &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, seeing the holy men and women as the only adults who seem calm in these days of horror and uncertainty. With half of the population looking to pick up the spear (although they are deadly enough with their claws and bite) and the other half studying the magic of nature, the furbolgs are a people whose society is changing.\"\n\"\"One positive thing the war has done for the furbolgs is get them more acquainted with the world outside their forests. Formerly only the friends of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, beings of the forest, and a self-contained people, now the furbolgs are watching the movements \u2014 political or otherwise \u2014 of the Alliance and Horde; traveling more; learning more about the world outside their forests; and widening their view of life as it applies to them in this new and harsher world.\"\" ~ Attributed to &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;\nAfter generations of peaceful existence on Kalimdor, the furbolgs have found an almost warlike passion concerning the Scourge, when the Scourge ravaged the land in the last war. Formerly slow to anger, furbolgs now consider the Scourge to be their ultimate racial enemy and will attack any Scourge they see on sight. The Scourge was behind the destruction of much of their race, and the furbolgs vow revenge. When their peaceful life was shattered, the furbolgs' great size was suddenly used for more than channeling earth magic; the gentle giants discovered hate and rage, and used their bulk to fight the Scourge. Their lack of intelligence caused many to be driven mad by the invading Scourge: Some lost their minds after drinking from polluted wells, and some went insane when exposed to the extended use of dark arcane magic. They mourn their maddened brethren, and they are sickened by the fact that the sick furbolgs still haunt the forests. Some warriors charge themselves with the tragic task of finding and destroying the feral furbolgs, lest they damage the forest or any travelers. These mad ones are no longer considered part of the furbolg clan, and the warriors feel great sorrow at the task of freeing them from their prisons of their maddened minds. Often a shaman will travel with the warriors to give a final, spiritual passage to the feral furbolgs.\nFaith.\nFurbolgs are tied to nature. Some accounts have them worshipping primitive godlike figures (they venerate the bear twins, &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;), but primarily they revere nature and the spirits of the world. The furbolg follow in the path of the long-dead ursine demi-gods Ursoc and Ursol, who fell in the War of the Ancients 10.000 years ago. The bear twins are the primary patrons of those who believe in a balance between nature and all living creatures. The furbolg are the most fervent followers of the twins in the present day, following in their magical tradition and carving their fortress, Timbermaw Hold, in the form of a gigantic, growling bear head. Timbermaw Hold is the shrine to the Ancients Ursoc and Ursol erected by the furbolgs requiring years and the labor of hundreds to construct. Furbolgs try to mimic the ales made by Ursoc. Furbolg shamans often bring &lt;a href=\"Amity%20wine\"&gt;Amity wine&lt;/a&gt; to peace talks and important discussions.\nFurbolg leaders are shaman or druids \u2014 which furbolgs usually also call shaman, making little distinction between the two practices. Furbolg priests are unheard of; only those who break far from furbolg society would follow the path of a deity or philosophy. &lt;a href=\"Ursa%20totemic\"&gt;Ursa totemic&lt;/a&gt;s follow the paths of the bear twins.\nAffiliation.\nIndependent. Furbolgs have long been friends of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and regard the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; with esteem. They are wary of all other races. The night elves have shared their forests with the furbolgs for generations, and appreciate their gentle respect for the flora. The tauren identify with the furbolgs' dedication to the Earth Mother and practice of divine magic. Their friendship with these two races makes them a unique, neutral bridge between the Alliance and the Horde. As they trust and admire both races, they cannot decide which group to join, so they choose neither, for now. Being neutral has its advantages, however, as they understand the night elves and the tauren well. This understanding has allowed some of the more ambitious (and intelligent) furbolgs to travel to Theramore or the Horde lands with a night elf delegation to mediate talks with Horde representatives, usually tauren. There are few furbolgs who can aid with diplomacy, however, because the furbolgs' most obvious weakness is their lower than normal intelligence.\nThe furbolgs are pretty chilly toward the other independent races. They don't appreciate the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s' capitalistic attitudes or their deforestation attempts. The &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; probably identify with the furbolgs the most, being spiritual beast-men themselves, but they are new comers to the continent and the furbolgs are not sure of their reasons for being here. Furbolgs have outright hatred for the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, as those arcane magic users are perversions of the night elves and threw their lot in with &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, an enemy of their allies. The &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; races pervert the furbolgs' forests and attack their allies, the night elves, so they are not trusted either.\nRegardless of their close affiliation with the night elves, the furbolgs are slightly uneasy around the other Alliance races. They worry about the introduction of so many new races to the continent of Kalimdor, especially since many of those new races are strong arcane magic users. They don't understand a lot of what happened during the war with the Scourge, but they do understand that it was arcane magic that brought them. With the Scourge thriving on &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and gathering forces in the north, the furbolgs are of the opinion that the less arcane magic used at this time, the better.\nIf pressed, the furbolgs would admit to feeling closer to the races of the Horde than the Alliance. The races of the Horde are closer to the earth than the arcane magic practitioners of many Alliance races. Their close friendship with the tauren allows the furbolgs to encounter orcs and trolls frequently on their visits to the tauren lands. They have exchanged shamanistic ideas and philosophies regarding the Earth Mother and her gifts, and the furbolgs genuinely enjoy the company of the Horde races. However, they still prefer their independent state.\nAppearance.\nFurbolgs resemble bears with a few humanoid characteristics \u2014 bipedal gait, dexterous hands, and the ability to speak. They dress in loose loincloths or togas when they wear anything at all. Fur color normally ranges from light brown to black, and white furbolgs from Northrend are called polar furbolgs. Fur color also denotes status in the tribe: shaman have gray fur, and black fur marks the most powerful furbolg fighters. Furbolgs are big and strong, averaging 7 to 10 feet in height and 3 feet in width. Many furbolgs continue to grow even after they reach maturity, adding layers of muscle. Furbolgs weigh 300 to 400 pounds on average, though some reach 500 pounds.\nLanguages.\nFurbolgs have their own language, &lt;a href=\"Furbolg%20%28language%29\"&gt;Ursine&lt;/a&gt;, and a few speak &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;. Furbolgs sometimes learn the languages of their friends and, occasionally, their enemies, including, Common, Low Common, and even Taur-ahe. Some furbolgs speak common and low common as primary languages.\nNames.\nFurbolg names tend to be simple and denote important characteristics of the individual.\nRegion.\nMost furbolg tribes live in isolated villages in Ashenvale Forest. A few live in other wilderness areas on Kalimdor. &lt;a href=\"Grizzlemaw\"&gt;Grizzlemaw&lt;/a&gt;, in the Grizzly Hills region in Northrend, is by some accounts the center of furbolg civilization. Furbolgs often place totems around their territory. &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; is the homeland of the furbolg, and they outnumber every other race there combined. In central Grizzly Hills the only known furbolg city, Grizzlemaw, hold but half their number, the rest are gathered in clans and scattered throughout the region. The furbolgs in Grizzlemaw are led by &lt;a href=\"Baergar%20Blackpaw\"&gt;Baergar Blackpaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration.\nFurbolgs origins were described by &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt; as: \"The initial idea was trying to spin a somewhat cool , some super-foresty badass furbolg kind of character, but make it hard. Back in the day we were playing tabletop role-playing games - was always the best. So we'd anthropomorphize. Animal characters and the s were always badass. In a way we were trying to fuse a bear and a wolverine into some kind of badass forest race. Once we got the furbolg, which became much more bear-like than the &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt;, I think ultimately in Northrend we wound up developing, so it just shook out a number of ways.\"\nFurbolgs are probably loosely based on the \"Fir Bolg\" of Irish mythology. The \"Fir Bolg\" were a pre-Celtic race who inhabited Ireland millennia ago; as with most such beings, it is unclear whether they were human, near-human, or something else entirely. The \"Fir Bolg\" were forced out of Ireland by the \"Tuatha de Danaan\", who are vaguely similar to elves.\nMore specifically, \"furbolg\" is likely a pun on \", a race of giants in the \" role-playing game that were inspired by the aforementioned \"Fir Bolg\"."}

{"id": "337780", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=337780", "title": "Furies", "text": "Furies is the name for all &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom try to keep the world in balance. Furies appear to be unique to Draenor. It may be something about the primal nature of the planet. After the destruction of Draenor, many furies disappeared, but they are still plentiful on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. There, the elements live in purity upon the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plateau%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Elemental Plateau&lt;/a&gt;. This purity is maintained through the Cycle of Rebirth. Impurities are accumulated in the elemental body over time, and when enough contamination has taken place, an elemental will become unstable and in some cases volatile. When the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plateau%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Elemental Plateau&lt;/a&gt; becomes unstable, the cycle of rebirth must begin. A part of the rebirth is pure, living essence which can be found atop the Elemental Plateau, as well as in the body of an elemental spirit.\nWhen the Elemental Plateau grows unstable, such as when the &lt;a href=\"Gordawg%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Gordawg&lt;/a&gt; was captured and enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the elemental spirits begin to devolve and mutate into &lt;a href=\"elemental%20conglomerate\"&gt;elemental conglomerate&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"slag%20elemental\"&gt;slag elemental&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe furies at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; are extremely powerful elementals, but they are no more all that it is to be earth, or water, than a handful of soil or a drop of water is all that it is to be earth or water. It is a complex idea.\nThere are many similarities between the elemental spirits of Draenor and their counterparts on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but also many differences that &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; will be forced to adapt to. Whereas the elements of Azeroth are in constant conflict, the elements of Draenor strive for balance within themselves. This is especially evident in the Throne of Elements in Nagrand, where the greatest elemental furies of Draenor have convened peacefully since the dawn of the world. Be warned, however: if the chaos of war on Draenor throws the elements out of balance, they may lash out at each other... and anyone caught between them.\n&lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmiths&lt;/a&gt; know that furies can be harvested for the best flux.\nHistory.\nBurning Crusade.\nDespite the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, some furies remain in Outland. Many are found in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Four powerful furies representing the four elements are located at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; placed members there to make certain the furies wouldn't be bothered by trivialities; that only those in need of their wisdom or sincere in offering aid could speak with them. But this was just a courtesy, as the furies are imposing and can handle themselves.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, the members of the Earthen Ring collaborate with the Furies of Outland to bring peace to the restless &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spirits of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Lo%27ap\"&gt;Elementalist Lo'ap&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Watoosun%20of%20the%20Water\"&gt;Watoosun of the Water&lt;/a&gt;, instructs &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill the destructive &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Spirit\"&gt;Lake Spirit&lt;/a&gt;s nearby and aids them with securing &lt;a href=\"Incineratus\"&gt;Incineratus&lt;/a&gt;' blessing. With the fiery essence of Incineratus himself granted to the adventurers, Lo'ap tasked his agents to set fire to &lt;a href=\"Windyreed%20Village\"&gt;Windyreed Village&lt;/a&gt;, whose inhabitants had agitated the water spirits in their efforts to create a marshland in Nagrand. Meanwhile, Watoosun cleansed the water spirits of their corruption; but in doing so, created a twisted spirit essence. Lo'ap sent adventurers to purge &lt;a href=\"Watoosun%27s%20Polluted%20Essence\"&gt;Watoosun's Polluted Essence&lt;/a&gt; and its offspring, the &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Surger\"&gt;Lake Surger&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Gordawg\"&gt;Gordawg&lt;/a&gt; also directs adventurers to kill tainted &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and destroying the one responsible for their corruption: &lt;a href=\"Gurok%20the%20Usurper\"&gt;Gurok the Usurper&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Elementalist%20Morgh\"&gt;Elementalist Morgh&lt;/a&gt; also sent adventurers to slay &lt;a href=\"Murkblood%20Putrifier\"&gt;Murkblood Putrifier&lt;/a&gt;s, who have been using &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism to control air spirits.\nThe furies in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; were corrupted or enraged when &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; shattered the land and severed the orcs' ties with the elements. The Earthen Ring captured the souls of furies in order to commune with them and find a way to heal the land. They revealed that &lt;a href=\"Cyrukh%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Cyrukh the Firelord&lt;/a&gt; was awakened and driven insane by the shattering, throwing the elements into turmoil. In order to redeem the elements, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s reconstructed Gul'dan's &lt;a href=\"The%20Cipher%20of%20Damnation\"&gt;Cipher of Damnation&lt;/a&gt; to summon Cyrukh and defeat him.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\n&lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; brought &lt;a href=\"Go%27el\"&gt;Go'el&lt;/a&gt; to meet the four furies at the Throne of the Elements. He asked them to help him understand what was &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;causing&lt;/a&gt; Azeroth's elemental spirits to suffer. &lt;a href=\"Kalandrios\"&gt;Kalandrios&lt;/a&gt; was uninterested in the plight of Air in a foreign world while his own essences suffered in Outland. &lt;a href=\"Incineratus\"&gt;Incineratus&lt;/a&gt; was also more troubled by the plight of his own, but still regretted being unable to help Go'el without some essence of Azeroth's Fire. He instead gifted Go'el with the fire of passion to do what was needed. &lt;a href=\"Aborius\"&gt;Aborius&lt;/a&gt; wished that he could help Go'el or impart a gift like Incineratus, but was only able to show compassion and provide words of encouragement. &lt;a href=\"Gordawg\"&gt;Gordawg&lt;/a&gt; also couldn't provide insight into Azeroth's spirits until Go'el presented a stone from Azeroth. Gordawg ate the stone and experienced its fear of being broken and shattered, likening it to the fear he tasted right before Draenor was destroyed.\nAlternate timeline.\nDuring a ritual, heard the cry of &lt;a href=\"Exurotus\"&gt;a fury&lt;/a&gt;. Beaten, half consumed, and shattered by ancient magics, the fury was the prisoner of the &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kron\"&gt;Kron, the Flame Breaker&lt;/a&gt;. It had been fragmented, its pieces scattered on the wind or consumed by scavengers. In order to free the fury, Drek'thar became one with Exurotus, and started on the path of becoming this world's greatest &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn earth fury, &lt;a href=\"Kronus\"&gt;Kronus&lt;/a&gt;, is later empowered by Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Atomik\"&gt;Atomik&lt;/a&gt; in order to assist the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in battle in &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Gordawg%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Gordawg&lt;/a&gt; and a large number of furies were captured by the &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s and enslaved. The plateau grew unstable, causing the elemental spirits there to devolve and mutate. Its imbalance created &lt;a href=\"Magmire\"&gt;Magmire&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"slag%20elemental\"&gt;slag elemental&lt;/a&gt; who was both fire and earth elemental. So long as Gordawg was absent from the throne, the imbalance in the elements would worsen. &lt;a href=\"Incineratus%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Incineratus&lt;/a&gt; tried to maintain the balance on the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plateau%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Elemental Plateau&lt;/a&gt; in slaying the corrupted Guardians of the Plateau while &lt;a href=\"Kalandrios%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Kalandrios&lt;/a&gt; ordered the death of the now-corrupted Gordawg.\nOn Azeroth.\nElemental furies also exist in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They mostly amass in the areas around &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;. Crystal furies are used by the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Seafury%20Elemental\"&gt;Water furies&lt;/a&gt; also appear.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Fury\"&gt;Azerite furies&lt;/a&gt; began to appear."}

He is a powerful spellcaster in his own right and has extensive knowledge of the Burning Blade operations. This knowledge earned him his current position in Desolace, as he was appointed by &lt;a href=\"Keldran\"&gt;Keldran&lt;/a&gt; to hamper the Burning Blade effort and eventually eliminate the cult from the region. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; drew on his expertise to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Slitherblade\"&gt;Slitherblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; that invaded the coast.\nSpeculation.\nMaurin Bonesplitter is specifically responsible for the use of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Gem\"&gt;Burning Gem&lt;/a&gt;s to trap the souls of Burning Blade cultists. It has been argued, however, that the cruel nature of Burning Gems was probably justified as it clearly demonstrated to all other races that the Horde would never show any sympathy or remorse to those worshipping the Burning Legion, thus proving that there were no ties between the Horde and the Burning Blade. From this point of view, it can be argued that Maurin Bonesplitter's mission was a success, although there is clearly still a need for a more permanent solution of the Burning Blade issue. Despite the malicious nature of the Burning Gems, their use, while successful, was most probably intended as a purely punitive measure, as its impact on the overall composition and effort of the Burning Blade in Desolace was highly marginal, casting doubts on the competence of Maurin Bonesplitter or possibly even on his allegiance. In fact, many have remarked that Maurin's deference to the Warchief and the Horde are exaggerated enough to possibly warrant an investigation into his true motives and loyalties."}

Mavis spawns by the northernmost dock on the pier of Lion's Landing. Mavis hits hard and fast for a world mob and has several lethal abilities. Bringing friends is advised although she is possible to kill solo.\nTactics.\nMavis is found near several alliance mobs, including some that patrol; it is usually advisable either to kill these mobs beforehand, or pull her away to an emptier area. However, Mavis does not require much room to fight. Perhaps the simplest option is to kite Mavis into the water, although this can make evading her Shank ability somewhat harder.\nMavis deals melee damage and is difficult to kite, due to Mortal Throw. This ability deals very large amounts of damage, but can be avoided entirely by remaining within 15 yards of Mavis at all times. Every so often Mavis will use Shank, stunning her target for 3 seconds. This can be avoided by moving away from her when she casts it, although she will probably attempt to cast it again fairly soon. However, since Mavis relies on melee auto-attacks to deal damage, avoiding Shank is mostly only a concern in terms of the time that is wasted while stunned; sufficiently powerful players can easily defeat Mavis without worrying about this ability. Mavis' final ability, Shadowblink, will cause her to teleport randomly a short distance from her current location. Since she relies on being within melee range to deal damage, this usually only has the effect of interrupting her melee attacks. The main risk of this ability is the possibility that she will immediately follow it with Mortal Throw; however, this appears only to happen when the player is moving away from her position, or sometimes when she is being snared."}

This horrific place houses the most vile and irredeemable &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s in existence. Ruled by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw inspires nightmares and legends even among the denizens of the Shadowlands. No one has ever escaped this vile place, and any foolish enough to venture here are never heard from again. At its center lies &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;, a cursed otherworldly prison where the most wicked souls in the universe are locked away. In recent years, the machinery of &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; has been broken, and \"all\" souls who enter the Shadowlands are now condemned to torment in the Maw, no matter their deeds in life. This has caused the Maw to begin growing larger and more powerful while the rest of the Shadowlands wither from a lack of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw is antithetical to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Maw is a max-level zone designed for exploration and (somewhat) open-ended play, without settlements or &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;s to let players catch their breath.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%209.1\"&gt;Patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt; added new areas to the Maw with &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Helgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nIn the deepest depths of the Shadowlands lies the inescapable Maw. The wretched souls imprisoned in this hopeless realm are the unforgiven and irredeemable. They are imprisoned forever and suffer without end, until they are twisted into a mere shade of their former glory. It is then that the tormented willingly serve their tormentor.\nNormally, few souls are sent directly here, as even the most evil and prideful beings in existence are given a last chance to atone for their sins in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. If they fail or refuse to seek redemption, they are condemned to an eternity in the Maw. Still, few souls that the Arbiter found completely irredeemable would be sent directly to the Maw.\nThe landmass within the Maw consists of pieces of land that have been ripped from a realm that was destroyed upon entering the Maw's atmosphere and whose pieces have become burned and desiccated. &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;The Jailer&lt;/a&gt; pieced these together into a single landmass by throwing out chains in every direction within the Maw from Torghast and pulling them inwards. The Maw was sealed and made inescapable with the magic of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;, with the goal of banishing The Jailer forever.\nAs the Jailer's dwelling, the Maw is a tumultuous, hopeless maze of torment chambers and endless despair. The laws that bind the Shadowlands are meaningless within the Jailer's realm. Reality is ever-changing within the Maw, which is continually altering itself to the whims of its singular master who resides in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe eye of &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; had been brought to the Maw by &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; long ago.\nRecent history.\nAround the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the machine of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; was broken, causing all souls who enter the Shadowlands to pour directly into the Maw as part of the . As a result, the Maw grows larger and more powerful while other parts of the Shadowlands have become deprived of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; and have started withering. During this time, Mueh'zala brought &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to the Jailer's side.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; has been working with the Jailer since her attempted suicide at &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; and has been perpetrating acts to bring about great amounts of death in the world of the living. As she has fed the Maw with new souls, both she and the Jailer have grown more powerful.\nThanks to their intimate connection to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth's world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s are able to &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;escape the Maw&lt;/a&gt; and further explore the Shadowlands, though some of their allies were left behind.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; jumped into the Maw by herself, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; received visions of Tyrande in the Maw, including specific locations within the Maw of where she'd be able to find her.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the Jailer uses massive chains to drag &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; into the Maw. With the power of the new Korthian &lt;a href=\"Waystone%20to%20Oribos\"&gt;Waystone to Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, covenant forces are able to come and go as they please (instead of piggy-backing alongside the Maw Walker's anima) and start their own assaults on the Maw.\nAt the end of the expansion it is made clear by the new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; that no soul will be sent to the Maw ever again and that all will receive a judgment of redemption.\nGetting there.\nPlayers enter the Maw by jumping into the &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Pillar\"&gt;Soul Pillar&lt;/a&gt; from the second layer of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;.\nGameplay mechanics.\nThe Maw is not a typical zone, and it has some unique mechanics to encourage players to drop by, gain some currencies by doing activities, and then leave. To start, players can at first not mount up in the Maw, and will travel on foot in general to most locations. However, you can unlock the ability to use a mount in the Maw by doing the &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; questline.\nThe three currencies.\nThe overall objective of the Maw is to gain &lt;a href=\"%23Stygia\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt; and the reputation to use it with &lt;a href=\"%23Ve%27nari%20and%20her%20refuge\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;, but balanced against drawing &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, the covenants would really like some more &lt;a href=\"%23Souls\"&gt;freed souls&lt;/a&gt; to power their way of life once a week.\nNearly everything in the zone affects some or all of the \"currencies\". Looting generic mobs will award a granule or two of Stygia. Freeing lost souls for &lt;a href=\"Return%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;the weekly covenant quest&lt;/a&gt; will award much more Stygia, but also advance the Eye of the Jailer progress. Rares and events will award more stygia, advance the Eye progress, and award reputation with Ve'nari. Completing quest objectives will advance Eye threat at that moment, while turning in will award the reputation and Stygia.\nTo direct players' efforts, there are several high-level activities that players are encouraged to complete daily and weekly:\nThe Eye of the Jailer.\nTo keep players from grinding Ve'nari reputation and &lt;a href=\"%23Stygia\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt; all day, the daily &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; comes into play until the launch of &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;. This mechanic gently encourages players to not idle in the zone and, after a while, less-than-gently encourages players to leave the zone as more advanced threats are unleashed. Eventually, the Jailer will have had enough and starts rapidly eroding the player's life force, killing the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; outright.\nThe Eye of the Jailer threat level resets daily, alongside daily quests.\nAt tier three and above, the Jailer will send &lt;a href=\"Assassin%20%28Maw%29\"&gt;Assasins&lt;/a&gt; to harry the player as they enter combat. Defeat it to survive. Defeat 100 to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Who%20Sent%20You%3F\"&gt;Who Sent You?&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt tier four, with no warning at all, a &lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Abductor\"&gt;Stygian Abductor&lt;/a&gt; will snag the player from the ground and fly up high, winding up a long cast that will likely throw them off the edge of the zone.\nAt tier five, players lose 10% incoming healing every 20 seconds. Once all incoming healing is gone, players lose 3% of their max health every tick. Thus, once players hit the maximum for the day, they have 200 seconds (3 minutes, 20 seconds) to exit the Maw or make it to Ve'nari's Refuge.\nDuring this tier, players are ineligible to loot any additional Stygia or gain reputation with Ve'nari. However, should they desire to run Torghast, they have enough time between landing in the Maw and running down hill to the refuge to make it to her Torghast portal.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;, players will permanently fend off the Eye (so it can become a boss in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;) during the quest &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Focusing the Eye&lt;/a&gt;. Once that quest is complete, the Eye mechanic is removed for that player, allowing them to stay in the Maw indefinitely.\nVe'nari and her refuge.\nOn the southeastern part of the mainland is &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Ve'nari's Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, home to the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;. At the refuge, players are immune to the Eye of the Jailer, have easy access to Torghast, and slowly build out a portal network to other points in the zone. Ve'nari trades in &lt;a href=\"%23Stygia\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt;, acquired from various sources in the Maw.\nHowever, Ve'nari is not a trusting character, and the Maw Walker will need to gain standing with her over time to purchase more of her wares. Such standing comes from completing her daily and weekly quests, killing notable foes, and taking part in other events in the zone. Additionally, two subzones, Perdition Hold and the Beastwarrens, are gated behind her reputation standing, and will award the achievements &lt;a href=\"Prepare%20for%20Trouble%21\"&gt;Prepare for Trouble!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Make%20it%20Double%21\"&gt;Make it Double!&lt;/a&gt; when unlocked.\nStygia.\nCompleting objectives in the Maw (freeing souls, daily quests, bonus objectives, etc...) will award some &lt;a href=\"Stygia\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt;. Ve'nari will trade the player's gathered Stygia for various upgrades, like a portal network, or quality-of-life improvements in Torghast, like the ability to always see at least two &lt;a href=\"Anima%20power\"&gt;Anima power&lt;/a&gt; choices when interacting with Anima hoards.\nShould players die in the Maw, they will drop roughly 20% their Stygia, but they can loot their corpse to recover it. Players respawn instantly at a graveyard with the &lt;a href=\"Edict%20of%20the%20Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Edict of the Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; buff and will need to run back to their corpse while alive. However, if players die again before looting their first corpse, the Stygia on that corpse will be lost permanently. Should players fall off the edge of the Maw, the lost Stygia is gone permanently.\nUse stygia to unlock permanent rewards and earn the achievements &lt;a href=\"To%20%27Ghast%2C%20Two%20Curios\"&gt;To 'Ghast, Two Curios&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%27Ghast%20Five\"&gt;'Ghast Five&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouls.\nOccasionally, players will find &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Cage\"&gt;Soul Cage&lt;/a&gt;s in the zone. Free the &lt;a href=\"Caged%20Soul\"&gt;Caged Soul&lt;/a&gt; inside to gain progress on the weekly quest &lt;a href=\"Return%20Lost%20Souls\"&gt;Return Lost Souls&lt;/a&gt;, which requires saving between five and twenty, but players will advance their progress on the Eye of the Jailer. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Soul%20%28Maw%29\"&gt;Wailing Souls&lt;/a&gt; serve the same purpose.\nFree 200 (over the course of several months!) to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Soulkeeper%27s%20Burden\"&gt;Soulkeeper's Burden&lt;/a&gt;.\nRares and events.\nThe minimap keeps track of both rare mobs (marked with a star), and Maw events (marked with a skull). Events respawn quickly (roughly every 5 minutes), while rares can take hours.\nKilling rares or marked events will award a decent amount of &lt;a href=\"Stygia\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt;, advance the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; and award some standing with &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;. The rares are also tracked in achievements &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20About%20Sending%20a%20Message\"&gt;It's About Sending a Message&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Better%20to%20Be%20Lucky%20Than%20Dead\"&gt;Better to Be Lucky Than Dead&lt;/a&gt;.\nChaotic Riftstones and Animaflow Teleporter.\nOnce unlocked with &lt;a href=\"Encased%20Riftwalker%20Essence\"&gt;Encased Riftwalker Essence&lt;/a&gt;, purchased from Ve'nari with Stygia, players can use &lt;a href=\"Chaotic%20Riftstone\"&gt;Chaotic Riftstone&lt;/a&gt;s to more quickly get around the Maw. Each Riftstone will send the player to it's pair.\nAdditionally, players can unlock the &lt;a href=\"Animaflow%20Teleporter\"&gt;Animaflow Teleporter&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Animaflow%20Stabilizer\"&gt;Animaflow Stabilizer&lt;/a&gt;, which provides one-way trips to the Tremaculum and the Beastwarrens:\nCovenant assaults.\nAfter completing &lt;a href=\"Good%20News%2C%20Everyone%21\"&gt;Good News, Everyone!&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, covenant assaults unlock. Twice a week, one of the four covenants will take charge on an assault of one of the hubs in the Maw:\nThe assaults are a great source of reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Advance\"&gt;Death's Advance&lt;/a&gt; and the covenant factions taking part in the assault, and have a number of achievements associated with them, including:\nAdditionally, assaults will award an &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Renown\"&gt;Emblem of Renown&lt;/a&gt; for players who are catching up.\nTormentors of Torghast.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%209.1\"&gt;patch 9.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; sends out one of the &lt;a href=\"Tormentors%20of%20Torghast\"&gt;Tormentors of Torghast&lt;/a&gt; to attack an area in the Maw. Take out the minions and lieutenants to fill the bar, then defeat the Tormentor of Torghast for 10% progress in &lt;a href=\"Shaping%20Fate\"&gt;Shaping Fate&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tormentor%27s%20Cache\"&gt;Tormentor's Cache&lt;/a&gt;, and likely an item drop or two.\nOnce a week, players can complete the &lt;a href=\"Phantasmagoria\"&gt;Phantasmagoria&lt;/a&gt; quest, which starts from the &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Phantasma\"&gt;Warped Phantasma&lt;/a&gt; found inside the Tormentor's Cache.\nDefeat all of the bosses to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Minions%20of%20the%20Cold%20Dark\"&gt;Minions of the Cold Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nPlayers visit the Maw a few times during the level-up campaign, then at max level have access to a few storylines regarding &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20intro%20experience\"&gt;Shadowlands intro experience&lt;/a&gt;, players crash-land in the Maw, fight their way through new enemies, catch up with the kidnapped leaders, and then activate the &lt;a href=\"Eroded%20Waystone\"&gt;Eroded Waystone&lt;/a&gt; and leave the leaders behind.\nLate in the &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus%20storyline\"&gt;Maldraxxus storyline&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walker is tasked to return to the Maw to retrieve a Baron of Maldraxxus.\nNear the end of the &lt;a href=\"Revendreth%20storyline\"&gt;Revendreth storyline&lt;/a&gt;, players are asked to return to the Maw again to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;, which ends up sending players into Torghast for the first time.\nAt max level, midway through the first chapter of their covenant campaign, players are sent to the Maw to recover souls to power their covenant sanctum. While working on Ve'nari's tasks, adventurers see Baine get captured and sent to Torghast!\nAfter completing the first chapter of the covenant campaign, Bolvar Fordrgaon asks players to return to Torghast to save Baine. In the process, they will recover a key that leads to the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt;, crafter of artifacts (and legendaries).\nAfter freeing Baine, the rest of the Ve'nari storyline plays out -- which is gated behind her reputation.\nCollectables.\nA great number of mounts, pets, and toys can be acquired from completing tasks in the Maw.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Other mortals and Shadowlands denizens can temporarily attune themselves to a Maw Walker's &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; to also gain access to the waystone. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; can attune their teleportation spell to a Maw Walker in order to teleport out of the Maw. Through the use of an ancient spell, &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator%20%28venthyr%29\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt; was able to use a Maw Walker as a conduit to travel back along the same path they used to get into the Maw.

There are canonically multiple such heroes, but prophecies from &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; also foretell of a single true Maw Walker, connected to a unique world-soul, who will be able to save Korthia from disaster. The city's &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s have a duty to aid this Maw Walker by empowering their &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. The prophecies also state that the Maw Walker would have need of the dormant waystone in &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;, and that this stone will prove crucial to the fate of the Shadowlands."}

He is summoned by using an &lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Buoy\"&gt;Arcanite Buoy&lt;/a&gt; at the Swirling Maelstrom, which is an enormous patch of floating wreckage off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nFor a &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; on quest chain, this fight should not be a challenge and can be done with as few as 15 members. Maws is a straightforward boss fight in the waters of Azshara. There is no need to submerge during this encounter, so &lt;a href=\"Water%20Breathing\"&gt;Water Breathing&lt;/a&gt; is not necessary. Maws will hit the &lt;a href=\"MT\"&gt;MT&lt;/a&gt; pretty hard and somewhat sporadically so you need a fair amount of healers on him. Maws will &lt;a href=\"Frenzy%20%28Power%29\"&gt;frenzy&lt;/a&gt;, so it is important that your &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s use a &lt;a href=\"Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;Tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt; when this occurs. Maws enrages every 25 seconds, and every 15 seconds when his health reaches 20%. When Maws is below 20%, he will occasionally &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; for 2000-3000 damage every 15 seconds. &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; should be able to keep all raid members up due to the long interval between AoE ticks. Make sure the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s/&lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s step up the healing on the MT while the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s are group healing.\nTrivia.\nMaws is named after the huge shark, , in the movies of the same name.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They bring pain and punishment to the most wicked of &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. These soldiers are the very worst the damned have to offer: the result of the Jailer torturing mortal souls until only a mere shade of their former glory remains and they willingly serve their tormentor for eternity, all begin as empty suits of armor forged at &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%27s%20Cauldron\"&gt;Zovaal's Cauldron&lt;/a&gt;, and then are infused with a decrepit &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt; to be brought to \"life\".\nThe size of the Mawsworn army rivals that of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and with the soul-river overflowing, their ranks continue to swell. The Mawsworn's weapons and armor were designed by the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver\"&gt;Runecarver&lt;/a&gt; against his will.\nBackground.\nIn the deepest depths of the Shadowlands lies the inescapable Maw. The wretched souls imprisoned in this hopeless realm are the unforgiven and irredeemable. They are imprisoned forever and suffer without end, until they are twisted into a mere shade of their former glory. It is then that the tormented willingly serve their tormentor as the Mawsworn.\nAfter she committed suicide at &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the soul of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the Maw and tortured by the Mawsworn until Zovaal intervened and revealed himself to her. Years later, when Zovaal instructed Sylvanas to start unleashing death and destruction on Azeroth, she complied and used her position as warchief to plunge Azeroth into the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, causing mass casualties and thereby feeding the Maw with even more new souls that could be conscripted into the Mawsworn army.\nWith the role of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; having been ended by Sylvanas, the Mawsworn sent &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt; to bring the message of the Jailer, and to embolden both the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. To aid their offensive into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Soulbearer\"&gt;Mawsworn Soulbearer&lt;/a&gt;s raised fallen Scourge champions &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;from the past&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, a group of them captured &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and took them to the Maw. The Mawsworn also attempted to capture &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, but she slew her attackers. During the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;resurgence&lt;/a&gt; of the Scourge, both factions were supported by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; which led the offensive against them, and enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; champions to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Seeking to strike a definite blow against the Mawsworn, Azeroth's heroes confronted and killed Herald Dalora in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the heroes of Azeroth entered the Shadowlands, the death knights of the Ebon Blade who accompanied them were scattered, and their forces were already depleted after only mere moments there, losing a large number of their troops during their advance against the Mawsworn forces. After the adventurers saved the leader, they began charging a &lt;a href=\"waystone\"&gt;waystone&lt;/a&gt; to leave the Maw, an effort that was noticed by the Jailer and prompted him to send his Mawsworn armies to stop them. When the party was about to be overwhelmed, Anduin called down a barrier of holy magic which held off the Mawsworn long enough for the champions to escape to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to claim the sigil of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;, the Jailer sent his Mawsworn\u2014led by Sylvanas herself\u2014to invade &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;. The covenants ultimately pushed the Mawsworn out of Ardenweald, but the dominated Anduin managed to breach the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt; and steal the Winter Queen's sigil. Meanwhile, the Jailer's forces assaulted &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to claim yet another sigil, that of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, but the covenants and the Knights of the Ebon Blade managed to hold off the attackers. After successfully claiming four of the five sigils, Zovaal began enacting his plan to escape the Maw, and Sylvanas personally commanded the Mawsworn defenses against the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s who attempted to breach the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Zovaal entered in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, his Mawsworn quickly spread across the realm like a plague in search of a way into the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The Mawsworn initially laid siege to the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; village of &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;, but the Jailer personally arrived to call off the attack since he believed that the place was of no consequence. They later used &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; to take control of &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt;, the realm's caretakers, and destroy the obelisks protecting the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the death of Zovaal at the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, the Mawsworn remains active but leaderless, as Sylvanas confront them during her penance to free all souls of the Maw.\nType of forces.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; were emboldened by the message of the Jailer brought by &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;."}

Driven by the voice in his head, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and climbed the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; to offer his soul to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow a necromancer of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad returned to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and founded in secret the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, recruiting cultists among the nobility and the lower classes of the kingdoms with promises of immortality. Years later, he became one of the principal agents of the Lich King responsible for spreading the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in his death at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; and Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. When Arthas became a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; and started the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he resurrected Kel'Thuzad as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; with the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, so he could summon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing Arthas's departure for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and his ascension as the new Lich King, Kel'Thuzad was left to command the Scourge in Lordaeron from the floating necropolis of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. After making a deal with the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, he trapped the &lt;a href=\"Highlord\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and recovered his body to make him the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; and his champion, before replacing him by his son &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; after the first battle for &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. For years he held control of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and fought against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, until his first defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWith the help of a &lt;a href=\"Inigo%20Montoy\"&gt;traitor&lt;/a&gt; among the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad managed to resurrect and recover his phylactery. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, he moved to Northrend with his necropolis to serve the Dark Lord of the Scourge, until he was once again defeated at the hands of the champions of Azeroth.\nIn death, Kel'Thuzad entered the afterlife of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; where he was approached by &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; and soon rose to a position of power within the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;, a position he used to plunge Maldraxxus into chaos in order to further the efforts of his new master, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, across the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. After his machinations were revealed, the archlich escaped to his master's side in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, where he was destroyed for good in a final confrontation with Azeroth's heroes.\nKel'Thuzad is one of the most iconic antagonists in the \"Warcraft\" franchise. He first appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" as a hero in the undead campaigns. He appeared in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" as the final encounter of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, implemented in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt; and retuned in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0\"&gt;patch 3.0&lt;/a&gt;, and returned as a secondary antagonist in '. He also makes appearances in &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Plains%20of%20Nasam\"&gt;Plains of Nasam&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad appears as a central character in the \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" sets ' and \"\", and he is a playable character in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBiography.\nThe Kirin Tor.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad was a member of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt;, the high council of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the masters of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Of the Kirin Tor's leaders, Kel'Thuzad was the most eager to gain access to the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Library\"&gt;Guardian's Library&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the depository of knowledge hoarded by &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; in his tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; - and thus he was most upset when the library was lost. After Medivh's death, Kel'Thuzad and the other senior members of the Kirin Tor questioned Medivh's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, about what happened; Kel'Thuzad seemed particularly interested in discovering more about the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Order of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, which \u2014 as he pointed out to &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the Kirin Tor \u2014 was relevant when discussing Medivh.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was in her third year of apprenticeship, Antonidas introduced her to Kel'Thuzad, who at the time was said to be one of the finest mages in the Kirin Tor. Kel'Thuzad's magics made her nauseous, and that was before he even caught interest in the dark arts.\nKel'Thuzad witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during their raid on Dalaran before the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and became even more interested in &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; after seeing what its power was capable of.\nCall of the Lich King.\nA handful of powerful individuals, scattered across the world, heard the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s mental summons from &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad was the most notable of them, and the first to answer the Lich King\u2019s call. Long considering him above the scriptures of his peers, Kel'Thuzad had been considered a maverick for years due to his insistence on studying the forbidden arts of necromancy. Driven to learn all he could of the magical world and its shadowy wonders, he was frustrated by what he saw as his peers' outmoded and unimaginative precepts. Upon hearing the powerful summons from Northrend, the archmage bent all of his considerable will to communing with the mysterious voice. Convinced that the Kirin Tor was too squeamish to seize the power and knowledge inherent in the dark arts, he vowed to learn what he could from the immensely powerful being named the Lich King.\nApproximately five years before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; learned that Kel'Thuzad had been experimenting with necromancy by reanimating dead rats. Fearing for the safety and reputation of Dalaran, Antonidas had Kel'Thuzad's properties searched, and all items tainted by dark magic were confiscated and destroyed. Antonidas warned Kel'Thuzad that he would be stripped of his rank and holdings, and exiled from both Dalaran and Lordaeron, if he did not abandon his \"madness\". Leaving behind his fortune and prestigious political standing, Kel'Thuzad abandoned the ways of the Kirin Tor and left Dalaran forever. Prodded by the Lich King's persistent voice in his mind, he sold his vast holdings and stored away his fortunes. Traveling alone over many leagues of both land and sea, he finally reached the frozen shores of Northrend. Intent on reaching Icecrown and offering his services to the Lich King, the archmage passed through the ravaged, war-torn ruins of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad saw firsthand the scope and ferocity of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s power. He began to believe that allying himself with the mysterious Lich King would not only be wise, but potentially fruitful.\nKel'Thuzad met with &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, who told him of all the power he could wield. Frightened by the horrors that he saw in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad teleported out and tried to escape. Unfortunately, he was surrounded by &lt;a href=\"wraith\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt;s and was brought back inside.\nAfter long months of trekking through the harsh arctic wastelands, Kel'Thuzad finally reached the dark glacier of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. He boldly approached Ner'zhul's dark citadel and was shocked when the silent undead guardsmen let him pass as though he was expected. Kel'Thuzad descended deep into the cold earth and found his way down to the bottom of the glacier. Within the endless cavern of ice and shadows, he prostrated himself before the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and offered his soul to the dark lord of the dead. The Lich King was pleased with his latest conscript. He promised Kel'Thuzad immortality and great power in exchange for his loyalty and obedience. Kel'Thuzad, eager for dark knowledge and power, accepted his first great mission: to go into the world of men and found a new religion that would worship the Lich King as a god.\nTo help the &lt;a href=\"archmage\"&gt;archmage&lt;/a&gt; accomplish his mission, Ner'zhul left Kel'Thuzad's humanity intact. The aged, yet still charismatic wizard was charged with using his powers of illusion and persuasion to lull the downtrodden, disenfranchised masses of Lordaeron into his confidence. Once he had their attention, he would offer them a new vision of what society could be \u2014 and a new figurehead to call their king.\nCult of the Damned.\nKel'Thuzad returned to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in disguise and in the floating dread citadel &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, and over the span of three years, he used his fortune and intellect to gather a clandestine brotherhood of like-minded men and women. The brotherhood, which he called the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, promised its acolytes social equality and eternal life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their service and obedience to Ner'zhul. As the months passed, Kel'Thuzad found many eager volunteers for his new cult amongst the tired, overburdened laborers of Lordaeron. Surprisingly, Kel'Thuzad's goal to pervert the citizens' faith in the Holy Light towards belief in Ner'zhul's dark shadow was easily attained. As the Cult of the Damned grew in size and influence, Kel'Thuzad made sure to keep its workings secret from the authorities of Lordaeron at every turn.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"Barov\"&gt;Barov&lt;/a&gt; family and some of his cultists moved into the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad also convinced his friend &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; to join the cult.\nWith Kel'Thuzad's success in Lordaeron, the Lich King made the final preparations for his assault against human civilization. Placing his plague energies into a number of portable artifacts called &lt;a href=\"plague%20cauldron\"&gt;plague cauldron&lt;/a&gt;s, Ner'zhul ordered Kel'Thuzad to transport the cauldrons to Lordaeron where they would be hidden within various cult-controlled villages. The cauldrons, protected by the loyal cultists, would then act as plague generators by sending the plague seeping out across the unsuspecting farmlands and cities of northern Lordaeron.\nThe Lich King's plan worked perfectly. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves. The cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 for soon, it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron and scour humanity from the face of the world.\nScourge of Lordaeron.\nKel'Thuzad, upon the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s instruction, oversaw the infection of the small town of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; where he was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. From there he quickly fled and they followed him back to &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, where he told Arthas of &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Enraged, Arthas hunted Kel'Thuzad down and killed him, but not before Kel'Thuzad told him his death would mean little. But they were not finished yet. \nAfter Arthas had traveled to Northrend, and slain Mal'Ganis with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, he returned to Lordaeron and betrayed his kingdom and became a servant of the Lich King. Kel'Thuzad began to appear to him as a ghostly apparition after his protector, &lt;a href=\"Gavinrad%20the%20Dire\"&gt;Gavinrad the Dire&lt;/a&gt;, was slain by Arthas and Kel'Thuzad's remains were reclaimed. He appeared only to Arthas, and told him that he was not to trust the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s, explaining to Arthas that they were the Lich King's jailors, and promised to explain all of the Lich King's plans to Arthas once he walked the earth again in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nKel'Thuzad watched over Arthas as he made the slow procession to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; against the stratagems of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Arthas ravaged his way through the two Elfgates and finally laid siege to Silvermoon itself, breaching through to the fabled &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas placed Kel'Thuzad's remains within the well, and with the help of &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad was reborn into the terrifying form of a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs they traveled to Alterac, Kel'Thuzad explained that the Scourge was merely the harbinger of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and that he would summon the first of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; warlock &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; to the mortal world. After slaying the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s guarding the Demon Gate, Kel'Thuzad communed with the dark lord who told him that he must go to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and steal the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Arthas led the attack on Dalaran and killed &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt;, the book was retrieved and Kel'Thuzad began the lengthy summoning process, with Arthas defending him from the many attacks of Dalaran and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. When all was complete, Archimonde stepped through the portal and was free to act according to his plans. His first act was to promote &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; to the leader of the Scourge, rendering Arthas and Kel'Thuzad of little use. However, Kel'Thuzad was confident in the Lich King's grand design and disappeared amidst the chaos of Dalaran's destruction. He told Arthas the final part of the Lich King's plan, then teleported him to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nKel'Thuzad resurfaced as the Legion raked across the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and in the aftermath of the invasion, he remained in the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; as one of the Lich King's lieutenants. Arthas had gone to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; on Ner'zhul's command to find the rogue &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, leaving only Kel'Thuzad and the &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; remaining in his stead. However, both knew that the Legion was defeated long before the dreadlords who remained in Lordaeron did.\nArthas returned in a fury and chased the dreadlords out of the capital, and Kel'Thuzad was relieved to see him. With the Legion's generals gone, they turned to the human villages who were escaping to the mountain passes. Kel'Thuzad thought that perhaps they would be a fitting sacrifice to the Lich King and led his necromancers into battle against the paladin &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt; and his men protecting the human refugees. But as they cut a swath through the human forces, Arthas suffered some violent seizures, and Kel'Thuzad considered recalling their forces, but the King forbade it, and they continued on their macabre mission. In the aftermath, Arthas received a vision from Ner'zhul, who told him to return to Northrend. Kel'Thuzad immediately prepared for his departure, but they were abruptly ambushed by the dreadlords, and separated. The dreadlords unleashed their forces against Arthas, but Kel'Thuzad found his own way out of the city.\nKel'Thuzad later came upon Arthas in the clutches of Sylvanas and her wicked banshees. She was about to strike when Kel'Thuzad unleashed his forces against her and her sisters. With the banshees dead, Sylvanas was forced to retreat. Kel'Thuzad escorted Arthas to the shore, where he had prepared a fleet of ships for his departure. Arthas asked Kel'Thuzad, as his most loyal servant and trusted friend, to remain in Lordaeron and ensure that his legacy endured. Kel'Thuzad swore on what was left of his life to carry out that mission at any cost. While Sylvanas and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; claimed the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad returned to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, which he ruled from the flying necropolis &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point, Kel'Thuzad created the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, extremely powerful elite &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the Scourge created to serve as his &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard\"&gt;royal guard&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; also joined the citadel to guard Kel'Thuzad's chamber. In Naxxramas, Kel'Thuzad appointed &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Razuvious\"&gt;Razuvious&lt;/a&gt; as the trainer of death knights.\nAshbringer.\nAfter being manipulated by &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; (who was possessed by the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; betrayed and murdered his father, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. Renault slew his father using the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; - an act of evil that &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;corrupted&lt;/a&gt; the sword. Collecting the body and blade, Kel'Thuzad transformed Alexandros into a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; - the leader of his &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith assistance from members of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; managed to infiltrate Naxxramas and defeat his undead father. He then fled the necropolis with the corrupted Ashbringer. After conferring with &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, Darion learned that his father's soul was trapped in the sword and that only a great act of love could set it free.\nWhen Kel'Thuzad staged an attack on &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Darion ran the Ashbringer through his own heart - sacrificing his life to release his father's soul. An explosion of light destroyed most of the lesser Scourge, but Kel'Thuzad was unaffected. Follwoing the battle, he reanimated Darion as a death knight, and while his primary goal had eluded him, he was content to take Darion as his prize, reasoning that the Scourge could always &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;return&lt;/a&gt; to Light's Hope.\nShadow of the Necropolis.\nIn the Lich King's haste to spread the plague of undeath over Azeroth, he gifted Kel'Thuzad, with the flying citadel of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, a horrific base of operations for the Scourge. Consistent attacks from the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; factions weakened the defenses of the floating fortress, enabling an incursion that led to Kel'Thuzad's defeat.\nKel'Thuzad sought &lt;a href=\"Atiesh\"&gt;Atiesh&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the first &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; attacked &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, which later led to an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; counterattack. &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; recruited Alliance heroes who raided &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and defeated Kel'Thuzad.\nKel'Thuzad was the last encounter of the dungeon &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, implemented in the &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, and was the end game boss of the original game of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". He was ultimately defeated by the players, but does not die. As a lich, he may reform using a magic item known as a &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt;. Had &lt;a href=\"The%20Phylactery%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad's phylactery&lt;/a&gt; been destroyed along with him, Kel'Thuzad would have been defeated forever, but some things do not happen as they should.\nThe quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;The Fall of Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; describes how the player, who likely wanted to destroy the phylactery, is manipulated by some mental force to give the phylactery to &lt;a href=\"Father%20Inigo%20Montoy\"&gt;Father Inigo Montoy&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. Something very unusual was going on there, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; reported that the phylactery did not reach their hands. A traitor among the ranks of the knightly order of the Argent Dawn absconded with Kel'Thuzad's cursed remains and fled to Northrend, where the fallen lich could be reanimated.\nCaverns of Time.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; section of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, a still-human Kel'Thuzad can be seen conversing with &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Commander Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt;: \"\"The lich, Kel'Thuzad. He serves the Lich King without question, a necromancer of great prowess in life, turned into a master of necromancy after his death. It is said he is the most loyal of the Lich King's subjects. Kel'Thuzad has survived trials that would have long since shattered the souls of even the greatest of the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. He readily gave his life at Arthas's hand, later to be brought back - reborn in the power of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. In the Plaguelands, Kel'Thuzad was again defeated by the agents of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. However, his phylactery was delivered to a false agent of the Brotherhood. We have yet to discover who stole his phylactery or why.\"\"\nKel'Thuzad once again returned as the final boss of the relocated &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 now floating above the &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Fields\"&gt;Carrion Fields&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, besieging &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. When the phylactery was given to Father Montoy, it was not delivered to the Argent Dawn; his hoarding of the artifact (instead of destroying it or giving it to the Argent Dawn) allowed Kel'Thuzad to regain corporeal form. (Montoy appears to have been rewarded for this effort as he is now a lich himself \u2014 known as &lt;a href=\"Thel%27zan%20the%20Duskbringer\"&gt;Thel'zan the Duskbringer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and located within the &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Mausoleum\"&gt;Wintergarde Mausoleum&lt;/a&gt; below Wintergarde Keep, which is currently under siege by Naxxramas.)\nIn the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Plains%20of%20Nasam\"&gt;The Plains of Nasam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players are sent to the &lt;a href=\"Plains%20of%20Nasam\"&gt;Plains of Nasam&lt;/a&gt; in a siege tank to destroy Scourge forces in the area and rescue injured &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; troops. They are also called on to identify the leader of the Scourge in the region \u2014 Kel'Thuzad himself, who stands upon a dais and is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Stitched%20Warsong%20Horror\"&gt;Stitched Warsong Horror&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Plague%20Spreader\"&gt;Plague Spreader&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; constructs.\nIn Naxxramas, Kel'Thuzad appointed Baron Rivendare to replace Alexandros as the fourth Horseman. In a manner very similar to how he was &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;originally defeated&lt;/a&gt;, the champions of Azeroth stormed the dread citadel and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;defeated&lt;/a&gt; the lich lord once again.\nKel'Thuzad did not have his phylactery on his person during his second defeat, but it was nevertheless destroyed at some point. After his defeat, rumors quickly spread that his soul was lost to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nWithin the Shadowlands, the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; assigned Kel'Thuzad's soul to the realm of &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; due to the great ambition he displayed in mortality. However, the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ta%27lora\"&gt;Ta'lora&lt;/a&gt; notes that given Kel'Thuzad's importance to the schemes of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, it is possible that the Arbiter's judgment was somehow manipulated. It's unclear exactly when Kel'Thuzad started working for the Jailer, but Ta'lora notes that it is plausible that the Jailer was able to peer into the mortal plane and came to see Kel'Thuzad as a means to extend his influence on Azeroth back when he was still a living necromancer. Kel'Thuzad himself later claimed that he had only pretended to serve \"false masters\" and that he had actually been working to architect Azeroth's end all along. In reality, it was &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; who reached to Kel'Thuzad after his ultimate defeat during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, recruited him to Zovaal's side and supplied him with &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to aid the cause.\nUpon arriving among the &lt;a href=\"necrolord\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt;s of Maldraxxus, Kel'Thuzad joined the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt; and rose through the house's ranks at a record pace due to his talent in necromancy and due to secretly receiving stores of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; from fellow servants of the Jailer in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;. He soon became one of the two barons serving under &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt; (the other being &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Ninadar\"&gt;Baroness Ninadar&lt;/a&gt;). He took the place of &lt;a href=\"Balmedar\"&gt;Baron Balmedar&lt;/a&gt;, whom he then also shut out of the house's dealings. Kel'Thuzad subsequently used his position and influence over Sin'dane, along with &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, to begin turning the houses of Maldraxxus against each other through treachery and deceit in order to further the plans of the Jailer.\nThrough his manipulation of Sin'dane and Gharmal, Kel'Thuzad caused the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Plagues\"&gt;House of Plagues&lt;/a&gt; in what looked like an accident. Not long thereafter, he orchestrated the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt;\u2014specifically the destruction of their &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nurakkir\"&gt;Nurakkir&lt;/a&gt; and the death of their leader &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Akarek\"&gt;Margrave Akarek&lt;/a&gt;\u2014through his servants in the House of Rituals, namely the liches &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Bitan\"&gt;Mor'Bitan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zelmany\"&gt;Zelmany&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drava%27ora\"&gt;Drava'ora&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fal%27zinge\"&gt;Fal'zinge&lt;/a&gt;. The baron then convinced Sin'dane and Gharmal to launch a joint invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. The invasion's leader, the lich &lt;a href=\"Nalthor%20the%20Rimebinder\"&gt;Nalthor the Rimebinder&lt;/a&gt;, stated that his \"master\" had ordered him to destroy Bastion and harvest the corpses of its &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants for the Maldraxxi armies, but it's not clear if he was referring to Sin'dane or Kel'Thuzad. Via his servant &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Ouix%27Ara\"&gt;Lady Ouix'Ara&lt;/a&gt;, Kel'Thuzad also continued securing anima from Revendreth, now not just for himself but for all of the House of Rituals and House of Constructs. More specifically, the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Tithelord\"&gt;Tithelord&lt;/a&gt; supplied Lady Ouix'Ara and her fellow Kel'Thuzad loyalists at &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20End\"&gt;Death's End&lt;/a&gt; with anima from &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;' stockpiles in return for Maldraxxian weapons.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s arrived in Maldraxxus, Kel'Thuzad told Mor'Bitan to personally perform a ritual at the &lt;a href=\"Rotting%20Mound\"&gt;Rotting Mound&lt;/a&gt; that would apparently grant him more power as a reward for his assault on the House of Eyes, but the ritual was sabotaged and Mor'Bitan was killed by &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Vashj\"&gt;Baroness Vashj&lt;/a&gt; and the Maw Walkers.\nSire Denathrius later gave Kel'Thuzad\u2014whom he called a \"faithful ally\"\u2014the &lt;a href=\"%3AMedallion%20of%20Dominion\"&gt;:Medallion of Dominion&lt;/a&gt;, which had previously belonged to &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;. This medallion would allow the baron to take control of countless venthyr and, with enough anima, even manipulate the very fabric of the Shadowlands.\nWith the aid of Maw Walkers, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the soul of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; ultimately discovered Lady Ouix'Ara's operation at Death's End and that Kel'Thuzad was the one responsible for the unrest in Maldraxxus. After Ouix'Ara was killed, an &lt;a href=\"image%20of%20Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;image of Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; appeared to taunt the \"meddlers\" and invite them to face him in the House of Rituals. Prince Renathal and Baroness Draka proceeded to work together with Maw Walkers to stop the traitorous Tithelord at &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%27s%20Manor\"&gt;his manor&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad personally appeared during the battle, supplying the Tithelord with Maldraxxi troops. However, when the Tithelord told the Arch-Lich to use the Medallion of Dominion to help him defeat the invaders, Kel'Thuzad refused and instead left the Tithelord to die, stating that the venthyr had served his purpose and that he needed to attend to \"the next part of the plan\".\nMembers of the House of Constructs later returned to Maldraxxus with spoils from their raid on Bastion, including Kel'Thuzad's \"personal prize\"\u2014the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bearer%20Thedrin\"&gt;Bearer Thedrin&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the Revendreth anima, the baron planned to use the Bearer in a ritual to breach his master's prison: the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the deposed baron Balmedar allied with the Necrolord Covenant and helped Necrolord Maw Walkers infiltrate the House of Rituals by killing and &lt;a href=\"Illusory%20Guise\"&gt;taking on the appearance&lt;/a&gt; of Kel'Thuzad's favorite acolyte, &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20Nelesis\"&gt;Nelesis&lt;/a&gt;, which would allow them to learn the Arch-Lich's intentions. Balmedar's &lt;a href=\"Balmedar%27s%20Oculus\"&gt;invisible oculus&lt;/a&gt; continued accompanying the Maw Walkers as they reported to Kel'Thuzad in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Vault of Souls&lt;/a&gt;. The Arch-Lich sent his \"acolyte\" to collect a set of tomes he'd ordered from Baroness Ninadar followed by some ritual reagents from &lt;a href=\"Jor%27dan%20the%20Powerful\"&gt;Jor'dan the Powerful&lt;/a&gt;. Balmedar had the Maw Walkers bring the ingredients to him instead, but not before the heroes learned from Jor'dan that Kel'Thuzad was awaiting a &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; shipment from &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; containing the last of the reagents. After ambushing the &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Ba\"&gt;Cartel Ba&lt;/a&gt; shipment, the Maw Walkers recovered the reagent in question: a &lt;a href=\"%3ADomination%20Blade\"&gt;:Domination Blade&lt;/a&gt; from the Maw. This caused Balmedar to realize what Kel'Thuzad was planning, but since the baron was too powerful to confront directly, the Maw Walkers would instead have to stop his ritual by returning with the now sabotaged reagents. Kel'Thuzad had begun to suspect that there was a traitor in the house's ranks after what happened to the broker caravan, but he was impressed by his \"acolyte's\" resourcefulness when she presented the Domination Blade to him and asked her to assist him in the final ritual. The sabotaged reagents did cause the ritual to fail when the baron attempted to sacrifice Bearer Thedrin with the Domination Blade, but they also triggered a burst of feedback that shed the heroes' disguise and revealed Balmedar's oculus. Realizing that he had been deceived, Kel'Thuzad had both Balmedar and the heroes captured and imprisoned in the Vault of Souls.\nBalmedar and the heroes managed to escape, but before they had a chance to warn Sin'dane of her baron's treachery, Kel'Thuzad personally confronted her and Baroness Ninadar at the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Hall of Sorcery&lt;/a&gt;. Sin'dane told Kel'Thuzad that he could not match her power, but Ninadar suddenly betrayed the margrave by stealing her weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Staff of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, while stating that she was weak and that it was time to anoint a new margrave. Kel'Thuzad proceeded to bind Sin'dane in magical chains and mockingly asked Balmedar and the Maw Walkers if they had come to celebrate his victory. He then summoned his old ally, the dragon &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt;, to deal with the interlopers while he departed to the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt; with the captive Sin'dane. With Ninadar's backing, Kel'Thuzad thus took full control of the House of Rituals.\nAfter mustering their respective forces, the Necrolord and &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s assaulted the House of Rituals to remove Kel'Thuzad's influence. The Arch-Lich's image taunted both of the invading parties\u2014the former attacking the stronghold's southern walls, the latter teleporting into Exoramas\u2014but the covenants managed to separately reach the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Arcanum\"&gt;Prime Arcanum&lt;/a&gt; in the house's center, where Kel'Thuzad and his minions successfully performed a ritual to open a portal to the Maw, summoning a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Infernous\"&gt;Maw Infernous&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the two covenants defeated the creature and pushed on to Exoramas, where Kel'Thuzad was keeping Sin'dane trapped in a block of ice and drawing power from her. The Arch-Lich mocked the gathering, especially Kael'thas, who sought vengeance against the lich for his part in the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;destruction of Kael's homeland&lt;/a&gt; years before. Baroness Draka told Kel'Thuzad to surrender or be destroyed, but he merely replied that the Jailer's plan was unfolding \"exactly as intended\" and that they would not live to see its completion. Most of the attackers spread out to hold off the lich's &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Bulwark\"&gt;skeletal minions&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walkers focused on weakening the traitorous baron himself so that Balmedar could free Sin'dane with the Staff of the Primus. When he placed the staff in her hand, it allowed her to shatter her icy prison, stunning Kel'Thuzad in the process. She declared that he would answer for his crimes against both Maldraxxus and her. Kael'thas wanted to claim his vengeance by incinerating the lich, but &lt;a href=\"General%20Draven\"&gt;General Draven&lt;/a&gt; intervened to grab the Medallion of Dominion from the lich's chest. Before the covenants had a chance to detain the lich, a group of &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; arrived through a portal from the Maw and helped the lich escape to his master's side.\nChains of Domination.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"covenant\"&gt;covenant&lt;/a&gt;s invade the Maw to take the fight directly to the Jailer, Kel'Thuzad directed the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; in striking back.\nThe Maw Walkers and their allies later assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, while the Jailer began enacting his plan to steal the final key from the Arbiter. The heroes fought their way through his minions, eventually confronting Kel'Thuzad at the apex of the soul river. With all his schemes and manipulations coming to a head, Kel'Thuzad vowed that death would answer to nobody but him, and that he would have his vengeance on the mortal champions who foiled all his plans. During &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28Sanctum%20of%20Domination%20tactics%29\"&gt;the ensuing battle&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walkers destroyed Kel'Thuzad's phylactery. With true death finally approaching the lich, Kel'Thuzad unleashed his full power and the armies of the dead in a final stand. After futilely attempting to trade \"unimaginable power\" in exchange for his continued existence, Kel'Thuzad would be struck down for the last time, his dying words expressing his disbelief that death did not answer to him. The remains of his power were used by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to open a gateway to the &lt;a href=\"Pinnacle%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Pinnacle of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nConversation with Helcular.\nKel'Thuzad appears in human form along with &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; wing of the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;. He patrols between the main road through Hillsbrad and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;.

Kel'Thuzad called &lt;a href=\"Linnena%20Hallow\"&gt;Linnena Hallow&lt;/a&gt; to be by his side as he sowed the undead plague through &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.

However, it is more common that the main tank will wear some frost gear, and the rest of the raid will not wear any, although a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Aura\"&gt;Frost Aura&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Resistance%20Totem\"&gt;Frost Resistance Totem&lt;/a&gt; may be used to assist healing.\nPhase 1.\nDuring the first phase, all players must stay in the middle part of the room (inside the ring on the floor) while the &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s slowly engage. If any players \"or pets\" leave the ring, many additional &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; engage at once.\nPhase 2.\nOnce the second phase starts, the boss should be engaged by the main tank, and any remaining banshees and other undead should be killed. Players should spread out to mitigate &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Blast\"&gt;Frost Blast&lt;/a&gt; (an ice block effect only removed by healing) and &lt;a href=\"Detonate%20Mana\"&gt;Detonate Mana&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"aoe\"&gt;aoe&lt;/a&gt; explosive debuff). \nThe ice block is an aoe - so any players closer than 10 yards will also be blocked, and all must receive a heal before being killed by the block. Because of this, if there are only 2 melee dps plus the main tank, they can spread out in a triangle shape, all at max melee range from the boss. However if there are additional melee, they should stack into 2 groups, and healers need to watch for multiple ice blocks. \nIt's very important that healers are in range of members of the raid so they can remove the ice block debuff. Healer positioning should be coordinated before the fight starts. It is recommended to position healers evenly around the room, rather than all in the center. This reduces your chances of losing 2 healers at once.\nAlso raiders should be on the lookout for &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Fissure\"&gt;Shadow Fissure&lt;/a&gt;s that spawn beneath your feet. The player on the top of the threat list (hopefully your main tank) will not be ice blocked at any point during the fight. \nPhase 3.\nDuring the final phase, everything is the same except additional &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Icecrown\"&gt;Guardians of Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; are released and must be picked up by one or two off tanks. These will never be killed, they just need to be kept busy. Off tanks must be cautious when picking up the adds to maintain a distance from other other raiders, especially healers. An ice block on a tank and a healer, on top of guardians running around free will almost certainly cause a wipe. If possible, off tanks should be within taunting range of each other, so if one tank dies, recovery is possible. Off tanks should also carefully position the adds and their camera so they can still watch out for fissure spawns.\nOnce Kel'Thuzud has been defeated, the fight immediately ends and the guardians will run away."}

He ruled over the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; from his citadel of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nFormerly a sorcerer of Dalaran, Kel'Thuzad was one of the principal agents of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for the spreading of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After being slain by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he was reborn as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;. He then aided Arthas in summoning &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful lord of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kel'Thuzad's true loyalty was to the Lich King, and not the Burning Legion. After the Legion's defeat, Kel'Thuzad supported Arthas in wresting power from the Dreadlords. When Arthas left for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; during the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;The Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, he left Kel'Thuzad as his agent to command the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron.\nAbilities and Strategy.\nPhase One.\nKel'Thuzad begins the encounter invulnerable, and you need to kill adds which come from the seven corners of the room. This includes the entrance.\nPhase Two.\nKel'Thuzad becomes active, stage 2 begins 5 minutes and 10 seconds after you engage him.\nKel'Thuzad has approximately 3,150,000 hit points. He is immune to taunt.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D55802\"&gt;Frost bolt single&lt;/a&gt; \n2 second cast. Inflicts 9,000 to 11,000 Frost damage to primary aggro target and reduces its movement speed for 4 sec, must be interrupted as it will one shot or nearly one shot the main tank. Frost bolt is cast at random intervals and is often chain casted, having multiple rogues and warriors meleeing Kel'Thuzad at all times is ideal. This spell is not resistable.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D55807\"&gt;Frost bolt multiple&lt;/a&gt; \nInflicts 2,750 to 3,500 Frost damage and reduces the targets' movement speed for 4 sec. Hits everyone in the room and cannot be interrupted - it is instant cast. Used every 15 secs. Fully resistible.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D28410\"&gt;Chains of Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;\nKel'Thuzad can mind control 5 people at once. Size increased by 200%. Charmed. Damage increased by 200%. Healing increased by 500%. They will buff and heal Kel'Thuzad. Can be CC'd by any ability that would normally work on humanoids. This ability will wipe all threat. This ability will always target the player with the highest aggro (I.E. the main tank) requiring a tank switch. This spell has a cooldown of 60 seconds.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D27819\"&gt;Mana Detonation&lt;/a&gt; \nA debuff randomly applied to a mana using player. The player will explode after 4 seconds, dealing Arcane damage based on maximum mana to all players within 10 yards (not to himself). This will burn half of their current mana pool. This spell has a 20 second cooldown.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D27810\"&gt;Shadow Fissure&lt;/a&gt; \nSummons a very noticeable red fissure around the targeted player which does 62500-137500 shadow damage after 3 seconds as &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D27812\"&gt;Void Blast&lt;/a&gt;. Easily avoidable by running out of the fissure. This spell has a 10 second cooldown.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D27808\"&gt;Frost Blast&lt;/a&gt; \nPlaces an Ice Block effect on the targeted player, and all players within 10 yards, rendering them unable to perform any action. This effect will continue to chain to anyone within 10 yards of anyone affected as with C'thun's &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fspell%3D26134\"&gt;Eye Beam&lt;/a&gt;. It will deal 104% of their maximum HP in damage over 5 seconds. If those affected are not healed within 4 seconds they will die. This spell has a 30 second cooldown.\nPhase Three.\nAt 40% health, Phase Three will begin as Kel'Thuzad calls for aid and the Lich King sends five Nerubian Crypt Lords known as the Guardians of Icecrown to attack the raid.\n40-man Level 60 Strategy.\nYou will need 6-7 tanks and 10-13 healers for this encounter. Frost resist gear is not generally advisable since you'll need all the DPS and mana regen you can get. The main tank also cannot resist Kel'Thuzad's frostbolt anyway.\nPhase One.\nGather in the middle of the room, make sure all pets are on passive. \nRanged need to all be on the Soldiers and Soul Weavers. Healers can help DPS Soldiers. Melee are on the Abominations. \nIt's incredibly important that all raid members are aware of the Soldiers coming at the raid. Although they only have 5,000 HP one touching the raid will take everyone down to 40% HP or so. Two hitting the raid will be a wipe.\nHave someone call out the Soul Weavers as soon as they acquire a target. They have a lot of HP and if they reach the raid there will be deaths.\nAbominations need to be killed as fast as possible without pulling aggro. They hit for about 4,000 on a tank and stack mortal wound. More importantly they spawn progressively faster as the phase goes on and you don't want any up when Kel'Thuzad attacks. You will definitely still have some Soul Weavers up as Kel'Thuzad spawns so ranged need to finish them off.\nPhase Two.\nThis phase needs to end as fast as possible so your healers have mana for phase three. A tank should pick up Kel'Thuzad as he spawns and drag him to the middle of the room. Make absolutely sure your interrupters are on the ball here. Kel'Thuzad is capable of bursting for 14,000 unresistable damage on a tank with a frostbolt into volley if you do not interrupt him which will kill any tank without shield wall up. Like most bosses Kel'Thuzad is immune to taunt. He has 3,150,000 hit points.\nPositioning will be the critical part of this phase. The melee need to establish a diamond around Kel'Thuzad's hit box with 8 yards between them to make sure less than 6 melee are hit at a time by Frost Blast. When Shadow Fissure hits a melee clump you'll need to move away from Kel'Thuzad then back in. If the melee are in groups of five Prayer of Healing can save them, as well as Chain Heal if you are a Horde raid. You'll need mulitple healers hitting all the melee however as Frost Blast hits for 130% of their HP.\nThe rest of the raid will need to be in a circle around Kel'Thuzad with 8 yards between them. Mana detonation will cause a lot of deaths unless you stay spread out, and remember that Frost Blast can chain through the entire raid if you do not keep spaced. Although it is tempting to drop melee for this encounter too many ranged will result in running out of room to fit 40 spread out people in.\nHealers will need to be ready for both burst healing on Frost Blast every ~30 seconds and Frostbolt Volley which hits for about 60% of a raid member's HP every 15 seconds. Kel'Thuzad melees for about 3,000 on a tank.\nKel'Thuzad's most dangerous ability is Chains of Kel'Thuzad. This will mind control your main tank and four others (possibly other tanks), wiping threat. Melee need to be especially careful to stop DPS when this comes as Kel'Thuzad is not tauntable. Whichever tanks are not mind controlled need to to immediately fight for threat on Kel'Thuzad while interrupts need to continue to avoid tank deaths. Anyone with a humanoid CC ability will need to use it, especially Mages, to control the mind controlled players who hit VERY hard and heal Kel'Thuzad for 500% healing. Mages should keep detect magic on Kel'Thuzad so the raid is aware of any buffs he may gain. Kel'Thuzad uses this ability randomly, as often as every minute or sometimes every two minutes. ALL of his other abilities carry on while this is in play so don't lose focus. \nPhase Three.\nAt 40% HP Kel'Thuzad will call for aid and the Lich King will send five Guardians of Icecrown at the raid. Three priests should be assigned to shackling these (no more or Kel'Thuzad will dispel your shackles). They obviously will need to run through other raid members so make sure people stay aware and move away to stay spread out. Two tanks need to be tanking Guardians that are free and they will be taking a lot of damage. Guardians gain 15% damage every time they switch targets or a player dies so try very hard to keep them under control or your tanks will explode. Guardians are tauntable.\nThis means you will have less tanks on Kel'Thuzad during a chains and sometimes Guardian tanks will have to try to pick up Kel'Thuzad, which is a good time for Shield Wall.\nKel'Thuzad's other abilities continue at the same rate so this phase can quickly become very frantic, especially if your Priests die. Try not to let DPS get overly excited and pull aggro during or after Chains of Kel'Thuzad as deaths will quickly escalate the encounter out of control.\nRaid buffs such as an Onyxia head turnin and full flasks are VERY helpful for the last 40%.

All his countless schemes and machinations have led to this final confrontation, where he has plotted the mortal champions' ultimate demise in service of his &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;true master&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nOverview.\nKel'Thuzad can only be truly defeated once his phylactery is destroyed. Until then, when Kel'Thuzad reaches 0 health remaining he calls forth his minions to protect him while the phylactery opens and empowers him. During this window, players may enter the phylactery and attempt to destroy the Remnant of Kel'Thuzad. Once fully recovered, Kel'Thuzad gains a stack of Necrotic Surge and engages the players once more.\nWhen the Remnant is destroyed, the phylactery shatters and Kel'Thuzad summons a Deep Freeze to unleash all his power before death can finally take him.\nAbilities.\nStage One: Chains and Ice.\nKel'Thuzad is a master of frost and shadow and until the phylactery is destroyed, remains immortal.\nStage Two: The Phylactery Opens.\nWhen Kel'Thuzad is defeated, the phylactery opens and restores him to life once more. While open, players can enter the phylactery to battle the last remnant of Kel'Thuzad's soul. It is during this time Kel'Thuzad uses March of the Forsaken to summon his minions to protect his exposed phylactery.\nStage Three: The Final Stand.\nWith the phylactery destroyed, true death awaits. Kel'Thuzad unleashes his full power to make his violent last stand."}

He rules over the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; from his citadel of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. He was originally voiced by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20McConnohie\"&gt;Michael McConnohie&lt;/a&gt; but the current voice actor is unknown. He is the final boss of the re-tuned raid dungeon Naxxramas in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\nFormerly a sorcerer of Dalaran, Kel'Thuzad was one of the principal agents of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for the spreading of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After being slain by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he was reborn as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;. He then aided Arthas in summoning &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful lord of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kel'Thuzad's true loyalty was to the Lich King, and not the Burning Legion. After the Legion's defeat, Kel'Thuzad supported Arthas in wresting power from the Dreadlords. When Arthas left for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; during the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;The Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, he left Kel'Thuzad as his agent to command the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron. He now commands Scourge forces in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; from his necropolis floating above &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor much more information, see:\n25-man abilities.\nPhase one.\nKel'Thuzad begins the encounter invulnerable, and you need to kill adds which come from the seven alcoves of the room.

He becomes active, and has approximately 5,660,000 hit points. He is tauntable.\nPhase three.\nAt 45% health, Phase Three will begin as Kel'Thuzad calls for aid and the Lich King sends two Nerubian Crypt Lords known as the Guardians of Icecrown to attack the raid.\n25-man strategy.\nYou will need one main tank and two to three Guardian-of-Icecrown offtanks for this encounter. It is worth noting that none of the abilities in this encounter can be removed by PvP trinkets or Ice Block/Divine Shield/Cloak of Shadows.\nDuring phase one, the raid will stack in the center of Kel'Thuzad's room. Melee will engage and kill Unstoppable Abominations while ranged will kill Soldiers of the Frozen Wastes and Soul Weavers before they reach the raid. 15 seconds after Kel'Thuzad's aggro emote, he will become active; it is essential that the entire raid spread out efficiently around the room before this occurs in order to mitigate the effects of the Mana Detonation and Frost Blast abilities. Mana Detonation will come approximately every 20 to 25 seconds, Shadow Fissure approximately every 15 to 20 seconds, Chains of Kel'Thuzad every 90 to 120 seconds, and Frost Blast every 45 to 60 seconds. \nFor phase two, the main tank should drag Kel'Thuzad to the center of the room, and melee classes should stack in the three cardinal points around Kel'Thuzad's hitbox not occupied by the main tank (a bit more than 10 yards from each other). It is critical that they be at max range and spread out so that Frost Blast will only hit as few as possible. This is a diamond-shaped formation. If this positioning is not perfected, multiple melee will be frozen by Frost Blast which tends to result in the death of most of them. If it chains to the tank, it usually results in a wipe.\nAn interrupt rotation on Kel'Thuzad's Frost Bolt should be established to reduce damage taken by the tank (30k damage per bolt without resistance). If/when Shadow Fissure is cast on the tank, the melee MUST reposition with the tank. The ranged DPS and healers should spread out in a circle around Kel'Thuzad with a space left for mana-based melee to run to should they be afflicted by Mana Detonation. Melee will need to move for Shadow Fissure but should move back to their original position afterward. The Guardian-of-Icecrown offtanks don't need to do anything until phase 3 begins and can stay in the alcoves where the adds spawned in phase one to avoid spreading Frost Blast. \nUsually at least once before phase 3 begins, Kel'Thuzad will cast Chains of Kel'Thuzad. All DPS must stop until the tank has reestablished threat on Kel'Thuzad. Interrupts need to continue. It is important that Mages polymorph and other classes CC the affected players very quickly as they will do extremely high damage (two-shotting raid members) and cast extremely large heals on Kel'Thuzad. It is also possible for Kel'Thuzad to be Bloodlusted and Hand of Protectioned, as well as any other buffs you can think of. When Chains of Kel'Thuzad ends, the affected players should return to their positions.\nAt 45% HP, the Lich King will send four Guardians of Icecrown to attack the raid. These appear one at a time. The Guardian offtanks will need to pick up the rest and offtank them in the alcoves for the rest of the encounter. All of Kel'Thuzad's phase-2 abilities continue in this phase. Note that it is possible and probable that one of your Guardian offtanks will be mind controlled at some point, so it is advisable that the Guardians are tanked relatively close together so that the other offtanks can taunt the Guardians when they become loose. Guardians hit very hard and their melee hits will increase the longer you take to kill Kel'thuzad.\nIt is advisable to save DPS cooldowns and Bloodlust for phase 3 as the Guardians will become untankable if you take too long to finish the encounter.\n10-man strategy.\nThe 10-man version of Kel'Thuzad is \"significantly\" easier than the 25-man and should be manageable if your group can kill Sapphiron. Since the Guardians do not hit very hard on 10-man and Kel'Thuzad cannot target the main tank with Frost Blast, the main tank can pick up both Guardians and tank them along with Kel'Thuzad, eliminating the possibility of the offtank being Frost Blasted while tanking Guardians, which can often result in death.\n(Pre-Patch) Kel'Thuzad's abilities in a 10-man consist of single-target Frost Bolts (which can be interrupted), raid-wide Frost Bolts (which must be healed through; the slowing effect can be dispelled), Mana Detonation (positional), and Shadow Fissure (instant death if in the area of effect after 5 seconds). \nHealers must keep the raid topped off, and heal the Frost-Bolted target immediately. \nOptimally, designate one healer for the tank, healer(s) to watch for Frost Blast, and AoE/chain heals for the raid-wide Frost Bolts. The healer assigned to heal the multiple Frost Bolt should stand near the center of the raid to have access to the entire raid. Healers should also be ready to heal each other in case of Frost Blasts, and to fill in for each other as needed. Once the adds are picked up, this encounter is effectively a DPS race, because the guardians get bigger and bigger, and hit harder, until eventually your tank will die or your healers run out of mana.\nWhile not as big a problem as on 25-man, restrict your melee DPS to three, including the tank. This allows them to form a triangle around Kel'Thuzad, which prevents frost bolts chaining onto the tank. The tank may have difficulty seeing the fissures once the Guardians grow to a certain size. To deal with this, try to move every time they form. This will not be an issue if your group has enough DPS to kill Kel'Thuzad before the Guardians get too big.\nKel'Thuzad's can chain cast his single-target Frost Bolt on a tank for 10-12k each. Any form of melee interruption is greatly helpful here, including a &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, Rogue &lt;a href=\"Kick\"&gt;Kick&lt;/a&gt;, or Death Knight &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Freeze\"&gt;Mind Freeze&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Strangulate\"&gt;Strangulate&lt;/a&gt;.\nKel'Thuzad has a 19-minute enrage timer (from the beginning of the fight), at which point his Frost Bolts begin hitting for approximately 30k and he hits for 20k melee on plate.\nQuotes.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; for quotes from his WCIII script.\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

When the Kelani fell to ruin, the &lt;a href=\"Razormane%20tribe\"&gt;Razormane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s were quick to scavenge and covet these beautiful and powerful objects. One such stone was retrieved by &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s search for the &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; said to reside deep within the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak%20caverns\"&gt;caverns&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and used its powers to power an enchanted bridge deep within the ruins beneath the mountain.\nSpeculation.\nNext to nothing is known for certain about the Kelani, other than arcanistry and their strong links to the ruins beneath Stonetalon Peak. Trapped within the same caverns that required Cairne's gemstone to access was &lt;a href=\"Aszune\"&gt;Aszune&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; princess. As such the Kelani Magi were likely an order of &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; night elves at some period in history, and the enchanted, peril-filled ruins beneath Stonetalon were of their construction. The powerful undead that haunted the area were thus likely the cursed remains of these Magi. This is a fate shared by many groups of Highborne across Kalimdor (such as the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;).

She trained with , and served directly under the military leader of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Ranger General . She was sent to oversee the blood elves aiding in 's &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of War.\nKelantir arrived shortly before the assault on &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;. was irritated that neither nor were present to assist in the attack (instead sending, as he put it, a \"third-ranking whelp\" on their behalf), though Garrosh -- whose respect for the blood elves was not improved by their leaders' absence for the battle -- wearily informed Kelantir that she had a chance to improve her standing and display her people's worth in battle.\nShe and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; were critical of Garrosh's strategies and spoke against him multiple times, especially in the company of and . She was present during Baine and Vol'jin's initial gathering of dissenting Horde commanders, and concurred with their concerns regarding the looming &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; assault. Garrosh interrupted the meeting, and slapped Kelantir when she attempted to question him. \nKelantir was unsupportive of Garrosh's usage of the &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Theramore, feeling it was as an act of cowardice, and the usage of the enslaved molten giants during the Razing of Northwatch Hold, calling it cruel and insulting. She also remarks that Garrosh is a fool and Thrall should return and kick him all the way to the Undercity, and lamented that it is too bad that the late Cairne didn't kill Garrosh when he have the chance, because Thrall would \"never\" use the elements in such a way, as well as the changes Garrosh makes on Orgrimmar, e.g. iron constructions replacing the simple wooden huts, a disapproval that Baine and some members of the Horde felt. When asked by Malkorok of her absence in Orgrimmar after their \"victory\" at Theramore, she snidely claimed that she was afflicted by \"iron allergy\", earning her a stare by the former. Kelantir, Farley, Vol'jin, and the tauren, blood elves, and Forsaken who were revolted by Garrosh's method gathered at an inn at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; instead of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; during the victory celebrations, much to 's relief, and they have a grim discussion (and some of them, such as Kelantir, not above badmouthing) of Garrosh and his acts. It is also likely that the incident of Garrosh slapping Kelantir spread among the Horde members, including the blood elves. Unfortunately, her very words are heard by Malkorok's spies and they reported them to Malkorok, who wasn't amused. They were subsequently approached in Razor Hill's inn by Malkorok, who questioned them about speaking ill of their warchief. When they remained silent, Malkorok pretended that his spies were mistaken, and Frandis Farley agreed that Malkorok needed better informants which the latter agreed as well. After Malkorok and his Kor'kron left, he then blew away the inn using grenades with them inside.\nWar Crimes.\nA vision of Kelantir and Farley's deaths was conjured by the Vision of Time during 's trial. took an instant liking to Kelantir, and believed 's reactions to the images shown spoke volumes of the regard the ranger-general had for her.\nAppearance and personality.\nKelantir was a pale, slender elf with golden hair and bright, gleaming armor. Garrosh incredulously made note of how she could fight and function in such heavy attire, given her lithe frame. \nThough loyal to the Horde's cause, she found herself gravitating towards the more moderate views of and which, to her sorrow, did not go unnoticed by the ever-critical Malkorok.\nSpeculation.\nShe might be related to ."}

Only the most stalwart among Illidan's forces could ever hope to keep him contained; the ruthless orc, Keli'dan, was the only possible choice.\"\nStrategy.\nThe Keli'dan encounter is composed of two phases. With a &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; (for &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Prayer of Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Shadow Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dispel%20Magic\"&gt;Dispel Magic&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Cleanse\"&gt;Cleanse&lt;/a&gt;) and a skilled &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;, the battle is trivial. &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20resistance\"&gt;Shadow resistance&lt;/a&gt; will help in this fight but is not necessary.\nFirst, Keli'dan's five Warlock companions must be killed. Individually, they are not very strong; if the party can &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; two or three of them, so much the better for surviving the encounter. If there isn't any (or much) crowd control, have the tank &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; the 4 or 5 loose warlocks around the corner into the room the party just came in from. The warlocks will all clump up in the doorway and begin casting on the puller, making them easy to &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to have the tank stationed near the door for when Keli'dan aggroes. This can be made more easy if you have a &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; in group that could enslave one of the Felguards that's just outside the room, the Felguard can tank the first phase easily. This cannot be done in Heroic mode, as the demons cannot be enslaved.\nThe warlocks will cast Shadow Bolts causing approximately 1000 shadow damage. They also will cast Mark of Shadow (magic &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;,all &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; magic taken is increased by 1100, lasts 2min.) It has a short casting time, so, if possible, remove the debuff immediately. Try not to let the warlocks all gang up on one character if you can't dispel their debuff, or that character is dead if he or she gets hit with a few bolts with the debuff active. If your party has no magic dispelling ability, keep the last warlock sheeped or otherwise crowd-controlled while waiting for the debuff to expire. Don't fight the boss with any debuffs active if you can avoid it.\nOnce the last warlock is dead, Keli'dan will come for the party. He casts Shadowbolt Volley, deals 1000 damage to all enemies within 40 yards.\nKeli'dan will also occasionally yell, \"Closer! Come closer! And burn!\" and will stand in place, immune to all damage for a few secs, then suddenly blasting away with Burning Nova, deals AoE &lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt; damage to anyone in a surprisingly large radius. The tank and any melee &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; should run away from him (run, don't back up) when he begins his yell and they will be able avoid this damage completely. However, if no-one is in the radius of Burning Nova, he will still cast Shadowbolt Volley at everyone.\nHeroic.\nKeli'dan will pull every player toward him before he begins Burning Nova, making it harder to avoid it.\nIf you stand near him you won't get pulled in, giving you more time to run away, though this tactic of course still leaves the fight rather tricky for hunters. However, if you start running the second you are pulled in then you can still get out of the blast radius in time.\nWhile the pulling does increase the time it takes to run out, it does give ample visual warning to get moving. This will work best with a less organized group, that cannot call out the nova over Teamspeak or Ventrilo for players standing close.\nAs soon as his blastwave is completed, he will throw another shadowbolt volley. It's imperative that the magic debuff that gets applied to the party is removed before this. It will increase the damage from the shadowbolts by 1500. He also applies the debuff to the party throughout the fight, so it will need to be constantly removed.\nNote.\nIt is possible to reset him, just run up the ramp and wait for him to yell \"Closer! Come closer! And burn!\", after he does his AoE he will run back, and reset.\nIt is possible to acquire a \"debuff\" called Rage of Magtheridon during this fight by stepping into one of the bright blue lights streaming up from the ground. The effects are \"Melee Attack Speed increased by 30%, Ranged attack speed increased by 30%, Spell casting time decreased by 30%\" It lasts for 30 seconds and appears as a debuff and cannot be removed. The light will vanish when it gives the debuff, but there are more than five of them around, so everyone can start with one to expedite the slaughter of the Channelers."}

It is one of the two starting zone for all players level 80 and higher (the other is &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;). The forest features a vast array of aquatic life and plants. There is a mixed focus between the main quests involving the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and auxiliary quests introducing players to &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;'s new under water mechanics.

Kelp'thar is separated by the &lt;a href=\"Shimmering%20Expanse\"&gt;Shimmering Expanse&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Lightless%20Reaches\"&gt;Lightless Reaches&lt;/a&gt;, a large chasm, much in the same way land zones are separated by mountains.\nThe forest's most notable features would be the seaweed forests and overly sized shells found throughout the region. There exists a few ruins, but not as many as would be found in the Shimmering Expanse. The region mostly consists of sunken vessels that were struck down by a &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;sea monster&lt;/a&gt; while heading to the newly risen landmass. The most common wildlife includes &lt;a href=\"sea%20turtle\"&gt;sea turtle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crab\"&gt;crab&lt;/a&gt;s, and other &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; life.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

After a few introductory quests, players can choose to head to Vashj'ir or Hyjal. On the Call of Duty, players will find themselves shipwrecked in &lt;a href=\"Seafarer%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Seafarer's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Legion%27s%20Fate\"&gt;Legion's Fate&lt;/a&gt; in the northern portion of Kelp'thar Forest.\nKelp'thar Forest is very heavily phased and is a directed-questing experience.

She is later found as a &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, where she is attempting to convince &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; to enter a trade agreement with the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s rather than with the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; represented by &lt;a href=\"Megs%20Dreadshredder\"&gt;Megs Dreadshredder&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in Gadgetzan, she dresses in civilian guise and pretends to be stereotypically perky and cheerful in front of Megs, who is completely taken in by the act and believes that Kelsey is merely an airhead. Out of sight at &lt;a href=\"Land%27s%20End%20Beach\"&gt;Land's End Beach&lt;/a&gt; however, she drops the charade and shows \"how gnomes get things done around here\".\nShe built &lt;a href=\"Steelspark%20LX-506\"&gt;Steelspark LX-506&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Legion Invasion&lt;/a&gt;s, Kelsey defended Gadgetzan.\nShe is also found in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; acting as the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt;'s quartermaster.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, she is present in &lt;a href=\"Staghelm%20Point\"&gt;Staghelm Point&lt;/a&gt; in where she directs adventurers to sabotage goblin mining operation.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nKelsey was, alongside the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, assigned by &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; to go to the Alliance's two bases in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. While the adventurer traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Castaway%20Encampment\"&gt;Castaway Encampment&lt;/a&gt; Kelsey went to &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt;. She later came to get the adventurer to help out at Xibala. After everything was in order, Kelsey revealed that she had been following the Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s journey for a while and greatly admired them. She wanted to tag along with them; although Kelsey was not too good in a fight, nobody could beat her mechanical skill. Kelsey is also a friend of &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt;, and asked the adventurer to investigate her disappearance.\nKelsey was part of the Gnomeregan Covert Ops team working with &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, the forces led by Wyrmbane began an operation to weaken the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; harbor's defenses. Kelsey and &lt;a href=\"John%20J.%20Keeshan\"&gt;John J. Keeshan&lt;/a&gt; planted bombs on the \"&lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Pa%27ku\"&gt;Breath of Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;\", and in the process Keeshan and Kelsey bonded over a love of collecting knives. Realizing one of the Zandalari ships had a route that would take it right by the Alliance's base in &lt;a href=\"Xibala\"&gt;Xibala&lt;/a&gt;, the two of them hurried to warn Wyrmbane. The ship that discovered them was \"&lt;a href=\"Gral%27s%20Call\"&gt;Gral's Call&lt;/a&gt;\", and Kelsey was part of the forces that boarded it to kill the crew before they reported to Zuldazar. Once the captain was captured and crew killed, Keeshan and Kelsey rigged the ship to explode. Seeing Kelsey's excitement at that part of the plan, Keeshan wished to speak to her later about their shared interests.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; was grievously wounded in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, his sealed escape pod was guarded by Kelsey during the trip back to &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt; while it was tended to by his assistant &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20Clickspring\"&gt;Elgin Clickspring&lt;/a&gt; and another gnomish engineer.\nKelsey later reached out for help to the capitals of the Alliance, seeking to save the High Tinker when his pod began to power down, putting his life in jeopardy. She planned to ask for assistance from the &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;Mechagon mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s as they possessed advanced techniques in biomechanical repair and improvements. Knowing her plan would not be completely approved of, she arranged to have Mekkatorque's pod secretly flown to &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; as part of a supply delivery, then quickly traveled there herself to ask for &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt;'s help before the pod's arrival. Kelsey would accompany the revived Mekkatorque, Erazmin, and the adventurer into &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon City&lt;/a&gt; to clear out the late &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;'s remaining forces. After Mechagon was liberated, the mechagnomes chose to rejoin their brethren from Gnomeregan; before a crowd in the High Tinkertory, Kelsey proclaimed Mekkatorque the new King of the Gnomes.\nShe appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; objective.\nQuotes.\nDun Morogh.\nI'm sorry, I can't offer you training.

She was imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Lord of Magic&lt;/a&gt; when she refused to bow to him. After she was released from the arcane prison he locked her in, she continued the fight against him in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; and lured &lt;a href=\"Saragosa\"&gt;Saragosa&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos\u2019s consort, to her death. In vengeance, Malygos forced Keristrasza to be his new consort. He tormented her and branded her body with runes until she went madder than him. The only escape for her after that was death, at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s who assaulted the Nexus.\nBackground.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, Keristrasza was incarcerated within one of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Augmented%20Arcane%20Prison\"&gt;augmented arcane prisons&lt;/a&gt;, which was then broken into pieces and scattered across &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt; - pieces that were recovered by adventurers questing at the behest of the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;. As a quest giver, Keristrasza could be called by activating the &lt;a href=\"Augmented%20Arcane%20Prison\"&gt;Augmented Arcane Prison&lt;/a&gt;, and handled a series of quests that lets the adventurers help in the battle against Malygos.\nIn gratitude, Keristrasza aided her rescuers in the fight against the Lord of Magic by luring his consort, &lt;a href=\"Saragosa\"&gt;Saragosa&lt;/a&gt;, to her death. After slaying his consort and luring him into battle with elements of the red dragonflight, Keristrasza was captured by Malygos, who made her his new consort. Whether the tortures inflicted on Keristrasza were revenge for the death of Saragosa or a misguided attempt to turn her into an ally is known only to Malygos. Regardless of his intent, her allies heard her cries of anguish and disturbing whispers of her diminishing mind. She was the only dragon not of the blue dragonflight to be a consort of Malygos, and the final consort of Malygos, branded with arcane runes which made her insane.\nThose who had once aided her entered &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20%28instance%29\"&gt;the Nexus&lt;/a&gt; and released her from her tortured existence - an unfortunate but necessary end to a sad and tragic tale.\nQuests.\nKeristrasza in her human form is involved in a quest chain that provides reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "181359", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=181359", "title": "Keristrasza (tactics)", "text": "Keristrasza was a servant of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza the Life-Binder&lt;/a&gt;, captured by Malygos, who keeps her imprisoned inside &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20%28instance%29\"&gt;the Nexus&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Whether the tortures inflicted on Keristrasza were revenge for the death of Saragosa or a misguided attempt to turn her into an ally is known only to Malygos. Regardless of his intent, her allies have heard her cries of anguish and disturbing whispers of her diminishing mind.\"\nStrategy.\nKeristrasza is frozen in ice at the beginning of the instance. There are three usable orbs around her. Once the area is clear of any patrols, click on the orbs and she will be released. It's best to have your three DPS use the orbs, so the Tank can pick her up right away. Keep her parallel to the rest of the group. She has a tail sweep, casts Crystal Chains, Crystalfire Breath that does frostfire damage and slows attacks, and has a stackable debuff called Intense Cold that can stack up to nine times.\nAs with most dragons she has both frontal and rear cone attack, so everyone but tank should make sure to stay either on her left or right. Everyone also should jump at all times to prevent Intense Cold from stacking, stopping only briefly to finish casts with casting time if really necessary. Trying to kite her around to allow casters to stay and cast long spells will make fight slower and harder to complete. The mage spell &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Ward\"&gt;Frost Ward&lt;/a&gt; absorbs damage from Intense Cold, allowing the mage to jump less often and thus maintain a higher DPS.\nA Paladin healer may have difficulty healing the tank and moving to avoid Intense Cold. To solve this problem, the paladin healer can put Beacon of Light on himself. When he heals the rest of the group, he will heal himself through the Intense Cold damage.\nHunters, Warlocks, and Death Knights may have trouble keeping their pets alive, as Intense Cold will stack several times. You can dispel Intense Cold on your pet by clicking the \"follow\" button, and having them move. For Warlocks using an Imp and frost Mages using a Water Elemental (or any other ranged pet), you will need to move a few steps away from your pet for this to work. There is no way to keep guardian pets alive during this fight.\nCrystalfire Breath can be dispelled. It helps if there is someone in the party that can either dispel or cleanse so that they will be able to remove Crystal Chains. It will keep the targeted party member rooted for ten seconds and prevent them from clearing their Intense Cold debuff. Mages can blink out, and a PvP trinket also clears Crystal Chains. Having a Shaman in the group will help immensely here, as continuous use of &lt;a href=\"Grounding%20Totem\"&gt;Grounding Totem&lt;/a&gt; will eat every cast of Crystal Chains.\nHeroic.\nFighting her on heroic is just like fighting her on normal except for a few minor changes:\nKeristrasza on heroic is just like Keristrasza on normal with the added difficult of not being able to dodge the Intense Cold damage all the time. Having the tank jump in place turns the fight largely into a typical dragon tank 'nd spank.\nHeroic tips.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Power\"&gt;Earthen Power&lt;/a&gt;-enhanced &lt;a href=\"Earthbind%20Totem\"&gt;Earthbind Totem&lt;/a&gt; will not affect Crystal Chains, because it does not affect root effects."}

Presumably because her great strength made her different she was singled out from others, but she describes her birth family as not sticking up for her or defending her. She eventually struck out on her own, leaving her family behind and trusting no one but herself, her childhood leaving her angry and bitter. She eventually crossed paths with the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;, and its leader, &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;, invited her to join them. Silas explained that he and his carnies were a family, that they defended each other and promised that she would never be alone again.\nAs a member of the Faire, Kerri apparently gives at least two performances a day, one in the morning and another in the afternoon, demonstrating her unusual strength. In their first visit to &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; however, Kerri got into an altercation when the drunken sons of a rich local winemaker tried to attack her. When one of the sons is later found murdered, Kerri is arrested as the main suspect. Silas investigates the murder and pulls all the legal strings he can, but later finds out that the Southshore Tribunal has sentenced Kerri to hang before he will be able to get the evidence of her innocence. Silas does not care that the Faire could lose a regular business opportunity in Southshore; since he cannot get the evidence in time they will rescue her instead.\nKerri hears from the guards that the Faire packed up and left town, assuming that they've left her behind. The carnies then pull off an audacious rescue plan, which turned out to be unnecessary but completely restores Kerri's faith that her carnie family will never abandon her.\nQuotes.\n&lt;Name&gt;, it's good to see you again!

Ultimately, however, he got more than he bargained for.\nBiography.\nKervo had been all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, exploring &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; ruins, &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; vaults, and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; temples. After years of obsessive research on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; during which he theorized that it held the key to immortality, he set out in search of the lost city despite the derision of his fellow gnomes.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", Kervo can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Junkheap\"&gt;Abandoned Junkheap&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to open the locked vault door.\nMechagon.\nWhile flying through a storm and over the area where he was sure Mechagon was located, Kervo's &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt; was suddenly struck down by a lightning bolt, causing him to crash on Mechagon Island. Word of an outsider's arrival reached &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; who personally investigated the crash. Accompanied by a retinue of two other &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt;, and a companion of the prince, they found Kervo and brought him into &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon City&lt;/a&gt;. Erazmin hung back a bit out of earshot with his friend, who told the prince that they could make use of the outsider.\nWhen Kervo woke up, King Mechagon brought him on a tour of the city, explaining that the people of Mechagon were reverting the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; in order to become flawless like their &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; ancestors. The king showed Kervo how the mechanization process worked. When Kervo pointed out that the procedure looked and sounded like torture, the king replied that the pain of mechanization was only temporary compared to the constant, inescapable pain of aging and death.\nA mechagnome brought Kervo back to his chambers to prepare for a celebration the king was planning for him the following day. Erazmin approached the pair and offered to escort their guest himself. Once out of earshot of the other gnomes, Erazmin told Kervo that he had to leave the city immediately that night. He explained that the king was using Kervo and his apparent pain and weakness to drum up support among his subjects for &lt;a href=\"mechoriginator\"&gt;a device&lt;/a&gt; he planned to use to forcibly revert the Curse of Flesh among all organic life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, which Kervo had to warn his people back home about. While Kervo tried to protest that he hadn't yet found what he came for, Erazmin stated that the warning was more important. He instructed Kervo to gather his things and be ready for when the prince came to get him out of the city.\nBack in his chambers, Kervo looked over his maps and compass and decided that he couldn't leave empty-handed. He went to King Mechagon and informed him of his son's treachery. As a reward, Mechagon brought Kervo to the device Erazmin had shown him earlier, explaining that its process would be instant as opposed to the years-long mechanization process normally used. While he had never used the device on his own people before, Mechagon argued that they hadn't earned it like Kervo had.\nWhen the device was activated, Kervo was instantly transformed into a completely mechanical being but braindead, unable to do anything except repeat the words \"Found it\" over and over again. One of the technicians noted that there seemed to be some damage, and Mechagon told him to make adjustments to the device so it wouldn't malfunction when used on the entire world. As for Kervo, Mechagon was of the opinion that he had gotten what he wanted, and all the time in the world to enjoy it.\nWhen Erazmin and his companion came to escort Kervo and discovered that he was not in his guest quarters, the prince realized that the \"crazy old fool\" had given them away and that they needed to flee the city immediately before the &lt;a href=\"Arcforged\"&gt;Arcforged&lt;/a&gt; came for them.\nQuotes.\nI aspire to greatness beyond your imagination.

Eventually, she alongside her master and colleagues noticed a fire in &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Narache\"&gt;Camp Narache&lt;/a&gt;. Muln ordered her to rescue villagers. After she was done she and the other shaman had to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Bloodhoof%20Village\"&gt;Bloodhoof Village&lt;/a&gt;. There the shaman started to talk about how elements abandoned them however, a runner from Narache approached them, telling that the threat was over. \nAfter she witnessed &lt;a href=\"Shotoa\"&gt;Shotoa&lt;/a&gt;'s power, she could not determine whom to follow. She remembered her first meeting with Muln 5 years earlier where he invited her to join the Earthen Ring and eventually had to battle against some Grimtotem. Back in present, Kettara visited Muln and they spoke about Shotoa\u2019s methods and tried to convince him to have an open mind about change. Muln however, continued to believe in the old ways and rejects Shotoa\u2019s methods, no matter how much more appealing his methods look. Muln used the orcs abandoning their shamanistic ways for warlock magic as an example of change leading her people to ruin. Yet Ketarra countered that the orcs arrival to Kalimdor was an example of positive change as the orcs were able to save the tauren from the centaur. Kettara told Muln that there are times to resist change and there are times to accept it but change eventually comes naturally, thus she decided to follow Shotoa in order to learn how to unite with the elements.\nKettara and other shaman were later delivered to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; where Shotoa's betrayal was revealed. He led them to Feralas in order to have his allies, the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt;, kill the shaman. She tried to attack Shotoa, but she was quickly overwhelmed. She died after being crushed by one of Shotoa's earth elementals and passed away in Muln's arms. Eventually she was cremated along with other deceased shaman."}

Friendly players can interact with the table to gain a stack of &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; refreshments, similar to a &lt;a href=\"Soulwell\"&gt;Soulwell&lt;/a&gt;. As with &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Refreshment\"&gt;Conjure Refreshment&lt;/a&gt;, the exact type of refreshment granted varies depending on the mage's level, with level 100 tables providing &lt;a href=\"Conjured%20Mana%20Fritter\"&gt;Conjured Mana Fritter&lt;/a&gt;. The table will last for 3 minutes or until 50 stacks of refreshments have been handed out. \nEssentially a convenient group alternative to &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Refreshment\"&gt;Conjure Refreshment&lt;/a&gt;, the table's primary use is in parties to save the mage from spending excessive amounts of time conjuring refreshments. The refreshment table is commonly referred to as a \"mage table\".\nRefreshments.\nRefreshments are provided in stacks of 20. The maximum amount of any type of conjured refreshment a character can have in his/her inventory is limited to 80 (4 stacks). Refreshments are &lt;a href=\"conjured%20item\"&gt;conjured item&lt;/a&gt;s, and as such will disappear after being logged out for 15 minutes.\nThe exact refreshments provided by tables depends on the level of the casting mage. Since this also determines the required level for use of those refreshments, players even a few levels below that of the mage may be unable to use the refreshments provided by the table. There is no way for mages to summon a lower-level version of the table.\nBelow is an incomplete list of the various refreshments provided by the table:\nTips.\nThe refreshments provided by &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Refreshment\"&gt;Conjure Refreshment&lt;/a&gt; and Conjure Refreshment Table are functionally equivalent, and both spells have a 3 second cast. The difference between the two lies in the method of delivery:\n\"Mage tables\" are often requested by players at the start of &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, while the team is preparing. Mages who are able should go to the trouble of conjuring one, allowing their teammates to stock up on refreshments. This can help reduce downtime in the battleground, improving their team's chances of success. Mage tables are usually appreciated by players, saving them time and money otherwise spent acquiring food and drink, and the refreshments provided can also be consumed outside the battleground such as while levelling or doing &lt;a href=\"dailies\"&gt;dailies&lt;/a&gt;. Players who see a mage table should do their best to take advantage of it, ideally acquiring the maximum 4 stacks for use in the future.\nHistory.\nThis spell was introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt; as Ritual of Refreshment. On the &lt;a href=\"PTR\"&gt;PTR&lt;/a&gt;, it originally required a to create, but this was changed to during testing. Channeling the spell created a portal which party members could click to assist in the summoning of a Refreshment Table; two party members were required to join in channeling the effect in order to summon a table.\nLearning Ritual of Refreshment used to require already knowing &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Water\"&gt;Conjure Water&lt;/a&gt; (Rank 9) and &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Food\"&gt;Conjure Food&lt;/a&gt; (Rank 8). These spells used to be only learnable from two rare books, &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Conjure%20Water%20IX\"&gt;Tome of Conjure Water IX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Conjure%20Food%20VIII\"&gt;Tome of Conjure Food VIII&lt;/a&gt;, respectively, which dropped in level 70 instances. With \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" this requirement was removed, and the spell made available to any mage of the appropriate level.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; simplified the spell substantially, changing it from a channeled summoning effect to a simple 3 second cast. Other players were no longer required to participate in order to complete the cast, and the reagent cost was removed. The name of the spell was also changed at this time to Conjure Refreshment Table."}
{"id": "15500", "revid": "49848256", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15500", "title": "Conjure Water", "text": "&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConjure Water is a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; spell that provides the caster with mana-replenishing &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;s. There is no limit to the amount of water a mage may conjure or carry, aside from inventory limitations. Conjured drinks stack to 20, and can be &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;d to other players. &lt;a href=\"Conjured%20item\"&gt;Conjured item&lt;/a&gt;s disappear if logged out for more than 15 minutes.\nNotes.\nWhen you first receive each rank of this spell, you can summon 2 bottles of the new type of water. Each level afterward, you can summon 2 more bottles per cast up to a maximum of 20. An exception is ranks 7, 8 and 9, which will conjure 10 bottles when first learned. Examples:\nFor the higher levels a better quality mana source can be learned with &lt;a href=\"Conjure%20Refreshment\"&gt;Conjure Refreshment&lt;/a&gt;.\nTips and Tactics.\nBe sure to summon some water as soon as you log in. Party members and random players will also ask you for water, especially at high levels, when store-bought drinks get very expensive.\nAs a mage, you'll be drinking so much water you'll wonder why your &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;Gnome&lt;/a&gt; hasn't bloated like a well-fed tick. Mages kill things very fast, and this is balanced with longer downtime (which, to be fair, is a minute at worst). Get used to having a sit and drink some water.\nTry not to think about what the first rank of water is if it's not \"purified\" or at least \"fresh\". Apparently focus groups didn't respond well to \"Summon Dishwater\"."}

Conjured items function like normal items during play, but they will disappear when the character logs out (or gets disconnected) for 15 minutes or more. Conjured items cannot be sold on the auction house nor to a vendor, although some can be &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt;d to another character, and you could charge money for the conjured item in the trade.\nNotable conjured items:\nConjuring items via a spell will consumes mana, so plan ahead and ask the mage or warlock for the item before the battle starts as mana is a critical resource for them.\nNote that the items are a class of items, and the unique items are unique for each specific item within that class; for instance, a mage could be carrying several different Mana Gems, but although a warlock could create and give away several different healthstones, any one person can only have one healthstone of any level at a given time. In the mage's case, this has diminishing benefit; each item takes an inventory slot, since uniques do not stack, and the benefits scale with the level of the conjuration, so only the top couple currently conjurable will be significantly beneficial.\nRemoved.\nSince patch &lt;a href=\"3.0.2\"&gt;3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, these conjured items do not fade after logging out for any length of time:\nAlso note that although a warlock could carry multiple soulstones, firestones, and spellstones of different levels, each of these items is used only one at a time, so there is no point to doing so. Soulstones have an application cooldown that ensures that a warlock can have only one soulstone applied at a time. Firestones and Spellstones are akin to &lt;a href=\"Wizard%20Oils\"&gt;Wizard Oils&lt;/a&gt; (these occupied the wand slot prior to &lt;a href=\"Echoes%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Echoes of Doom&lt;/a&gt;), and so are applied actively for an hour each."}

They are practitioners of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; arts, having learned through researching the ancient tomes to bend the forces of nature to do their will. They can make the energies of nature strike down opponents, summon forth great creatures or command the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s. They are specialized in the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%23Schools%20of%20arcane%20magic\"&gt;school of conjuration&lt;/a&gt;, the study of magically creating creatures and objects, which they use to notably summon and control &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; familiars. Therefore, most conjurers are primarily &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHowever, among those who practice &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;secular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt;, some may be called \"conjurers\". Those &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s are specialized in the summoning of &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nConjurers of Stormwind.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, there was an order of conjurers who served the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. They were a secretive sect, and would only gather and train in their own specially-prepared mystic &lt;a href=\"Tower%20%28WC1%20Human%29\"&gt;towers&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;royal household&lt;/a&gt; had its own &lt;a href=\"Court%20Conjurer\"&gt;court conjurer&lt;/a&gt; as well as several conjurer-lords. The most famous conjurer of his time was &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt;, father of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Last Guardian&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh himself had rebuked dozens of failed apprentices, most of them from Stormwind and discreetly sent by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mages of Stormwind were considered by their northern brethren as &lt;a href=\"hedge%20wizard\"&gt;hedge wizard&lt;/a&gt;s as they were not pupils of the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, though some of them still belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. But this didn't mean that they were rogue mages or unorganized, for Stormwind had its own magical academy back then.\nThe wizards of Stormwind were first intrigued and then terrified by the orcs' appearance, and sent many letters with information and then requests for aid to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; as the situation grew more dire for them. The northern mages appreciated the orcs' danger but thought them little more than a local nuisance, confined to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;that continent&lt;/a&gt;, and as such didn't do much to help. During the conflict, Stormwind's spellcasters were individually stronger than the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, but were far fewer in numbers and couldn't work in unison as well as the invaders.\nAfter the conclusion of the First War, the order was left utterly decimated by the Horde, but the Lordaeron &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s who participated in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; learned of their defeat and trained themselves in more aggressive and destructive &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s.\nConjuror of the Tirisgarde.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt; was reformed in presence of many of Azeroth's greatest mages in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20the%20Guardian\"&gt;Hall of the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, where they pledged allegiance to the order under the leadership of the \"&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Conjuror of the Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;\", a title that symbolizes the responsibility borne by the Tirisgarde. \nAfter they managed to defeat &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt; and imprison him in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Citadel\"&gt;Violet Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the Conjuror of the Tirisgarde were given the title of \"Archmage\" by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; for their exploits.\nIn the RPG.\nConjurers are capable of summoning &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s as well as casting such potently destructive spells like &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Blast\"&gt;Elemental Blast&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, who focused on various aspects of the arcane arts, conjurers were primarily concerned with elemental and summoning magics. Conjurers sometimes become &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, highly specialized spellcasters who traffick with demonic entities. Upon becoming a warlock, the conjurer increases its devotion to the conjuration &lt;a href=\"magic%20schools%20%28RPG%29\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;, yet must forsake study in two other schools."}

They are quite weak and vulnerable, and chances are that they will die if a melee unit manages to get close to them, so they must be protected. Conjurers are very expensive and easy to kill, so sometimes it is better to leave them at the base and make them summon Water Elementals from there. If attacking the enemy base, make sure that the Conjurer uses Rain of Fire, as it brings destruction to everything in its path (including your own units!).\nConjurers use Mana to cast spells. Mana will slowly regenerate over time, up to a maximum of 255.\nSpells.\nConjurers maintain a close relationship with the &lt;a href=\"element\"&gt;element&lt;/a&gt;s about them, and the ability to focus those forces is the basis of this spell. This channeling manifests itself as a sphere of charged energy that issues forth from the hands, enabling the caster to strike an enemy from a great distance. This is one of the basic &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; taught to conjurers and serves as the cornerstone for training the caster in focusing both mind and will to the task of summoning.\nThe caster calls upon the creatures of the desert by magically transporting them to do his bidding. They are under the conjurer's direction and will do his bidding to the death. Research has proven that it is simpler for the conjurer to transport several smaller scorpions in a short time than to drain his energies further by summoning a single, large creature.\nThe caster uses the forces of nature to create a &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;. He summons the forces of air and water and combines them into a simulacrum to defend the lands. They are excellent creatures, and will never turn upon their creators. The element of water was chosen because it is persistent as in the state of erosion, and it is the opposite of fire, which seems to be the element that the Orcs favor.\nThis is a very powerful spell that combines the natures of flame and water. It calls forth the essence of fire and delivers it through massive thunderheads of vapor and brimstone, creating an actual firestorm. This spell is very destructive, and will cause damage to any foes and buildings in its sphere of influence. Use this spell with care, for the rain of fire knows no friends."}

Connected realms behave as if they are one cohesive realm, meaning players are able to join the same guilds, trade and access a single shared Auction House, in addition to able to share the same mythic raid lockouts prior to the hall of fame closing.\nThe first realms were connected 2013-10-25, and continued regularly with the bulk of the original connections completed by 2014-10-08. Since then, additional realm connections have occurred only occasionally.\nGeneral information.\nCharacters in a Connected Realm are able to send mail to characters on other realms in the Connected Realm, and to friend, whisper, and group with characters on other realms in the Connected Realm. Characters in a Connected Realm may join a guild on any realm in their Connected Realm.\nAll realms in a Connected Realm share a common Auction House. All realms in a Connected Realm share a common Trade Chat. Custom chat channels also work between Connected Realms.\nCharacters on different realms within a Connected Realm may have the same name, as may guilds. Only the name (and guild, if any) is displayed above a character's head, but if a character is on a different realm within the Connected Realm, chats, whispers, and the character's tooltip will show the character's name, followed by a dash (\"-\") and the name of that character's realm. The same conventions are followed within character tooltips for guild names if the other character is in a guild on a different realm.\nThe names of characters in lists such as guild Rosters and Who Lists who are on other realms within a Connected Realm are appended with a dash followed by their realm name. When addressing in-game mail to characters on another realm within a Connected Realm, the recipient character's name must have a dash and the other character's realm name appended.\nThe current limit of 11 characters on each individual realm is not affected by Connected Realms. Players are therefore allowed to create 11 characters on \"each\" Connected Realm, allowing for an overall total of far more than 11 characters on the combined virtual realm. Players who have already reached the character limit on their own realm may therefore wish to create new characters on a Connected Realm, with negligible difference. This provides new possibilities for players with regard to character limits, and effectively redefines the realm character limit as 11 x number of Connected Realms.\nWhen a Connected Realm is selected for services such as free character moves or new player recommendations, that will affect all of the realms in a given connection.\nBlizzard are considering the possibility of merging individual Connected Realm forums in order to provide a single communal forum for all players on Connected Realms.\nIn some cases, realm times may be adjusted to match each other as a part of the connection process.\nFAQ.\nBlue posts.\n&lt;a href=\"Vaneras\"&gt;Vaneras&lt;/a&gt; has stated the following regarding the eventual target population for Connected Realms:\nFaction balance on Connected Realms has also been the subject of much discussion on the official forums:\nVaneras has stated that while Connected Realms are not intended to correct population problems on high or full population servers, the implementation of the technology may eventually help with these problems:\nExternal links.\nUS\nEU"}

The box is somewhere within the &lt;a href=\"Stockpile\"&gt;Stockpile&lt;/a&gt; - the cavern complex at the back of &lt;a href=\"Kurzen%27s%20Compound\"&gt;Kurzen's Compound&lt;/a&gt;.\nIf this secure strongbox is found, and the small brass key can open it, then perhaps the mystery behind Thorsen's detection will be revealed.\nProgress.\nThe strongbox is bound in bronze, very sturdy, and very heavy.\nCompletion.\nOpening the strongbox, it's clear that this is where Herod keeps his more valuable coins and items.\nGains.\nUpon completion of this quest you will gain:\nNotes.\nYou've saved Thorsen from ambush. You've located the Bookies office and searched through his papers. The trail is still fresh, and you are about to discover how hot things can get. You must travel deep within the Stockpile, a dark and dangerous cave at the back of Kurzen's Compound. The enemy here is numerous, and will attack the unwary with little warning. Their hatred of the Alliance is complete. Because of the number of these Kurzen scum, and their preference to attack in swarms, you might want to bring some friends with you if you plan to venture into the cave.\nFor those adventurers on their way to deal with Colonel Kurzen himself, you will pass right by the box you seek. After you turn to go up the ramp, you will find a location where the cavern opens up a bit. There will be a ledge on the right covered with many boxes and crates, as the path curves down and slightly to the left. There are many of the enemy here, and they do not stay defeated long, so you need to fight fast. This is why a group of friends may be helpful. You are looking for a small box, located near the far end of the line of crates. It is easy to miss, unless you are looking for it from the side closest to the path. You will use the Small Brass Key you found in Bookie Herod's Records, and the box should open right up. The key will be consumed by this process.\nBe sure you have room in your bags for two items. You will receive a nice mace as reward for finding the box; and also a Muddy Note, which will lead you further in your search for the traitor.\nThere are reports that characters with stealth capability (Rogues and Druids in Prowl) can sneak their way in to the box, and complete this quest very quickly before too many of the Kurzen scum notice you are there. Other abilities like Distract and Sap can also help. Good luck if you choose to try this. Having friends around for this part of the quest chain will prove helpful to those without the ability to sneak around."}

The Warsong Clan drank the blood and became &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20orc\"&gt;Chaos orc&lt;/a&gt;s imbued with a bloodlust and demonic powers. With these new powers, the Orcs easily overcame the Sentinels and slew Cenarius, forcing the Night Elves to retreat back into the depths of the forests.\nHellscream's sense of victory was short-lived, however. Mannoroth appeared before him and declared that the Orcs would serve the Burning Legion once again, despite Hellscream's feeble protests that they were \"free\"."}

It is advised to ensure this achievement is not botched that nobody uses &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt;s as it may prematurely kill the add. The tank has to stand on the table tanking the add while the sword is lowering and take the AoE damage as well. The achievement will be earned the instant the add is killed by the AoE.\nSvala will use her Ritual attack once (and only once) immediately after she falls below 50% health. When soloing this achievement at a high level, be careful that you don't kill Svala or the Hulk in one hit, or leave a DoT that will kill either of them before the ritual completes. You may need to remove some of your gear to prevent this from happening.\nIf the Ritual of the Sword does not kill the Hulk outright, you can still get credit for the achievement if you kill the Hulk before the Ritual's DoT on the hulk expires."}
