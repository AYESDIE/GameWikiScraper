Having one of them in your log prevents you from accepting the other two, should it be offered that day. In other words, should you not complete one of them on the day you accept it, you will not be able to do either of the other two quests the following day. This means that you should do all three daily quests on the day you accept them if you want to complete \"Up To The Challenge\" in three days. \nCompleting the four available valiant dailies will reward and 5x each day.\nReputation Considerations.\nOver the course of championing all five faction's cities you can expect to gain 11,250 reputation with each capital city. Keep this in mind when considering champion-level quest rewards. The can only be used to buy reputation tokens worth 250 reputation with one city at a time. Do not purchase reputation with a faction when you can reasonably expect to reach exalted status while doing the valiant chain for the rest of the cities. The is a better alternative for players who already have high reputation with their faction's cities. It is also possible to continue doing a faction's valiant-level quests, earning reputation with that faction, if one does not turn in the \"The Valiant's Charge\" quest with that faction.\nIn the past completion of city-faction dailies would award 250 reputation for the related city and 62 \"splash\" reputation for allied cities. Those wishing to use the Argent Tournament to become exalted with all Alliance (or Horde) cities would use spreadsheets to optimize the amount of time they lingered at valiant level with each city. The \"splash reputation was removed\" some point prior to patch 4.0.6 and spreadsheets are no longer necessary. This effectively halved the amount of reputation gained by lingering at Valiant level (250 instead of 250+248). People wishing to achieve exalted with their faction cities can also run dungeons wearing the city tabards.\nTwo of the daily quests and the items sold by &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Evniki%20Kapsalis\"&gt;Dame Evniki Kapsalis&lt;/a&gt; (such as &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Pony%20Bridle\"&gt;Argent Pony Bridle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusader%27s%20Tabard\"&gt;Argent Crusader's Tabard&lt;/a&gt;) are restricted to players with the &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20%28title%29\"&gt;Crusader&lt;/a&gt; title which requires exalted reputation with the five faction cities.\nChampion dailies.\n\"N.B: &lt;a href=\"Threat%20From%20Above\"&gt;Threat From Above&lt;/a&gt; requires the completion of &lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Knight%27s%20Fall\"&gt;The Black Knight's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. See above for the The Black Knight chain.\"\n\"Completing these dailies will reward and up to 4x or 4x each day.\"\n\"Also available for players not with the Argent Crusade is &lt;a href=\"Contributin%27%20To%20The%20Cause\"&gt;Contributin' To The Cause&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nCrusader dailies.\nIn order to be eligible for these quests, players are required to have earned the title . Several daily quests are offered randomly each day, one from each questgiver:\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Crusader%20Adelard\"&gt;High Crusader Adelard&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Silverdawn\"&gt;Crusader Silverdawn&lt;/a&gt;\nSilver Covenant (Alliance) / Sunreavers (Horde) dailies.\nIn order to be eligible for these quests, players are required to have earned the achievement &lt;a href=\"A%20Silver%20Confidant\"&gt;A Silver Confidant&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Sunreavers%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;The Sunreavers (achievement)&lt;/a&gt; by being with the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; and being a &lt;a href=\"champion\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of at least one racial faction.

In &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, the Tournament Grounds' defenses were reinforced with three guard towers - one between the Coliseum and &lt;a href=\"Deathspeaker%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Deathspeaker's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, one near the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant%20Pavilion\"&gt;Silver Covenant Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;, and one near the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Pavilion\"&gt;Sunreaver Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo start the quest-chain of the area, &lt;a href=\"Justicar%20Mariel%20Trueheart\"&gt;Justicar Mariel Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; is present inside the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Pavilion\"&gt;Argent Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; just to the west of the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;, while the northern part of the building serves as a &lt;a href=\"chapel\"&gt;chapel&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Confessor%20Paletress\"&gt;Argent Confessor Paletress&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; are respectively represented by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant%20Pavilion\"&gt;Silver Covenant Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Pavilion\"&gt;Sunreaver Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuilt during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade put time and effort into building a sturdy stone arena and a tilting ground as a way to search out the elite warriors they thought had the best chance of taking a run at &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, since throwing a whole army against the undead would only have increased the number of troops in the armies of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; announced the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, an event that would, among other things, attempt to create some semblance of order between the ever disparate Horde and Alliance, but also to train this large army in preparation for an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s bastion, and more importantly, to determine the very best fighters present who would then be used to create a small strike force that would lead the charge into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. The reasoning behind using a small force to spearhead their assault lay in the fact that any great loss of life that they might suffer would only serve to reinforce the Scourge, and subsequently might leave the rest of the world open to attack. The tournament was also a chance to try to heal the wounds from the disaster at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, but it was too soon.\nThough criticized, both &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, respectively accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, made appearances on these grounds and agreed to observe some of the tournament's trials in the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. Both factions were then represented by the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant%20Pavilion\"&gt;Silver Covenant Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Pavilion\"&gt;Sunreaver Pavilion&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Peacekeeper\"&gt;Argent Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt;s maintained a constant vigil throughout the grounds, policing the tournament to ensure there was no conflict between the Horde and Alliance.\nHowever, the tournament drew the attention of the Lich King, who sent forces to disrupt it in a number of ways, with assaults and kidnappings from the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, the infiltration of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament, and attacks from &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, partly in an attempt to free &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20Twins\"&gt;some of their kind&lt;/a&gt; which the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s had captured, though they were unable to inflict any lasting damage. Towards the end of the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King himself appeared in the coliseum and reminded those gathered that the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;nerubian empire&lt;/a&gt; extended far across and beneath the entire continent, then proceeded to shatter the very floor of the tournament grounds, dropping the Crusade's champions deep into a series of underground tunnels to confront a resurrected &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the ambush, Anub'arak was vanquished, marking the conclusion of the Argent Tournament, and the beginning of the assault on Icecrown Citadel.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, the tournament grounds came under concentrated attack by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and became the Crusade's main base of operations in fighting the undead back. As the attack was as sudden as it was unexpected, many valiants laid wounded, while the civilians participated in defending the area as best as they could. Consequently, &lt;a href=\"Justicar%20Mariel%20Trueheart\"&gt;Justicar Mariel Trueheart&lt;/a&gt; requested the support of the Crusade's forces in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, they managed to repel the undead and save the lives of many injured.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the tournament grounds have been remade into a place for the Argent Crusade and any who would fight the Scourge to train. They still get the occasional incursion of Scourge, but the undead are aimless once more.\nIn Hearthstone.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the Tournament Grounds continued to be used in the name of fun, becoming the setting for , the second expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Originally a &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic people cultivating a primitive &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;-based society, the orcs were corrupted by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lord of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and manipulated into forming a bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; that waged war on the peaceful &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; race. Rampant demonic corruption caused the orcs to be filled with bloodlust and turned their normally brown skin into shades of green, culminating with Kil'jaeden's servant &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; convincing the orc chieftains to &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;drink the blood&lt;/a&gt; of the demon &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and thereby enslaving them to the Burning Legion's will. The few orcs who escaped the corruption became known as &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;mag'har&lt;/a&gt; (\"uncorrupted\").\nAfter conquering Draenor, the Horde invaded the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and waged war upon the world's native kingdoms, until Azeroth's nations united into an &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; that managed to defeat the invaders and enslave most of the survivors. Yet, the shamanistic tradition of the orcs managed to rekindle from the ashes as a young shaman named &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; arose to become &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; and lead his people in their darkest hour. He reunited the clans into a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;new Horde&lt;/a&gt; and led the orcs out of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; they had been forced to invade and into the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where the orcs finally freed themselves from demonic corruption and briefly united with Azeroth's other races to stand against an invasion of the Burning Legion. Seeking to begin a new existence on Kalimdor for themselves and other newfound member races of the Horde, the orcs founded the nation of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the great city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs time passed, conflicts between the Alliance and Horde reemerged. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall passed leadership of the Horde to the reckless &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, whose actions plunged the Horde into civil war. After being deposed, Hellscream traveled to an in the time before the original Horde's invasion of Azeroth. There, he rallied the orc clans into an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u2014free of demonic corruption but still bent on conquest\u2014to invade the main universe's Azeroth. History ultimately repeated itself as the Iron Horde succumbed to the Burning Legion's will before being defeated by the forces of Azeroth, with the uncorrupted remnants of the Iron Horde subsequently renaming themselves . Years later, these uncorrupted orcs were recruited into Azeroth's Horde and joined their main universe brethren.\nHistory.\nOrigins and early history.\nOrcs can trace their lineage back to &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;, the enormous stone giant created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Evergrowth\"&gt;Evergrowth&lt;/a&gt; and the plant-like &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s of ancient &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. As Grond and the Sporemounds fought, pieces of the battling leviathans fell to the earth and gave rise to the &lt;a href=\"colossal\"&gt;colossal&lt;/a&gt;s, children of Grond, and the &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;, children of the Sporemounds. After Grond's death, the colossals continued fighting the Sporemound &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt; and its minions, but over time many of the stone giants succumbed to their foes. From the colossals' remains, new creatures known as &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; emerged. After the colossals sacrificed themselves to destroy Botaan in a massive explosion, spores from the plant creature's body, teeming with the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit of Life&lt;/a&gt;, drifted back to Draenor's surface and clung to the hides of the magnaron, weakening their bodies and turning them to flesh. Some of the magnaron devolved into beings called &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, and due to the lingering effects of the spores, a small number of gronn continued degenerating into the &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;. Over thousands of years, the residual spores transformed a number of ogron into the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; race, from whom would arise yet another race \u2014 the orcs. The smallest and weakest of Grond's line, the orcs made up for what they lacked in size and strength with a fierce intellect and a sense of community. By banding together, they survived the harsh wilds.\nBy the time that the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; empire fell, 1,200 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the children of stone had grown in number and spread across the land. The ogres and orcs quickly learned to fear the ogron's attention, and the orcs stayed far away from ogron lands. The largest orc settlement at the time was in a massive cave network beneath &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;. While it was not a bountiful region, the orcs preferred a life of freedom in meager conditions over suffering as slaves of the ogron.\nFormation of the orc clans.\nWhen the ogres revolted against their ogron masters, the hierarchy of survival on Draenor was dramatically altered and the two greatest threats to Gorgrond's orcs \u2014 the gronn and the ogron \u2014 were eliminated. By the time of 800 years before the Dark Portal, the orcs, no longer confined to their underground caverns, began forging permanent settlements on Draenor's surface for the first time in generations. The orc population exploded, and overpopulation and lack of prey to hunt became a serious issue. Tensions between families simmered, but before war erupted many orcs migrated out of Gorgrond in search of new land to settle. Those who remained in Gorgrond formed the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightning%27s%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Lightning's Blade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; clans. Those who migrated east found themselves drawn to &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;, where they adopted a savage, superstitious mindset. Those who kept their sanity became the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, while those who lost themselves to dark impulses were exiled and over time formed another, smaller clan known as the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewers&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs who journeyed west of Gorgrond settled in the icy &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaws&lt;/a&gt; learned to adapt to the environment, while the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; instead sought to dominate the land. In the south, three clans settled in the mountains and plains of fertile &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Redwalker%20clan\"&gt;Redwalkers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewinds&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; migrated farther southwest and roamed the plains of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, while to the southeast the peaceful &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; formed in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese new &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;orcish clans&lt;/a&gt; gradually isolated themselves from each others, only meeting up at special occasions like the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festivals. This is what kept peace between them, but also at a cost: individual friendship between orcs of different clans became gradually seen as an anomaly, something almost impossible, like friendship between a &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"talbuk\"&gt;talbuk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first shaman.\nMystics from the Shadowmoon clan frequently ventured across the world on pilgrimages, hoping to hear the will of the divine. Many of these travelers received strange dreams and visions near the mountains of northwestern Nagrand, which unbeknownst to the orcs was the final resting place of Grond and a place infused with &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; energies. The first Shadowmoon visitors to the location learned about the world's &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;primordial spirits&lt;/a&gt; of fire, air, earth and water. They treated these beings with utmost respect and named the site of their discovery the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs flocked to Grond's remains and learned to guide the elemental spirits with a sense of harmony, and in return received astonishing powers unlike any seen by the orcs before. The Shadowmoon were the first to dedicate themselves to the elements and transformed Grond's head into a crude temple. They soon began spreading their teachings to the other clans, nearly all of which adopted the practice. Young orcs were raised to be steadfast allies of the elements, and fledgling shaman traveled to the Throne of the Elements to seek the spirits' blessing, entering trances to attune their minds to the elements. However, during this process &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;a few orcs&lt;/a&gt; glimpsed the realm of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, and what they saw drove them insane, leading them to being exiled from their clans and forced to live in seclusion in the caves beneath Nagrand. White skulls were tattooed on their faces, marking them as \"dead\" to their people. Those orcs who were welcomed by the elements returned to their clans as spiritual leaders whose counsel was highly valued. The bond between shaman crossed clan boundaries, allowing them to peacefully solve conflicts, and the Shadowmoon clan began a biannual gathering called the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg%20celebration\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival. Initially only a gathering for shaman, it soon grew to include all orcs.\nThe destruction of Goria.\nFor generations, the orc clans lived on the fringes of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; of the ogres, engaging in occasional territorial disputes but never committing to all-out war against the ogres. The Gorian had little interest in (or fear of) the orcs and saw their practice of shamanism as little more than quaint trickery, but when they witnessed the power of a shaman first-hand they decided to take this power by force. 403 years before the Dark Portal, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt; sent an army to drive away the orcs from the Throne of the Elements and begin experimenting on the power there. One day, the dissonance between the ogres' magic and the residual energies lingering in the remains of Grond, from whose head the Throne had been formed, caused an explosion that blew apart the orcish temple at the site. The incident threw the elements out of balance all across Draenor, causing great storms, but Molok simply sent more spellcasters to replace the ones that had been killed by the explosion.\nAt the next year's Kosh'harg festival, the Shadowmoon elder shaman &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt; pleaded for action, lest all of the clans suffer disastrous famines as a result of the elements' imbalance. The clans agreed to join together, and Nelgarm called upon the elements to bless them with their protection. The united orc army took back the Throne of the Elements with little bloodshed, but Imperator Molok was quick to retaliate. The Gorian armies moved en masse, and total war engulfed Draenor, and now every orcish male, female and child had to be prepared to fight. The ogres imagined that this merciless tactic would strike terror into the hearts of the orcs, but the clans rose to the challenge and small, mobile groups of raiders slowly dismantled the Gorian Empire's network of fortresses and outposts, pushing the ogre armies back to their capital, &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe orcs kept their distance on the hills surrounding the city, content to starve their enemy out. As the siege progressed and the ogres found maintaining their empire to be increasingly unsustainable, Molok and his sorcerers revisited their &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt;, searching for a way to break the siege. In time, they discovered the arakkoan legend about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, and began experimenting with ways to create a similar affliction among the orcs. They succeeded, and soon the so-called &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; spread like wildfire through the orcs' encampments, culling vast amounts of the orcish combatants. Nelgarm and his fellow shaman, realizing that the pox was an unseen attack from the ogres and that the siege was now doomed to fail, beseeched the elements to destroy Goria. The orcs and the elemental spirits both understood that Molok would resume meddling with the Throne of the Elements if the orcs failed, and so the spirits unleashed their fury upon Goria. Over hours, lightning, fire, and earthquakes ravaged the ogre capital until nothing but ash and rubble remained, before the earth itself wrenched open like a giant maw to swallow Molok and the remains of his great city whole.\nOnly whispers of the event would reach the other Gorian cities, but those whispers were enough to discourage further tampering with the elements. The orcs were victorious, but they had suffered massive losses and witnessed a destructive power they never wanted to see again. Nelgarm and the other shaman were particularly frightened by the elementals' wrath and said that the need for a unified orc army had passed. There was little argument, and the orc clans returned to their lands. The Gorian Empire never recovered. The ogre outposts and fortresses gradually became more akin to individual city-states than a unified nation. The orcs began to seize ogre lands by force, gradually surpassing them as the most advanced, dominant race on the world \u2014 that is, until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; 200 years later.\nThe arrival of the draenei changed orcish society. With the crash of the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\" ship in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs adopted the new crystal mountain as &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, \"Mountain of Spirits\". The orcs started holding their &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festivals at the foot of Oshu'gun, communing there with their dead ancestors' spirits. The draenei themselves were peaceful toward the orcs; coming now and then to each clan, ready to trade their carefully crafted tools and weapons and decorative pieces of carved stone in exchange for the thick pelts of the forest animals, brightly woven blankets, and raw materials the ores culled from land and stone. For the orcs, the relationship was a curiosity, an occasion of interest in the clans, but the exchanges only lasted a few hours. The draenei did not invite closeness, and no clan leader had ever asked them to stay and share their hospitality. Relationships were cordial but aloof, and everyone involved seemed to want it that way.\nThe Rise of the Horde.\nAfter investigating of the world, the powerful demon lord &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; tricked the head shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; by appearing as a spirit of an orc ancestor. He convinced Ner'zhul that the draenei were conspiring against the orcs, and were planning on attacking. Ner'zhul began raiding the draenei hoping to be the savior of his race.\nWith the mass murder of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the elements refused to aid the orcs in their war. Believing that the elements had turned on them, the orcs turned to Ner'zhul. He went to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; to speak with the spirits directly and learned the truth about Kil'jaeden. Refusing to help Kil'jaeden any further, Ner'zhul was replaced by his apprentice &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as the spiritual leader of the clans. Gul'dan cared little for the orcs and readily agreed to follow Kil'jaeden in exchange for more power.\nAfter being taught by Kil'jaeden, Gul'dan established &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; schools to replace the shaman powers the orcs had lost. To consolidate his power, Gul'dan united the clans into the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; under Blackhand as Warchief and formed the Shadow Council to pull the strings from the shadows. Over the next few years, the entire race was corrupted by fel energy and began turning green.\nOn the eve of the final assault on the draenei at &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan presented the clan chieftains with Mannoroth's blood. The resulting bloodlust allowed them to easily overrun the city, ending the war. Believing the orcs to have fulfilled their purpose, Kil'jaeden abandoned them. Completely devoured by their demonic bloodlust and without new enemies to fight, many orc clans began fighting amongst themselves. Petty rivalries escalated into full-scale bloodbaths, and total chaos descended upon orcish society. The few remaining draenei took advantage of this and started a guerrilla campaign that continues to this day.\nBy using the promise of new lands to conquer on worlds other than Draenor, the Shadow Council was able to form a tenuous unity within the Horde. Gul'dan and his warlocks began probing the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, desperately searching for new worlds within easy reach before the clans' bloodlust exploded beyond control.\nOne night, an extremely powerful entity touched the thoughts of Gul'dan. Identifying himself as a servant of Kil'jaeden's master, Medivh enticed Gul'dan with the power of &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras' Tomb&lt;/a&gt;. He also presented images of the vibrant lands of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadow Council, despite the debate over Medivh's true intentions, decided to do Medivh's bidding and spent several months constructing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Invasion of Azeroth.\nWith time and much effort the orcish warlocks were able to expand the rift enough to allow orcs to squeeze through. Though their first scouts were driven mad, either by the rift itself or by what they had seen, the council was able to confirm that on the other side of the rift was the world Medivh had shown them. A small contingent of orcs was sent through the stabilized rift, now known as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, to scout and construct a base of operations.\nThe caution urged by the Shadow Council fell on deaf ears when the clan chieftains learned of how seemingly weak the native &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of the area were. Bloodlust soon overcame the Horde, and they launched a preemptive strike against the most powerful establishment of humans in the area, the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Lead by &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clan and &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, this attack ended in a humiliating defeat for the Horde. Each chieftain blamed the other for this failure, and the Horde split into two factions. The Shadow Council attempted to reunite the Horde, but could not act directly, and so they chose an avatar to act as their puppet ruler: &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; the Destroyer was named Warchief of all the Horde once again.\nWar continues.\nUnder Blackhand's iron fist, order was restored. It was then that Medivh once again made contact with Gul'dan. Medivh seemed even more powerful, but less sane. Medivh ordered Gul'dan to have the Horde destroy the Kingdom of Stormwind, and make Medivh the new ruler of the humans. Gul'dan initially refused to do Medivh's bidding; after all, the Horde had a new target and Medivh's usefulness, in Gul'dan's eyes, had run out. Desperate to see his plans succeed, Medivh tempted Gul'dan by promising to reveal the location of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the lord of the Burning Legion and Kil'jaeden's master. And so the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; between the Horde and the humans of Azeroth occurred, ending with the destruction of the Kingdom of Stormwind.\nNear the beginning of that conflict the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the very few clans of orcs that had rejected the demonic gifts of Kil'jaeden, was exiled to Azeroth and its leader &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; was murdered by Gul'dan's forces as a warning. His infant son was left for dead but was taken in by a nobleman from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; fleeing the carnage of Stormwind. The Frostwolves, leaderless, fled to the far northern mountains. Toward the end of the war, a surgical strike was launched by the humans to kill the treacherous Medivh. As Medivh was assaulted, Gul'dan felt the psychic trauma waves that Medivh emanated and realized that his chance to obtain the power of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was about to slip out of his grasp. He entered Medivh's mind and attempted to steal the location of the Tomb of Sargeras while Medivh was weakened and distracted. It was at this moment that Medivh died, and Gul'dan, having been in his mind at the time of death, was thrown into a coma. \nWhen he awoke, Gul'dan learned of a major power shift within the horde. Blackhand the Destroyer had been overthrown by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; after he had learned of Blackhand's role in corrupting the Horde. Doomhammer was not as gullible or easily swayed as Blackhand had been, and quickly discovered the Shadow Council's presence in orcish affairs. He completely eradicated the Council through accusations of treason. Gul'dan survived only by 'swearing' allegiance to Doomhammer, and by promising to provide a vast undead army for the Horde's use. He formed the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20Clan\"&gt;Stormreaver Clan&lt;/a&gt; and began the process of re-animating the corpses of fallen knights with the spirits of the fallen members of the Shadow Council. \nThese new Death Knights, along with other fel projects(such as the capture of the &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;), gave the Horde enough strength to advance steadily north despite facing the might of the unprecedented &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; of all the human nations (&lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and the magical forces of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;). The elven nation of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; sent support to the Alliance, and after the Horde took their beloved lands of Khaz Modan, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s gladly joined the ranks of the Alliance. When the Kingdom of Alterac betrayed the Alliance, the victory of the Horde seemed inevitable, but the Horde was to suffer a betrayal of their own.\nGul'dan's folly.\nWith victory in sight, Gul'dan convinced Cho'gall of the Twilight's Hammer clan that he knew the location of the Tomb of Sargeras. Together, along with the Stormreaver clan, they abandoned their posts and set out to claim the demonic power for their own. This loss of nearly a third of the Horde brought their campaign to a standstill at the doorstep of Lordaeron. Doomhammer, furious with the insubordination at such a critical time, deployed a large portion of his own forces to attack the deserting clans and their leaders. This allowed the Alliance forces to rally and crush the Horde while they were divided. With the destruction of the Dark Portal the Second War ended. Although a number of powerful men in the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; wanted the orcs rounded up and executed, &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; ignored them and had the orcs placed in internment camps under the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Internment%20Act\"&gt;Alliance Internment Act&lt;/a&gt;, with hopes that they would one day lose their bloodlust. There, cut off from their demonic rulers and with no way to replenish their fel stamina, the orcs languished and eventually slipped into lethargy.\nThrall's rise.\nSeveral years after the Second War, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, escaped from his cruel human master &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; at the Durnholde internment camp and set out to find the rest of his people. In his travels he encountered &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who along with his Warsong Clan had been hiding out in the wastelands of Azeroth in hopes of another chance at conquest. Thrall became friends with Grom, and eventually met Orgrim Doomhammer, who had escaped from the humans' prison several years before. From Doomhammer he learned about his father and the Frostwolf clan, and the betrayal of his father by the Shadow Council. After learning this, Thrall made his way to the exiled Frostwolf clan stronghold, where the shaman &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; taught him about the orcs' noble heritage and how they had been corrupted by demons. Thrall swore to free his people from the chains that bound them, and as Drek'Thar's new student, embarked upon the path of the shaman. Together with Grom and Doomhammer, Thrall &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;successfully launched attacks against the internment camps&lt;/a&gt; to free the captive orcs. It was difficult to rouse the orcs from their lethargy, but Thrall was able to prove to them that their destiny was not yet at its end, and the clans rallied behind the new Horde. Unfortunately, during the attack on the last internment camp, Doomhammer was struck down. In tribute to the fierce and proud orc, Thrall donned Doomhammer's black armor and the hammer which bore his name to lead his people from their captivity. This internment camp was later captured by the Horde, renamed in honor of Doomhammer, and is now the Horde outpost of &lt;a href=\"Hammerfall\"&gt;Hammerfall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThrall knew the human nations would not stand idly by and let the Horde regroup or settle down. Fortunately for Thrall, a prophet appeared in the form of a raven and advised him to leave Azeroth for the distant land of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall, having no better alternatives, captured some human ships and set sail for the new land, taking all of his orcs out of Lordaeron. During the journey, the orcs helped a tribe of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s escape from their sinking island. The Darkspear trolls were immensely grateful for Thrall's assistance and swore allegiance to his new Horde. When they arrived in Kalimdor, they were greeted by &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs helped Cairne fend off the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s, and in return, he told the orcs the location of the Oracle. The &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; however, was sent to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to cut lumber as punishment for attacking the humans without permission. There they battled the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Pit%20lord\"&gt;Pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; took advantage or the fact that the orcs were losing to empower them with his blood, and thus bring them back under his control. Thrall allied with the human sorceress &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; at the indication of the Prophet (who was actually &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;). They captured Hellscream and turned him back to normal. Thrall then went with him to confront Mannoroth. Mannoroth quickly subdued Thrall, but Grom was able to kill the demon, though it cost him his life, and free the orcs from their demonic master.\nThe founding of Orgrimmar.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; over, and with it the immediate threat to the world, Thrall set out to found the new orcish homeland in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. He named the land &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; in honor of his father, and founded the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in honor of Orgrim Doomhammer. With the orcs' new allies, the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, becoming part of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and with the support of the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;ian &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20%28nation%29\"&gt;survivors&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall was able to build quickly. However, this was not to last. &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Admiral\"&gt;Grand Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina's father, arrived in Kalimdor (having left before the war was over to look for any surviving forces) and launched an &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; against the fledgling orc nation. During the initial assault the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; trolls lost their new home on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; and with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, came to live with the orcs in Durotar. The &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; pledged the tribe's eternal allegiance to the Horde in return. Thrall, not knowing what humans had attacked him, initially suspected Jaina's forces, but her loyalty was proven when she helped the orcs stop the invading forces of her father Admiral Proudmoore.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhen word reached Warchief Thrall that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; had reopened, he immediately gathered his advisors to plan an expedition through it, eager to find new insights into the history of his people on the other side. After the forces of the Horde, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, repelled a invasion through the Dark Portal from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, their combined forces pressed through it into the shattered world &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the homeworld of the orcs, &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. There, the Horde expedition, led by Thralls loyal advisor &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, founded the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde came into contact with the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt; - orcs corrupted by the blood of a &lt;a href=\"pitlord\"&gt;pitlord&lt;/a&gt; and the servants of the ruler of Outland, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. The Fel Horde was lead by none other than &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;, chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; and one of the greatest orc heroes of the younger history. The Horde forces stormed the stronghold of the Fel Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, conquered it and killed Kargath Bladefist. His fall to corruption and death was a heavy blow to the orcs, but they nonetheless honor the memory of the orc Kargath once was, as well as the lesson learned from his downfall.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s weren't the only orcs on Outland. The Horde also met &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;The Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; - a group of brown-skinned orcs who completely escaped the demonic corruption that affected the rest of their race. Among these orcs were individuals like &lt;a href=\"Jorin%20Deadeye\"&gt;Jorin Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, son of the legendary &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, son of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and the son of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde allied with the Mag'har and Thrall himself convinced Garrosh to return to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as an advisor to the Warchief.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the second &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;Scourge Invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrimmar was targeted as well. This lead Thrall to convene a council of important Horde figures, including Varok Saurfang, Garrosh Hellscream, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, to discuss the matter. While Thrall advocated sending scouts and cooperating with the Alliance, Garrosh Hellscream instead wanted to bring the armies of the Horde directly to Northrend before the Lich King could react. Arguments escalated and Garrosh challenged Thrall to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27Gora\"&gt;Mak'Gora&lt;/a&gt; after he felt that the Warchief had spoken disrespectably about his father. The duel was interrupted when the Scourge attacked the city.\nAfter the undead had been driven from the orcish capital, Thrall issued orders to contact the Horde's goblin shipwrights and marshal their forces to meet the Lich King in Northrend itself. Garrosh Hellscream was to lead the first attack, with Saurfang as his advisor. Hellscream's &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt; established &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, where the Horde advanced despite setbacks to &lt;a href=\"Angrathar\"&gt;Angrathar&lt;/a&gt;, the Wrathgate. Dranosh Saurfang lead the Horde army that combined its forces with that of the Alliance under &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; to breach Arthas' defenses. Both armies were betrayed by Putress, who unleashed his new plague on both the Scourge and the living. Dranosh Saurfang was killed by the Lich King and reanimated as a death knight.\nLearning of Putress' betrayal and of an insurgency in the Undercity led by &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall lead an army together with Sylvanas to deal with the treacherous dreadlord. While the Horde's forces were victorious, new hostilities with the Alliance followed after &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had led his own strike force into the Undercity and witnessed the experiments of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; forces were dispatched to watch over the experiments of the society from then on.\nAs the conflict in Northrend stretched on, Garrosh became increasingly hostile to the Alliance, with special enmity to Varian Wrynn, who had similar sentiments against the Horde. Both nearly came to blows in Dalaran, after being briefed about an &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;ancient threat&lt;/a&gt; contained in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, and continued exchange insults during the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, Garrosh proved himself to be a competent military leader, who earned the admiration of his orcish followers through his dedication to martial prowess and frowning of dishonorable tactics like poison.\nCataclysm.\nIn addition to his commitments as leader of the Horde, Thrall was a dedicated &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; with close ties to the elements. When he noticed severe disturbances in the elemental spirits, Thrall knew that he had to step down as warchief in order to investigate the situation lest all of Azeroth fall into chaos. Given his options, Thrall believed that Garrosh was the clear choice for warchief. But the impulsive young Hellscream is much more aggressive than his diplomatic predecessor. With the equally tempestuous King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; back on the throne of Stormwind, it seems likely that the orcs will need their famed strength now more than ever.\nGarrosh sought more land and resources for his Horde. Under his leadership, Horde soldiers thundered across the realm in the wake of the devastation of the Cataclysm. The Alliance meanwhile, under Varian Wrynn, didn't use the disaster to gain a military advantage.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Theramore%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Theramore's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;all out war erupted between the Alliance and Horde&lt;/a&gt; in every corner of the world. Since then, heroes of the Alliance and the Horde have tested their mettle against the might of the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, and each other, but neither side could have predicted the boundless atrocities the Horde's warchief would commit.\nGarrosh Hellscream's reckless thirst for power has led him to do the unthinkable: from beneath the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, he has seized the desiccated heart of an &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; to use as a tool of war, unleashing horrors upon the sacred valley. The brazen warchief has also turned against &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;other members of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to create a &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;purely orcish force&lt;/a&gt; of his own. Now this \"true Horde\", composing of Garrosh's most loyal and fanatical followers, is amassing strength within Orgrimmar's iron ramparts. With Garrosh bent on total victory, he plans to demonstrate the potency of the true Horde by conquering not just the Alliance but the whole of Azeroth. His machinations were stopped in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and Garrosh was arrested as a war criminal by the forces of Azeroth.\nWhile some orcs have stood by Garrosh's side, the majority of orcs stood with the rebellion against Garrosh's vision of a \"pure\" Horde.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nWith the aid of the renegade &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and the Black Prince &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh managed to escape from his trial at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Kairozdormu transported himself and the former Warchief to an 's past \u2014 a version of reality where Garrosh was never born \u2014 with the hope of constructing a new Horde. After murdering Kairoz with the Vision, Garrosh traveled to the nearby village to seek the alternate self of his father, .\nGarrosh managed to convince Grommash to rally the orc clans of this alternate world into an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, an army free from demonic influences who would ravage &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt; technology Garrosh had brought with him.\nWhen summoned the clans to the to drink the blood of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, Grom refused and slew the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan and his agents were shackled beneath the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to power the gateway between worlds. The invasion of Azeroth was pushed back by the combined forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, and led by the Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; the heroes of Azeroth ventured to Draenor in a suicide mission to stop the Iron Horde.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; led by and , the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kaz%20the%20Shrieker\"&gt;Kaz the Shrieker&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;Council of Exarchs&lt;/a&gt; also joined forces with the outsiders against the Iron Horde, leading to a series of crushing defeats for the orc army.\nFollowing the deaths of most of the orc warlords, Gul'dan approached Warchief Grommash with his &lt;a href=\"Cup%20of%20Unity\"&gt;offer&lt;/a&gt; once more. Grommash refused, but , Warlord of the , accepted, delivering the Iron Horde into the hands of the Legion. Gul'dan used his fel magic to twist and corrupt the Iron Horde's stronghold of , and within he successfully summoned &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; the Defiler. When Archimonde was once again defeated by the combined might of the Alliance and Horde, and with Draenor once again free from the Legion's influence, Durotan, Yrel and the now-freed Grommash vowed to rebuild their world together.\nLegion.\nThe orcs, now officially led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, defended &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in the death of Warchief Vol'jin and the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; as his successor. The orcs then joined various class orders and fought against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs alongside their Horde allies took part in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, which ended with the burning of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the Alliance invaded &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently began the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. As the battle raged Varok, disgusted by Sylvanas' actions, decided to stay behind to confront the encroaching Alliance forces, while the rest of the Horde retreated. Varok was ultimately captured and imprisoned by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, while the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt;. With Varok's capture and imprisonment left the orcs were left leaderless.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; unfolded, &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; rejoined her people, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; helped secure the loyalty of the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orcs&lt;/a&gt; to the Horde, and Garona, Eitrigg, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; led their people in the war effort. In time Anduin released Saurfang from captively, enabling the orc to rally Horde forces against Sylvanas. While the Mag'har orcs led by &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; remained loyal to Sylvanas, many orcs joined Saurfang in his revolution, with the likes of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg and those who stood against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; joining him.\nWhen the Alliance and Horde revolutionaries were prepared to lay siege to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as their brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. The Mak'gora ultimately ended in Varok's death and Sylvanas abandoning of the Horde. Following this, many of her former loyalists such as Geya'rah defected to Saurfang's revolution, and the orcs subsequently attended Saurfang's funeral.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the Horde gathered together within the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; with Thrall representing the orcs. Though Thrall was favored to resume the position of Warchief, he turned down and instead the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, a conglomerate of leaders who would represent their people's interests, was created to lead the Horde. In this council the orcs were represented and led by Thrall.\nShadowlands.\nMuch like the rest of Azeroth, the orcs defended themselves from the marauding &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces, with it being noted how orc territories such as &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; fell under siege. In the midst of the renewed Scourge attack, Thrall was taken captive and brought to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. In time, he was freed from imprisonment and joined the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;War against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. As he remained in the Shadowlands to aid the war effort, it is unknown who led the orcs on Azeroth in his stead. Following &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the trial of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall returned to Azeroth.\nDragonflight.\nFeeling as though the orcs had lost their way as a people due to the loss of their old traditions, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; sought to start the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; anew. In this endeavor, he was joined by &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt;, who suggested that they could offer the orcs more than just a reunion by simultaneously introducing a new rite of passage, the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, to replace the old &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;orc champions&lt;/a&gt; being the first to complete it.\nThe first Kosh'harg of Azeroth was held in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall and Eitrigg assembled the clans and invited many orcs from all across Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, including groups who'd had a troubled history with the Horde (like the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;) and ones who were normally not invited to such events (like the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27nathal\"&gt;Mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;). The festival was enough of a standout event to bring even reclusive individuals like &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; out of hiding. As part of their om'gora, the champion created a &lt;a href=\"Feast%20for%20the%20Ancestors\"&gt;feast for the ancestors&lt;/a&gt;, summoning the spirits of Varok Saurfang and other famous orcs of recent history to give their blessing.\nOnce the hero completed the rite, the Kosh'harg transitioned into a feast in their honor, with plenty of eating, drinking, and drunken brawling. Thrall then held a speech to the crowd to celebrate the champion's accomplishment, after which Aggralan performed the ceremony to bring the festival to a close. Altogether, the first Kosh'harg of Azeroth was deemed to be a great success, one that inspired hope of a new, bright age for the orcs as a people.\nCulture.\nOrcish society has always been characterized by hardy and rugged living. As a result, they are staunch pragmatists, and never shy from killing if it will protect the future of the orc or his or her clan. All orcs, regardless of gender or station, are expected to pull their own weight and weakness is considered a grave liability. The weakness of one contaminates the strength of all, and it is punishable by the greatest humiliation an orc can receive: exile. Different orc clans however have different personalities; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolves&lt;/a&gt; are notable for having brought a measure of mercy and compassion to the Horde, typically seen in Thrall's kinder treatment towards &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt;s, who were once viewed as a despicable sub-race. On the other hand, clans such as the &lt;a href=\"Warsong\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; remain who still cling to the rigid, spartan beliefs valued in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;first Horde&lt;/a&gt; as it was first established on Draenor.\nYet regardless of their clan affiliations, orcs prize honor over all other things in life \u2014 first to bring honor to their clan (and by extension, the Horde) and secondly bringing honor to the self and to their sense of self-worth as an individual. Likewise, hospitality is considered one of the greatest honors that can be bestowed. The orcs and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; have become fast and unswerving allies because the tauren gladly offered the orcs shelter in a strange new land as well as their assistance regardless of the cost to themselves.\nSince Thrall took leadership of the Horde there is no discrimination between genders in orcish society. Women are able to pursue the same career choices as men, rise to positions of power and are even expected to answer to the call for battle just as men are. Strength (both physical and mental), courage, initiative and independence are prized traits in all orcs. Traditionally, children are seen as children of the parents, but are raised as children of the clan. However, because of the newly unified Horde and the current diaspora of individual orc families creating homes and settling down in various areas around Durotar, &lt;a href=\"the%20Barrens\"&gt;the Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, this typical clan scheme has been changing, and life is beginning to become more centered around the nuclear family rather than the greater clan.\nOne tradition of the orcs on Draenor was a ceremony for newborns of the clan. The infant's parents would stand in a body of water near the encampment with the entire clan observing from shore. The mother would hand the baby to the father, who would then raise the child to the sky and proclaim the child as his, through himself and his father, and present the baby for the clan's blessings. The clan chieftain would then hold the baby and declare the infant under their protection, with the hope that they bring honor and glory to the clan. The chieftain's heir would then give a blessing. Finally, the Elder Shaman would ask for the blessing of the elemental and wild spirits, and the hope that the ancestors would watch over the newborn.\nIn some clans, if the child appears sickly or frail, they will instead be drowned, likely by the father. A common expression of scorn is that an orc \"should have been drowned at birth\". This is likely the reason that the parents would stand in the water when presenting a newborn. The &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; were noted for doing this without any qualms. The &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; however, were known to have rejected such cruel practices, thought the families of &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;such children&lt;/a&gt; still moved to the outskirts of their villages.\nOrcs begin weapons training at age 6, when they are nearly the size of an adult human. When they reach 12, they are considered strong enough to fight and allowed to participate in hunting parties. This is also the age they become eligible for the &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt; rite of adulthood and for the courting hunt, making them full-grown adults.\nThere is an old orc saying that goes \"Don't pull a &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;'s tail\". The ancient tribes of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; were known to harvest the &lt;a href=\"Bloodbeak\"&gt;Bloodbeak&lt;/a&gt;s' sharp beaks for crude tools and weapons.\nOrcish children have a tradition where they sneak up on a &lt;a href=\"Mud%20Jumper\"&gt;mud jumper&lt;/a&gt; and whisper a secret they wish to come true. If the mud jumper doesn't jump, the wish will come true.\nTo an orc, blood was the ultimate tie. It bound oaths, commanded allegiances, and marked the true warrior in combat. To taint a blood bond was one of the worst crimes imaginable.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs were not seafarers and most of the superstitious clans feared the open sea. Despite this, &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Master%20Seahorn\"&gt;Fleet Master Seahorn&lt;/a&gt; claims that aboard any vessel on Azeroth that's manned by at least one orc, one will hear sea shanties sung about a device capable of navigating the broad, rough ocean of Draenor, which the orcs used to keep their heading true in the choppiest of storms. Nowadays this fear seems to have been overcome.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dying%20Time\"&gt;Dying Time&lt;/a&gt; was a period during the reign of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and right after the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome orcs are still resentful for the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s putting them into &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Bolik\"&gt;Captain Bolik&lt;/a&gt; notably groomed himself as a way to look as little like the young &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; he had been as possible.\nMessengers and couriers are denoted by a lightning-shaped nose ring.\nThe orcs are one of the most prolific races in the universe.\nOrcs are capable of handling &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic. Those among them who do it are known as &lt;a href=\"arcweaver\"&gt;arcweaver&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSpirituality.\nAs far back as orcish history has been recorded, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; have been mentioned, and learning to speak with the elemental spirits of Draenor was a pivotal achievement in destiny for the orc clans. The first orcs to learn the ways of shamanism hailed from the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, but many clans claim the mythical \"First Shaman\" arose from their ranks, even though the truth is that no one is sure of his or her allegiance.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, young orcs were raised from birth to be stalwart, steadfast allies of the elemental spirits. When they came of age, fledgling shaman from around Draenor embarked on a pilgrimage to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; to seek the blessings of the spirits and entered trances to attune their minds to the elements. The entire journey was filled with risk, but the ceremony itself was the most dangerous time of an orc's life. Those orcs who were welcomed by the elements returned to their clans as respected spiritual leaders whose counsel was highly valued, second only to the words of the clan chieftain. The bond between shaman crossed clan boundaries, allowing them peacefully mediate arguments and solve conflicts. However, not all orcs were found worthy during the ceremony. A few poor souls who were not strong or worthy enough accidentally glimpsed the realm of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and succumbed to terrible visions and unearthly whispers during what should have been the triumph of their young life, driving them insane. The ones who survived fled or were exiled from their clans and were forced to live in seclusion in the caves beneath &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, becoming &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s. White skulls were tattooed on their faces, marking them as \"dead\" to their people. Orcish shaman long used this tattoo practice to similarly mark certain failed apprentices as \"dead\". When &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; fell into despair on the dying Draenor, his mind plagued by visions of death, he had such a skull tattoed on his own face.\nOrcs instinctively revere the rugged forces of the natural elements, and as such, shaman are held in high regard. They generally have a close relationship with the nature elements and angering them is considered a grave offense. Over the ages, shaman like &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; have communed with these spirits and, through patience and dedication, learned to soothe roaring infernos, bring rain to sun-scorched lands, and otherwise temper the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s' ruinous influence on the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; is a barren place with little water or plant life, orcs are reliant on shaman to negotiate with the elementals to provide necessities such as drinking water from fallen rain or fire to warm their hearths. In orcish culture, any shaman that has been spoken to by the spirits is given equal respect and honor regardless of age or experience.\nSeveral orc shaman worship or at least acknowledge the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;, the benevolent creator deity primarily worshipped by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrc &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s follow the &lt;a href=\"Lok%27osh\"&gt;Lok'osh&lt;/a&gt;, a path of healing and renewal introduced by the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lok%27osh%20Nakha\"&gt;Lok'osh Nakha&lt;/a&gt;. While shaman speak to \"the elements without\", Nakha speaks to \"the elements within\", a song of the heart and the spirit.\nBack before the &lt;a href=\"genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;genocide of the draenei&lt;/a&gt; and their corruption by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, orcs generally used to &lt;a href=\"Funerary%20practices\"&gt;burn their dead&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Pyremaster\"&gt;funeral pyres&lt;/a&gt;. Being laid to rest in the ground was an odd concept to them, for they wanted their bodies to be given to fire, their ashes to air, to be consumed by water and earth, while their spirits would be then left free to join their ancestors. That old custom was gradually abandoned as the orcs fell to their bloodlust and rejected their old shamanistic ways. In present days some orcs are still being burned on funeral pyres, but others are now also laid to rest in &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSome orcs are believed to go to an afterlife in the form of a &lt;a href=\"hunting%20grounds\"&gt;great hunting ground&lt;/a&gt; after death. &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; believed in an afterlife consisting of \"glorious battlefields\". Suicide is not regarded with honor among orcs however, being considered a coward's answer to the problems one might face. Orcs think they will not be permitted to live on as a spirit if they take that way to escape their situation.\nCuisine.\nOrcs are voracious eaters: each orc eats as much as a dozen &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s. The staple diet of the orcs - as well as &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s - is fresh meat. To satisfy this hunger for flesh, wild &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s are trapped and bred for food. There are several &lt;a href=\"pig%20farm\"&gt;pig farm&lt;/a&gt;s in the areas south of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and swine meat is commonly sliced up and used to make bacon. During the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs were also known to slaughter &lt;a href=\"grok%20%28animal%29\"&gt;grok&lt;/a&gt;s, some kind of livestock, while during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, boar meat coupled with a tankard of &lt;a href=\"bloodmead\"&gt;bloodmead&lt;/a&gt; became a bonfire favorite among the hardened troops engaged in a long war march. The prickly fruits that grow on cacti in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; are also commonly eaten. Orcs eat various types of fish, including pike, golden stonefish, and sandy carp, as well as other types of aquatic life like clams and crawfish. &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Nougat\"&gt;Orgrimmar Nougat&lt;/a&gt; is a traditional &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; treat. Orcs from Orgrimmar also brew &lt;a href=\"boar%27s%20grog\"&gt;boar's grog&lt;/a&gt;, an alcoholic beverage they used to sell to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nMounts and companions.\nWolves.\nLong ago, the orcs tamed the large and swift &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. These massive canines came to be the orcs' chosen companions as well as their favored method of transportation. The wolves' unflinching temperament made them especially well-suited for battling large prey. When the orcs became more warlike and invaded Azeroth, their wolves were bred for size and stamina so they could bear armored riders into battle. &lt;a href=\"Dire%20wolf\"&gt;Dire wolves&lt;/a&gt; remain the favored mounts for orc fighters. Generations ago, when orc clans still called &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; home, an enormous wolf spirit played an important role in their lives. When the orcs departed, they no longer had any need for the spirit and they left it behind. In time, the spirit grew lonely and it too left the forest.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;, when the orcs arrived on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, they were told of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs adopted him as their hero on this new world, for they considered that the will of orcs is strong like his and, like him, not even death can stop them. According to &lt;a href=\"Takrik%20Ragehowl\"&gt;Takrik Ragehowl&lt;/a&gt;, the demigod Lo'Gosh has always been with the orcs as a part of their Horde, in their instincts and in their blood. He has appeared in many forms on both Azeroth and Draenor and is known by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; as \"&lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;\", the wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;. \nLanguages.\nOrcs know Orcish and Common. Orcs tend to only favor the languages of their allies, for example &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandali\"&gt;Zandali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gutterspeak\"&gt;Gutterspeak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28language%29\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; in recent times as well. Before the slaughter of the draenei on Draenor, there were orcs who learned &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20%28language%29\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate trade between the two races.\nSeparate tribes had variations of dialect that differed so much that orcs could not understand each other unless they spoke the common tongue. The main form of the Orcish language used by all the tribes is known as common Orcish.\nOrc clans.\nOrcs are divided into clans. Each clan has a different culture, tradition, or behavior which sets them apart from the other clans and often also gives them their name. The Warsong clan for example is named because of the rhythmic songs they chant in battle, while the Shattered Hand clan is named for the tradition of their warriors to cut of their own hand and replace it with a weapon.\nEvery orc clan is led by a chieftain, while the leader of all clans is called &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; are former Warchiefs of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the current being &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Banshee Queen, notable for being the first elf, undead, and female to hold the position. The chieftain is usually the strongest member of the clan and there are two ways of becoming a chieftain. Either you challenge the old chieftain and beat him in a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; or you inherit the status of chieftain.\nWhile there are still many different clans in the Horde, they don't live as strictly separated as they once did. However, some clans still maintain a large amount of individuality and separate themselves from the other clans, like Warsong or Dragonmaw.\nAlthough there are many different clans, the strongest and most important clans were limited to fourteen. The other smaller clans never reached the power or importance of these main clans.\nAn &lt;a href=\"Oath%20Cry\"&gt;Oath Cry&lt;/a&gt; is a loud, deep, furious cry that beckons all members of the clan to the caller.\nAppearance.\nOrcs in general have muscular physiques and on average, female orcs are around 6' to 6'6\" tall while male orcs tend to reach 7 feet in height. Males often have very long and unusual facial hair. Females tend to have eclectic hair styles and unusual piercings.\nOrcs have an acute sense of smell, so much so that they can distinguish others without the need for visual confirmation.\nAging.\nOrcs mature quickly, growing nearly the size of a human adult by the age of six years old, which is also the age at which they start their hunter/warrior training.\nOrc warlocks are able to use magic to accentuate the growth of young orcs, aging six-year-olds rapidly into twelve-year-olds.\nPhysique.\nAn orc's face would be described by some races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as monstrous, their hideousness comparable to that of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Orcs have large heavy jaws from which protrude sharp, tusk-like teeth, heavy brows, a broad and flat snout-like nose, and pointed ears. The number, size and position of orcish tusks and teeth are particularly variable, much like their &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; allies. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, for example, has been portrayed with twin sets of tusks.\nOrcs come in all shapes and sizes, ranging from the short, pitiable &lt;a href=\"peon\"&gt;peon&lt;/a&gt; to the hulking &lt;a href=\"grunt\"&gt;grunt&lt;/a&gt;. The average male Orc height is seven feet tall, while the females stand at an average of six to six and a half. Males, particularly warriors, are often hunched to variable degrees, though others stand straight and tall, such as &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. A fair amount of sexual dimorphism exists between the orc sexes, with male orcs possessing more extreme orcish physical characteristics, most noticeably broader shoulders and larger tusks. Yet all the orcs (with the exception of the oft-ignored peons) are large, powerfully built creatures when compared to their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; counterparts, warriors and spell-casters alike, and regardless of gender. Old orcs such as &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drak%27thul\"&gt;Drak'thul&lt;/a&gt;, however, are often frail and wiry, though not all allow themselves to weaken with age, such as &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrcs who drink the blood of a &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; quickly grow in body mass and strength, and even the weakest of these &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s is a deadly foe. This unnatural power was apparently not carried down to the later, green-skinned generations of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Fel orcs often have much longer teeth, becoming nothing short of tusks, as well as spines erupting from their body. &lt;a href=\"Dire%20orc\"&gt;Dire orc&lt;/a&gt;s are gargantuan, severely-hunched orcs also displaying many of these traits, although they are not all fel orcs.\nAn up-close look at an orc on the cover art for \"\" showed them with horns protruding from their cheeks and forward-pointing, tufted ears, neither of which have been seen in later examples, although Fel Orcs have spikes on their jawline.\nSkin.\nOriginally, all orcs were either brown-skinned, ranging from a bark-like brown to reddish-brown; or grey-skinned, ranging from a light grey to a dark, sooty black. However, with the exception of the isolated &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt;, their bodies reacted to their exposure to warlock magic once it was introduced by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. All orcs with warlocks in their clan found their skin slowly turning green before they were ever offered the blood of the demon &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe first orcs to drink the blood of a pit lord rapidly completed their transition to green skin. Further drinking the blood, or possibly the blood of any demon, will change their skin again from green to scarlet, transforming them into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Orcs that drink Mannoroth's blood obtained gray marks in their green skin. Through certain rituals this state is reversible, not only restoring the orc\u2019s sanity but their previous green tone as well. No green-skinned orc has ever managed to return to a completely uncorrupted state.\nWith \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt; and (with ') &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;s have grey-green or grey skin, differentiating them from the rest of the orcish race. The Blackrock orcs' skin has apparently darkened due to years of dwelling within the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; cities within &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen greenskinned orcs blush, they turn purple.\nThe change of skin color from brown to green appears to have permanently altered them as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, who had little direct exposure to warlock magic until recently, has had green skin from birth, and none of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, who have eschewed fel magic the longest (bar the Mag'har) have younger, brown-skinned members. It would also explain why it does not appear to reverse with time, as neither &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; of the Frostwolves nor &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; have regained the brown skin of their youth despite decades with little or no contact with warlocks.\n\"\" revealed that Blackrock clan orcs developed grey skin due to years of living underground. When this change occurred, or whether it affected all clan members is not made clear. There is no mention of the Blackrock clan being anything other than green-skinned before \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; have never been shown as grey-skinned. However, \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Blackhand%20%28comic%29\"&gt;\"Blackhand\" comic&lt;/a&gt; depicts , and the with grey skin. &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; was noted as green-skinned in \"&lt;a href=\"Of%20Blood%20and%20Honor\"&gt;Of Blood and Honor&lt;/a&gt;\" and has been like-wise depicted in art, but being a Blackrock orc he is shown in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" as grey-skinned, as is his son &lt;a href=\"Ariok\"&gt;Ariok&lt;/a&gt;. This is despite him leaving the clan at the end of the Second War, and never returning to Blackrock Mountain. The Black Tooth Grin, which did not dwell in &lt;a href=\"Hordemar%20City\"&gt;Hordemar&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and only reunited with the Blackrock following it, have the same skin tones as their brethren.\nThe Dragonmaw orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; were originally pale green but were changed in ' to grey. It's unknown whether their grey coloration is the result of genetics or (like the Blackrock orcs) years of dwelling in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonmaw might even deliberately change the color of their skin with dyes. The earlier choice of pale green skin may have represented differences in skin tone between clans. Grey skin tones are also often used for orcish cultists and might represent sickliness, similar to the grayish-purple skin of human and gnomish cultists. The Dragonmaw chieftain &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; retains his green skin in ', though this may have been an oversight.\nThe nature of the change in skin color when corrupted is considerably different from that of other fel-touched races. &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;Felblood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; change from their original skin tones straight to the extremes (for orcs, red), and don't appear to have a middle-ground.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;'s mind, the orcish green tint would get overwritten by 2nd/3rd generation unless there would be another direct voluntary exposure to felblood, but that is just his opinion.\nEyes.\nThe naturally occurring eye colors of orcs include shades of brown, oranges, yellows, reds, greens, grey, violets, indigo, and in rare cases, pure blue. The color of eyes may change into red color when orcs succumb to rage or bloodlust.\nOrcs who drank the blood of the pit lord Mannoroth invariably had eyes that glowed a bright, blood red, and the same is true of &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s derived from the blood of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;. These eyes did not dim even after the orcs' withdrawal from warlock magic after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, and among the prisoners of the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s those orcs with glowing red eyes were the most ashamed, confused and eager for direction of all. Only the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; against Mannoroth finally managed to free those orcs from their curse, with their eyes coming back to their original color.\nPure blue eyes are quite rare in the orcish race, and are seen as a sign of great destiny. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; has such blue eyes, as well as &lt;a href=\"Rehgar%20Earthfury\"&gt;Rehgar Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona&lt;/a&gt; in some depictions, though this may be more a sign of her &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt; heritage and not her fate. The eyes of cultist orcs sometimes appear to be completely clouded-over.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"player%20character%20revamp\"&gt;player character revamp&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw orcs&lt;/a&gt; now have glowing yellow eyes. The reason for this is unknown.\nHair.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", orcs are shown with a variety of hair colors; black, brown, blues, reds, purples and with age, grey and white. In earlier depictions, orcs only had black, grey or white hair, if they had hair at all \u2013 shaven heads are common among orcs of both genders, at least compared to most other races. Some male orcs cultivate beards, while others are clean shaven.\nIn earlier games and art, orcs had only black, red, grey and white hair (with the \"\" adding brown to the mix). From \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" onwards (including the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;TCG&lt;/a&gt;\") have orcs been shown with more colorful hair. In \"Warcraft II\" &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; has blonde facial hair.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s original model had dark blue hair, rather than the black from his earlier incarnations, in \"\", his hair changed back to black, indicating that either his mild blue hair was an oversight or that it was due to a dye.\nAlthough in \"World of Warcraft\" orc females and children have eyebrows, the majority of male models don't, with the exception of Thrall's models since \"Cataclysm\". In other materials like the \"\" cinematic or other artworks like show male orcs with them. In \"Warcraft II\" &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; have eyebrows and in \"Warcraft III\" the &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Far Seer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20Warlock\"&gt;Stormreaver Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s have eyebrows while other orcs don't have them. &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Battlemaster%20Br%C3%B6ng\"&gt;Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng&lt;/a&gt;, and various unnamed male orcs are depicted with eyebrows in \"&lt;a href=\"Bloodsworn\"&gt;Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBlood.\nOrc blood is a dark red color, much darker than that of dwarves and humans. Because of this, orcs have been called \u201cblackbloods\u201d by their &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; foes. However, they are sometimes shown with bright red blood, namely in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", as are both &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; (with otherwise purple blood) and some &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; (otherwise black blood or green ichor).\nMarkings.\nOrcs, especially orc warriors, are fond of tattoos of orcish symbols that have abstract, yet personal meaning to the individual orc, such as a clan symbol or a battle standard. In orcish society, scars are a source of pride for an orc; the amount of scars an orc has received in battle marks his experience as a warrior.\nOrc relations.\nIn the newly established Horde, the orcs have strong ties to the recent race members of the Horde who are originally from Kalimdor. The ties between the orcs, tauren, and jungle trolls are unquestionable. In the aftermath of the Third War, Thrall, Cairne, and Vol'jin reluctantly allowed the Forsaken to join the Horde ranks, and with the reopening the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; the Horde recruited a fifth race to its ranks, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s also joined the ranks of the Horde, with the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; joining after Pandaria became unshrouded by &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Horde has seven notable races, the Horde also counts smaller organizations as its members, notably the Mok'nathal and Stonemaul ogres as well as other various groups. Recently, Thrall has tried to establish a connection to the Ironforge dwarves in order to minimize wars between the two races. This could be seen when Thrall ordered Horde adventurers into the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; to find the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde becomes allied with the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an ancient offshoot of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and the &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;. The taunka are Horde specific but the tuskarr are a naturally neutral race. Orcs have a long history of violence with humans, though they grudgingly respect their strength and some still cling to old hatreds even despite the fact that they fought alongside each other during the Third War. However, while they don't like humans generally, the orcs do respect their own leader &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, especially since she had chosen to side with them over her father.\nIn the RPG.\nIntroduction.\nTo their enemies, they are brutal and fearsome opponents, without parallel in their ferocity and cunning. To their allies, they are noble and honorable, following the traditions of a rediscovered past. The orcs of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; are part of a race that has once again found its true spirit, shunning the cruel practices of arcane and demonic magic for the paths of wisdom and power. Some orcs still hang on to the arcane practices of the past, but their time is fading. Though brutal in combat, orcs fight with a feral grace that equals even the finest fencing of an elven noble. For an orc, skill in battle brings great honor. The concept of personal honor that pervades all echelons of orcish society has made the race more cohesive and more of a threat to their adversaries in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Even the naming of an orc is temporary until he has performed a rite of passage. Once an orc has brought honor to his name and the name of his clan, the elders give him a second name based upon his deed.\nFor an orc, personal reputation is as important as his or her clan, and most will fight to the death in defense of either. This is in drastic contrast to when they were led by the forces tainted by the Burning Legion and were a bestial force barely controlled by demonic magic. While the orcs might seem quick to anger, they are tempered by the wisdom of their leaders and their shaman. There are few of the demon-worshiping clans left, for the Alliance or the Horde itself has hunted down most of the remnants of such clans. Now, most of the orcs have embraced the values embodied in the leadership of Thrall as taught by his mentor, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs are one of the most populous races on the world of Azeroth. While many of the Alliance races perceive them to be brutish and savage, the orcs have forged a complex society that embraces many occupations and many different races. No doubt the leadership of Thrall and the support of the tauren and jungle troll elders has aided in this solidarity, but it is quite apparent that humanity has underestimated the ability of the orcs to unify and create their own distinct and powerful culture. Perhaps in time, the two factions might come to an understanding, but with the current division of Alliance and Horde, no one can say how or when peace might come.\nWhen they were freed from the Burning Legion, orcs experienced a cultural revolution as the unnatural, arcane bloodlust left their bodies, giving them calmer and more focused states of mind. They, for the most part, follow Thrall as he forges ahead to reform the Horde both inside, with his shamanism, and outside, with the founding of Durotar. Still, not all orcs are pleased with these movements, namely the evil orcs who still reside on Azeroth. These orcs, who include a good number of the surviving warlocks, actively raid &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Independent\"&gt;Independent&lt;/a&gt; caravans and towns, and renounce all that Thrall proclaims the Horde is. Like the two faces of the Alliance, the different Horde factions meet rarely; but there are some orc warlocks on Kalimdor who would very much like to retake control of the Horde forces and are gaining strength in the wilderness to do so.\nCulture notes.\nOrcs wear a variety of clothing styles, from furs and hides in some clans to heavy metal armor in others. They favor clothes of hide, and armor and arm themselves with a variety of gear.\nThe orcs of Draenor were once known as the green plague and the Bane of Azeroth. They can speak &lt;a href=\"Low%20Common\"&gt;Low Common&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpirituality.\nOrcish religion takes the form of an animistic worldview that has strange parallels with the practices of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;. Orc shaman draw their power from the forces of the elements and the spirits of nature, forming a very intimate connection with the world that surrounds them. This awareness has led to even more revelations of their race\u2019s true nature, as the orcs realize that they live more in harmony with the world than many of the races of the Alliance.\nAppearance.\nOrc males are massive and brutish looking creatures. Weighing in at 250 to 300 pounds and standing from 6 to 7 feet in height, they are not a small race. Even orc women tend to be only a half-foot or so shorter and 50 to 100 pounds lighter than most males (and some of them are equal in stature to their male counterparts), having broad shoulders and muscular, powerful bodies.\nMost orcs are green-skinned, usually ranging from a light chartreuse yellow or olive to a dark forest or emerald green.\nOrcs tend to have coarse and bristly hair and beards, often black or brown in color, graying with age. Orc males sometimes choose to grow beards that are wild and untamed, while others prefer them to be braided and tasseled. These beards always hang from the chin, as orcs do not grow heavy facial hair above their upper-lip."}

Once a peaceful race from the &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs were &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;demonically corrupted&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; forming the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;waged war&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; they shared Draenor with, and then they came through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as conquerors. After having conquered the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs were eventually defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, after which they became &lt;a href=\"Internment%20camp\"&gt;prisoners&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs were &lt;a href=\"Liberation%20of%20the%20internment%20camps\"&gt;liberated&lt;/a&gt; from the camps and formed the New Horde, and after yet another &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;, the orcish people were able to settle the land of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrcs start their journeys in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt; within this new homeland. Their capital city is &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, which is also considered the main base of the entire Horde itself. The chosen orc mount is the &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;, and their main language is &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;. Being the leaders of the Horde, their allies have learned this language from them as well.\nBackground.\nCreation screen description.\n\"The orc race originated on the planet Draenor. A peaceful people with shamanic beliefs, they were enslaved by the Burning Legion and forced into war with the humans of Azeroth. Although it took many years, the orcs finally escaped the demons' corruption and won their freedom. To this day they fight for honor in an alien world that hates and reviles them.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"The once-peaceful Orcs came to Azeroth from the planet Draenor after falling victim to the corruption of the demonic Burning Legion. Now, the Orcs fight to survive in a world that hates them, prizing blood and honor above all things.\"\nClassic opening cutscene.\n\"Long ago, the orcish horde was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and lured to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. For generations, the orcs made war upon the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Horde was ultimately defeated, a visionary young &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; rose to lead his people in their darkest hour. Under Thrall's rule, the orcs freed themselves from the chains of demonic corruption and embraced their shamanistic heritage. After years of wandering, the orcs founded their own kingdom in the harsh wastelands of Durotar. Based in the warrior city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, they stand ready to destroy all who would challenge their supremacy. As a proud defender of Durotar, it is your duty to crush the enemies, both seen and unseen, for the nefarious agents of the Burning Legion still wander the land.\"\nCataclysm opening cutscene.\n\"The Great Cataclysm has shattered more than just the world. Warchief Thrall, arguably the most powerful living shaman has left his people behind so that he might stop the Cataclysm at its source. Yet, in his absence, the Horde champion Garrosh Hellscream has become the Horde's new Warchief. Though popular amongst the orcs for his victories against the Lich King, Garrosh's reckless leadership has begun to cause a rift between himself and the other leaders of the Horde. With Durotar's natural resources nearly depleted, Garrosh seeks to take whatever his people need to survive regardless of who stands in his way. A dangerous new era for the Horde has dawned and it falls to brave orcs like you to uphold the will of the new Warchief and assure the dominance of your people.\"\nHistory.\nLong ago, the noble orcish race was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into the merciless, destructive &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Lured to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs were forced to make war upon the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdoms of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in what would become known as the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; Wars. Though the Horde nearly succeeded in annihilating humanity, it ultimately devoured itself from within and collapsed. The defeated orcs spent many years within guarded prisons, unable to function without the prospect of conquest and warfare. After many years, a visionary young &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; rose to lead his people in their darkest hour. Fittingly enough, the young orc\u2019s name was &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Under his rule, the orcs freed themselves from the chains of demonic corruption and embraced their shamanistic heritage.\nAt the behest of a strange prophet, Thrall led his people to the ancient lands of Kalimdor. There, Thrall and the Horde came face to face with their old oppressor, the Burning Legion. With the aid of the humans and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs defeated the Legion and set out to find their own path in their adopted world. The orcs claimed the harsh wastelands of Durotar as their kingdom in Kalimdor.\nNow based in the warrior city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the orcs look forward to a shining new future for their people. Though they are no longer driven by dreams of conquest, they stand ready to destroy all who would challenge their sovereignty or their supremacy. It is your duty to crush the enemies of Durotar, both seen and unseen, for the nefarious agents of the Burning Legion still wander the land.\nAppearance.\nMale orcs are large, hunched and frightening, wielding axes and hammers as well as massive fists the size of a small child. They have flat, wide noses and beady red eyes. Female orcs have tiny, squashed noses and angry, slanted eyes. Female orcs have very shapely bodies and very exotic hairstyles with either messy hair poking out in every direction or thick braids\u2014or no hair at all. All orcs have some variation of green skin.\nMale orcs average 7' in height, while females average 6-6.5'.\nCharacter.\nThe orcs start in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, an area located in southern &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. \nQuotes.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"patch%207.0.3\"&gt;patch 7.0.3&lt;/a&gt;, orc characters who use the codice_1 emote also say \"&lt;a href=\"Thrall%27s%20balls\"&gt;Thrall's balls&lt;/a&gt;!\".\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

It is used as the main language of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main form of the Orcish language used by all orc tribes on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; was known as common Orcish. Separate clans had variations of dialect that differed so much that orcs could not understand each other unless they spoke the common tongue. There was an older, archaic version of Orcish that few but the highly educated, such as the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;s, knew.\nWritten using runes, Orcish is regarded by non-speakers as an ugly, guttural language. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; is able to differentiate between pictographs from an old version of the orc language.\nOrcish primer.\nOfficial translations.\nHere are a few common orcish phrases and words, for which the translations have been officially confirmed by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn-game parser.\nThis is the list of words created by the in-game language parser for the Orcish language and is listed as language number one (word range 1-100) in the Language text file.\nNote: The language algorithm used by the in-game \"translator\" merely makes the words \"look\" like Orcish. It does not actually translate words. Therefore, translated in-game speech isn't true Orcish.\nOrcish / Common dictionary.\nThe following appear in the \"&lt;a href=\"Orcish%20-%20Common%20Dictionary\"&gt;Orcish / Common Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;\" found in eastern &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nNaming.\nCharacter creation screen.\nThe following names are offered as suggestions when creating characters on the &lt;a href=\"character%20creation%20screen\"&gt;character creation screen&lt;/a&gt;. Note that this list represents a sample of the many possible suggestions. \nWarcraft II.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20II\"&gt;Warcraft II&lt;/a&gt; cinematics, orcs randomly say words in orcish like \"Moka\", \"titoo\", \"glode\". These words, however, have never been heard in another &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; game and have never been translated.\nIn the RPG.\nOrcish (or Orc) is a coarser language than Common, and many words lack the subtlety of Common. Orcs rely on context, repetition and volume to add emphasis or meaning. There are many orc dialects, examples include one spoken by the majority of the Horde, and another by orcs living near &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrcish is written using a combination of &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; alphabet and runes.\nOrc names.\nMost orcish names derive from words in their language that have some complex meaning or hidden significance to their families. Typically, this is the name of a favorite thing or relative. Family names don't exist; most orcs have last names related to some great deed of heroism or honor. However, in the case of truly incredible deeds, an orc might take on the last name of his father to ensure that the chronicle of that terrific deed lives on. The concept of honor is seen in every level of orc society, even in their naming practices. An orc\u2019s first name is given early in life, often derived from a family name or the name of a great hero. The tribe bestows the second name after the orc reaches maturity, this name based upon some great deed. Such a practice gives rise to surnames such as Doomhammer, Elfkicker, Foe-ender, Skullsplitter, Thumper, and the like. This second name may be changed if a new one seems more appropriate. \nSpeculation.\nOrcish surnames are usually derived from great acts or merits a previous ancestor was lauded for, but some exceptional orcs earn their own surnames (&lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt;), and many prefer to use the names of their fathers (&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Son of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;). Only the family leader can hold an eponymous title (For example, there can only be one Doomhammer or Deadeye at a time), and the rest of the clan identify themselves through their line of birth.\nTwo types of orc names appear to have arisen: two syllables separated by an apostrophe and a simple name shortened from a longer one. The two-syllable ones- Gul'dan, Drak'Thul, Dal'Rend - appear to have initially been only used for spellcaster, but was later exported (Gar'Thok was a grunt). The second type was highly cultural; only those with powers over the warrior could use their full name, such as Shamans and chieftains, or the orc's personal religious leader. For example, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Brox&lt;/a&gt;'s full name was Broxigar, a term which he allowed only &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; to use. &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s full name was Grommash, which &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; used to address him as a demonstration that Hellscream was his. This is very inconsistent, however, most of the known orcish names (such as &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim\"&gt;Orgrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath&lt;/a&gt;) are never documented being used in short forms.\nOther speculation.\n\"Orc\" as a term defining language, has an apparent connection to DnD derived generic languages, which apparently can be found in DnD rule books.\nTo a degree, phonetically some of the words resemble Tolkien's Black Speech, which makes sense since that language was presumably the foundational influence for the sound of this one. It is, however, generally somewhat less guttural and (to use Tolkien's own adjective for the Black Speech) uncouth.\nIt also doesn't seem to really be an actual language as such; Blizzard apparently originally invented a few words with an \"Orcish\" sound to use as acknowledgment phrases when units were clicked on in the earlier Warcraft games, and thus to create consistency, these words were brought over to WoW. The translated vocabulary, however, is not large, and there is no real formal grammar. The \"Orcish\" that can be seen apparently being spoken by players in-game is the result of a hash table created by Blizzard, (as mentioned above) and the words produced by it are intentionally meaningless gibberish.\nThe examples of Orcish we've seen indicate what the phonetic inventory of the language might include, but we have nearly no evidence of the structure of the syntax or grammar. It may be possible to assume that adjectives come before nouns, as in English and other Germanic languages. As seen in the primer above, \"Grommash\" translates to \"giant's heart\". Thus we might say that \"grom\" (giant's) is an adjective modifying \"mash\" (heart). The word \"Grombolar,\" meaning \"bowels of the giant\", seems to follow this pattern as well. Of course, if this is actually a possessive clause, or a compound word, then the speculation that Orcish follows an adjective-noun word order could be erroneous."}

Founded to fight the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; threat, the order has been recently revived to fight the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es. Members of the Order, known as Inquisitors, are highly trained individuals using a variety of techniques and weapons, some of them using the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, and all armed with an in-depth knowledge of Drust and witch magic. The Inquisitors of the order have been successful in containing this influence, and securing the region from ruin during the &lt;a href=\"Drust%20incursion\"&gt;Drust incursion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOld order.\nAround 2,700 years ago, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; arrived on an island that they would later call &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. The indigenous &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; people enacted raids against the humans' fledgling hamlets, seeking to protect their territories. Initially, the humans tried to pursue peace with the Drust, though only a few of the natives tolerated their new neighbors, and war became inevitable. The Drust themselves glorified the slaughter, attacking unarmed civilians.\nDrust assaults carried on for many years until the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; launched their own crusade against the attackers. Though the Waycrests were hearty folk, the unique death magic of the Drust was strong, and war shifted against the humans. In desperation, the Waycrest family oversaw research into their enemies' magic, forming the Order of Embers to use the knowledge gained against the Drust. New tactics were developed when their scholars began to uncover weaknesses in the Drust's magic, such as the use of &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; weapons and a complex alchemical solution called Liquid Fire to burn away the Drust, gave the Order an edge in the fight. All of their knowledge was compiled into a treatise on weapons and tactics that could be used to defeat the barbarians, entitled the \"&lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Silver%20and%20Ash\"&gt;Tome of Silver and Ash&lt;/a&gt;\". It also contained sketches of Order members wearing a particular outfit.\nIn the end, the Kul Tirans triumphed over the Drust and drove them from the land which was soon settled. Unbeknownst to the humans, however, the Drust leader &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; had not been fully vanquished and plotted his vengeance for centuries to come. The Order of Embers, its main purpose having been fulfilled, would begin to fade over the subsequent years, but its legacy was secured from unwanted hands. The \"Tome of Silver and Ash\" was secured deep inside the Drust ruins of &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Var\"&gt;Gol Var&lt;/a&gt;, and a cottage with a secret door was built by House Waycrest in front of the cave entrance to conceal it. Knowledge of the Order, the tome and the cottage would be passed down through Lord &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;'s family since then.\nRefounding.\nThousands of years after the first defeat of the Drust, Gorak Tul's influence began to grow in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; once more, spread by the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; of powerful &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es. &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; itself, having sided with Gorak Tul, seized control of much of the region, including the city of &lt;a href=\"Corlain\"&gt;Corlain&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo fight the resurgent threat, &lt;a href=\"Lucille%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lucille Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; set out to reform the Order of Embers, thought by many to be merely a legend. Getting help to retrieve the \"Tome of Silver and Ash\" from Gol Var, she drew new Inquisitors from the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Guard\"&gt;Waycrest Guard&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and refounded the order at &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;. The Inquisitors immediately began a campaign to drive back the Heartsbane. Much of the Order's ancient knowledge was successfully used against the new threat. A victory over the witches in &lt;a href=\"Falconhurst\"&gt;Falconhurst&lt;/a&gt; led by Inquisitor &lt;a href=\"Joan%20Cleardawn\"&gt;Joan Cleardawn&lt;/a&gt; gained the aid of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Ashton\"&gt;Master Ashton&lt;/a&gt;, who began recreating Liquid Fire. From there, the fight was then taken to the Coven and their &lt;a href=\"wicker\"&gt;wicker&lt;/a&gt; army in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Forest\"&gt;Crimson Forest&lt;/a&gt;, where their forces were decimated. They also managed to stop &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;'s first attempt at re-entering the physical world, at &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Inath\"&gt;Gol Inath&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the same time, the rest of the Order focused on liberating Corlain, and secured &lt;a href=\"Watchman%27s%20Rise\"&gt;Watchman's Rise&lt;/a&gt; as a forward base. &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Notley\"&gt;Inquisitor Notley&lt;/a&gt; used his falcon to scout the surrounding areas and identify important targets. The &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Ballaster\"&gt;Angus Ballaster&lt;/a&gt; was soon rescued from the witches, becoming the Order's main smith. As in times past, silver weapons were forged to effectively battle the Coven, the materials being taken from &lt;a href=\"Bleak%20Hills%20Mine\"&gt;Bleak Hills Mine&lt;/a&gt; to the east. Caged falcons were also saved from being corrupted in the &lt;a href=\"Corlain%20Aviary\"&gt;Corlain Aviary&lt;/a&gt;, while the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Goodspeed\"&gt;Captain Goodspeed&lt;/a&gt; and his troops were brought to justice.\nDuring her search, &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Mace\"&gt;Inquisitor Mace&lt;/a&gt; also discovered that &lt;a href=\"Harris%20Hocking\"&gt;Harris Hocking&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hocking%27s%20Plot\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt; was holding back the Heartsbane because the presence of his onion field somehow disrupted Drust magic, adding another weapon to the Order's arsenal. Merely striking corrupted falcons with a pungent onion was enough to kill them instantly. Lucille would remark that her grandmother's stories about onions warding off evil turned out to be more literal than she thought possible.\nWith much of Corlain secured, the Inquisitors turned their efforts on &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Corlain\"&gt;Upper Corlain&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s at the entryway, &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Sterntide\"&gt;Inquisitor Sterntide&lt;/a&gt; broke down the barrier blocking access to the district. Together, the Inquisitors cut a path and pushed all the way to &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;, the center of the Coven's power. There, they encountered the \"Mother\" and leader of the witches, revealed to be &lt;a href=\"Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Meredith Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, and her undead husband, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lord Arthur Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;. After being forced to slay their former commander, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Everit%20Reade\"&gt;Marshal Everit Reade&lt;/a&gt;, the Order stormed the manor on Lucille's orders and put an end to the Mother and her closest disciples.\nAfter a short moment of reprieve, the Inquisitors had to face their final challenge deep underneath the house itself, which turned out to have been built on an ancient &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; edifice. There, &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, made his entrance into the physical world. After a climactic battle, the Order repelled the Drust king, but it was revealed that it was only a vessel that they defeated. Gorak Tul still dwelled within the Blighted Lands, and would eventually return. Even so, the Drust's hold on Drustvar was broken, and the Heartsbane Coven dismantled.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Drustvar\"&gt;Faction Assaults&lt;/a&gt; on Drustvar, &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand%20Inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitors&lt;/a&gt; of the Order were present to fight alongside the &lt;a href=\"Purified\"&gt;Purified&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, protecting the region and its inhabitants.\nMembership.\n &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand%20Inquisitor\"&gt;Arom's Stand Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s\nReputation.\nFaction description.\n\"An ancient Kul Tiran order resurrected to battle the threat of witchcraft, the Order of Embers fights with knowledge guiding their blades.\""}

The naaru bestowed Greydon the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt; to give to the one he deemed best. However, Greydon kept it for himself, infuriating his brother. To prove his worth, Silverlaine later stole the sword from Greydon's quarters and went to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; who was capable of summoning the Darkstorm. However, the dreadlord convinced Silverlaine to join his side. Upon returning to the order, Silverlaine killed the naaru, and the weapon shattered, its crystal shards blasting across Azeroth. With the naaru gone, Silverlaine returned to the nathrezim, Greydon settled in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and the order was shattered as was the Diamond Blade.\nDespite the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s victory, the Darkstorm couldn't come. The reason for that was the naaru's essence that survived in the form of the shattered crystal shards. It also appeared as a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Voice of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, guiding Greydon Thorne and later his children &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; to finding the shards. In the meantime, Malus managed to capture both, Greydon and Aram, in the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; while Makasa reassembled the Diamond Blade and gathered friends and allies to invade the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; fortress.\nWhen the battle started, Xaraax deemed Malus unuseful and, in turn, Malus turned on Xaraax, defeating him but also becoming &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-corrupted. Because he was of the Order of the Seven Suns, Greydon's essence was needed for the Darkstorm to feed upon his life. Fortunately, Makasa and her allies managed to free the Greydons, defeat demons, and kill Malus, avenging the naaru and putting a stop to the Darkstorm threat."}

The oldest tomes are reserved for the eyes of the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; alone. The tower used to be guarded by &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es, but in the present day none can be found here.\nAfter the Primus' disappearance, the Sepulcher was magically sealed. The Primus placed five guardians in the area around the facility, each connected to a runestone and embodying the virtues of one of the five houses of Maldraxxus, and the door was sealed with an elaborate magical lock controlled by a &lt;a href=\"Unlocking%20Obelisk\"&gt;pair of obelisks&lt;/a&gt; that will only open the door after being fed with &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe valley surrounding the Sepulcher has been turned into a swamp by the slime flowing from &lt;a href=\"Akarek%27s%20Tears\"&gt;Akarek's Tears&lt;/a&gt; and has become infested with &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s attracted to the remnants of the power in the facility.

In &lt;a href=\"Tier%2017\"&gt;Tier 17&lt;/a&gt; it functioned as a meaningful single-target DPS &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; for both Brewmaster and Windwalker monks. For Windwalkers, it was an important single-target cooldown and was the ideal talent of the row for encounters containing only one enemy. Brewmasters also benefited from its DPS potential but also could use the ability to spam &lt;a href=\"Blackout%20Kick\"&gt;Blackout Kick&lt;/a&gt; continuously for 10 seconds to build up a large amount of Shuffle, the buff it provides that increased &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt; chance and &lt;a href=\"Stagger\"&gt;Stagger&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%206.2.0\"&gt;Patch 6.2.0&lt;/a&gt; came with an implicit acknowledgement that Brewmasters' ability to use Serenity to stack large amounts of Shuffle was too strong. While the ability was unchanged for Windwalkers, Brewmasters found its duration cut in half, in addition to the other Shuffle-related nerfs. This indirectly strengthened &lt;a href=\"Chi%20Explosion\"&gt;Chi Explosion&lt;/a&gt; as a choice, as the defensive benefits of Serenity were less pronounced in &lt;a href=\"Tier%2018\"&gt;Tier 18&lt;/a&gt;."}

The real name of \"Sergeant\" is unknown, but he is described as \"huge by human standards\", easily over six feet tall. He had red hair, with a long beard, a barrel-chest and wore a black scarf and an earring in his left ear. A tough, seasoned fighter, he let his recruits know who was in charge, but also kept a sense of compassion for them.\nLord of the Clans.\nSergeant came to the attention of one &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; after the lieutenant had found the orcling Thrall next to his murdered father (&lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;) and mother (&lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;), along with one of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s traitorous guards. On the first day of training with Thrall and his other recruits, Sergeant said that the earring he wore had not been removed for thirteen years, and that with each group of recruits he issued a challenge to rip the ring out of his ear. If a recruit were to do so, he would allow them to beat him to a pulp. Thrall knocked Sergeant to the ground and in his bloodlust nearly snapped his neck in a duel. He said that was the closest any of his recruits ever came to removing the earring. This incident also introduced the young orc to the concepts of mercy and honor. After this incident, Sergeant suggested to Blackmoore that Thrall be given military history books to read, to better understand tactics and strategy.\nYears later, Sergeant and his trainees were conducting a drill where twelve of his men \u2014 armored and armed \u2014 would take on a \"wild orc\" (Thrall playing the part of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, naturally) when several orcs being transported to the camps broke loose. One of them, thinking that the men were actually attacking the young orc, shouted in &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; for Thrall to flee, that he would protect him; Thrall did not understand much Orcish, and thus misinterpreted the orc's actions as an attack. Sergeant and his men attacked and killed the orc, but the warning he had tried to give burned into Thrall's brain.\nLater on, he had to watch how Thrall fought eight rounds and became exhausted. Aedelas wanted Thrall to fight another round against an ogre but Thrall was eventually defeated. After this, Thrall was transported to his cell, but there Aedelas and others men who lose money. It was Sergeant who interrupted the men who were beating Thrall. After Thrall recovered, Sergeant boasted Thrall.\nWhen Thrall became &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; and led the new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to the gates of Durnholde, Sergeant believed that, in accordance with etiquette, they should parley with the warchief \u2014 at least long enough for the reinforcements called in by Blackmoore to arrive. However, Blackmoore sealed Durnholde's doom by throwing the head of his mistress, Thrall's friend &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt;, to the ground at the warchief's feet. With Blackmoore incapacitated by his drunkenness, and his lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Karramyn%20Langston\"&gt;Karramyn Langston&lt;/a&gt;, a weakling and a coward, Sergeant conducted the defense of Durnholde himself. In the end, the numerical superiority and brute strength of the Horde won the day; by the battle's end, Blackmoore was dead and the fortress in the hands of the Horde.\nAfter the battle ended, Thrall approached Sergeant's group of survivors, and quickly grasped the earring in Sergeant's left ear... then left it in place. In exchange for Thrall's promise that they would be spared, Sergeant and his men were disarmed and allowed to go free.\nSergeant's fate after the fall of Durnholde is unknown."}

Her husband was &lt;a href=\"Latronicus%20Moonspear\"&gt;Latronicus Moonspear&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSeeds of Faith.\nWhen a massive &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; invasion overwhelmed &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt; in the immediate after effects of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Moonspears were part of the evacuation to the top of the tree tower, but Latro fell behind. Certain that he was dead, Vestia fell to sobs of grief and despair. &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; had to implore her to get on an evacuation &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; for the mainland, telling her that he would have wanted her to go on, for himself and the others who had given their lives. To Shandris' great relief, she contained her sobs and allowed the general to guide her onto the hippogryph, who winged her away to safety.\nSoon after &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; arrived to rescue Shandris, she found Latronicus' body in one of the buildings, confirming that he was dead. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and Tyrande later conducted a mass funeral in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; for all those that had been killed in the Cataclysm, as their people gathered around them with the couple in the center. From the couple's home, a recovering Shandris spotted Vestia standing alone at the edge of the gathering. Funeral biers on wagons containing the dead were blessed one final time by Tyrande before their interment; it is highly probable that Latronicus's remains was one of them.\nCataclysm.\nWith the return of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, the scholar in Vestia spurred her to learn from them; she saw the opportunity to be more valuable than practicing strict ignorance of the arcane. She joined the Highborne at the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Estulan\"&gt;Tower of Estulan&lt;/a&gt;, teaching several of Estulan's &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20of%20Estulan\"&gt;apprentices&lt;/a&gt; the inherent danger of using arcane magic frivolously. Vestia feels she can offer these youths the guidance and wisdom they need.\nSome of Vestia's friends did not understand why she would join the Highborne, and ended their friendships with her. Vestia does not express any anger or bitterness over this, but rather wishes that they would understood her reasons for doing so.\nQuotes.\nCataclysm.\nI was once a priestess, but I've always been a scholar. The chance to learn from the Highborne seemed more valuable than practicing strict ignorance.\nWhat's more most of the apprentices here are youths who came of age during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;third war&lt;/a&gt;. They need guidance, wisdom...\nI only wish those who used to call me friend understood."}

After the adventurer proves their strength to Vex'tul joins &lt;a href=\"Fiona%27s%20Caravan\"&gt;Fiona's Caravan&lt;/a&gt;. When the caravan reaches of one the Argent towers (&lt;a href=\"Eastwall%20Tower\"&gt;Eastwall Tower&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Northpass%20Tower\"&gt;Northpass Tower&lt;/a&gt;) Vex'tul decides the time for vengeance is at hand. With the aid of the adventurer, Vex kills &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Thresh%27jin\"&gt;Warlord Thresh'jin&lt;/a&gt; and claims his body. He then asks for the adventurer to set &lt;a href=\"Body%20of%20Warlord%20Thresh%27jin\"&gt;Warlord Thresh'jin's body&lt;/a&gt; ablaze but warns that he leave the caravan and pass on to the afterlife when it is done.\nWhen the members of Caravan arrive to fight &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Anastari\"&gt;Baroness Anastari&lt;/a&gt; and prevent her from turning &lt;a href=\"Gidwin%20Goldbraids\"&gt;Gidwin Goldbraids&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, Vex'tul is among even if Thresh'jin's body was set ablaze. If the player had burned Thresh'jin's body he hovers as a spirit, but if the player still he has the body he joins the other members of the caravan in the attack."}

He is an &lt;a href=\"arcane%20elemental\"&gt;arcane elemental&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"An arcane elemental of unimaginable power, Vexallus was summoned to the Magister's Terrace by a trio of &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; who were slain by the force of his arrival. The magical energy in the surrounding crystals resonates within Vexallus, and his being is in a constant state of explosive chaotic flux.\"\nStrategy.\nVexallus will spawn Pure Energy adds every time his health drops 15% and starts to AoE the entire party at around 20% health. These adds must be taken down immediately, otherwise they will start AoEing the entire party for ~2k each.\nWhen the adds are killed, the player who killed the add gains \"Energy Feedback\", a debuff that causes 300 Arcane damage per second, but also increases all damage dealt by 50% (this debuff can stack multiple times, renewing its timer on application, increasing both the damage taken and the damage increase buff). Allowing too many stacks of the debuff to build up on a single player will likely kill them if the healer can not keep up, so it is best to spread them out among the tank and DPS'ers, or otherwise. (See: Sample Group).\nThe fight is essentially a race against your healer's mana pool and maximum HPS (healing per second). As more and more debuffs pile up, it becomes harder and harder to keep everyone alive (similar to the combined Garottes in the &lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt; fight). However, in order to kill Vexallus fast enough when he enrages, you must accumulate debuffs in order to increase your group's DPS (unless you substantially out-gear the encounter).\nAll damage dealt by Vexallus and the adds is Arcane (including his melee attack) and cannot be shield blocked or spell reflected. Stacking Arcane resist will help immensely, although high DPS must be maintained, and quick bursts of 5K-6K damage are very common. The damage portion of the debuff from killing an add is not resistible in part or whole. Arcane Protection Potions will significantly ease the load on your healers.\nThere are several ways to approach this fight, depending on group makeup. \nHeroic Strategy.\nWarlock Minion Zerging.\nAny group with a warlock speced for master summoner can make this fight so easy it's laughable. Simply have them summon a voidwalker, and have the voidwalker take the first set of sparks. From here you have two options depending on the group's dps. For a group with lower dps, simply sacrifice the voidwalker once it has taken the sparks and begin summoning a new one; as long as you act quickly, you should have a voidwalker ready to take every single set of sparks. With a high dps group it is possible (and safer) to use health funnel to keep the voidwalker alive to take a second round of sparks. This lowers the risk of not having the voidwalker available to take the sparks, because your group will be spawning them rather rapidly. If your group is still getting overwhelmed with sparks it is recommended that your group slows down on dps until there is a voidwalker ready to take the sparks. IMPORTANT NOTE - Always sacrifice the voidwalker before the next one is summoned, otherwise you run the risk of resummoning it with the debuffs still applied.\nDruid Overload Strategy.\nBringing any type of druid makes this fight much easier. Once Vexallus gets to ~20%, have the druid use barkskin and tranquility. The amount healed will mitigate most of the damage which occurs when he starts his overload. Any druid spec can do this since tranquility heals for an enormous amount. It is critical to remember to barkskin, otherwise tranquility will end prematurely because of the pushback from overload.\nOff-Healer Strategy.\nFor groups with a DPS that can act as a second healer, this fight gets much easier. The key is to take it slowly, spread the debuff from the adds around, and keep the in coming damage low. Make sure the adds die before they 'pop' and lets some of the debuffs run out. Everyone can get healed up before each 15%. Let the DPS takes the last couple adds so that they have a decent +damage going into the enrage. \nHave the healer switch to damage at 20% and it should be simple.\nStrategy 1.\nTwo Pure Energy adds appear at 15% health intervals until 25% health remains, for a total of ten.\nVexallus goes into Overload at 10%, making any remaining adds more dangerous; therefore, controlling your DPS may be necessary. \nSample Group.\nA sample fight for a Warrior, Priest, Mage, Warlock, and Rogue group:\nAs you can see, the key to this fight is to hit the \"adds\" as soon as possible. Providing this is done, the damage done to the DPS should be negligible.\nAlternate Strategy via Narkotyxx:\nIf you have a shadow priest with a good arcane resist set (200 or above), he/she will act as the tank. Vexallus does arcane and nature damage only, so this will counter the lack of armor. Have your regular tank work on killing the sparks. I can vouch for this being I have done this a couple time already, with the encounter being easy. Just ensure that you hold the dps after each spark to let the debuff go off.\nAlternate Mage Strategy.\nA mage with the following macro\n /stopcasting\n /target Pure Energy (or \"/tar Pure\")\n /cast Ice Lance\ncan easily dispatch all of the Pure Energies in heroic mode, often collecting 6-8 debuffs at a time before wiping them with &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, provided your group has enough DPS to finish him off during the overload without the +damage buffs.\nWarlock tips.\nA warlock can also tank this fight fairly easily, provided it has sufficient arcane resistance. With the following macro, the fight becomes simple;\n /cast Searing Pain\n /petattack Pure Energy\nThis will ensure you hold aggro, while at the same time telling your pet to attack pure energy immediately, assuming you spam-click this macro. Using sacrifice on voidwalker when its about to die also helps a lot.\nSince there is no guaranteed amount of adds the voidwalker can take, considering the sometimes spontaneous movement of them, it is useful to have a macro to inform your group when your voidwalker is down, and let them know that its time for the next adds-taker. You can normally expect it to take two waves, using this strategy.\nIt is not recommended to tank the boss if your arcane resistance is only above 200 due to your felhunter, as it will quickly drop when your felhunter takes adds. Either that, or the warlock's function as an adds-taker is wasted.\nAlternate Shadow Priest Strategy.\nShadow Priests offer a cool way to handle the fight using Vampiric Embrace. Simply have the priest kill 3-4 of the adds to increase damage by 150 to 200%. Apply Vampiric Embrace, dot up Vex and the passive heals will heal the shadow priest through the periodic damage of the debuff. Its helps to have a tank with good threat generation or perhaps have the tank kills one or two of the adds to increase their threat generation.\nPatch 3.0.2.\nAs of patch 3.0.2, the damage from the Energy Feedback is now resistable. Assuming that this is not reverted, this fight has become laughably easy. Any tank, assuming a heroic-level life pool (~12000), that stacks arcane resistance gear past 300 should be able to tank this in heroic without issue.\nQuotes.\nAggro:\nDischarges Energy:\nOverload:\nKills player:\nGains.\nAfter killing this NPC you will gain:"}

The Box of Chocolates contains six items randomly selected from a list of five; four chocolates, and this empty wrapper. Odds favor getting a selection of three of the chocolate from any one box, but other combinations are common as well. \nThis is the least common of the five items that can be found in the Box of Chocolates, appearing less than half as often as any of the chocolates.\nCreates.\nUsing an Empty Wrapper to wrap an item creates a &lt;a href=\"Wrappered%20Gift\"&gt;Wrappered Gift&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wrapped%20Gift%20Package\"&gt;Wrapped Gift Package&lt;/a&gt; container item which can be mailed or given to others.\nNotes.\nThis item does not participate in the &lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Tooth\"&gt;Sweet Tooth&lt;/a&gt; achievement, but it is a factor. Every time this item is drawn from the Box of Chocolates is a null towards completing the achievement.\nOf the five items that can be drawn from a Box of Chocolates, this is the only one that does not expire. \nNotes.\nThe existing Wrapping Papers in WoW all stack 10 high before use. The created gift packages do not stack. Only Wrapping Paper of the same type will stack.\nIt is easy to miss that this item isn't just useless junk. Conceptually, a candy wrapper is a much smaller item than a sheet of wrapping paper, the flavor text only indicates a candy is missing, and the \"Empty Wrapper\" has no sell price, leading a player to think it is worthless. \nUnlike many of the \"Love is in the Air\" items, including the &lt;a href=\"Box%20of%20Chocolates\"&gt;Box of Chocolates&lt;/a&gt; container it come from, the \"Empty Wrappers\" do not expire shortly after the event.\nWarning.\nA common scam was to wrap up a worthless item and &lt;a href=\"COD\"&gt;COD&lt;/a&gt; it to a player, hoping that they would accept and send back a large amount of gold for a poor quality item. This was fixed in a patch so players cannot mail wrapped items anymore. However, scammers now just send the wrapping paper itself now."}

This consists in a breach of the \"World of Warcraft\" &lt;a href=\"End-User%20License%20Agreement\"&gt;End-User License Agreement&lt;/a&gt;, which requires the user to agree not to connect to unauthorized emulated servers. &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard has made substantial effort to prevent the authoring, distribution and hosting of third party game servers, with responses including legal action against their developers and sites.\nDescription.\nEmulated servers are usually created by writing or using custom emulation software which mimics the behavior of an official &lt;a href=\"Realm\"&gt;game server&lt;/a&gt;. For this reason, players are experiencing a third party product that may have new or different features and bugs from the official servers. Some servers offer incentives or advantages to play upon them such as custom or new items, access to cheap or free items and equipment, boosted experience and drop rates, disabled fall damage, access to inaccessible areas, the ability to go to war with your own faction, ability to go past the current level cap, instant max level, or even &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;Game Master&lt;/a&gt; powers for certain users. In the majority of cases, the purpose of a private server is to make money off donations or micro-transactions (such as buying special items).\nScripted events, such as boss encounters and many newer quests, are often broken on private servers and must be updated manually. For instance, around the time of \"Cataclysm\"'s release, private servers were still trying to script bosses in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. With the extensive use of &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt; in \"Cataclysm\" private servers are likely to decline significantly."}

When you accept Belnistrasz will run towards the entrance of the instance and stop at a room close by to the zone where the idol is. He will attack the idol and you will need to protect him while he cast his spells. 7 waves of mobs will attack you. Each wave is an elite caster, elite melee and 2 non-elite boars. After 3 minutes &lt;a href=\"Plaguemaw%20the%20Rotting\"&gt;Plaguemaw the Rotting&lt;/a&gt; will finally attack you. Kill it and the quest will be finished.\nDue to the spawn rate of the mobs, you might not ever exit the combat phase during this battle, precluding you the opportunity to drink for mana. Ration your mana wisely. A good tip is to read what the escort NPC says to see how far along into the battle you are. One important fact is that it doesn't actually matter how many of the spawns you kill, all that matters is surviving long enough to defeat Plaguemaw the Rotting and keeping Belnistrasz alive. If you can cycle CCs and tanks properly, you can complete the quest having only killed 5 or 6 mobs.\nWhen the quest is accepted:\nDuring the ritual:\nIf attacked:\nBe sure to click on the &lt;a href=\"Belnistrasz%27s%20Brazier\"&gt;brazier&lt;/a&gt; Belnistrasz leaves behind for the reward."}

The first is just past the first trash pull on the &lt;a href=\"Cyclone%20Summit\"&gt;Cyclone Summit&lt;/a&gt;, before reaching the bridge, hanging off to the east. The next can be found immediately past &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Vizier%20Ertan\"&gt;Grand Vizier Ertan&lt;/a&gt;, to the right (southeast) of the ledge with the Slipstream, just underneath it.\nThe next two Golden Orbs are located off of the first bridge on the &lt;a href=\"Nimbus%20Rise\"&gt;Nimbus Rise&lt;/a&gt; after the storm drake, guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Gale\"&gt;Howling Gale&lt;/a&gt;s. Players can either chance it by interrupting the gales and jumping off the ledge normally, or by letting the gale blow them in the direction of the orb. Repeatedly right-click the orb as it gets in range. The left Slipstream near the instance line will take players close to that location.\nThere is an orb or two available during the &lt;a href=\"Altairus\"&gt;Altairus&lt;/a&gt; encounter, accessible by getting knocked up by the cyclones during the encounter.\nMove on to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Assad\"&gt;Temple of Assad&lt;/a&gt;, either by continuing past Altairus or taking the right Slipstream at the instance entrance. Run a third of the way up the first circular ramp with the Zephyrs floating past to see the an orb hanging in the air to the northeast. Another orb is on the \"same\" circular ramp, almost at the to top off to the east. It will take getting hit with a Zephyr for the run speed buff in order to reach this orb.\nA final orb is on the circular ramp leading down to Assad's area, about halfway down hanging off to the east. Mages can cheat by casting &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Slow Fall (ability)&lt;/a&gt; on themselves, getting hit with a Zephyr and jumping off.

{"id": "19471", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19471", "title": "Eye (Maelstrom)", "text": "The Eye is a &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;sub-aquatic region&lt;/a&gt; located in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, at the center of the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; exploded at the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, it created the Maelstrom: a magic storm that lashes the waves with wind, rain and raw magic power, and its center was named the Eye. There is not much on the surface (besides an ancient whirl of arcane energy), but beneath the waves, on the ocean's floor, dark secrets await, as well as giant sea monsters, underwater volcanoes and thermal vents.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; control the Eye, dominating it from their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt; also inhabit the Eye with the city of &lt;a href=\"Mak%27aru\"&gt;Mak'aru&lt;/a&gt; being the center of their civilization. They hate the naga and are their sworn enemies, Unfortunately, they don't seem to care much for outsiders of any kind, no matter their intentions.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited it, he said he saw more forms of life in the Eye than he imagined existed in all the world, because he saw creatures that defied categorization as they seemed more like alien organisms from other &lt;a href=\"plane\"&gt;plane&lt;/a&gt;s than simply animals native to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Eye was once the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, which means \"Glory of Azshara\". It played a key role in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, for it was the site of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s first invasion of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. When the Well exploded during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, Zin-Azshari shattered and sank, and the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; was created. The city ruins are now scattered throughout the Eye.\nFor as long as the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;eastern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;western&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;s have existed, the Maelstrom has made sea travel between the two difficult. Both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; lost numerous &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Reaches\"&gt;Drowned Reaches&lt;/a&gt; during the exodus to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, during &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s expedition, he was shipwrecked on &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;one lone island&lt;/a&gt; not far from the Maelstrom, somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. It was here that he met the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; and saved them from zealous &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, thereby enlisting them as members of the Horde.\nIn a desperate gamble, the Alliance is planing to outfit hundreds of their best and brightest with the magic and technological items necessary to survive underwater. With the help of some allied &lt;a href=\"makrura\"&gt;makrura&lt;/a&gt;, they plan to stage an attack on &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;. However, the attack would simply be a distraction in order to allow a small group of adventurers to enter the city, steal into the palace, overcome &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses, capture her, and return her to the surface. The Alliance plans to either siphon the captured queen's &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; powers or use her to enlist the help of the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nOn the surface, the Eye is a vast arcane storm swirling with magical power, the Maelstrom, which creates a great vortex beneath the waves, forming a massive whirlpool that leads into the depths of the Eye, drawing in ships and creatures foolish enough to get too close. The Maelstrom also creates a wall of swirling water, nearly impassable, beneath the surface thus accessing the Eye is no mean trick.\nThe ocean floor is volcanic and undersea volcanoes belch magma and steam into the water. Thermal vents release strange gases, which manifest as large bubbles that rise toward the surface. Natural life thrives around these vents, devouring the nutrients released from the world's core. &lt;a href=\"%3ASeaweed\"&gt;:Seaweed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt; and more bizarre creatures \u2014 pale, eyeless &lt;a href=\"worm\"&gt;worm&lt;/a&gt;s and spiderlike &lt;a href=\"crab\"&gt;crab&lt;/a&gt;s with eyes on stalks, among others \u2014 appear in profusion. In addition to these harmless creatures, the Eye is home to &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"octopus\"&gt;octopi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hydra\"&gt;hydra&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"threshadon\"&gt;threshadon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"frenzies\"&gt;frenzies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"giant%20squid\"&gt;giant squid&lt;/a&gt;s. Surprisingly, it seems there are no &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"mur%27gul\"&gt;mur'gul&lt;/a&gt;s in the Eye. It is presumed that either the naga slay any murlocs they find here, or the dim creatures are sharp enough to steer clear of this place. As for mur'gul, perhaps the naga consider their capital too sacred to allow their slaves access.\nFurther within the center of the Eye, the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20%28Maelstrom%29\"&gt;Rift&lt;/a&gt; is located, which is all that remains of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. It goes deep down into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s core, allowing magma from the depths to rise up. The naga capital of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; is built into its walls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20Deep\"&gt;Pillar Deep&lt;/a&gt; is located to the northeast of the Eye, and the &lt;a href=\"Gishan%20Caverns\"&gt;Gishan Caverns&lt;/a&gt; to the north. To the southeast there is the &lt;a href=\"Boiling%20Terrace\"&gt;Boiling Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, and in its southeastern edge lies the &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Reaches\"&gt;Drowned Reaches&lt;/a&gt;, which holds the remains of all the ships that have been dragged into the gigantic whirlpool. Oppositely, on the southwestern side of the Maelstrom and around the perimeter of the Eye, lies the &lt;a href=\"Scintal%20Reef\"&gt;Scintal Reef&lt;/a&gt;, which encloses the makrura city of &lt;a href=\"Mak%27aru\"&gt;Mak'aru&lt;/a&gt;."}

The fight against Malygos is comparable to the fight against Onyxia in that he is a solo raid boss housed within his own instance. \nBackground.\nFrom within the safety of his personal domain, the Eye of Eternity, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; coordinates a crusade to reestablish his dominance over the arcane energies coursing through Azeroth. In his eyes, the foolish actions of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and other mortal magi have plunged the world into chaos, and the abuse of their powers will no longer be tolerated. Threatened by the Spell-Weaver's brutal tactics, the Kirin Tor has allied itself with the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the two groups closely observe Malygos, searching for a way to thwart his campaign and strike out at the Aspect of Magic, but thus far the elusive Spell-Weaver has proven difficult to engage. \nAt &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient meeting ground of the dragonflights, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and the ambassadors of other flights have discussed Malygos' recklessness and reluctantly concluded that he is beyond the point of salvation. With the red dragons' assistance, Azeroth's heroes may be able to accomplish what has formerly been unthinkable: challenging the Spell-Weaver from inside the Eye of Eternity. Sustaining the safety of Azeroth depends on Malygos' defeat, but his end will also herald a new age: a world of unguarded magic, absent of the Dragon Aspect powerful enough to watch over it.\nDragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest.\nThanks to &lt;a href=\"Tarecgosa\"&gt;Tarecgosa&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; started working with Deathwing in the Eye of Eternity.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nHowever, there is a difference between the in-game and book version of this event. When Kalecgos became the Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; flew into the Eye, where he met with an alternate timeline version of &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;. As Blackmoore mounted Arygos, however, he plunged his sword into the back of the dragon's skull, killing him. The Twilight Father used Arygos's blood to activate the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; and siphon the magic from the Nexus into the massive chromatic dragon &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to life. \nDeathwing's fall.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; was needed once more in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul instance&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; sent several of their most powerful shamans under the leadership of to ambush the heroes at the Eye.\nLegion.\nServing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Xylem\"&gt;Archmage Xylem&lt;/a&gt; came here where he could use the Focusing Iris to wreak untold havoc on Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s and siphon their energy directly into himself. Drained of magic, Azeroth would be ripe for destruction by his demon masters and his power would become limitless."}

It is the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s main base where Ysera and her brood watches over both the dream and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from. It was founded shortly after Azeroth's (and thus also the Emerald Dream's) creation when the green dragonflight was charged with their task of protecting both realms. The other green dragons honored Ysera by naming the field and that created within the Eye of Ysera.\nHistory.\nStormrage.\nPlanning to drain Ysera's power, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; seized the Eye and imprisoned Ysera within it during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, assaulting her in a storm of magic. Both attempting to break free and help the outside forces led by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; against the Nightmare, Ysera called upon &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt; to aid her. As Lucan approached the Eye, he was amazed by the golden structures which were \"too perfect\" to have been built by men. Magically slipping through the main dome's wall, Lucan found Ysera who asked him to repel the Nightmare's powers which kept her from contacting Malfurion.\nWhen Ysera finally managed to inform Malfurion about how the &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt; was not the main force behind the Nightmare, their conversation was also detected by &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;. Driven to a furious rage upon discovering her location, he hazardously hurried to the Eye in order to free her. When he arrived, the buildings were being twisted and warped by the Nightmare to both fend him off and hide Ysera's exact location within the Eye. They became \"jagged, toothy things that looked ready to impale the dragon\" and changed places with each other.\nEranikus swiftly discovered which dome Ysera was hidden in, and began to tear it apart. Not only was he assaulted by the Nightmare's taint radiating from the walls, he was also attacked by &lt;a href=\"Lethon\"&gt;Lethon&lt;/a&gt;. Temporarily fending him off, Eranikus managed to tear apart the dome's roof before Lethon returned. Continuing the fight with Lethon, Eranikus commanded Malfurion to free Ysera while he kept Lethon away. He somewhat failed though, as Lethon not only rapidly grew stronger than him by absorbing the Nightmare's power, but also interrupted Malfurion's attempt to free Ysera.\nAs Lethon began to overpower Eranikus, he told how the &lt;a href=\"dragons%20of%20Nightmare\"&gt;dragons of Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; soon \"would be able to fly Azeroth's skies unimpeded\". Eranikus decided to destroy Lethon, even if he had to sacrifice himself, to prevent that from happening. Dragging Lethon with him, Eranikus pulled them both into a vortex between the Emerald Dream and Azeroth. Located in the vicinity of the Eye, the vortex connected both realms, creating a turbulent nexus in the middle. Overwhelmed by the shredding power, Lethon was torn asunder, creating a fiery maelstrom which swallowed Eranikus.\nThe maelstrom's powers then began to roam the area. To contain them and prevent any more destruction, Malfurion managed to steer the energies to the dome Ysera was trapped within, reducing it to mere vapor. Free at last, Ysera ascended to the air above her former prison and emitted an aura which brightened the entire Eye. Fully fending off the Nightmare, her aura revitalized the Eye and restored it to its lush state."}

The keeper plucked his own eye from his head and gave it to Mueh'zala, allowing him to see through it beyond the &lt;a href=\"veil\"&gt;veil&lt;/a&gt; and into the Shadowlands. There he saw the winged &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, inspiring him to create his own beings based on them: the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to Odyn, Mueh'zala subsequently delivered the keeper's all-seeing eye to his master, &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, who transformed it into a weapon of darkness.\nThe Eye constantly searches the Maw for enemies of the Jailer, and once an individual in the Maw has drawn the Eye's notice, anything of import they do will catch the attention of the Jailer, causing him to unleash &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;increasingly deadly threats&lt;/a&gt; against them. However, if the victim hides from the Eye for long enough, the Jailer inevitably turns his attention elsewhere. Furthermore, one can conceal themself from the Eye using tools such as &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; wards.\nChains of Domination.\nWhen the Jailer pulled the realm of &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; into the Maw, his Eye physically accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces attacking the realm. However, the city's powerful magic prevented the Eye from breaching its defenses or peering inside.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s discovered that the Jailer's servant &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; was capturing and sacrificing Odyn's Val'kyr. The heroes freed the Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Danica%20the%20Reclaimer\"&gt;Danica&lt;/a&gt; and flew with her to &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt;, where they delivered Helya's message to Odyn: that she would twist every Val'kyr he sent and that his own eye betrayed him. Odyn declared that this \"insult\" could not stand and ordered the heroes to create an instrument, the &lt;a href=\"Ilskahorn\"&gt;Ilskahorn&lt;/a&gt;, with which they would lure his Eye to battle, and to recruit a group of worthy Val'kyr to accompany Danica in battle. The Maw Walkers returned to the Maw and, after binding the Ilskahorn to the Maw with the help of the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;, traveled to the terminus of the and used the instrument to summon both the Val'kyr and the Eye. The heroes and Val'kyr managed to defeat the Eye's &lt;a href=\"Chosenseeker%20Eye\"&gt;lesser minions&lt;/a&gt; and forced it to flee back to its master's side in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. Both Odyn and the Maw Walkers' allies rejoiced at the Eye's defeat, emboldening their continued advance against the Jailer.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"When &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was young, &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; traded his eye to &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; to peer into the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. Vain Odyn was deceived, for &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; twisted the Eye to serve his own ends. The Eye's unwavering gaze allows the Jailer to see all that transpires within his domain--and perhaps others as well.\"\nOverview.\nThe Eye of the Jailer fights players directly on the platform at first. Upon reaching 66%, and 33% health remaining, the Eye of the Jailer unleashes two of its Deathseeker Eyes to assault players on the platform and retreats to fight from a distance.\nWhen all of its &lt;a href=\"Deathseeker%20Eye\"&gt;Deathseeker Eye&lt;/a&gt;s have been defeated the Eye of the Jailer becomes enraged, unleashing Immediate Extermination and beginning its final assault."}
{"id": "682265", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=682265", "title": "Eye of the Jailer (mechanic)", "text": "The Eye of the Jailer is one of the core mechanics of the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; at max level, representing the gaze of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;physical entity&lt;/a&gt; of the same name. Players are not intended to stay in the zone all day - and the Eye of the Jailer will encourage players to leave once the difficulty ramps up. It resets daily.\nThe mechanic is disabled for players who complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Focusing the Eye&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;, allowing those players to stay in the Maw as long as they like.\nSources.\nThe Eye of the Jailer threat level is raised by killing enemies and completing tasks in the Maw, and is displayed on a circular bar surrounding a symbol of the Eye at the top of the player's screen:\nLanding the last hit on a normal mob is worth 6 points. The last hit on an elite is worth 12 points. Merely being on the threat table (and thus eligible for loot), but not landing the last hit is worth 0 points.\nThe act of completing the objective of a daily/weekly/etc quest will raise the threat level, not turning it in. For instance, should players be tasked with gathering eight chains, the moment they loot the eighth chain they will gain 50% of a threat level. Ve'nari will grant her Stygia/reputation award on turn-in.\nPlayers' first objective is to max out Ve'nari reputation. The objective here is to \"waste\" quest threat since players should have already hit max threat before completing objectives. To gain reputation as effectively as possible, first start by nearly completing quest objectives. For instance, if the quest asks to gather eight chains, collect seven of them, then leave the area. Once that is done, kill as many rares and rare-elites as possible, but avoid killing the event mobs, as the 40 reputation per 300 threat is the least efficient source of reputation in the zone.\nAt threat tier four, work on other objectives like Wrath of the Jailer events or a Beastwarrens hunt. That should push the threat level to tier five. Then, quickly complete quest objectives and turn them in. Ve'nari will still grant her reputation/Stygia at max threat. Exit the Maw to regain health, then return for another quick hit-and-run to a different quest objective area.\nMechanics.\nThe Eye of the Jailer has six stages, each with increasing threats:\nSoulseekers.\n&lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Soulseeker\"&gt;Mawsworn Soulseeker&lt;/a&gt;s are normally neutral mobs in a few quest areas. At level one, they turn hostile.\nTowers.\nTowers will spawn a ~10-yard radius white swirly underneath the player. Get well clear of it or Soul Surge will hit for 50% of max health and spawn five Shackles to snare the player:\nAssassins.\n&lt;a href=\"Assassin%20%28Maw%29\"&gt;Assassins&lt;/a&gt; (appearing in-game as \"&lt;Name&gt;'s Assassin\") are level 61 mawsworn humanoids with a handful of variants that will spawn following some telegraphs:\nThe next time the player enters combat, an Assassin will spawn and aggro on the player:\nAssassins have various abilities, but always lead off with a charge of The Jailer's Mark, unless protected by the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20the%20Unseen\"&gt;Sigil of the Unseen&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;:\nKilling 100 assassins (of any variety) awards the achievement &lt;a href=\"Who%20Sent%20You%3F\"&gt;Who Sent You?&lt;/a&gt;.\nWinged abductors.\n&lt;a href=\"Stygian%20Abductor\"&gt;Stygian Abductor&lt;/a&gt;s occasionally attack without warning. They will swoop out of the sky and pull the player ~50 yards into the air, immediately applying Soul Brand (unless protected with the &lt;a href=\"Soul-Stabilizing%20Talisman\"&gt;Soul-Stabilizing Talisman&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt;), and will wind up a 10-second cast of Quietus Strike that will launch the player from the Maw. Quickly finish it off before the cast finishes!\nImmediate extermination.\nIn this final stage, players lose incoming healing by 10% every twenty seconds, stacking to -100%. At that point, players start taking 3% of their maximum health as damage every tick. Players thus have 200 seconds (3 minutes 20 seconds) to exit the Maw or make it to Ve'nari's Refuge.\nAdditionally, all &lt;a href=\"Stygia\"&gt;Stygia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; reputation gain from drops/kills is nullified while in this stage. Players can still turn in their quests and will get their expected reputation and Stygia.\nIn-game implementation.\nIn-game, the Jailer threat value is a number from 0 to 5000, with each tier breakpoint at a multiple of 1000. While in the Maw, players can run this macro to see their raw threat value:\ncodice_1\nTo compare with the table at the top of this article: a regular (non-Perdition Hold) weekly quest adds 1000 points (100% of a threat level), normal rare enemies will raise the threat by 300 points (or 30% of a level), while rare-elites add 500 points to the total."}

Eye of the Storm is a 15 vs 15 domination battleground, where each side attempts to control the Mage Tower, Fel Reaver Ruins, Blood Elf Tower, and Draenei Ruins for as long as possible. The draenei seek to claim it due to its proximity to the naaru's mysterious vessel, Tempest Keep. This battlefield is coveted by the blood elves for its rich energy deposits.\"\nOverview.\nEye of the Storm is a battleground which combines the overall &lt;a href=\"resource%20race\"&gt;resource race&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Basin\"&gt;Arathi Basin&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Capture%20the%20Flag\"&gt;Capture the Flag&lt;/a&gt; mechanic of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe main objective for each team is to hold as many towers as possible, much like in Arathi Basin, and then to score points by bringing the flag from the center of the map to one of the those towers. The towers work much like those in the Eastern Plaguelands or &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;: players stand in them to capture them and the more people standing in them the faster the capture goes. More towers held increases the potential to score points. Each flag return to a friendly tower rewards points depending on the number of towers controlled by the team. The game ends when one side reaches 1600 points. If the flag carrier dies (similar to Warsong Gulch) then the flag is dropped and can be picked up by any player. Thus it is possible, and sometimes tactically advantageous, for one team to allow the opposing team to pick up the flag initially, then kill the flag carrier and seize the flag, returning it to one of its towers and scoring a flag capture. If the flag is not promptly picked up after being dropped, it will return to its spawn point (much like Warsong Gulch). Again, a player may return the flag to any tower owned by their team, so holding many towers is helpful not only in scoring points, but also in creating more options in retrieving the flag.\nThe four areas of the battleground are as follow: the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt; tower, the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20reaver\"&gt;Fel reaver&lt;/a&gt; ruins, the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; ruins and the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20tower\"&gt;Mage tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nFalling (or jumping) in the void between the land masses kills any player, after a short fall. This doesn't cause any durability penalty.\nBasic rules.\nNB: Based on the opposing faction controlling whichever towers you do not, neutral towers are not included in the calculation for either side\nStrategies and opinions.\nFlag fighting strategy.\nOne often used strategy is to have one or two people capture each tower on the starting side of the battleground at the beginning of the match, with the rest of the team quickly pushing to the flag and gaining control of the middle. However, this strategy only works when the other team uses the same strategy. If the other team goes for towers while your forces are in the middle, you will lose the game in mere minutes as the other team racks up 10 points per second and your team is standing there with a useless flag. \nFights should take place near a tower, on the hill. Fighting outside the cap radius of a tower does not advance the control meter and does not stop the graveyard from spawning enemies.\nThree tower strategy.\nIf one side has three towers, and the other side only has one tower, it is most likely that the side with three towers will win, even if the other side captures all the flags from start to finish. The reason for this style of play is that flag capping gives points depending on the number of towers the same side controls. If you have more towers, flag caps are worth more. If you have fewer they give fewer points. At the current mechanics, no number of flag runs can win the game for the side which only controls one tower from start to finish.\nThe best strategy is to capture three towers right at the start. Groups 1 and 2 will head to one of the opponent's towers while one person from Group 1 or 2 will cap the same tower on their side. Group 3 will head to the other tower on your side and cap it, staying there to defend. The flag is left alone. No-one should go for the flag, although there is an option to get a druid to head for the flag, in case the opponent is following the same course of action.\nIf you are Alliance, the forces will look something like this\nIf you are Horde, it will look something like this\nOpinions on flag fighting strategy.\nSome do not agree with the Flag-Fighting Strategy. Assuming 100% flawless execution of the strategy, all these have to occur.\nThis strategy requires you to maintain control of the midfield while ensuring a proper tower defense, as well as flag-running consistently. While this strategy is quite common in PUGs, it is very difficult to utilize properly, as it requires a large amount of teamwork, and there are many counter-strategies an organized team can use. Speculation for the use of this strategy is an attempt to accrue honor via &lt;a href=\"Honorable%20Kill\"&gt;Honorable Kill&lt;/a&gt;s.\nOpinions on tower control.\nPro Tower Control\nIf your side controls only one tower, regaining control of a second tower should be the highest priority. If the other side controls three towers it is virtually impossible to win no matter how many times you capture the flag. To see this, consider the case where your faction controls one tower and the other faction controls three. The other faction is gaining four points more per second than your faction (5 vs 1). Each flag capture for your faction is worth 75 points (in this scenario). You would have to capture the flag every 18.75 seconds to negate the 4 point per second difference. Even if you manage to cap every 18.75 secs you are only keeping pace with the opposing faction. A faction which controls only one tower for most of the battle cannot win.\nCapturing the flag in a 1 versus 3 situation still gives you points. However, holding the flag will prevent the opposing faction from earning an even greater point advantage. So it is reasonable to have a few people trying to capture flags\u2014after all, if you have the flag then they can't get 100 points for it.\nWhile a team holding three towers is in a better position to four-cap (take control of all the bases), they may find trouble with the opposing faction pushing in force on their third tower with only one or two people from that faction running the flag. This can ultimately make or break the game depending on how strong the defense of that tower is.\nAnti Tower Control\nAny strategy involving the capture of three towers is extremely risky due to defenses being spread too thin. The only time it should ever be attempted is when you significantly outnumber your opponents, or you're running a premade with flawless coordination.\nCapturing two towers, playing defense, and above all, controlling the flag spawn leads to a virtually guaranteed victory as long as everyone is on board.\nComparative View\nAny strategy is regarded as a good strategy if it works. Teams who try for three towers and can't get them for several minutes should switch to two towers plus flag-running, before they fall too far behind. Teams who can't gain control of the middle should try for a third tower to lessen the value of the other team's flag-running. \nWith either strategy, the team has to control three points: either three towers or two towers plus the middle (and flag routes). The three points that need to be controlled are closer together in the two tower strategy, assuming the original towers are held, since the triangle formed by the three points is smaller and the graveyard will be closer if one is lost. \nPlayers who are unaware of the values of flag caps at various numbers of towers often refuse to capture until a second or third tower is gained, believing incorrectly that the difference is very large (it is very large only when a fourth tower is gained). Such arguments sacrifice points if the team controls the middle."}

With their burst of power they attacked the night elves and killed Cenarius himself."}

They are known as places of healing for those who drink of their waters, that purify their surroundings for years, and possess extraordinary restorative properties. &lt;a href=\"Magi\"&gt;Magi&lt;/a&gt; and other spellcasters can refresh their &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; in these pools \u2014 a gift from Elune to Azeroth's other defenders.\nBackground.\nThe moonlight appear as a glowing white, silver light, and is the power of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few true deities of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Worshipped by several mortal cultures throughout the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, she is best known as the primary &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;dess of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, whom she considers her \"favored children\". She is associated with the larger of the planet's two moons, the &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome tales say that &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; fell in love with the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; during the world's first nightfall. Her light guided him through the woods and showed him he was not alone. It banished fear and brought hope. Many creatures have loved the moon and pursued her to madness. She grants light as she will, on her own timetable, and moonlight cannot be captured or possessed. Even so, night after night, the White Stag chased her across the skies. He grew so swift and strong that at last he succeeded in reaching her. She was so moved by his devotion and beauty that she made him her consort. To this day he loves the wilds best when they are lit by her radiance.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt; fell into madness, due to &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; poisoning, a group of ancient heroes gathered in the village of &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt; and confronted the rampaging beast. They called down the moon's wrath and Omen, blinded and stunned by the power of the moon goddess, fled into the deep waters of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Elune%27ara\"&gt;Lake Elune'ara&lt;/a&gt;. That &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;day&lt;/a&gt; marked the end of his rampage, and symbolized a new beginning for the people of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the followers of Elune.\nDuring a visit to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; explained that the kaldorei's description of Elune, as well as the demonstrated powers of the goddess, matched his experiences with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; and powerful &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. He began to offer advice regarding how to commune with powerful naaru, but while Tyrande thanked him for his opinion, she cordially requested that he refrain from making such outlandish claims when in Darnassus or in the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; is a title given to the person who channels Elune's powers in a ritual to become her avatar. Legend says that long ago, the Night Warrior was used by the night elves to secure &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. For thousands of years thereafter, none who attempted the ritual survived, for Elune's raw power tore them apart. This ritual is extremely dangerous, and even witnessing the ritual can be a danger. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; became the first night elf known to survive the ritual. The process empowered many other night elves as well, forming the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Black%20Moon\"&gt;Army of the Black Moon&lt;/a&gt;.\nUses and effects.\nAs devotees of the moon goddess, &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; can wield the moonlight to perform numerous deeds granted by Elune. They can cast a rain of solid moonlight to fall if they face enemies. They can give blessings and purify the darkness. They have the ability to calm races engaged in battle by singing a song of peace at night, until sunrise. They can also heal, mend broken bones, and grant a follower the gift of healing. When &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;'s hand was burned by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande prayed to Elune, and a stream of silver light encompassed the priestess and wrapped around Brox's hand. As the moonlight touched his fingers, in a few seconds the burned flesh healed, the gaps where bone showed through regrew, and the horrific injury utterly vanished. When &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; called on the power of Elune, the moon goddess destroyed a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, shattering it into scorching fragments, and leaving the &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; free to heal the seared flesh of its victims. She later drew on the light of Elune and used her power to blink, vanishing from where she laid. It can also be used to light more or less around the caster.\nAs the High Priestess of Elune, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; stated that she relied upon Elune's power to remain hidden during the night. Facing camouflaged &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, she used the moonlight to infuse her weapon and as an aura, in order to reveal their position and scare them away. She used the silver moonlight to draw the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Jarod\"&gt;Jarod&lt;/a&gt;'s deceased wife, &lt;a href=\"Shalasyr\"&gt;Shalasyr&lt;/a&gt;, and guided her on her sacred journey in death. When she lost her &lt;a href=\"glaive\"&gt;glaive&lt;/a&gt;, she shaped the light of Elune into a moonlight weapon that resembled her favored glaive. Against &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, the light of Elune was blazing and bright and white, then flooded the area as Saurfang froze where he stood, gripped by the spell as if turned to stone. She then used her powers in all its fury and beauty, with a dozen points of Elune's light hovering over the orc's head. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande used petrifying starlight to freeze a group of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; enemies in moonlight. During the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande used Elune's light to dissipate the fog of war created by the Horde's &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, burning their machinery in the process.\nUnder conditions, it can be used to &lt;a href=\"resurrect\"&gt;resurrect&lt;/a&gt; the dead, as Tyrande noticed that a priestess of the moon could not bring back to life a slain kaldorei who had been \"dead for several days\".\nSince the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; has roots in both the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; (through the wolf Ancient &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;) and the holy power of the goddess Elune, &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; was able to calm the cursed &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; by using the light of Elune, but only for a short time. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; was created to help the night elves control the wolf &lt;a href=\"Pack%20form\"&gt;pack form&lt;/a&gt;, mixing the power of the moon goddess with the wolf form. The scythe is said to possess untold lunar power for the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; with balance enough to keep control.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; was corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, and mournfully killed by Tyrande, tendrils of moonlight reached down from a lunar eclipse and cleansed both Ysera and the &lt;a href=\"Tears%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Tears of Elune&lt;/a&gt; from the Nightmare's taint. Despite the strength of the Nightmare eating away at &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, the light of Elune as channeled through Tyrande was enough to free the \"Tyrant of the Dream\".\nBy using Elune's Light and a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;, the priestesses of the Moon are able to create &lt;a href=\"holy%20water\"&gt;holy water&lt;/a&gt; which can notably be used to break the will of a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tarindrella\"&gt;Tarindrella&lt;/a&gt; used the water from &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;'s moonwells to imbue the night elf adventurer with the \"Vengeance of Elune\", granting them power of nature and moonlight to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Bough%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Bough of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Candle\"&gt;Elune's candles&lt;/a&gt; are artifacts of great reverence to the disciples of the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt;. Stored within the candle is true moonlight, which is harmless to most creatures, but can burn and dazzle &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt; and his minions. &lt;a href=\"Daniss%20Ghostdancer\"&gt;Daniss Ghostdancer&lt;/a&gt; channeled Elune's power into the &lt;a href=\"Drum%20of%20Primal%20Might\"&gt;Drums of Primal Might&lt;/a&gt;, harnessing the \"raw, primal might of the slain beasts\" into \"instruments of destruction\".\nPractitioners.\nDruidism.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Tahu%20Sagewind\"&gt;Tahu Sagewind&lt;/a&gt;, it is no secret that all &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; alike, can call upon &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s light (or Mu'sha as known in &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;). As creatures of the night, the night elves druids put great stock in the moon goddess and her light. By leveraging the sacred powers of the moon, the sun, and the stars, balance druids access &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magics to aid in the fight against imbalance that threatens the natural order of all things. With experience, they can also rain celestial fury on their enemies from a great distance.\nSisterhood of Elune.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; epitomize the power and grace of their race's ancient moon goddess. When the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; rode into battle, the priestesses of the Moon fought side by side with the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, singing to Elune and calling upon her power. Oftentimes the lunar goddess responded by visiting her wrath upon the night elves' enemies. It was even said that the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;esses could bring a semblance of the moon into the noonday sky, lending some of Elune's strength to the nocturnal night elves. After the battle was won, the priestesses prayed over the wounded and brought them healing. The light of Elune is a part of themselves.\nTheir battle chants can call down Elune's wrath to smite an enemy, and their prayers can heal even the gravely wounded. The night elves priests who prove themselves worthy of Elune can learn one of her spells unique to their people, &lt;a href=\"Starshards\"&gt;Starshards&lt;/a&gt;. For the most dedicated of them, it is tradition to teach them the spell known as &lt;a href=\"Elune%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Elune's Grace&lt;/a&gt;."}

As part of the Noble District, the harbor is one of the more affluent areas of the city and services the vast majority of the nightborne nobility, who reside within the nearby districts. After &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, which is found just across the water to the southwest, the Moonlit Landing is the largest series of docks in Suramar, with full access to the surrounding &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt;. The port's day-to-day operations appear to have been overseen by &lt;a href=\"Auditor%20Esiel\"&gt;Auditor Esiel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe marina received notable attention from the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen insurgents&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;their rebellion&lt;/a&gt; after the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the docks were placed under heavy security for the duration of the conflict. At this time, they were regularly patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; forces, &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20construct\"&gt;magical constructs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the Burning Legion. It also possessed its own &lt;a href=\"Marina%20Sentry\"&gt;unique division&lt;/a&gt; of security.\nThe docks are accessible via a series of stairs leading down from the Gilded Market in the northwest, which also opens onto the nearby &lt;a href=\"Midnight%20Court\"&gt;Midnight Court&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Moonlit Landing has presumably traditionally serviced the surrounding Noble District and &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt; for the 10,000 years of isolation &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; people found themselves under their magical shield. However, ships and boats had only limited usefulness during this period as the shield prevented any access to waters outside the city.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began and Suramar City was plunged into &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt;, the Moonlit Landing was used by both sides in their struggles to defeat the other. Despite the heavy security presence, the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen rebels&lt;/a&gt; used the docks as a landing point when they infiltrated a loyalist banquet being held in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Court of Stars&lt;/a&gt;, early in the conflict. Utilizing a gondola for transport, the group of disguised rebels made their way from the drop-off point at the Moonlit Landing through the nearby buildings to the nearby &lt;a href=\"The%20Gilded%20Market\"&gt;Gilded Market&lt;/a&gt;, where they continued on their mission.\nRebel agents also assassinated &lt;a href=\"Auditor%20Esiel\"&gt;Auditor Esiel&lt;/a&gt;, a loyalist official in charge of the docks, as part of the conflict. Elements of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%23Noble%20Houses%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;House Stelleris&lt;/a&gt; were also known to make use of the marina for their operations. When they attempted to kidnap &lt;a href=\"Ailen\"&gt;Ailen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%23Noble%20Houses%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;House Astravar&lt;/a&gt; as part of a power play, Nightfallen operatives raided a part of the landing and rescued the noble before he could be transported away by boat. &lt;a href=\"Corvelyn\"&gt;Corvelyn&lt;/a&gt;, a thug in the employ of House Stelleris, was also killed on the docks in a separate encounter, on the orders of the rebel-sympathizer &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Moonlit Landing avoided much of the fighting in the later stages of the conflict, and was not involved in the transport of &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; civilian prisoners to &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic bases outside the city for soul harvesting, as the nearby &lt;a href=\"Astravar%20Harbor\"&gt;Astravar Harbor&lt;/a&gt; was."}
