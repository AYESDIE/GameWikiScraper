Mandokir and his people were reluctant at first to summon Hakkar into the mortal world and revolted against the plan, but as soon as Hakkar entered the world their resistance seized and they soon fulfilled his every command.\n&lt;a href=\"Jin%27do%20the%20Hexxer\"&gt;Jin'do the Hexxer&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful lieutenants, Jin'do was originally the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Hakkari\"&gt;Hakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. After being exiled or murdered for the evil deeds they had done in Hakkar's name, they decided to wreak havoc upon the world and summon Hakkar into the mortal world. Jin'do and the remaining Hakkari trolls now reside inside the walls of the ancient Gurubashi capital of Zul'Gurub.\n&lt;a href=\"Gahz%27ranka\"&gt;Gahz'ranka&lt;/a&gt;.\nGahz'ranka is a giant sea-creature that lives in the waters of the ancient Gurubashi capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. The famous fisherman &lt;a href=\"Nat%20Pagle\"&gt;Nat Pagle&lt;/a&gt; hunted the creature for a long time, but apparently failed to capture it. Gather a group of heroes and maybe some lure. Who knows, maybe you'll succeed where Nat failed...\n&lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe long centuries following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of the world were difficult ones for the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; race. Famine and terror were commonplace within the broken kingdoms. The &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; trolls, driven to desperate ends, sought aid from ancient, mystical forces. Though both of the troll kingdoms shared a central belief in a great pantheon of primitive gods, the Gurubashi fell under the sway of the darkest one.\nHakkar the Soulflayer, a vile, bloodthirsty spirit, heard the trolls' call and decided to aid them. Hakkar gave his secrets of blood to the Gurubashi and helped them extend their civilization across most of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and certain islands of the South Seas. Though he brought them great power, Hakkar wanted more and more for his efforts.\nIn recent times, the Atal'ai priests discovered that Hakkar's physical form could only be summoned within the ancient capital of the Gurubashi Empire, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the priests have met with recent success in their quest to call forth Hakkar\u2014reports confirm the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the Gurubashi ruins.\nIn order to quell the blood god, the trolls of the land banded together and sent a contingent of High Priests into the ancient city. Each priest was a powerful champion of the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Gods\"&gt;Primal Gods&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Bat, Panther, Tiger, Spider, and Snake\u2014but despite their best efforts, they fell under the sway of Hakkar. Now the champions and their Primal God aspects feed the awesome power of the Soulflayer. Any adventurers brave enough to venture into the foreboding ruins must overcome the High Priests if they are to have any hope of confronting the mighty blood god.\n&lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kurinnaxx\"&gt;Kurinnaxx&lt;/a&gt;.\nKurinnaxx, a large &lt;a href=\"sand%20reaver\"&gt;sand reaver&lt;/a&gt;, is the first &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. He has a wide aggro radius and can see stealthed rogues.\n&lt;a href=\"General%20Rajaxx\"&gt;General Rajaxx&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe mighty &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; known as General Rajaxx commands the Qiraji armies in battle. He was described in the War of the Shifting Sands as \"a towering monstrosity, swinging clawed limbs, looming over all and always shouting commands to the insect soldiers of Qiraji and &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; during battle.\" He is currently a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; found in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. He is commonly thought to be &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;'s equal or greater in physical size.\n&lt;a href=\"Moam\"&gt;Moam&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Wall\"&gt;Scarab Wall&lt;/a&gt; prevented the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; from venturing out of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, the insect empire refused to remain idle. In preparation for their reemergence in the world, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;the shadowy master of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; commanded Emperor Vek'lor to create a new obsidian statue superior to all other &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Destroyer\"&gt;Destroyers&lt;/a&gt;. Vek'lor sought his twin brother's aid in the task, and while Vek'nilash used his physical might to craft a grand body of volcanic rock, Vek'lor fortified the shell with powerful magic. \nEmperor Vek'lor named the finished construct Moam, and observed as the dark master infused it with life. He was pleased and surprised to find that the improved Obsidian Destroyer was far more versatile than its earlier counterparts. The &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Twin Emperors&lt;/a&gt; intended to use Moam as a colossal weapon, knowing that its strengths would help it survive in the thick of melee as well as magical combat-but they did not expect for the construct's abilities to advance further without their own assistance.\n&lt;a href=\"Buru%20the%20Gorger\"&gt;Buru the Gorger&lt;/a&gt;.\nBuru guards the eggs of the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. It is only by the destruction of those eggs that Buru can be weakened until finally weak enough to break through his immensely thick armor.\n&lt;a href=\"Ayamiss%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Ayamiss the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nAyamiss is a powerful flying hunter in the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; army. She and her soldiers hover high above the ground, and when confronted, Ayamiss gets great pleasure in sacrificing random members of the opposing forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Ossirian%20the%20Unscarred\"&gt;Ossirian the Unscarred&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"Anubisath\"&gt;Anubisath&lt;/a&gt; constructs crumbled under the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s assault, a single Anubisath did the seemingly impossible - he found a way to fight back. \nOssirian targeted one of the leaders, the massive dragon &lt;a href=\"Grakkarond\"&gt;Grakkarond&lt;/a&gt;, and hurled his obsidian sword through the beast's wing. The crippled wyrm descended, crushing the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; as it fell. The dragon mauled Ossirian nearly to death, but the remaining Anubisaths and Qiraji now had a target on the ground to focus on, and they swiftly converged and overwhelmed the noble dragon. \nOssirian's beaten body was dragged back to the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; following the battle, where he should by all rights have perished. It is whispered that Ossirian found the favor of the malevolent force that reigns over the Qiraji, for in spite of his wounds, the construct survived.\n&lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lucifron\"&gt;Lucifron&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe first of the five &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker\"&gt;Flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s defending Molten Core, Lucifron is the first 40-man raid boss most players encounter. His attacks are all Shadow based, but Shadow Resistance is not needed in any way. His guards can mind control players, while he himself has an AoE Magic effect called Impending Doom that will deal 2000 Shadow damage if not dispelled quickly, as well as a Curse that doubles the mana/rage/energy cost of all abilities. Drops the Tome of &lt;a href=\"Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;Tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt;, a necessity for future bosses.\n&lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nA favored pet of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and progenitor of the &lt;a href=\"core%20hound\"&gt;core hound&lt;/a&gt;s that roam throughout the Molten Core. Goes into deadly frenzies that only &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s can dispel, has an AoE Fear, and occasionally throws Lava Bombs that ignite the surrounding area, dealing massive Fire damage. Killing Magmadar prevents core hounds that roam the instance from spawning. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%201\"&gt;Tier 1&lt;/a&gt; leg pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Gehennas\"&gt;Gehennas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe second of five &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker\"&gt;Flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s defending Molten Core. Will call down a powerful Rain of Fire on his attackers, and also has an AoE curse that greatly reduces healing.\n&lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nA powerful &lt;a href=\"Elemental%23Earth%20Elemental\"&gt;Molten Rock Elemental&lt;/a&gt; that serves as one of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' lieutenants and is partially responsible for &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;'s imprisonment. He is guarded by eight Firesworn elementals that he can combust at will. He also consumes buffs. Killing Garr prevents the &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Surger\"&gt;Lava Surger&lt;/a&gt;s that roam the instance from spawning. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%201\"&gt;Tier 1&lt;/a&gt; head pieces and one half of the &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Bindings of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nA powerful &lt;a href=\"Elemental%23Fire%20Elemental\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt; that serves as one of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' lieutenants and is partially responsible for &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Prince Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;'s imprisonment. Turns players into living bombs that explode after 10 seconds, dealing massive Fire damage to nearby allies and more often than not, killing the player. When near death, he starts a spell called Armageddon, which will likely kill anyone nearby should he succeed. Drops one half of the &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Bindings of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Shazzrah\"&gt;Shazzrah&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe third of the five &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker\"&gt;Flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s defending Molten Core. Spams a powerful Arcane Explosion and casts an AoE Curse that reduces Arcane Resistance. Will also randomly Blink towards players.\n&lt;a href=\"Golemagg%20the%20Incinerator\"&gt;Golemagg the Incinerator&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nA massive &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20Giant\"&gt;Molten Giant&lt;/a&gt;, Golemagg is the keeper of the valuable &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Ingot\"&gt;Sulfuron Ingot&lt;/a&gt;s needed to form &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras\"&gt;Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt;. He has two &lt;a href=\"core%20hound\"&gt;core hound&lt;/a&gt; pets that can not be killed until he dies. When low on health, he begins attacking much faster and causing earthquakes. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%201\"&gt;Tier 1&lt;/a&gt; chest pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Harbinger\"&gt;Sulfuron Harbinger&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe fourth of the five &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker\"&gt;Flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s defending Molten Core. His true name is not known. He is guarded by four Flamewaker Priests, who won't hesitate to heal Sulfuron or each other.\n&lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe fifth and final &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker\"&gt;Flamewaker&lt;/a&gt; defending Molten Core, Executus is &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' most trusted lieutenant, and will only appear once the protective runes throughout the Core are extinguished. His encounter is the first truly complex 40-man encounter players encounter, calling for an interesting juggling of his eight guards. Once the guards are dead, Executus will surrender and leave to go summon Ragnaros himself. He leaves behind a chest of Epic loot, most notably items required for the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; epic quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nOne of the four &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lieutenants\"&gt;Elemental Lieutenants&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, Ragnaros is a being so powerful that his entrance into this world created the volcanic wastelands surrounding &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. However, he is only a shadow of his former self, having been separated from the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; when he was summoned into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He is the final boss in Molten Core. High Fire Resistance is a must for those who wish to challenge him. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; leg pieces, as well as the primary requirements for the legendary weapons, &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras%2C%20Hand%20of%20Ragnaros\"&gt;Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury%2C%20Blessed%20Blade%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Razorgore%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Razorgore the Untamed&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe most powerful known &lt;a href=\"Dragonspawn\"&gt;Dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; in the world, Razorgore serves no master but himself. However, the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; found a way around that, creating a powerful orb that would allow the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blackrock Clan&lt;/a&gt; to control Razorgore, and uses the Dragonspawn to defend a clutch of Chromatic dragon eggs. He is the first boss in Blackwing Lair. The encounter involves using the orb to make Razorgore destroy the eggs, all while fighting off 40 other Orcs and Dragonspawn. It is known as one of the most chaotic encounters in the game, if not \"the\" most. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; bracers.\n&lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz%20the%20Corrupt\"&gt;Vaelastrasz the Corrupt&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nVaelastrasz the Red was the keeper of the red shard of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. He had sworn to destroy the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, but lost the battle inside Blackwing Lair, losing the shard as a result. The raid comes upon Vaelastrasz just as Nefarian completes his corruption, and the mighty red dragon is helpless as Nefarian orders him to kill his allies. However, before the corruption is complete Vaelastrasz gives the players a buff called Essence of the Red, granting them unlimited mana, rage, and energy. However, this buff only last three minutes, and is crucial to the encounter. The dragon will also give players Burning Adrenaline, which makes all their spells instant cast but also eventually kills them. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; belts.\n&lt;a href=\"Broodlord%20Lashlayer\"&gt;Broodlord Lashlayer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nA large black &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;, Broodlord Lashlayer oversees the suppression rooms in Blackwing Lair, keeping the many kidnapped &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; whelps in check. The encounter starts long before the raid even lays eyes on Lashlayer, as they battle their way through the complex suppression rooms. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; boots, and acquiring his head is the first of many steps in the quest to open the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Gates of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Flamegor\"&gt;Flamegor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe third of three black &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s found in Blackwing Lair. Like the other drakes, he uses Wing Buffet to reduce aggro, as well as the deadly Shadowflame, which needs to be mitigated by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20Scale%20Cloak\"&gt;Onyxia Scale Cloak&lt;/a&gt;s. His unique ability is Fire Nova, a direct damage attack that hits all enemies within his line of sight. However, he uses this only when frenzied, which can be dispelled by &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; gloves.\n&lt;a href=\"Ebonroc\"&gt;Ebonroc&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe second of three black &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s found in Blackwing Lair. Like the other drakes, he uses Wing Buffet to reduce aggro, as well as the deadly Shadowflame, which needs to be mitigated by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20Scale%20Cloak\"&gt;Onyxia Scale Cloak&lt;/a&gt;s. His unique ability is Shadow of Ebonroc, which applies a debuff to whoever is on top of the hate list. Whenever Ebonroc hits someone who has the debuff, he regains 25000 health. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; gloves.\n&lt;a href=\"Firemaw\"&gt;Firemaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe first of three black &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;s found in Blackwing Lair. Like the other drakes, he uses Wing Buffet to reduce aggro, as well as the deadly Shadowflame, which needs to be mitigated by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20Scale%20Cloak\"&gt;Onyxia Scale Cloak&lt;/a&gt;s. His unique ability is Flame Buffet, which applies a stackable Fire DoT to all enemies within his line of sight. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; gloves.\n&lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe only known &lt;a href=\"Drakeadon\"&gt;Drakeadon&lt;/a&gt; in existence. The encounter is largely random, as his two heads will each have a random breath attack, and he casts random Brood Afflictions, applying nasty debuffs to all players. His skin also \"shimmers,\" changing his vulnerability to certain schools of magic. Goes in frenzies that can be dispelled by &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and enrages at 20% health. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; shoulder pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Nefarian%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nSon of the Black &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, and lord of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. He allied the Black &lt;a href=\"Dragon\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s with the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blackrock Clan&lt;/a&gt;, and is attempting to create a &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. He also stole the red shard of the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; after defeating him, and threatened to destroy it. He is the final boss in Blackwing Lair. In Phase 1 of the encounter, players must fight off wave after wave of randomly colored &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s, all while an invulnerable Nefarian wanders amongst the raid in human form, randomly shadow bolting, mind controlling and fearing people. Nefarian leaves shortly after. Once 42 Drakonids are killed, Nefarian returns in dragon form, opening up with a Shadowflame that hits all members of the raid. He will then proceed to randomly call out classes, forcing all players of that class to do something bad based on their class (ie. forcing Druids into Cat Form, summoning hostile Infernals, etc.). At 20%, he resurrects all the dead Drakonids as Bone Constructs. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; chest pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaughter of the Black &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, and brood mother of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. When she isn't meddling in human affairs or plotting with her brother, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, she is in her lair in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, fiercely protecting her eggs. Although small for a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; her age, she is no less dangerous. The encounter is divided into three distinct phases. In the first phase, she is on the ground and is extremely difficult to tank. In the second phase, she takes flight and breathes fire down on her foes. In the final phase, she lands once again and begins fearing her attackers, all while the ground erupts beneath their feet. Drops all &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; head pieces, as well the sinew required for the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt; epic quest.\n&lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%20Skeram\"&gt;The Prophet Skeram&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nReligious leader of the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and author of the &lt;a href=\"Prophecy%20of%20C%27Thun\"&gt;Prophecy of C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, the Prophet Skeram is the first boss in Ahn'Qiraj. Creates two mirror images of himself at 25% health intervals, and both the images and himself can Blink, Earth Shock, and Arcane Explosion. He also casts True Fulfillment on random targets, mind controlling them while increasing their damage, movement and resistance, and making their spells instant-cast.\n&lt;a href=\"Kri\"&gt;Lord Kri&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nOne of the three optional &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Colossi\"&gt;Silithid Colossi&lt;/a&gt; found in Ahn'Qiraj, players must fight Lord Kri at the same time as &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Yauj\"&gt;Princess Yauj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vem\"&gt;Vem&lt;/a&gt;. Loot received from the encounter depends on the order the Colossi are killed in, and killing Lord Kri last is the hardest method and yields the best loot. He has an AoE Toxic Volley that hits all players in the room for Nature damage while applying a Poison DoT. When he dies, his corpse leaves behind a deadly toxic cloud.\n&lt;a href=\"Princess%20Yauj\"&gt;Princess Yauj&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nOne of the three optional &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Colossi\"&gt;Silithid Colossi&lt;/a&gt; found in Ahn'Qiraj, players must fight Princess Yauj at the same time as &lt;a href=\"Kri\"&gt;Lord Kri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vem\"&gt;Vem&lt;/a&gt;. Loot received from the encounter depends on the order the Colossi are killed in, and killing Princess Yauj last is the intermediary route, yielding good loot but not the best. She has an AoE Fear, and heals herself as well. Upon death, she releases a swarm of &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vem\"&gt;Vem&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nOne of the three optional &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Colossi\"&gt;Silithid Colossi&lt;/a&gt; found in Ahn'Qiraj, players must fight Vem at the same time as &lt;a href=\"Kri\"&gt;Lord Kri&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Yauj\"&gt;Princess Yauj&lt;/a&gt;. Loot received from the encounter depends on the order the Colossi are killed in, and killing Vem last is the easiest method and yields the lowest quality loot. Vem can charge his opponents.\n&lt;a href=\"Battleguard%20Sartura\"&gt;Battleguard Sartura&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nA &lt;a href=\"Qiraji%20Battleguard\"&gt;Qiraji Battleguard&lt;/a&gt; in Ahn'Qiraj, Sartura and her three guards are nasty opponents. All of them constantly reset aggro lists, the guards punt their opponents, and Sartura enrages at 20%. And if she isn't dead within 10 minutes, she goes into a super-enrage that is sure to wipe the raid.\n&lt;a href=\"Fankriss%20the%20Unyielding\"&gt;Fankriss the Unyielding&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nOne of only two known &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sandreaver\"&gt;Sandreaver&lt;/a&gt;s, Fankriss summons many, \"many\" bugs during the encounter. He has an ability called Mortal Wound which cleaves through opponents and severely hinders healing.\n&lt;a href=\"Viscidus\"&gt;Viscidus&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nA giant &lt;a href=\"Ooze\"&gt;Slime&lt;/a&gt;, Viscidus is the second optional encounter in Ahn'Qiraj, and is a highly Nature Resistance intensive fight. Not only that, but he is a very interesting fight as well. He normally takes only 50% of normal damage. However, if he is hit by enough Frost attacks (whatever the source), he will freeze. Once frozen, physical attackers move in and attack him until he shatters, exploding into 20 globs. Once these globs reunite, Viscidus appears again. Killing a glob deals 5% damage to his total health, and is the most efficient way of killing him. Drops the bindings required for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20quest%20loot\"&gt;AQ Set&lt;/a&gt; boots and shoulder pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Princess%20Huhuran\"&gt;Princess Huhuran&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nA lone &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Wasp\"&gt;Wasp&lt;/a&gt;, Huhuran is a Nature Resistance intensive fight. Goes into frenzies that need to be dispelled by &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Has deadly Nature AoE that she uses when frenzied or enraged, spews Noxious Poison, and uses an AoE Wyvern Sting that not only put players to sleep, but deals thousands of Nature damage if dispelled. Enrages at 30%. Drops the bindings required for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20quest%20loot\"&gt;AQ Set&lt;/a&gt; boots and shoulder pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Emperor Vek'lor&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nFought alongside his twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Vek'nilash&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; Emperor is immune to all physical damage, resulting in an interesting tanking situation. He spams Shadow Bolt and casts Blizzard. He reacts with an incredibly powerful attack that will wipe the raid if someone hits him with a physical attack. And for good measure, he constantly teleport-switches with his twin, who has a similar reaction to magical attacks. Drops a circlet required for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20quest%20loot\"&gt;AQ Set&lt;/a&gt; head pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Emperor Vek'nilash&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nFought alongside his twin brother, &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emperors\"&gt;Vek'lor&lt;/a&gt;, this &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; Emperor is immune to all magical damage. He has an Uppercut attack that knocks back opponents, and Unbalancing Strike, which deals massive damage and lowers Defense by 100. He reacts with an incredibly powerful attack that will wipe the raid if someone hits him with a magical attack. And for good measure, he constantly teleport-switches with his twin, who has a similar reaction to physical attacks. Drops a circlet required for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20quest%20loot\"&gt;AQ Set&lt;/a&gt; head pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Ouro%20the%20Sandworm\"&gt;Ouro&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nThe ancient &lt;a href=\"Silithid%20Sand%20Worm\"&gt;Silithid Sand Worm&lt;/a&gt;, Ouro, is a being of legendary power. He is rumored to have been created by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; himself as a mockery of life. He is the last optional boss in Ahn'Qiraj, and is Nature Resist intensive. During combat, he has a powerful breath attack called Sand Blast which deals large Nature damage, and an AoE knockback attack that often results in him targeting ranged attackers and healers. He also submerges at set intervals. When submerged, Dirt Mounds begin tearing around the room at random, dealing Nature damage to anyone caught their path. Once he reaches 20%, he enrages AND starts summoning Dirt Mounds without submerging. Drops the items required for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20quest%20loot\"&gt;AQ Set&lt;/a&gt; leg pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocation: &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;The Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; Raid 40\nOne of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; who ruled &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; prior to the coming of the &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt;, C'Thun has been plotting his revenge since the day he was defeated by a nameless Titan in the deserts of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. It was he who created the &lt;a href=\"Aqir\"&gt;Aqir&lt;/a&gt;, ancestors of the &lt;a href=\"Qiraji\"&gt;Qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, in the image of the &lt;a href=\"Silithid\"&gt;Silithid&lt;/a&gt;. And it is he who drives the Qiraji on their relentless campaign. He is the final boss in Ahn'Qiraj. During phase 1 of the fight, players must contend with his Eye, which shoots immensely powerful beams of energy, and an assortment of minor tentacles. In phase 2, his body surfaces and giant tentacles appear, including mouth tentacles that swallow players whole. Those players plummet down into his stomach, full of disgestive acid, and must defeat some tentacles inside his stomach in order to weaken him. Drops the items required for the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20quest%20loot\"&gt;AQ Set&lt;/a&gt; chest pieces.\n&lt;a href=\"Naxxramas%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn ancient &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt; ziggurat, Naxxramas was torn free from the ground by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; to serve as &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;'s base of operations as he spreads the plague throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDue to Kel'Thuzad fighting a war against the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the humans of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as constant incursions of adventurers from every race and nation into the Scourge-controlled Plaguelands on a daily basis, his forces have been severely taxed to maintain the security of his necropolis. But now the gates of Naxxramas are open, Kel'Thuzad's new forces are rapidly sweeping away all opposition to the Scourge.\n&lt;a href=\"Anub%27Rekhan%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Anub'Rekhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nA powerful Crypt Lord who guards the hallways of the Spider Wing in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Widow%20Faerlina%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Grand Widow Faerlina&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs her name suggests, Faerlina is a powerful spider in the form of a female &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;, clad in &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt;. She uses poison volleys, Rain of Fire and enrages, giving her abilities more destructive power.\n&lt;a href=\"Maexxna%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Maexxna&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaexxna is the final boss in the Spider Wing section of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. She awaits all who dare oppose her in her giant web in the outer ring of Naxxramas. She uses powerful poisons and traps players into her webs.\n&lt;a href=\"Noth%20the%20Plaguebringer%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Noth the Plaguebringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a notable Wizard and alchemist of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Noth heard the Lich king's call as &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; did, he was quick to turn his back on the light and joined the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; where he believed that real power lay. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20war\"&gt;third war&lt;/a&gt; Noth saw that many innocent lives were needed to feed the growing might of the Scourge and he came to a point where he started opposing himself, Kel'Thuzad resolved the matter by freezing his heart in his chest with his frost magic. Noth the Plaguebringer, now more undead than Human is an extremely powerful Necromancer with a various array of deadly spells and curses.\n&lt;a href=\"Heigan%20the%20Unclean%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Heigan the Unclean&lt;/a&gt;.\nA powerful &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; sorcerer who resides in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;' Plague Wing. He is believed to have invented the plague cauldrons being used in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, which were used during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, and were used in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href=\"Havenshire\"&gt;Havenshire&lt;/a&gt; besides &lt;a href=\"Noth%20the%20Plaguebringer%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Noth the Plaguebringer&lt;/a&gt;'s cauldron seen in the &lt;a href=\"Havenshire%20Farms\"&gt;Havenshire Farms&lt;/a&gt;, which is used for &lt;a href=\"The%20Plaguebringer%27s%20Request\"&gt;The Plaguebringer's Request&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Loatheb%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Loatheb&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in the Plague Wing. Loatheb uses an evil combination of incapacitating the healers by placing a one minute cooldown of every spell and placing a damage over time spell on all members of the group.\n&lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Razuvious%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Instructor Razuvious&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstructor Razuvious trains the &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; recruits of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and poses an interesting fight. The Instructor himself deals insane amounts of damage; to such extend that the only way to tank him is to &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; one of his 4 students and cycle through them as the Mind Controls run out. Above that, his fearsome shouts will drain and almost destroy anyone who hears them...\n&lt;a href=\"Gothik%20the%20Harvester%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Gothik the Harvester&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs his name suggests, Gothik is the Harvester of Souls for the undead armies of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;The Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Four Horsemen are four powerful death knights in the service of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, in his dread citadel of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.

The theme of this boss is similar to that of Frankenstein's Monster, creating something akin to an &lt;a href=\"Abomination\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt; in that it is sewn together of human parts, but also part machinery.\nWhile Thaddius is being powered up, his two \"guardians\" in the form of &lt;a href=\"Wight\"&gt;Wight&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Stalagg\"&gt;Stalagg&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feugen\"&gt;Feugen&lt;/a&gt;, attack you.\n&lt;a href=\"Sapphiron%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn ancient servant of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, - the Hand of Magic - Sapphiron was a &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; who lived with a powerful brood in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, where he communed with the ancient spirits of the dead dragons. Sapphiron was magnificently powerful, and protected the lands of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; as best he could. Though &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s malevolent influence defiled the Dragonblight, Sapphiron continued to guard his hoard of treasure from intruders.\n&lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, the King of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, thought that perhaps by equipping themselves with Sapphiron's treasures, he and &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; might be more prepared for the perilous journey through Azjol-Nerub. Arthas agreed, and journeyed into Sapphiron's lair with Anub'arak. \nSapphiron greeted the undead as they approached him. He found Arthas's honesty about stealing his treasure quite refreshing. Sapphiron and his drakes attacked with all their might, unleashing their strange, cold magics upon them. In the end, despite all odds, Arthas was victorious, and Sapphiron was defeated. As a final, clinching victory, however, Arthas used what remained of his dwindling power to recreate Sapphiron as a frost wyrm to serve the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormerly a sorcerer of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was one of the principal agents of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, responsible for the spreading of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; across &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After being slain by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, he was reborn as a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;. He then aided Arthas in summoning &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful lord of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. However, Kel'Thuzad's true loyalty was to the Lich King, and not the Burning Legion. After the Legion's defeat, Kel'Thuzad supported Arthas in wresting power from the Dreadlords. When Arthas left for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; during the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;The Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, he left Kel'Thuzad as his agent to command the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron. He now commands Scourge forces in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; from his necropolis floating above &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;."}

Though it is very hard to keep him constantly faced away because you walk a lot around with him to avoid the lightning cloud.\nIf you are having a lot of trouble with an undergeared tank, I would suggest telling him to put his NR gear on. With 250 NR I noticed that his lightning attacks did minimal damage. However, it is good to keep in mind that the extra melee damage one would take from stat sacrificing NR gear would probably make pure NR gear not such a bad idea.\nEdit: NR is a good idea because he seems to carry his personal poison cloud with him as well. If you have no NR, then keep NR totem and Poison Cleansing totem up (for Horde) and let Hunters keep Aspect of the Wild."}

At an unknown point, he was caught by the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20clan\"&gt;Gordunni clan&lt;/a&gt; and brought to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; to fight for their amusement with other slaves. He once tried to escape only to get caught. The &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s beat him and severed his leg. From that moment he was using a wooden peg during fights. He was known as skull-splitter.\nWhen the ogres caught &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren didn't say his name and said only the contempt name given by ogres - Woolbeard. Stolid, he told the boy that he would kill him, but eventually he was softened by Aram's sketches and bravery during his fights against the &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, encouraged by Aram, he assisted the other slaves in escaping. Although smashed by &lt;a href=\"Wordok\"&gt;Wordok&lt;/a&gt;, they managed to escape, Woolbeard taking the captive &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s out of Dire Maul back home. As Aram's group and Woolbeard's parted ways, the tauren said that it was an honor to meet Aram and revealed him his name. As the tauren and murlocs were leaving, an &lt;a href=\"ogre%20girl\"&gt;ogre girl&lt;/a&gt; halted them. He was ready to fight her, but she only asked them to let her join them. Having seen how &lt;a href=\"King%20Gordok\"&gt;King Gordok&lt;/a&gt; treated her, they agreed and she immediately supported the one-legged tauren and left the ruined city.\nWuul accepted &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;'s plea for help to rescue &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar Thorne&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "334844", "revid": "210711", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=334844", "title": "Wyll Benton", "text": "Wyll Benton was an elderly servant of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. He had been taking care of Anduin since the king was little and refusing his service would offend him. As far as the king of Stormwind knew, Wyll had no family and was in service to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; family almost his entire life, having served King &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Llane&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; when they, too, were young. Though old and gray-haired, Wyll was tall and heavyset. Even though he was sarcastic, Anduin knew he was a kind man, and his mild, slightly detached demeanor disguised a stubborn will and fierce devotion to the house of Wrynn. Wyll accompanied Anduin in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; during the tumultuous events preceding the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; but died of old age shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAs a young man, Wyll met and married a kitchen servant named &lt;a href=\"Vellcinda%20Benton\"&gt;Elsie&lt;/a&gt;, and they remained happily together for many years. Their social circles revolved around the royal families and the servants, as they themselves were.\nElsie was in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, visiting family in the castle, when &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. By this time, Elsie described herself as \"not young\". She was slain and raised into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;, and later became &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in the service of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, but Wyll assumed that she was simply killed during the city's destruction. Anduin never heard of him speak of his family in passing or in person, and suspected it was too painful for him to recall those times and what he believed to be Elsie's fate.\nThe Shattering.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Wyll accompanied his prince to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. After the petrification of King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, his daughter &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; returned to Ironforge. Wyll was sent to find Anduin and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge and tell them to see the princess. While Moira held Anduin and everyone else in Ironforge captive, Wyll told the prince that he was certain Varian was working on a liberation.\nBefore the Storm.\nWyll continued to serve as Anduin's manservant in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. By this point, increasing age began preventing Wyll from performing many of his duties, but he still wanted to feel like he was useful. After Anduin's speech at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Lion's Rest&lt;/a&gt; and the meeting with several Alliance members, Wyll tended to Anduin and spoke about their previous visit to Ironforge, as they were set to travel there again in the near future. Wyll assured Anduin that he would accompany him during his journey. Once they returned from Ironforge to Stormwind, Wyll tried to get everything ready for the next part of Anduin's journey. However, the king convinced him to stay in Stormwind instead and get a well-deserved rest.\nDays later, his health worsened, and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Laurena\"&gt;High Priestess Laurena&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; confirmed he was dying. Upon hearing this, Anduin wanted to heal the old man and restore his health, but Wyll, lying in bed in his chamber, refused. He told Anduin that he was tired of living in old age and wanted to see his deceased loved ones once again. He also stated that he had made a list of men he could recommend to serve as Anduin's new valet since the king was now a grown man and didn't need a child's servant anymore. Wyll did, however, allow Anduin to use the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; to ease his pain. Anduin remained by his side and started reading his book about the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; until the old man fell asleep. When he awoke, he started hallucinating about the dead loved ones waiting for him but was confused to find that Elsie was not among them. As Anduin calmed him, Wyll's last words were for Anduin to tell Elsie that he would be waiting for her. With that, the servant passed away. Anduin remained for the next hour, alone, to grieve in private.\nSpeculation.\nAs he had served both Llane and Varian when they were young, this suggests he was likely present during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War%23The%20second%20siege%20of%20Stormwind%20Keep%20and%20the%20fall%20of%20the%20kingdom\"&gt;second siege of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and survived the evacuation to Lordaeron."}

As such, the difficulty of these pulls can range from moderately easy to extremely complex. These pulls are generally viewed as being harder than the actual boss encounters they precede due to their highly variable mechanics.\nElemental Shield.\nEach wyrmguard will have a 300% weakness to a certain element (Frost, Fire, Shadow, Arcane, or Nature). All other magic damage is reduced by 75%. Because DPS is extremely lopsided in these pulls, it is very easy for casters to pull aggro through overnuking. Lower rank offensive spells must be used for these pulls, regulating damage to about 1000 per 3 seconds.\nStrategy.\nOne to two tanks should be assigned to each wyrmguard before pulling along with personal healers on each tank. Remaining warriors should be ready to pick up any wyrmguards with green brood power. Casters and ranged should be as far as possible with offtanks standing in between the MT and DPS camp to ensure a clean pickup. Green brood power wyrmguards should be killed first, then Red, Bronze, and Blue. This order frees up tanking resources and eliminates the most dangerous wyrmguards while giving tanks time to build solid aggro on the bronze and blue wyrmguards. Melee DPS should be focused on the main target to speed up takedowns.\nOn the last pull before Ebonroc, involving the 3, it is a valid strategy to pull them down into the area where firemaw was fought. The pull is done by a hunters pet and picked up by the tanks. Make sure that they are spread out incase there are two greens. With two greens involved, other tank's mobs may cause one AOE stun to hit another tank on another mob. "}

All mobs specifically identified as wyrmkin in WoW are female dragonspawn, with the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Coldarra%20Wyrmkin\"&gt;Coldarra Wyrmkin&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nWyrmkin, also known as wyrm kin, form the bulk of the dragonspawn forces. Wyrmkin are the most common and low-ranking of the spawn, but they are nonetheless fierce opponents in battle. They are tough and hardy, but not particularly intelligent. Most lack self-motivation, requiring a leader to give them specific instructions and commands. Those who show ingenuity, superior skill, or sorcererous talent are elevated to the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Flametongue%20%28dragonspawn%29\"&gt;flametongues&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"scalebane\"&gt;scalebane&lt;/a&gt;s. \nWyrmkin usually carry &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s (usually &lt;a href=\"longsword\"&gt;longsword&lt;/a&gt;s) or &lt;a href=\"spear\"&gt;spear&lt;/a&gt;s provided by their patrons. These weapons are magical, with an enhancement or other minor feature. Wyrmkin are clever &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt;s, well trained and organized. Wyrmkin are trained to setup ambushes, use hit-and-run tactics, and generally do everything they can to gain the upper hand in a battle. They employ advanced battle strategies and capable of performing advanced maneuvers utilizing terrain, ambush, and flanking, as well as distinctive formations for different foes. Most wyrmkin fight in large units, they known for flanking their enemies or taking specific formations, but they rarely think of strategies on their own. Their one critical flaw is a lack of initiative and creative, independent thinking. Despite this shortcoming, they are a feared battle unit, capable of wreaking much havoc. Fortunately, most of these groups are led by higher-ranking dragonspawn, to whom the wyrmkin looks for orders. Wyrmkin are almost always fighters, although some &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s are found within their ranks, but very rarely \u2014 those who show such talent are promoted to the flametongue legions.\nWhile most wyrmkin are content \u2014 and often eager \u2014 to serve their dragon patrons, some strike out on more adventurous paths. Sometimes, a dragonspawn rebels against her oppressive culture, while other times a wyrmkin's patron or &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; offers its blessings on her quest. Some adventuring wyrmkin are on lengthy missions for the dragonflight, exploring new places and discovering new magic.\nThey speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draconic\"&gt;Draconic&lt;/a&gt;."}

Among them, the red dragonflight was the most active of the four, with a large number of red dragons guarding &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the former Aspects decided to officially dissolve the Accord, however, Kalecgos opposed this decision and manages to convince them to hold the Accord and continue to protect Azeroth together.\nHistory.\nThe Nexus War.\nThe Wyrmrest Accord was founded by Alexstrasza following &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s declaration of war upon all mortal spellcasters. She gathered together representatives from the other three dragonflights, both to oppose the blue dragonflight and to defend the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; against the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. At the top of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; was placed a massive sphere, the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Orb of Unity&lt;/a&gt;, as a symbol of the dragonflights' alliance. Eventually, the blue dragon &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; as an unofficial ambassador to the blue dragonflight, openly declaring his opposition to the Nexus War.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nWith the defeat of both Malygos and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Wyrmrest Accord's activities lessened. Alexstrasza began reaching out to the remaining members of the blue dragonflight in a show of good faith, and the representatives of the black dragonflight mysteriously disappeared. After the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Wyrmrest Accord began meeting with certain blue dragons, including Malygos's son, &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;, to urge them to select a new &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; in order to help restore the shattered world. However, Arygos was still angry about the death of his father, wondering aloud if Alexstrasza would simply kill him, too, if it became convenient.\nDuring one such meeting, Wyrmrest Temple came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. The twilight dragons lured the defenders away from the temple, allowing their agents to slip into the sanctums within the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt; and corrupt all of the eggs within. Their deception was discovered by Alexstrasza's consort, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;, who sacrificed himself to destroy the sanctums and all the eggs contained within, heavily damaging Wyrmrest Temple in the process. Alexstrasza was initially unaware of the corruption of the eggs, and as a result, she was consumed with grief over their loss and distraught over the possibility that her love might have betrayed them to the twilight dragonflight. In her grief, Alexstrasza shattered the Orb of Unity, effectively ending the Wyrmrest Accord.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nEven though the Aspects worked together once more on retaking the Wyrmrest Temple and then finally on defeating Deathwing, they didn't want to continue with the Accord even though Kalecgos tried to show the importance of this draconic alliance. The former Aspects decided to officially dissolve the Accord during their next meeting the next month. Kalec however summoned the three sooner and used an artifact from Tyr to remind them the time when they had been merely &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and as they had fought against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; together. An attempt strongly criticized by the former Aspects but who gave them the will to continue to protect Azeroth by fighting together, which avoided the official dissolution of the Accord.\nReputation.\nReputation with Wyrmrest Accord can be earned by completing the following daily quests, through &lt;a href=\"Championing\"&gt;Championing&lt;/a&gt; via the Tabard, or by purchasing a &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Commendation%20Badge\"&gt;Wyrmrest Commendation Badge&lt;/a&gt; at the Emblem of Triumph Quartermaster in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nRewards.\nThe Wyrmrest Accord quartermaster, &lt;a href=\"Cielstrasza\"&gt;Cielstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, resides at the top of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nSeveral quests provide reputation with the Wyrmrest Accord."}

It towers above the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wastes\"&gt;Dragon Wastes&lt;/a&gt;, tier after tier of white columns and golden domes in the style of the titans. It's an ancient structure, built before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; so the newly created &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s would have a place to meet and watch over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt; takes the lower portion of the temple while the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Summit\"&gt;Wyrmrest Summit&lt;/a&gt; takes the uppermost section. Here, Alexstrasza created the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; to battle the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Aspects sacrificed their power to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, in order to destroy &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, it has been mostly emptied of dragons.\nHistory.\nAncient Kalimdor.\nThousands of years ago, the &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;titanic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s bestowed upon the five &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s that defeated &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; the power of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, thus the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; were born. To help the Aspects, the keepers created a new species that would serve as their allies and consorts, the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. With this, the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s were created. The Dragon Aspects and their flights would all be bound by their duty to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To strengthen this bond, the keepers forged a grand tower in northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; named Wyrmrest Temple. It would serve as the heart of the dragons' culture, a sanctuary where they could gather and discuss their activities. But above all, Wyremst Temple would stand as a symbol of their unity.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nMany legends hold that the five great &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; were blessed within this fortress and given their charge to watch over the budding world. In reality, they were blessed at the site where &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; died. Perhaps it is for this reason that dragons nearing the end of their lives come to the Dragonblight to enrich the land with their passing. Surrounding Wyrmrest Temple are five majestic dragon shrines: red, bronze, green, blue, and black, each blessed with the powers of its respective flight. In recent times the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; has laid siege to these shrines in an effort to further its attempts at raising terrifying new variations of undead dragons to serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to arrest these invasions, the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, has begun recruiting heroes to aid in the fight against the Scourge.\nAt some point after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; used their &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; as a breeding ground for &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, a terrible experiment undertaken by &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; to create a new dragonflight to rule over Azeroth. These energy vampire abominations had to be slain by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. The black dragonflight then attacked the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed it in retaliation. Consequently, the adventurers were sent to destroy &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt; and his lieutenants &lt;a href=\"Saviana%20Ragefire\"&gt;Saviana Ragefire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baltharus%20the%20Warborn\"&gt;Baltharus the Warborn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Zarithrian\"&gt;General Zarithrian&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring their assault of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s destroyed &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Frostwing%20Halls\"&gt;Frostwing Halls&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than leave her to suffer again in some form, they took her &lt;a href=\"Crystalline%20Essence%20of%20Sindragosa\"&gt;crystalline essence&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; at Wyrmrest Temple, where she could truly be laid to rest. Upon receiving the essence, Kalec stated \"So much suffering, so much needless destruction. These have not been kind times for my brothers and sisters. But thanks to your efforts, brave adventurers, this darkened yet still noble soul may find peace at last. Rest now, Sindragosa. You are home...\"\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nAlexstrasza summoned for a meeting, where for the first time blue dragons were invited. The place of meeting was at Wyrmrest Temple. Korialstrasz remained in Ruby Sanctum while Alexstrasza met her sister and representatives of the blues, Kalecgos and Arygos atop the Temple. The meeting was interrupted by an attack of twilight dragons in service of the Twilight's Hammer. Moreover, an explosion arose from the basement. It was revealed that Korialstrasz had betrayed the Dragonflights. After this, Alexstrasza shattered it in a fit of rage.\nThe Aspects then abandoned the Temple, only to be retaken by the Twilight Father and his followers. It was also there where Arygos's sister Kirygosa was held captive and Chromatus's body was brought. The monstrous being was then resurrected by magic from the Nexus. Thrall managed to unite the Aspects and the Dragonflights and Kirygosa escaped from the Temple and told everything she knew. The Aspects attacked the Wyrmrest Temple, however, Chromatus was powerful and Nozdormu urged to retreat. Timeless one said some wise words, and together they attacked and were able to defeat Chromatus and took back the Temple. While there, they searched the Temple for the Twilight Father's body, but according to Kirygosa who would always know his face, he was not here. The Aspects thanked Thrall and enabled him to leave for Maelstrom.\nHour of Twilight.\nWyrmrest Temple is the location of the first part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; raid, the final battle against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nDawn of the Aspects.\nAdhering to their tradition to meet when the two moons of Azeroth were at a particular cycle the former aspects meet at Wyrmrest Temple. At the end of the brief meeting Alexstrasza, along with Ysera and Nozdormu, decided that they would officially end the Accord one month from now, to the shock of Kalecgos. The former aspects would later return to the temple at the request of Kalecgos, who used an artifact from Watcher Tyr to remind them about their past battle against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt; and that they didn't need to be aspects to help safeguard the world. Agreeing with him, the other three decided to continue their affairs in protecting Azeroth. They also swore Kalecgos to secrecy about the nature of Galakrond, as they did not want anyone to follow in his dark path.\nLegion.\nThe Wyrmrest Temple is once again a meeting place for dragons and the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; visited them during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; in order to learn something about &lt;a href=\"Kyranastrasz\"&gt;Kyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt;.\nWyrmrest is also visited when speaking with &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; who sends the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into the future Wyrmrest.\nExploring Azeroth.\nDuring their travels, the brothers Bronzebeard, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; visited the temple. They stated that the dragons might meet again there on their own schedule, but at the time, the only permanent inhabitants were the &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; guards, who were not very talkative.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nMany dragons of all flights from all across the world felt a strange sensation in their hearts. They all assembled at Wyrmrest Temple, where Alexstrasza informed them that the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were reawakening, and the sensation they felt was the dragonflights' ancestral lands calling them home.\nIn the RPG.\nWyrmrest Temple is set in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;'s southwest and this structure dominates the landscape for two reasons. First, it is massive and impressive. Second, its inhabitants, past, and present. The &lt;a href=\"Titans\"&gt;Titans&lt;/a&gt; built the temple, though no one alive knows why. It looked out upon the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to the north and the ocean to the south. The Titans have long since vanished and now the temple occupants are dragons: &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragons\"&gt;blue dragons&lt;/a&gt; more specific. It seems they monitor the Dragonblight, see to the needs of those dragons arriving here to die, and commune with the spirits of those dragons already departed. They allow non-dragon visitors up to the temple but not within, so its internal architecture is a mystery. If it is half as impressive as the exterior, this is the most beautiful building in all of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt; is similar to Wyrmrest Temple, especially when considering that both were made by the Titans."}

{"id": "14548", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14548", "title": "Wyvern", "text": "A wyvern, also known as a wind rider and war rider, is a sentient lionish creature with bat wings and a scorpion tail native to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They can speak and understand &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taur-ahe\"&gt;Taur-ahe&lt;/a&gt;, but cannot understand &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Both males and females have manes.\nBackground.\nWyverns share a common ancestry with both &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s and hail from some of the most inhospitable regions of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, making them masters of adapting to any environment. They can be found living in the harsh cliff-terraces of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, as well as parts of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. They hold great enmity for &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, as the vile creatures like to capture them.\nThe average wyvern is usually about the size of a horse, but some have been known to grow up to three times that size. Wyverns of this larger breed tend to have cubs the size of full-grown bears.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; first arrived on Kalimdor, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; suggested enlisting the aid of the wyverns who dwelt nearby. Upon reaching their nesting grounds, the two leaders discovered that a band of harpies had captured and enslaved the wyverns. Encountering fierce local resistance, a force led by Thrall and Cairne fought their way to the harpies' lair and slaughtered the vile bird-women, freeing the wyverns. The sentient wyverns of Kalimdor were eager to ally themselves with the shamanistic &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Impressed by the orcs' commitment to honor and victory, the wyverns allowed the orcs to ride them into combat against those who would disturb the tranquility of Kalimdor and its denizens. The wyverns use their powerful claws and razor-like fangs against both airborne attackers and ground troops, while their riders may hurl envenomed spears at the enemy. Wyverns are today considered sacred by both orcs and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nWyverns revel in flight, dutifully carrying &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; riders along various routes surrounding &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; for a small fee. However, not all wyverns are friendly to the Horde; some are even enraged. Unfortunately, the Horde cannot train enough wyverns to keep up with the demand.\nDespite appearing mammalian, wyverns do lay eggs. They are very protective of them, forcing the Horde to take the eggs to raise the newborn wyvern.\nThe venom of a wyvern, in some circles, is more valuable than the beast itself. The venom resides in two soft and sensitive venom sacs, resting just below the stinger. The &lt;a href=\"Highperch\"&gt;Highperch&lt;/a&gt; wyverns have a potent, and valuable, venom. The sacs bursting with venom are normally only gathered from young wyverns or fertile females. An &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; source on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; at one point claimed that orc assassins collect venom from the &lt;a href=\"Pridewing%20Wyvern\"&gt;pridewings&lt;/a&gt; of the Stonetalon Mountains in order to use the substance on secret death raids against the Alliance.\n&lt;a href=\"Thorg%20No-Legs\"&gt;Thorg No-Legs&lt;/a&gt; never paid heed to the old &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; saying, \"Don't pull a wyvern's tail.\"\nThe &lt;a href=\"Armored%20Blue%20Wind%20Rider\"&gt;Armored Blue Wind Rider&lt;/a&gt;s are not native to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, but they have adapted extremely well to the cold. The &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Armored%20Wyvern\"&gt;Grand Armored Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;, renowned among wyvern handlers, was one of the first mounts chosen to take part in the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Dominance%20Offensive\"&gt;Dominance Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a flying mount.\nIn \"\", &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%20mounts%23Artisan%20Mounts\"&gt;Armored Wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s are the epic flying mount of the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. However, in some cases they were apparently trained to accept any rider, as seen by the bombing roosts around &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Wind%20Rider%20Cub\"&gt;Wind Rider Cub&lt;/a&gt; was available on the original &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Store\"&gt;Blizzard Store&lt;/a&gt; for $24.99 US or \u20ac24.99, along with a wind rider cub plushie.\nAs a hunter pet.\nWyverns are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"Feathermane\"&gt;Feathermane&lt;/a&gt; family, added in &lt;a href=\"patch%207.2.0\"&gt;patch 7.2.0&lt;/a&gt;. In order to tame Feathermanes, hunters must purchase the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20the%20Hybrid%20Beast\"&gt;Tome of the Hybrid Beast&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Pan%20the%20Kind%20Hand\"&gt;Pan the Kind Hand&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; at a cost of .\nIn the RPG.\nLike &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s, wyverns are intelligent creatures \u2014 as smart as any humanoid. Their fierce predator instincts, as well as their harsh environments, lend little trust for humanoids, however. Despite this, wyverns are new allies to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The green-skinned &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s proved themselves to wyverns in battle against harpies attempting to kill a Stonetalon Mountains flight. Since then, the two species have a growing respect for one another. Wyverns share respect for the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; just as they do the orcs, though the former are simply too large to join forces with a flying wyvern. A wyvern may choose an orc with a willingness to take to the air, and the two establish a formidable aerial scouting and combat team. Such orcs are known as &lt;a href=\"wind%20rider\"&gt;wind rider&lt;/a&gt;s. Wyverns are encountered alone as often as they are found in an orc rider\u2019s presence. Orcs raise wyverns to serve as steeds both in and out of combat. Professional wyvern trainers wear thick, elbow-length leather gloves to protect themselves from baby wyverns' deadly stings. When wyvern carry others, such as orcs, they are capable of carrying up to 600 pounds, and that would be considered a heavy load for them. A medium load is between 201-400 pounds and a light load is considered anything under 200 pounds. \nIn the &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three\"&gt;Appendix Three&lt;/a&gt; of \"&lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters\"&gt;Manual of Monsters&lt;/a&gt;\" there are different types of wyverns described: &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Wyvern\"&gt;wyvern (dragonkin)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Manual%20of%20Monsters/Appendix%20Three%23Sand%20Wyvern\"&gt;sand wyvern&lt;/a&gt;. However the validity of the source is disputed.\nMyth.\nDespite possessing mammalian qualities in \"Warcraft\", s were a type of reptilian dragon found in medieval heraldry. Wyverns were differentiated from other dragons by their four (rather than six) limbs and their barbed tails. Wyverns could breathe flame (typically from the nostrils rather than through the mouth), possess a venomous bite, or possess neither or both qualities (depending on culture specifications). The wyvern had an even worse reputation than the dragon \u2014 while dragons could be benign or wise, wyverns didn't seem to be sapient.\nThe wyverns of the Warcraft universe share more features with s than wyverns. The manticore was a mythological beast, originally of Persian origin, that had the body of a lion and occasionally wings, possessed a reptilian or scorpion's tail, and had a human face with a shark-like maw containing three sets of sharp teeth. These more leonine wyverns were intended to fit the wiser image of the ' Horde and to contrast with the evil-looking dragons the ' Horde stole from &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;."}

He has a Lich Slap that hits for roughly 800-900 &lt;a href=\"shadow\"&gt;shadow&lt;/a&gt; damage on his target. He also has a &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt; Volley with 25-30 yard range (can easily be ranged by healers). In addition, he channels a &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; for 150 shadow damage per tick while attacking. He also has a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; that hits for about 130-150 damage and immobilizes.\nIt's best to pull him down the stairs and into the last hallway before the graveyard. Have your warrior tank him with his back to the wall at the end closest to the stairs, with your healers standing at the other end in range of heals but out of Frostbolt Volley range. Be sure to keep the tank topped off because the Lich Slap is quite powerful."}

They measure an average of 3 ft. long.\nThey attack anything they perceive as a threat with their claws and stinger, which holds venom capable of killing creatures up to 100 times its own body weight. When stung, the venom causes rapid suffocation followed by violent seizures, and shortly after, death. Although tail venom of most scorpids is the most deadly, it is the bite of the diminutive &lt;a href=\"scorpling\"&gt;scorpling&lt;/a&gt; that is the greatest threat. &lt;a href=\"Stonelash%20Pincer\"&gt;Some species&lt;/a&gt; also have venomous pincers. Hunting and killing scorpid is considered a rite of passage by the orcs. \nScorpids speak in complex clicking and chittering sounds, which sentient beings can actually learn and communicate with, such as &lt;a href=\"Zathra\"&gt;Zathra&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Cataclysm\" introduced a second model for scorpids, which is used by some of the new scorpid and &lt;a href=\"scorpion\"&gt;scorpion&lt;/a&gt; mobs.\nKnown scorpids.\nExtinct scorpids.\nSince the cataclysm, the following species of scorpid have disappeared from the game, presumably having gone extinct.\nSilithid scorpids.\nIn addition, several scorpids, or scorpid-like creatures are found amongst the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;.

Until recently, it was a major player for control of the world. Created initially as the precursor to an invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge broke free from their demonic masters and \u2014 under the iron rule of the dread &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 have built up their power base on the arctic continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Their influence spreads throughout Northrend, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and southern &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to a small degree. Consisting of thousands of walking corpses, disembodied spirits, beasts of the north, and damned mortal men, the Scourge is a terrifying and insidious enemy which, before its downfall, was perhaps the most dangerous threat to the world of Azeroth.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge became relatively quiet, controlled by the new Lich King &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. However, after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the helm was shattered by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. Since that moment, the Scourge became leaderless, and is now an aimless mass of undead rather than a force organized, which aimed at the hearts of all living things.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had experimented with the undead for at least ten thousand years, with the first hint of the Scourge's creation being an experiment by the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; to raise undead &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scourge was (and still is) a vast army of the undead serving the Lich King \u2014 the being formerly known as the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. Under the control of the Burning Legion, the Scourge's mission was to spread terror and destruction across the world in anticipation of the Legion's inevitable invasion. A mission that was almost undone before it even began when the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s attacked and began the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, however, the conflict ultimately ended with the Lich King's first major triumph (while the nerubians were immune to the plague, their corpses could still be reanimated). The Lich King was impressed by his enemy, however, and adopted nerubian architecture for his own, as a testament to the spider lords' tenacity and age.\nThe Lich King, now uncontested in the ice realm of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; where he ruled from the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, unleashed the terrible &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; southward into &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; lands. As the plague encroached on the southlands, countless humans fell prey to Ner'zhul's mental control and life-draining sickness every day. With the help of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; the plague was spread. Many of Lordaeron's northern villages were contaminated almost immediately. Just as in Northrend, the citizens who contracted the plague died and arose as the Lich King's willing slaves. The cultists under Kel'Thuzad were eager to die and be raised again in their dark lord's service. They exulted in the prospect of immortality through undeath. As the plague spread, more and more feral zombies arose in the northlands. Kel'Thuzad looked upon the Lich King's growing army and named it the Scourge, for soon it would march upon the gates of Lordaeron and scour humanity from the face of the world.\nReign of Chaos.\nThough Ner'zhul and his undead Scourge were bound to the will of the Burning Legion, the Lich King constantly strove to free himself and gain vengeance upon the demons for dismembering his body and damning him so completely. To this end, he sought a champion to carry out his will and decided that &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; would be the perfect choice. During the &lt;a href=\"Scourging%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Scourging of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas became increasingly enraged at the devastation the undead caused and sought to end their threat by any means necessary, including &lt;a href=\"Culling%20of%20Stratholme\"&gt;culling a city&lt;/a&gt;. This would lead the young prince to Northrend, the roof of the world. There, the Scourge engaged in combat with the &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;1st Legion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Expedition\"&gt;Dwarven Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, which would eventually team up and proceed to &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;' citadel. Fearing of being overwhelmed, Arthas would obtain the &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; and kill the nathrezim, who he had thought was in command of the Scourge. It was there that the whispers of the Lich King guided Arthas into becoming Ner'zhul's champion and the greatest of his &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Arthas returned to his soldiers and killed them, raising them as Scourge.\nIn the days since Prince Arthas took the fleet to Northrend, the Silver Hand was fighting the spread of the plague. However, the undead soon mysteriously pulled back from the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt; and vanished from sight. The citizenry didn't know the cause, but suspected that their prince succeeded in his quest to destroy the Scourge in Northrend. The truth was that the Lich King ordered the Scourge to retreat in order to prepare for Arthas' homecoming. Arthas, now the champion of the Scourge, returned home, and brought a mighty Scourge army with him, consisting of death knights, &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"crypt%20fiend\"&gt;crypt fiend&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s. The prince ordered the army to remain hidden for the time being, and only a handful of death knights accompanied him to &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; where he killed &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;his own father&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the capital, along with hundreds of citizens. At the same time, the Scourge emerged from hiding across Lordaeron and attacked the living. When the Scourge attacked Tirisfal, the &lt;a href=\"Agamand\"&gt;Agamand&lt;/a&gt; family fortified their &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Mills\"&gt;mills&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Devlin%20Agamand\"&gt;Devlin&lt;/a&gt; betrayed his people and made a deal with the Scourge. The &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; held his ground on &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt; in defense of Lordaeron. The farm and all on it were waylaid by a gigantic wave of Scourge, with Nathanos perishing to &lt;a href=\"Ramstein\"&gt;Ramstein&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently being rased as a Scourge himself.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; returned from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with the mighty &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in hands, the Highlord was reported to be paring down the Scourge's numbers. Neighboring human and dwarven nations converged on Lordaeron to vanquish the Scourge. However, the Scourge was numerous and defeated any Alliance resistance. Ultimately, the Scourge took Lordaeron, ravaging many towns and farms across Eastweald, including &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;. The undead also continued to spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting the land. The Scourge attempted to invade &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, however, King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; turned to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; who summoned feral &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to repel the undead attacking &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; sent Arthas on a mission, rallying the Cult of the Damned to his banner and invading &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; where Arthas ended the life of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;. The death knight and his army continued to &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invade&lt;/a&gt; the ancient &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, defiling the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; and using it to resurrect the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;. With Kel'Thuzad once more among them, the Scourge moved forward to &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;destroy&lt;/a&gt; the magi-city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and claim the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the result of which was the summoning of the &lt;a href=\"demon%20lord\"&gt;demon lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; into the world, as well as Dalaran's destruction. It was at this point that Archimonde ordered that the Scourge be commanded by the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlords&lt;/a&gt;; however, Ner'zhul was planning a different move.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Ner'zhul engineered the downfall of the Legion by having his lieutenant, Arthas Menethil, alert the demon hunter &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to the presence of the Legion in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. Illidan's attack on the demons there brought about the death of &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, which greatly weakened the Legion and made it possible for the Alliance, Horde, and night elf forces to stop Archimonde during the Battle of Mount Hyjal. It was at this point that Ner'zhul was finally capable of making his bid for freedom, effectively cutting all ties to the remaining demons as well as the remaining demon lord, Kil'jaeden. Such a move inspired Kil'jaeden to incredible heights of anger, and it was now the demon's turn to lust after vengeance. But, thanks to the Legion's defeat, Kil'jaeden was stripped of his capacity to simply bring about swift destruction, and was forced to use more subtle methods to dispose of his rebellious creation.\nIn Felwood, the Scourge decimated the area with attacks of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s and other demonic magics, with the slimes supposedly creeping up through the earth during the attacks.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nShortly after the Battle of Mount Hyjal, Kil'jaeden contacted &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; with an offer too tempting for the demon hunter to refuse: Slay the Lich King and be granted the awesome power of a demon lord. Gathering his once-&lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; allies, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and began weaving a massive spell targeting the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; using the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. However, the spell was interrupted at the eleventh hour by Illidan's brother &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. Though the spell was not completed, enough potent &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy had been siphoned to cause a fracture in the Lich King's icy prison. This caused Ner'zhul's powers to weaken, especially his control of his undead. It was during this time that a large band of undead, led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, regained their free will and left the Scourge. After &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;warring&lt;/a&gt; over the control of the Plaguelands and defeating the remaining nathrezim, she named her followers as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Desperate, Ner'zhul contacted Arthas, the greatest of his &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, by telepathy and commanded him to return to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; at once.\nHowever, this matter was complicated by Kil'jaeden once again. Growing impatient with Illidan's failures, the demon lord instructed him, with his allies the Naga and newly named &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, to travel to Northrend and put an end to the Lich King personally. Arthas's undead forces battled Illidan's army at the base of the glacier, the aftermath of which left Illidan wounded and his troops broken. Arthas, victorious, proceeded into the Lich King's throne chamber where he used the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; to shatter the Frozen Throne and free the essence of Ner'zhul. The spirit of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; then bonded with Arthas and they became one of the most powerful beings the world had ever known.\nInterim.\nThe survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; in northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; continued to strike at Scourge, including &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, the Silver Hand splintered after the death of &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; who had been lured to Stratholme's gates where he fought against waves of the undead, but ultimately was betrayed by his son, &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt;. This heralded the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, which later led to further battles, including an attack on &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; died, attack on &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; to free his father Alexandros, and an attack on &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; where Darion sacrificed himself. The Scourge would manage to recover several bodies of the fallen Argent Dawn members, including Darion and his weapon, the Ashbringer. Naxxramas served as the war factory for the Scourge.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Raymond%20George\"&gt;Lord Raymond George&lt;/a&gt; and his Argent Dawn fought against the Scourge. Their necromancers raised the Dawn's fallen soldiers and created twisted golems to slay more soldiers.\nTwo years after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge were edging closer to &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; according to &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;'s farm and the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;-controlled &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; were attacked by the Scourge led by the traitor &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; who was looking for the essence of the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. They were eventually defeated by Kalec, &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt;, Anveena, &lt;a href=\"Jorad%20Mace\"&gt;Jorad Mace&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Harkyn%20Grymstone\"&gt;Harkyn Grymstone&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in the past, the Scourge had invaded &lt;a href=\"Barony%20Mordis\"&gt;Barony Mordis&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, killing Baron &lt;a href=\"Valimar%20Mordis\"&gt;Valimar Mordis&lt;/a&gt;, and continued to operate there until Kalec, Anveena, and his group arrived there. They were led by the &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ichor\"&gt;Ichor&lt;/a&gt; who had the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Orb of Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; that they used to raise undead beasts. The baron had the orb stolen, and he wanted to use it to create his own army from remains dug out by a group of dwarves. When their frost wyrm attacked, Ichor captured Jorad and Tyrigosa. Soon, however, the prisoners and Kalec's group fought against the undead, while &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; struggled with his former comrade, destroying the orb and causing the deaths of Ichor and Mordis. Dar'Khan managed to capture Anveena and brought her to Quel'Thalas. The &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; continued to fight against the undead and noted that the Scourge numbers were increasing in the area. As they learned, Dar'Khan's return was the cause. In the meantime, the orb of Ner'zhul had reanimated Trag, who sought revenge against the Lich King. When the two clashed, the Lich King revealed that he wanted to make Trag his champion and a Scourge commander.\nAt some point, the Scourge led by &lt;a href=\"Kirkessen%20the%20Zealous\"&gt;Kirkessen the Zealous&lt;/a&gt; tried to invade Light's Hope Chapel once again in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20the%20Sanguine\"&gt;Siege of the Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;, but failed. &lt;a href=\"Diodor%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Diodor the Damned&lt;/a&gt; led a &lt;a href=\"Summertide%20Assaults\"&gt;series of attacks&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, two of which were successful while the final third one marked the Scourge's defeat.\nAround year 24 on &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlet Crusade attacked the Scourge. The battle was joined by the mad &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; who killed not only the Scourge force, but also his fellow crusaders.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Thorval\"&gt;Lord Thorval&lt;/a&gt; scouted an area for Scourge presence. While he was away from his village, the Scarlet Crusade burned the villagers, Thorval's family among them. He and his scouting party discovered this but were ordered to continue to the nearest remaining waypost. Not long after nightfall, they heard the ominous cackling of the undead echoing from the trees, and a wave of Scourge overtook them. Thorval was killing them, but for each of the fallen, two more crawled forth from the hills. They were caught in the same tide of Scourge they had been hunting, only now they were broken and unprepared. Thorval's allies were succumbing to wounds and exhaustion. Thinking of his deceased family filled Thorval with hatred. Suddenly, he came to a realization that death was the only real end to any mortal tale, wielding power to protect led inalterably to failure, and that success met only those who used it for a different end. As such, Thorval swore allegiance to the Lich King. The lord of the Scourge purged him of his hateful human sensations that had tormented him, and he was reborn as a death knight.\nTwo years after his previous defeat, Dar'Khan re-emerged in Quel'Thalas with a band of undead and lured &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; into a trap, seeking her new &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; killed and reanimated into powerful Scourge warriors. The ploy failed, and Dar'Khan and his minions were defeated once more.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe Scourge was primarily concentrated in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; with a large concentration in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. Their primary fortification and \"capital\" in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;. The Scourge controlled the majority of the city, but the humans of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; held a small section. The Scourge has also been seen in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; holding &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scourge is also reported to have a presence as far away as the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;; The lich &lt;a href=\"Amnennar%20the%20Coldbringer\"&gt;Amnennar the Coldbringer&lt;/a&gt; and his forces participated in the Scourge's assault on Mount Hyjal during the Third War. Afterward, the Lich King instructed his servant to remain in Kalimdor and expand the Scourge's influence, and so Amnennar began plans to create a base from which to strike at &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, Amnennar has set his sights on recruiting the recently displaced and desperate &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;, promising them power over death so they can repel invaders in their lands.\nThe necromancer-lich Kel'Thuzad, the majordomo of the Lich King, once controlled the Scourge in Lordaeron from his citadel of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, floating over Stratholme and &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;Plaguewood&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich King and Kel'Thuzad later sent &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es to &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;invade&lt;/a&gt; various areas across Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor, including Azshara, the Blasted Lands, the Burning Steppes, the Tanaris Desert, the Eastern Plaguelands, Winterspring, and capital cities. The Scourge were establishing small staging points in the places under attack, receiving communications and other assistance from the necropolises that flew overhead.\nAfter defending the lands, heroes of the Alliance and Horde stormed Naxxrammas, forcing Kel'Thuzad to retreat along with his floating fortress to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nThe Scourge appeared many times in the blood elven lands of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, mostly on the tainted land known as the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt;. The high elf traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, slain during the Third War, ruled the Scourge in Quel'Thalas from the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; until he was eventually slain by blood elf and Forsaken forces. A few members of the Scourge were seen fighting the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor years, Andorhal remained in the hands of the Scourge. At some point, &lt;a href=\"Maddox\"&gt;Maddox&lt;/a&gt; and his group tried to &lt;a href=\"Retaking%20of%20Andorhal\"&gt;retake&lt;/a&gt; it with the help of the Argent Dawn, but the effort failed, and the Scourge overwhelmed the soldiers.\nJust prior to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, a large Scourge army was amassing somewhere in Lordaeron, and &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; suspected that they were headed for Dalaran, so the red dragon decimated them.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAfter the merging of Arthas and Ner'zhul, the Lich King entered a period of dormancy as he slept and dreamed atop the Frozen Throne. In the meantime, his minions rebuilt Icecrown Citadel as he made his plans for the conquest of all of Azeroth. Finally, after several years, the Lich King awoke and unleashed his Scourge on the unsuspecting world, attacking &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion%20%28Stormwind%29\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20%28Theramore%29\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. The Lich King personally also led his minions into the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe forces of both the Alliance and Horde then arrived in Northrend to confront the Scourge on its home soil, until at last they were prepared for a final assault on Icecrown. After facing a gauntlet of the Scourge's most powerful leaders, the greatest champions were able to reach the Frozen Throne to confront the Lich King himself. In the epic battle that ensued, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; used the sword &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; to shatter Frostmourne, releasing the spirits within that then aided the champions as they sent Arthas to his demise. This did not mean the end of the Scourge, however, as the spirits of both &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; had warned that without anyone to control it, the Scourge would be free to destroy the world. As Fordring contemplated placing the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt; upon his head (thinking there was no one else who could accept such a burden) the disfigured &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; appeared and stated that it was his fate to be the Jailer of the Damned. In addition, he said that the world must be told that both he and the Lich King were dead and never know the truth about what had really happened if it was to live free from the tyranny of fear. Fordring then reluctantly crowned Fordragon as the new Lich King, and moments later ice imprisoned the Lich King once more.\nCataclysm.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge is little more than a shell of its former power in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The Lich King is dead, the Scourge command structure all but wiped out, and the remaining legions of undead held in check by Bolvar's sacrifice.\nBecoming the new Lich King has been a difficult transition for Bolvar and he needs a bit of time to reign in the Scourge. Though the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; are asleep, the Scourge and &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; operating in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; are autonomous. There are still sizable Scourge forces in the Plaguelands of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; who continue to serve their now-dead master. The island fortress of &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, home of the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, is the major Scourge holdout west of the &lt;a href=\"Thondroril%20River\"&gt;Thondroril River&lt;/a&gt;, and their forces can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome former servants of the Scourge have found their way into the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, the winged harbingers of the Lich King, were brought into Sylvanas' fold after the Lich King's demise; the Banshee Queen used their necromantic powers to solve the problem of her people's limited numbers by raising their slain mortal enemies as Forsaken.\nAfter the Shattering, both the Alliance and the Forsaken started making major efforts to expel the Scourge from Andorhal. The ruined city became a warzone between the Alliance under the command of &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;, and the Forsaken under the command of &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Araj%20the%20Summoner\"&gt;Araj the Summoner&lt;/a&gt; led what remains of the Lich King's forces in Andorhal, their power diminished by the death of their lord. This major conflict in this war effort came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. The combined forces relentlessly slaughtered these Scourge and ultimately destroyed Araj.\n&lt;a href=\"Ix%27lar%20the%20Underlord\"&gt;Ix'lar the Underlord&lt;/a&gt; was an independent &lt;a href=\"crypt%20lord\"&gt;crypt lord&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; that believed the Scourge would rise again under his rule.\nLegion.\nFollowing the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King Bolvar has entered into a pact with the Knights of the Ebon Blade, where the death knights of Acherus will once again act in the Lich King's name if the Scourge remains confined to Northrend. As part of this agreement, the Lich King has &lt;a href=\"A%20Pact%20of%20Necessity\"&gt;offered assistance&lt;/a&gt; to the Ebon Blade to obtain powerful &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt;s to use against the Legion. Acherus briefly relocates to Icecrown Citadel, where a champion of the Ebon Blade obtains the shards of Frostmourne to forge into &lt;a href=\"Blades%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Prince\"&gt;potent new weapons&lt;/a&gt;, while directing other champions to obtain &lt;a href=\"Apocalypse\"&gt;similar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;weapons&lt;/a&gt;. Once the artifacts are found, the Lich King grants his blessing to the champions, whose orders are to be obeyed as if they were his own.\nIt is revealed by &lt;a href=\"Amal%27thazad\"&gt;Amal'thazad&lt;/a&gt; that the Burning Legion continues to try to recreate the masterpiece that was the Scourge, their &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; apparently only being able to make \"puppets of bone\".\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Scourge activity increased dramatically in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;'s report after the war, the Hillsbrad Foothills was rife with several enemies, including the Scourge.\nWe Ride Forth.\nBelieving that &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; would come for the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King Bolvar employed a daring gambit. He deceived the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; into thinking that he had fallen under the dark powers of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; by bringing and hiding the forces of the Scourge around Icecrown Citadel, so that when Sylvanas inevitably confronted him, the horsemen would arrive soon after and finish off the winner, before choosing who would be the new Lich King.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s hands, as foreshadowed by King Terenas years earlier, the now-masterless Scourge marauded all across Azeroth, emboldened by the message of &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; brought by the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;. Off the heels of yet another brutal war, the forces of Azeroth mounted a counterattack and assaulted the source at Icecrown Citadel. During this conflict, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; were forced to regain control of , while the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to lead the offensive against the Scourge.\nDuring the course of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge also invaded &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the Jailer was slain by the war's end, the Scourge remained a threat as the mightiest of the Scourge vied for supremacy, like vicious warlords in the wake of their king's death. One such warlord was the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vorath\"&gt;Vorath&lt;/a&gt;, who commanded his Scourge forces from within &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Sin%27dorei\"&gt;Sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; before he was slain. Vorath's attack on Quel'Thalas had unsettled Lor'themar who suspected that things were even worse in Northrend.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; visited the &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; after years and notably reported the activities of the Scourge.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt; is still held by the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Fleshwerks\"&gt;Fleshwerks&lt;/a&gt; remained under Scourge control; the undead still making more monsters of their own, though without driving purpose and at a much slower rate.\nOrganization.\nPrior to Arthas' defeat, he was at the top of the organization as the Lich King, who sent orders from his &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;ice fortress&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend. His direct underlings were liches, undead mages, and necromancers with incredible power to spread plague and command undead armies. It is unknown how many liches there were, but Arthas's right-hand lich was Kel'Thuzad, who reigned in Lordaeron and had his hands full fighting the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, the undead who broke free from the control of the Lich King. Kel'Thuzad contained the fight against the Horde and Alliance in Northrend when Naxxramas moved to the Dragonblight prior to his final defeat (or his \"presumed\" defeat, as his &lt;a href=\"phylactery\"&gt;phylactery&lt;/a&gt; was nowhere to be seen after his death). The banshees under his command often led scouting troops to discover new areas to infiltrate, while other important Scourge members included necromancers, responsible for raising and commanding the dead, and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, a bizarre group of mortals so fascinated by the undead that they follow them, worship them, even emulate them, hoping to one day be damned as the undead are. They don\u2019t see the foulness and evil, but rather power and eternal life.\nA &lt;a href=\"Scourgestone\"&gt;Scourgestone&lt;/a&gt; is an item given to all Scourge upon \"birth\" or creation. It provides certain benefits to the holder, but more importantly it provides Scourge leaders insight into the location and movement of their units. By \"birth\", &lt;a href=\"The%20Ebon%20Watcher\"&gt;The Ebon Watcher&lt;/a&gt; is referring to necromancers and other dark magic wielders who are born into the ranks of the Scourge alive and gradually become undead, never actually dying themselves. It's important to clarify however that beings that transition in this way are also physically dead, their bodies bearing the mark of decay.\nMost of the undead reported to a region's leadership of necromancers or liches, who in turn reported to Kel'Thuzad. He reported pertinent information to Arthas. The rogue undead, the Forsaken, were wild cards: the Lich King lost much of his power over the undead before merging with &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. This allowed one of the more powerful banshees, Sylvanas Windrunner, to escape his hold. She freed many more undead creatures, and currently leads the Forsaken from her &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;tunnel complex underneath the former capital city of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. While they are not part of the Scourge and do not fall into the Scourge organization, they work along roughly the same lines \u2014 kill or otherwise eliminate those that oppose them and dominate the undead. He had many plans for Azeroth, so he couldn't focus entirely on Sylvanas and devote much of his time to 'reclaiming' the Forsaken. A thing to note about the Scourge was that the further from a lich or a necromancer the weaker undead got, the more disoriented they were. They lost the command of the Lich King, but they didn't necessarily become free. Once the will of the necromancer or other controlling force left them, they had no memory of their former selves, and they shuffled around as mindless husks, searching for someone to lead them. \nArthas led the Scourge in Northrend from the Frozen Throne, completely dominating Icecrown. The Scourge's secondary base was the continent of Lordaeron, in the city of Stratholme, Arthas's first conquest. Now it lies in burning ruin. There are few remaining mortals there, except for those of the Cult of the Damned and the Scarlet Crusade. Lordaeron's northern and eastern areas are practically abysmal with the Scourge. Their foul stench permeates the air. Yet the Scourge has reached all areas of the world, dripping down through Khaz Modan and into Azeroth, and even west to &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt; Kalimdor. Arthas wanted his finger on everything happening in the world, and he had the forces to do it.\nWith Arthas' defeat and Fordragon's ascendancy as the new Lich King, the Cult of the Damned chose to become independent of the Bolvar-controlled Scourge, while during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Knights of the Ebon Blade come to an agreement with the new Lich King by acting voluntarily as his agents if the Scourge remains contained in Northrend. It is still unknown what the new Scourge command structure was during Bolvar's reign.\nFollowing the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge marauded masterless all across Azeroth, emboldened by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;. Though Zovaal the Jailer would be ultimately slain, the mightiest Scourge would seize control and vie for supremacy, like vicious warlords in the wake of their king's death.\nFormer command structure.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Fall of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith most of Arthas' commanders dead, and &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; having donned the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; only to contain the Scourge, it is unclear what command structure, if any, Bolvar employed during his reign. Most of his dealings with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; were via an agreement to be allies, rather than a ruler and his subjects; Bolvar offered to aid the Ebon Blade during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and in exchange they agreed to act as his agents as long as the Scourge remained confined to Northrend.\nScourge outposts run by the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; continued to pose a threat, as members of the cult generally chose to serve the Scourge during the previous kings' reigns, rather than being forced into it.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; defeated the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; Bolvar Fordragon and destroyed the Helm of Domination, the lesser undead of the Scourge went feral and began to rampage throughout Azeroth. Additionally, the Cult of the Damned made a resurgence under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt; and began once more to spread the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"Warcraft III\".\nUndead Scourge was the undead faction led by &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. Their team color was green. It appeared as an enemy faction in and &lt;a href=\"Ravages%20of%20the%20Plague\"&gt;Ravages of the Plague&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;The Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. Their units consisted of regular undead units with the addition of sketelons.\nIn the RPG.\nThere was suspicion that an agent of the Scourge may have influenced &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; in his necromantic endeavors. The followers of Zalazane even eventually managed to create greater undead such as &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Linnena%20Hallow\"&gt;Linnena Hallow&lt;/a&gt; to be by his side as he sowed the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and she was instrumental in raising the undead to strengthen the Scourge's army.\nMonstrous Scourge.\nSome creatures of the Scourge are not technically undead, but instead are monstrous constructions created by the science and magical experimentation of the &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;s following &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. These are constructed creatures fashioned by the perverse experimentation of the Lich King's followers and do not occur in any natural fashion.\nMonstrous members of the Scourge are not particularly intelligent, having been created from the leftover pieces of enemies and friends alike. They are, however, very loyal and almost fanatically devoted to whatever task is appointed to them. These creatures are not truly individuals, having little will of their own other than that given to them on creation or through the current descriptions given in their orders.\nMembership.\nThe members of the Scourge are easy to spot, smell, and identify. And it doesn't take much to join. All it takes is to either love the Scourge or be undead and under the Lich King's spell, and you're in. One does not need to do much to be in this organization. Some of the first members were mortals who had fallen in the undead plague. People sickened from the plague and died, only to rise as zombies. This city-razing technique proved to be not as efficient as the Lich King desired, apparently, because he started telling his necromancers to desecrate graveyards and raise up even more members. Only two things seem to separate a Scourge servitor from the Lich King's will: whatever faltering in the Lich King's power allowed the Forsaken to free themselves from his grasp, and destruction of their bodies. Scourge creatures are bidden to do the Lich King's will, and they do this with a blind fervor. The Cult of the Damned is an enigma. No one knows why they do what they do. Whatever the reason, they willfully follow the Scourge, dressing in dark robes, doing their bidding, while helping to spread the plague into more and more cities."}

{"id": "43147", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=43147", "title": "Scourge Invasion", "text": "The Scourge Invasion was a &lt;a href=\"Event\"&gt;world event&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt; that heralded the opening of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, the citadel of the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. It was reintroduced into the game in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; partway through the &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;Zombie Infestation&lt;/a&gt; event, in preparation for \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", and tuned for the new level cap which players had achieved (70), occurring after &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt;. It is thus the only non-seasonal world event to have ever been repeated.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Death Rising&lt;/a&gt;, the pre-event for \"&lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;\" as the Scourge are marauding across Azeroth, was heavily inspired by the Scourge Invasion.\nOfficial description.\nDuring the invasion, several regions of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; organized a worldwide counter to the Scourge invasion, keeping an eye out for any &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; sightings and passing on their information to all adventurers willing to aid them in their struggle.\nWith each victory against the Scourge, the defense grows stronger. As more and more invasion attempts are beaten back by the defenders, the Argent Dawn will be able to bestow increasingly more powerful blessings upon those fighting the invaders. If the mortal races focus on clearing the Scourge camps all over the world that have sprung up beneath each necropolis, perhaps the invasion can effectively be halted or even repelled. Those who wish to take up arms against the undead invaders should speak with a representative of the Argent Dawn to learn what regions need help and how the defense is holding up.\nThere are also reports of Scourge agents showing up in Stratholme, the Scholomance, Dire Maul, the Scarlet Monastery, Shadowfang Keep, and the Razorfen Downs. Whatever their purpose there may be, the world will surely be better off if they are destroyed before their evil plans are fulfilled.\nA necropolis has appeared outside Stormwind and Undercity, and soon the assault on these capitals will launch in full force. Skeletal shock troops are standing by to commence the attack, led by abominations and gruesome undead officers. The city guard will need all the help they can get once the Scourge unleashes its wrath on the cities. The Argent Dawn has already heeded their desperate call for help, setting up camps inside the besieged cities and rallying the defense against the encroaching darkness.\nNecropolis invasions, Necrotic Runes, and the Shards.\nDuring the Scourge Invasion, numerous high-level zones are under attack by one or two flying &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropoli&lt;/a&gt; each. The zones under attack have purple skull markers on the continent-level maps. The zones that get attacked are &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. See showing possible spawnpoints for scourge forces\nNPCs near Argent Dawn tents in the major cities will note where the necropoleis are attacking, and how many are in each zone. There are also necropoleis over the capitals. The ones over the major cities seem to be permanent but they only spawn low level Scourge for the introductory quest. If you look on the world map, areas under attack (excluding capital cities) will be marked with a purple skull.\nAssaulting the Necropolis.\nThe necropoli are accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Necrotic%20Shard\"&gt;Necrotic Shard&lt;/a&gt;s, which are visible on the ground near each of the flying citadels. These shards are always surrounded by a large number of undead. The undead are non-elite and grant 5 Argent Dawn reputation until the end of , unlike normal undead. They yield if slain while having the equipped.\nThe Shards near the undead are weakened as the undead are killed. When the strength of the shard reaches zero, four &lt;a href=\"Cultist%20Engineer\"&gt;Cultist Engineer&lt;/a&gt;s will appear and start to heal it. Each of these engineers can be \"disrupted\" through the use of eight &lt;a href=\"Necrotic%20Rune\"&gt;Necrotic Rune&lt;/a&gt;s. The Acolyte will then convert into a &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20of%20Doom\"&gt;Shadow of Doom&lt;/a&gt;, which is a tough 70 elite mob. Upon its defeat, the Shadow of Doom will yield a , 50 reputation with the Argent Dawn, 30 Necrotic Runes, and has a chance to drop a chest piece of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Slaying\"&gt;Undead Slaying&lt;/a&gt; set.\nDestroying all four Shadows of Doom will destroy the Necrotic Shard, heal nearby players for 10,000, grant them a powerful buff, and stop new Scourge from spawning there (at least for a short time).\nDestroying all the Necrotic Shards attached to a necropolis will destroy the necropolis. Destroying all the necropoli in a zone will cause that zone to no longer be under attack. The Scourge will eventually deploy more necropolises; however, so clearing a zone does not mean it is safe forever.\nRewards.\nMarks of the Dawn.\nAfter a certain number of battles have been won on a server, additional rewards are available. After the battles have been completed, a new NPC will spawn at Lights Hope Chapel and in your faction capital and will hand three of the item out for free!\nNecrotic Rune turn-ins.\nThe undead have a chance to drop a Necrotic Rune. &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Thomas%20Helleran\"&gt;Commander Thomas Helleran&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; wants ten of these runes to complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Under%20the%20Shadow\"&gt;Under the Shadow&lt;/a&gt;; after completing Under the Shadow the remainder can also be turned in to the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Argent Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; at Light's Hope Chapel or in camps in your faction capital city for various rewards:\nMob drops.\nIn the original Scourge Invasion, three rare spawns appear at each of the Shards (&lt;a href=\"Bone%20Witch\"&gt;Bone Witch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lumbering%20Horror\"&gt;Lumbering Horror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Spirit of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;), which drop two to three Necrotic Runes as well as the bracers of the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Slaying\"&gt;Undead Slaying&lt;/a&gt; set. Like most rare spawns, they are not elite but are slightly higher level. These spawns appear roughly every fifteen minutes after engagement of Scourge in the area, and despawn about fifteen minutes later.\nIn the second Scourge Invasion, the rare spawns are level 71, and instead drop the pants for the new &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Undead%20Slaying\"&gt;Blessed Undead Slaying&lt;/a&gt; sets with 100% chance of drop. These can be easily taken down if fought without any adds; a level 68 tank and another DPS character or healer will easily make quick work of these rares.\nLetters from the Scourge.\nNon-elite undead around the Necrotic Shards will occasionally drop letters. There are six total, each of which starts a turn-in quest at the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Rolls\"&gt;Keeper of the Rolls&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; for a small reward. Once the quest is started, the letters may be read. They contain well-written bits of lore, mainly related to the events in \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\". These letters appear in both versions of the Scourge Invasion.\nA week after turning in a letter you will receive through the mail a message from the Keeper indicating a NPC that is mentioned in the original (quest) letter. This does not start a quest. The NPCs indicated become vendors that will sell you (2934 mana over 30 secs) and (2148 health over 30 secs). There is no other reward, and the lemonade and bread are functionally equivalent to normal level 45 vendor food and drink, though while consuming them an animation of a cartoon heart is displayed above your character and a short, tinging sound will repeat. These vendors continue to sell these items after the Scourge Invasion ends. There is one vendor in each faction &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nCapital city invasions.\nAside from the necropolis events outdoors, Scourge mobs will occasionally appear in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. They spawn seemingly at random, causing city NPCs to yell for help. The most common are &lt;a href=\"Flameshocker\"&gt;Flameshocker&lt;/a&gt;s, level 55 mobs (level 63 elite mobs during the second Invasion) which do not hit very hard, but have a very large amount of health points. The city NPCs are capable of killing the Flameshockers on their own, but if a player or group chooses to tag them, they will receive 5 Argent Dawn rep (at Honored). Flameshockers can drop Necrotic Runes.\nThere are also groups of tougher elite mobs (&lt;a href=\"Pallid%20Horror\"&gt;Pallid Horror&lt;/a&gt;) that periodically spawn in Stormwind and Undercity and attempt to get to the city leader, causing him/her to yell that he/she is under attack. (These do not pose an actual threat to racial leaders, they are easily able to defeat the creatures if they manage to reach them.) When all the mobs are defeated, the city leader will yell that they are safe, and a dead Necrotic Shard will spawn. The shard will give a quest to talk to an NPC at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. Any player can receive this quest, even if they did not tag the mobs that spawned the shard.\nAll the mobs that spawn inside cities are yellow (passive) and do not attack players who haven't attacked them first. They also appear not to attack vital NPCs such as bankers and vendors. So, it would seem players who aren't interested in the city events are not threatened by them in any way, and can simply ignore them and go about their business.\nNew bosses.\nThere are also reports of Scourge agents showing up in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. These new boss mobs can be identified by the glowing purple aura they have which is similar to those of the invading Scourge outside the instances.\nTenris Mirkblood\u200e.\n, a &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt;, can be found above &lt;a href=\"Attumen%20the%20Huntsman\"&gt;Attumen the Huntsman&lt;/a&gt;'s room in the kitchen. He is the objective of &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;. Introduced with the second Invasion.\nBalzaphon.\n is a &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; who formerly patrolled the fountain courtyard to the left of the service entrance in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. Balzaphon uses many frost-based abilities. He has since &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; been moved from his patrol route and now stands in a corner northeast of the fountain.\nLord Blackwood.\n resides in &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;. He is a large &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; who attacks with both ranged bow attacks and heavy melee attacks.\nRevanchion.\n, a &lt;a href=\"wraith\"&gt;wraith&lt;/a&gt;, wanders the hallway behind Tendris Warpwood in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;.\nScorn.\nThe lich appears in the graveyard portion of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;The Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; once &lt;a href=\"Bloodmage%20Thalnos\"&gt;Bloodmage Thalnos&lt;/a&gt; is defeated.\nSever.\nThe &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; appears in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; along the corridor that runs parallel to the Great Hall and Kitchen. He is arguably the hardest boss in the instance.\nLady Falther'ess.\n, a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;, and can be found in the slaughter pens area of &lt;a href=\"Razorfen%20Downs\"&gt;Razorfen Downs&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nThe following is a list of quests available during the second Invasion.\nThe following quests start from rare drops off the non-elite Scourge near any crystal.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, on the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt;, members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; for the Alliance and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde work to combat the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and the floating &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt;es.\nThe second Scourge Invasion.\nThe second Scourge Invasion began partway through the &lt;a href=\"Zombie%20Infestation\"&gt;Zombie Infestation&lt;/a&gt; world event, shortly after &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, immediately preceding the release of \"\".\nThe second Invasion largely mirrored the first Invasion, albeit with the addition of &lt;a href=\"Tenris%20Mirkblood\"&gt;Tenris Mirkblood&lt;/a&gt; and numerous changes to the available quests and rewards.

In both cases, destroying the chains that held the crystals to the flying structure caused them to explode and crash into the ocean.\nIn the end, the Alliance won victory over the Scourge, demolishing the abominations on the ground, as aid arrived in the form of the Ironforge Airforce, which drove back the assault along with aid from the &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Quarter\"&gt;Mage Quarter&lt;/a&gt; and cannonfire from the ramparts and fleet.\nThe battle for Stormwind was over... but the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army was just beginning...\nComic version of the battle.\nAlthough depicting the same event, the comic and the game show some differences: "}

We're going to hold off on the decimation for, like, a week or so. \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: ok? \n[theLichKing]: I was thinking. How much trouble do you think it would be to have a thermostat installed in the Throne Room? \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: ... \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: y? \n[theLichKing]: It's really really cold in here. \n[theLichKing]: I'm Lord of the Scourge. I think I should get a thermostat. \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: no its a frozen throne \n[theLichKing]: Right \n[theLichKing]: See that's exactly what I'm talking about. The throne is frozen. The chair that I sit on all day? Literally a block of ice. \n[theLichKing]: It is so very, very cold. \n[theLichKing]: I actually cannot over-emphasize how cold I am on a daily basis. \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: but its supposed to be frozen \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: its the source of ur power \n[theLichKing]: About that. Can I get my power transferred to some other source? \n[theLichKing]: Something that isn't made out of ice that I then have to literally sit on? \n[theLichKing]: Someone dropped the ball there. \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: ok so like what should it be then \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: like a ring? \n[theLichKing]: A ring? \n[theLichKing]: Seriously, a ring. \n[theLichKing]: Do you _read_ history? \n[Kel'Thuz4d]: so what then \n[theLichKing]: I don't know.

The conflict took place all throughout the Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, including its &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;southern&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;northern&lt;/a&gt; woodlands, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;.\nFresh from destroying his homeland of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Arthas turned his gaze northward, and led his phalanxes toward Quel'Thalas with the purpose of defiling the kingdom's mystical &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, a key component in the resurrection of the necromancer &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. The elves were aware of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in Lordaeron and thus were busy preparing for the undead. Anasterian rallied his people to action but left the command of their army and defense to Sylvanas Windrunner. The elves resisted Arthas but were ultimately unable to prevent the Scourge from advancing. The elven homeland was overrun by the Scourge, the capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; was sacked and reduced to ruins, roughly ninety percent of the high elves were killed \u2013 including the &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;elven king&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;ranger-general&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Belo%27vir%20Salonar\"&gt;grand magister&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 and Arthas successfully managed to defile the Sunwell, bringing forth the dread necromancer as a powerful &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis goal achieved, Arthas abandoned Quel'Thalas to its fate and left to bring about similar destruction to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Scourge invasion was the most damaging event in &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; history, and a blow its survivors, calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in honor of their perished brethren, would take years to begin recovering from.\nPrelude.\nThe conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; saw a relatively peaceful end to Quel'Thalas' conflict against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The orcs, who had broken off their siege of Silvermoon, had been soundly defeated and subdued, and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, with whom the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; had shared several millennia of conflict, were further broken and dispersed in their ill-fated attempt to reclaim the land for themselves.\nIn the aftermath of the war, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; seceded from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, realizing that the Alliance needed his kingdom far more than his kingdom needed the Alliance. The elves spent the next several years in a period of secluded independence, seeing little conflict outside of the occasional Amani raiding party.\nNews soon began to travel of a mysterious plagued grain epidemic in southern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. It fell to the young Prince Arthas Menethil to investigate this threat to his people, though his quest to protect them led him to do quite the opposite: a fateful trip to the icy wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; brought the prince into contact with &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, a cursed blade which, when claimed, corrupted him wholly and twisted him into a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. \nArthas returned to Lordaeron a triumphant hero, though he used this as a smokescreen to murder his father, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and almost completely wipe out &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and its neighboring towns. Raising the dead into his service, Arthas's army steadily grew in number and power, supplemented by a myriad of undead creatures brought from Northrend.\n&lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, a necromancer that Arthas had killed during his quest to end the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;, now proved to be one of his most loyal subordinates. Kel'Thuzad led Arthas north to Quel'Thalas, informing the prince that only the elves' mystical font of power, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, could restore him to corporeal form. Arthas led his now-colossal army toward the elven homeland.\nArthas managed to capture an elven priest and gained vital knowledge. Apart from this, he gained an ally in a dissatisfied magister named &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Farstriders' defense.\n&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, had heard several disturbing rumors and reports concerning the state of Lordaeron, though they could no longer be ignored. Sylvanas and her rangers departed to the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;Thalassian Pass&lt;/a&gt;, and confronted the twisted prince in person. Sylvanas instructed him to turn back, though Arthas announced that death itself had come to the high home of the elves. After a failed attempt to kill the prince then and there, Sylvanas and her rangers began an attack on the undead forces, hoping the three &lt;a href=\"Elfgate\"&gt;Elfgate&lt;/a&gt;s could hold the Scourge invaders off.\nIt did not take long for Arthas to crash through the first gate. With hulking &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; allies acting as sentient siege engines, Arthas's army rushed towards the next elfgate, slaying every elf who stood in its way. The human necromancers among the Scourge's ranks were hastily resurrecting the fallen elves as undead thralls; the rangers attempted to counter this by cutting down the humans, though this too proved a mostly futile effort. With the first elfgate lost, Sylvanas and her surviving comrades were forced to fall back.\nThe ranger-general acknowledged the unfavorable odds and knew that she could not win this battle. She maintained that the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, could still turn the battle around and sent a number of runners to inform them of the impending attack. Arthas and his &lt;a href=\"gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt; allies slew almost every single runner Sylvanas sent back to the capital, though it did not take long for the danger to become apparent. Sylvanas organized the evacuation of &lt;a href=\"Fairbreeze%20Village\"&gt;Fairbreeze Village&lt;/a&gt; and other nearby settlements.\nGiven the unprecedented nature of the onslaught, not all of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; were fighting together, and several ranger companies were initially unaware of the threat. Ranger Lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; was among them \u2013 patrolling around &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar quickly became aware of the presence of an invading army, and rushed west to confront them. However, he had not anticipated the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; of his enemies, and was nearly killed by a group of risen elven guardians, losing the use of his left eye in the process. Fellow Ranger Lord &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; narrowly saved him from the undead, and the two rangers' companies rushed to defend the capital.\n&lt;a href=\"An%27owyn\"&gt;Elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;, the elves &lt;a href=\"Koltira\"&gt;Koltira&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Faltora\"&gt;Faltora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Merriel\"&gt;Merriel&lt;/a&gt; encountered a plethora of Scourge warriors and &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s, among them the powerful &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;. In turn, all three of them met their end at the hands of the Scourge, the former of whom was later risen into a death knight by Thassarian himself.\nThe mother tree &lt;a href=\"Thas%27alah\"&gt;Thas'alah&lt;/a&gt; was cut down by the Scourge and the base of &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; was erected in its place. With the aid of a treacherous magister named &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas acquired the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20the%20Three%20Moons\"&gt;Key of the Three Moons&lt;/a&gt;, allowing him to bypass several of the elfgates and their defenses. Overcoming each of Sylvanas' tactics (including an aerial &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; attack) by using the diversity and practicality of his undead army, Arthas surged forward and obliterated the elves' nearby settlements.\nArthas eventually confronted Sylvanas. Frustrated at the harsh resistance she had given him, he charged her directly, and the two did battle. The exhausted ranger general was unable to match the power of Frostmourne and was cut down. As a last mockery, Arthas sired her as an undead &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;, binding her to his will and forcing her to battle her homeland in his name.\nAs the undead army approached the capital, they wrought a trail of &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;dark, unholy destruction&lt;/a&gt; upon the land.\nThe siege of Silvermoon.\nArthas arrived at &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, demanding the elves open their gates and allow him passage. He was met by the reigning &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister\"&gt;Grand Magister of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Belo%27vir\"&gt;Grand Magister Belo'vir&lt;/a&gt;, who took over the defense of the city in Sylvanas' place and told Arthas that no army had ever breached Silvermoon. Arthas had Sylvanas brought out and paraded her in front of Silvermoon, as a testament to the fate awaiting his enemies. Still, the elves refused to waver. With High Priest &lt;a href=\"Vandellor\"&gt;Vandellor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;High Priestess Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; mending the soldiers' wounds, Belo'vir and his forces attempted to hold the city's entrance, while Arthas prepared for a siege. The sight of Sylvanas and the other atrocities laid bare proved disheartening for the elves, even the most stoic among them.\nIn spite of the unfavorable odds, the elves were confident that Silvermoon's great Sunwell-empowered shield, &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 \"Gatekeeper\" in &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 would be enough to ward off the invaders from advancing into the capital. Arthas, revealing the mooncrystals he had pilfered, dispelled the barrier with them, leaving Silvermoon vulnerable. Grand Magister Belo'vir instructed magi to immediately inform the Convocation of what had transpired, and that the magi needed to raise the barrier themselves in the mooncrystals' place. Seizing the chance, the Scourge began a heavy assault on the city, setting their gargoyles against the dragonhawks and bringing out catapults tingling with filth to further demoralize the elves. Despite Belo'vir's order for the magi on Quel'Danas to raise the shield manually, nothing yet had happened. The Scourge's &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; allies burrowed underground with Ban'dinoriel dispelled, and did massive damage to Silvermoon's walls from the inside.\nLike Sylvanas before him, Belo'vir, unnerved, came to acknowledge that defending Silvermoon was impossible. The grand magister tasked &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Archmage Rommath&lt;/a&gt; with the evacuation of the city, instructing him to transport as many elves as he could to the safety of Quel'Danas. Accompanied by Liadrin's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt;, several ships (filled mostly with evacuated children) took sail from the port, hoping to find safe refuge with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, though were attacked and destroyed by the Scourge's gargoyles. Most of the children drowned; the survivors were forced ashore, most of whom were also slain.\nBetrayal.\nOn Quel'Danas, the treacherous Dar'Khan went about binding the Sunwell's energies. Empowered by his \u201cblessed lord Arthas\u201d and following the careful instructions of the prince and an &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;unseen advisor&lt;/a&gt;, Drathir individually murdered roughly half of the &lt;a href=\"Convocation%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Convocation of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; in cold blood, then prepared his binding ritual.\nDar'Khan wasted no time in sealing the Sunwell's power, killing several of its unsuspecting defenders and methodologically eliminating any magi who may have been able to discern what he had done to the well. Dar'Khan, who had been a long-time friend of Lor'themar Theron (who, in addition to his Farstrider background, had been a warden of the Sunwell for several years), had used this friendship to gain intimate knowledge of Quel'Thalas' defenses. Coupled with the sacking of &lt;a href=\"An%27owyn\"&gt;An'owyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"An%27telas\"&gt;An'telas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"An%27daroth\"&gt;An'daroth&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in their hidden mooncrystals passively fuelling the shield being seized, Dar'Khan's ritual resulted in Ban'dinoriel becoming impossible for the Sunwell's magi to invoke.\nDrathir had been promised unlimited access to the Sunwell, provided he wait until Arthas' arrival. Playing on the magister's ego and lust for power and recognition had worked well on Arthas' part, though Dar'Khan couldn't help but disobey and attempt to gorge on the well himself.\nWith the capital evacuated and the troops being transported to Quel'Danas, Belo'vir, Vandellor, and Liadrin left to defend the Sunwell and King Anasterian. Without the shield, Silvermoon was quickly invaded, sacked, and overrun by the Scourge. Its fires and smoke could be seen from across the ocean.\nBattle on Quel'Danas.\nAs the elves began their retreat to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the wielder of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt;, made a last stand on the southern shores of Quel'Danas, holding off waves of Scourge so his men could safely reach the Sunwell. He was killed by the death knight &lt;a href=\"Morlen%20Coldgrip\"&gt;Morlen Coldgrip&lt;/a&gt;, the legendary elven blade lost for the time being. During the elves' retreat, some of the Scourge split off from the main army to attack the docks and &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%20Isle\"&gt;Sunstrider Isle&lt;/a&gt;, with nothing else left in sight to destroy.\nGrand Magister Belo'vir rallied the soldiers on southern Quel'Danas. With Silvermoon conquered and the lion's share of Quel'Thalas under Scourge control, Arthas created a &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;path of frost&lt;/a&gt; to cross the ocean to Quel'Danas, giving the elves little time to marshal a counter-attack. Crossing his icy bridge, Arthas and his Scourge legions rushed to the Sunwell, where they were met by the high king of Quel'Thalas himself, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, armed and armored. The king destroyed Arthas's path of frost with his fiery magics, shattering the unholy pathway and forcing the undead to the ocean. Anasterian began battling the Scourge, his might, even after several thousand years of life, giving his people heightened morale. Arthas confronted Anasterian, and the two leaders began a fierce battle. The elves knew that the duel unfolding before them would decide the fate of them all. The Scourge fought with less velocity for a short while, as they turned to observe their master doing battle with the elven king. High Priestess Liadrin used the opportunity to assist Belo'vir and Vandellor, both of whom were killed in the ensuing battle. Before he was overwhelmed by the Scourge, Belo'vir teleported Liadrin to safety.\nAfter a struggle, Anasterian managed to severely wound Arthas's necromantic steed, &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, by severing its forelegs. The act only served to enrage the dismounted Arthas, who charged Anasterian. Seizing the chance, Anasterian warped behind the rampaging prince and attempted to decapitate him, though was caught in an icy blast and immobilized. Wielding &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas shattered the king's blade, &lt;a href=\"Felo%27melorn\"&gt;Felo'melorn&lt;/a&gt;, and was undeterred even when Anasterian buried the broken sword deep in Arthas's thigh. Arthas ran Anasterian through with Frostmourne, piercing the king's heart and stealing his soul. With his most powerful obstacles all removed, the prince began his final assault on the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe brothers &lt;a href=\"Solanar%20Bloodwrath\"&gt;Solanar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falon\"&gt;Falon&lt;/a&gt; managed to secure the king's body during the battle, taking it away from the carnage and sparing Anasterian the fate of undeath that had befallen most of the prince's other &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;formidable&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vandellor\"&gt;enemies&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefilement of the Sunwell.\nBound by Dar'Khan's magic, the Sunwell proved little boon to its defenders, who were unable to overcome the invaders. Having finally reached his destination, Arthas submerged Kel'Thuzad's remains within the Sunwell, bringing forth the necromancer as a powerful &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; and tainting the Sunwell in the process. Arthas then killed the treacherous Dar'Khan Drathir for good measure.\nWith no more reason to linger in the elven homeland, Arthas left Quel'Thalas to its fate, believing he had dealt the elves an irrecoverable blow.\nThe mighty &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; arrived too late, and witnessed the Sunwell's defilement. However, something of its energies remained behind.\nAftermath.\nWith the deaths of Quel'Thalas' highest authority figures, it fell to Lor'themar Theron, Sylvanas' second-in-command, to rally the high elven survivors and protect them from the Scourge remnants. Theron and Halduron led search parties all over to find any surviving elves, eventually taking over a portion of Silvermoon, the &lt;a href=\"The%20Bazaar\"&gt;Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, and barricading it off from the undead. This served as a point of congregation for other survivors, who made their way to the safe portion of the city. Among them was Archmage Rommath, also searching for survivors, who cleared out hordes of undead on his lonesome using his powerful magic. The brothers Solanar and Falon arrived at the scene, with the king's body in tow; and Lady Liadrin had also survived the battle's climax, though had sworn off using the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, believing it had failed Quel'Thalas in its hour of greatest need.\nThe elves were also forced to deal with another potential calamity: the tainted Sunwell, pulsating with dark energies, threatened to deal fatal damage to the land and the elven survivors, who had relied upon the Sunwell to sustain them their entire lives. However, Quel'Danas was teeming with undead stragglers, and was also the target of a resurgent Amani fleet hoping to crush the Scourge and use the elves' dire circumstances as a chance to reclaim the land (and secure the Sunwell) for themselves.\nThe Prince's return.\nWhen the elven prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; learned of what had befallen his homeland, he returned home from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to reconcile with his people and take up the mantle of leadership in his father's place. He traveled with his advisors all over the country, surveying the damage done first-hand. Kael was also forced to set certain portions of the forests ablaze, as an act of scorched earth to halt the Scourge remnants. Knowing what the enemy was capable of, the elves also began burning their corpses to avoid reanimation. Returning to Silvermoon to rally the survivors, Kael informed them of the danger the corrupted well presented, and prepared an invasion force to destroy it before the Amani could take it over.\nJust as Arthas and Dar'Khan had used the mooncrystals to subvert Ban'dinoriel, Kael, Rommath, and &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor&lt;/a&gt; planned to destabilize the tainted well using the same principle, hoping to overcharge it with the crystals and destroy it, taking the gathered trolls and undead with it. A raid including Rommath, Astalor, Falon, Solanar, Lor'themar, Liadrin, Halduron, &lt;a href=\"Galell\"&gt;Galell&lt;/a&gt;, and Kael himself left for Quel'Danas.\nAfter a struggle, the elves succeeded in taking over the site of the Sunwell, and Kael'thas destroyed the tainted well. Though this had averted the damage he had feared, another issue presented itself: magical addiction.\nWith the Sunwell gone, the elves were struck with severe withdrawal symptoms, whose effect proved fatal to the sickly, the very young, and the very old. The elves realized how dependent they had become upon the Sunwell, and how much they relied upon the constant flow of arcane energies it provided them with. Overcoming this addiction became another goal.\nRise of the blood elves.\nHaving paid his respects to his father, Kael'thas decreed that Anasterian would be the last king of the high elves. He prepared to leave for &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, to battle the Scourge alongside the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and named &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; Quel'Thalas' regent in his absence. He instructed Theron to protect the kingdom from the Scourge remnants and to seek a cure for the elves' addiction to magic. Halduron Brightwing was named the new &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and assisted the regent lord with this daunting task.\nBefore leaving, Kael'thas proclaimed the high elves reborn as the &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;\u2013 &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 in honor of their fallen brethren.\nReclamation and rebuilding.\nThe Scourge had left most of Quel'Thalas dangerous and uninhabitable, and the beleaguered elves, wracked by the pangs of addiction, made little progress with countering the Scourge remnants. However, Lor'themar, Halduron, and the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; frequently ventured out into the wilderness to battle the Scourge. One such outing led them into contact with &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his comrades, who were searching the realm for their companion, &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;. After initial distrust, the blood elves joined forces with the group to battle the newly-returned &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, who had captured Anveena for his own purposes. Anveena was revealed to be the mortal avatar of the Sunwell, and following Drathir's second death, was placed under sin'dorei protection.\nThe prince's campaign in Lordaeron eventually resulted in his abandonment of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;, and his exodus to the broken realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas pledged himself to the half-demon &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in return for the knowledge to overcome his people's addiction to magic, though the demon lord ensured him that there was no way to conquer it \u2013 only to sate it. Illidan passed on the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Tap\"&gt;siphoning arcane magic&lt;/a&gt; from objects and creatures bearing mana power, which was spread among Kael's forces. The prince sent back &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; to Quel'Thalas, with the mission to spread these teachings, reinvigorate the people, and rebuild the country, finally giving the blood elves a method by which to sate their cravings.\nReinvigorated by this new technique of acquiring arcane magic \u2013 which Rommath smoothly attributed to being that of Kael'thas's doing, not Illidan's \u2013 the blood elves began a true counter-attack on the Scourge. Rommath led the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; in the reclamation of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, annihilating the lingering Scourge with their powerful magics. The magi rebuilt the city almost overnight, and the blood elves, after years of fighting a losing battle, began taking back much of their lost land, aiming to drive the Scourge out completely and restore Quel'Thalas to its glory.\nImpact.\nThe Scourge's wildly successful attack had many lasting consequences for the Thalassian people and included several military achievements of note. Among them:\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28Quel%27Thalas%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt; first entered the ruined Quel'Thalas alongside &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Kael%27thas\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; who left &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; prior to its destruction. Whether there was any Royal Guard of Quel'Thalas is unclear but if there was, it would be decimated or utterly destroyed."}

My name is Belnistrasz, and I thank you for rescuing me. I had given myself up for dead... or worse, as a meal for these &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;-infested vermin. Yes - I said Scourge all right; they've brokered some sort of deal with the &lt;a href=\"Quilboar\"&gt;Quilboar&lt;/a&gt; here, and this nightmare is a result.\nListen... rather than just flee, I want to make a difference for all of our sakes.

Talk to him again to start an escort quest. Make sure your whole party completes \"this\" quest before accepting the \"next\" quest which is the escort quest itself. Failure to do so results in not being able to complete the escort quest.\nThis is an escort quest/endurance battle. The quest level (37 elite) may not accurately reflect its difficulty. Due to the spawn rate of the mobs, you might not ever exit the combat phase during this battle, excluding you the opportunity to drink for mana. Ration your mana wisely. A good tip is to read what the escort NPC says to see how far along into the battle you are. One important fact is that it doesn't actually matter how many of the spawns you kill, all that matters is surviving long enough. If you can cycle CCs and tanks properly, you can complete the quest having only killed 5 or 6 monsters."}

Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill him once again.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The death knight Tyrannus was promoted to Scourgelord after slaying the giant &lt;a href=\"Forgemaster%20Garfrost\"&gt;Garfrost&lt;/a&gt;. His power, ruthlessness and &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;, Rimefang, make him the perfect guardian for the Pit of Saron and the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nBosstiary.\n\"A merciless and efficient slave master, Tyrannus watches over the Quarry of Tears as the Lich King's right hand. The blessings of Tyrannus' dark lord come in many forms, not the least of which is the scourgelord's frost wyrm, Rimefang.\"\nStrategy.\nAt the start of the fight, Tyrannus will be mounted atop Rimefang, his personal &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt; mount. After some dialog, he will hop off of Rimefang, heal to full, and engage the party on the ground. Rimefang will continue to fly overhead during the battle but cannot be targeted. Note that Tyrannus heals to full as soon as he dismounts, so don't bother attacking him at range until he's on the ground.\nTyrannus deals fairly heavy damage and can spike with Forceful Smash, so keeping the tank constantly at full is very important. You will be warned when he does so:\nAn added complication to this fight is that Rimefang will continually launch bolts of frost at random locations on the ground, which will be indicated beforehand by a blue rune design. When they hit, they will create an Icy Blast, which is a patch of frost on the ground that slows and deals heavy periodic Frost damage to anyone walking across (including Tyrannus). Tyrannus also occasionally marks a player with Mark of Rimefang.\nThe party will be warned when Rimefang is about to focus on a player:\nIt is important that the targeted player move away from other players, especially the healer (unless the healer is the target), because when Rimefang shoots an ice bolt at the marked player, it will deal Frost damage to and stun the player and anyone else who is too close for a few seconds.\nThe ice patches are vital because of Tyrannus' Unholy Power ability, which he casts after a Forceful Smash. He gains a double damage and speed buff, which can possibly overwhelm the tank or the healer because of the damage he deals. To survive this, the tank needs to drag Tyrannus over the frost patches created by Rimefang (while avoiding walking through them), which will slow him and allow you to kite him around until Unholy Power wears off, at which point you can return to tanking him normally. It is suggested tanking Tyrannus with the tank's back to an ice patch, that way just before Tyrannus' Unholy Power ability activates, the tank will get knocked backwards over the ice patch thus forcing Tyrannus to walk all the way through the ice patch to get to the tank again on the other side.\nThe only other major thing to watch for is Overlord's Brand. Any DPS that receives this needs to immediately stop doing damage, as any damage they deal will also be done to the tank. Additionally, if a healer is marked with the brand, all heals done will be amplified and then mirrored on Tyrannus. It is probably best to just heal through the brand if the healer is marked, but DPS must stop if marked unless the tank and healer heavily outgear this encounter.\nRimefang will fly away once Tyrannus is dead.\nAlternative strategy.\nInstead of kiting Tyrannus when Empower is active, it is possible to continue tanking the boss, using defensive cooldowns such as &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Block\"&gt;Shield Block&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Protection\"&gt;Divine Protection&lt;/a&gt; to stay alive. This reduces the encounter to &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;, with only Rimefang and Overlord's Brand to watch out for.\nEncounter Timer.\nThis encounter appears to be limited in number of attempts, (not a number of attempts counter). If this timer is exceeded, the falling ice in the access tunnel will close it off entirely, precluding additional attempts. To give a rough idea until better/more exact information is available, is roughly equivalent to seven attempts with everyone having to run and mount back, rebuff, etc.\nAdds From Behind.\nSometimes the defensive line behind the encounter can be breached, and scourge forces can quickly overwhelm the group (or at least take out players with a quick barrage of shadow-bolts if they step too close to the entrance). It has been suggested, but not officially confirmed, that the strength of the defensive line is determined by how many slaves the group freed earlier in the instance, so groups should not skip freeing the slaves just because nobody has that particular quest. Simply moving the ranged and healers to the far end of the arena area while Tyrannus goes through his startup sequence should help avoid this problem.\nBugs.\nIf any action is taken during the roleplaying before the fight (This bug is not fixed as of July 22nd, 2010) Scourgelord Tyrannus may mount back, &lt;a href=\"Rimefang\"&gt;Rimefang&lt;/a&gt; still flying around attacking the group, while Tyrannus is out of harm's way. The only two ways to fix him is to either wipe, or somehow have everyone alive in your group run out of the instance to have him reset. It might not work at all, even with a wipe and letting the trash respawn.\nIt seems that this bug is caused by people attacking Rimefang or Tyrannus during the Roleplaying that precedes the fight. Staying out of combat during the event between Tyrannus and &lt;a href=\"Martin%20Victus\"&gt;Martin Victus&lt;/a&gt; and avoiding any actions might reduce the chance of this bug happening if that is what causes it.\nBest way to avoid this bug seems, so far, to keep all the party in the middle of the crowd of slaves, and have one player just run in and start the Roleplaying event, then return to the crowd. Do not cast any spells, heal or do anything. Wait for Tyrannus to run to you, then the tank can pick him up and fight normally. The &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Boss%20Mods\"&gt;Deadly Boss Mods&lt;/a&gt; timer for combat start is a few seconds early, so you have to wait for him to run to you."}

These could be turned in for equipment, reputation, and other rewards. With the Cataclysm, this system was obsoleted and new players will not encounter any trace of it. However, players who earned Argent Dawn Commission trinkets prior to the Cataclysm can still request replacements, and can in fact continue to collect scourgestones; however, the scourgestones are now entirely useless.\nThe scourgestones were turned in to &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Zverenhoff\"&gt;Nicholas Zverenhoff&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Officer%20Garush\"&gt;Argent Officer Garush&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"The%20Bulwark\"&gt;The Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Officer%20Pureheart\"&gt;Argent Officer Pureheart&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe trinkets noted below cannot be obtained by new players, as the quests to acquire them are no longer in the game. Players who earned them previously can still request replacements for the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20Commission\"&gt;Argent Dawn Commission&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20the%20Dawn\"&gt;Seal of the Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20the%20Dawn\"&gt;Rune of the Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Wearing these trinkets will still cause undead mobs to drop scourgestones, but the scourgestones serve no purpose.\nCollection.\n&lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures sent out by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and his forces will have a chance to carry upon them three different levels of Scourgestones. One may obtain these stones by equipping one of the following trinkets (none of which can be acquired by new players anymore):\nUndead &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, along with their living compatriots of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; have the chance to carry one of these stones.\nBoss type mobs such as &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkmaster%20Gandling\"&gt;Darkmaster Gandling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; will \"always\" carry a Corruptor's Scourgestone.\nObsolete types of Scourgestones.\nAs stated, these items can still be collected. However, they can no longer be turned in for any rewards.\nIn the RPG.\nThe process of turning scourgestones into holy mightstones is favored by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Young members of the Dawn collect scourgestones to show their mettle."}

The ever-expanding reach of the Lich King has drawn the forces of both the Horde and the Alliance to the frigid lands of Northrend, but they do not know the horrors that await them. Can you muster the courage you will need when death itself stares back at you? The unrelenting forces of the Scourge have risen and they will stop at nothing until the last breath of life has been siphoned from Azeroth.\nThe Scourgewar has begun...\"\nLoot Items:\nInformation.\nPlayers in the online realms have been hard at work in Northrend for almost a year now, with the Wrath of the Lich King letting adventurers land on the frozen continent and take on everything it has to offer. Now the action is coming to the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game on November 24th, when Sourgewar freezes things over at your local game store.\nAmid the powerful new Death Knight cards and other secrets we have waiting for players in the next expansion, you're probably dying to get a look at the newest additions to the Loot card assortment. Without making you wait any longer, let's dive right into things.\nLoot cards.\nTiny.\nSay hello to our newest little friend. Tauren and Draenei, we have the ultimate irony you've been waiting for. The newest super-common loot card will give you a mini mount that will carry you around as fast as his little legs will take him\u2014which isn't any faster than your character can run, but hey, it's the thought that counts. Horde characters will get a baby raptor version of the mount, and Alliance will get a pony version. Each code will be redeemed for 50 uses, so you'll be able to get lots of work out of Tiny for each card you get your hands on.\nTuskarr Kite.\nOne of the coolest factions to make their appearance in Wrath of the Lich King, the Tuskarr are a Walrus-like species of humanoids that like to fish. One of the things you've probably noticed while running around and doing their errands is the cool decorations they have around their towns. With Tuskarr Kite, you'll be able to own your own decorative kite that functions just like the Onyxia Kite from March of the Legion's Kiting Loot card. This uncommon Loot card also counts towards your companion pet achievements, so if you're still working towards your new pets, the Kite will help too!\nSpectral Tiger Cub.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Tiger\"&gt;Spectral Tiger&lt;/a&gt; is the quintessential Loot card for collectors out there, and now they'll have a little kitten to add to their spectral menagerie. This companion pet comes with tiny little armor to match his size, and lets out a haunting meow when you click on him. Stop to check your mail and it will wait patiently for you, and then run to catch up to you when you head on your way after business has been attended to. As the rare Loot card of the expansion, this is one kitty that plenty of fans will be wanting to get their hands on!\nImpact.\nThe Scourgewar set had a significant impact to the TCG. Arguably it is considered the best set in the Scourgewar block, with many staples and meta-changers appearing, such as &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, Broderick Langforth, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Flint Shadowmoore, &lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20Oblivion%20%28item%29\"&gt;Edge of Oblivion (item)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corpse%20Explosion\"&gt;Corpse Explosion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Death%20Wish\"&gt;Death Wish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Plague\"&gt;Devouring Plague&lt;/a&gt;, and many more. The set focuses on playing allies that share the same class, preferably with your hero. This \"class matters\" focus is also represented in the class master allies, &lt;a href=\"Klannoc%20Macleod\"&gt;Klannoc Macleod&lt;/a&gt; for warriors, &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; for death knights, &lt;a href=\"Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; for rogues, and &lt;a href=\"Mor%27zul%20Bloodbringer\"&gt;Mor'zul Bloodbringer&lt;/a&gt; for warlocks. In addition, it introduced &lt;a href=\"Conqueror\"&gt;Conqueror&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Justicar\"&gt;Justicar&lt;/a&gt; allies, who have significant advantages over cards of another class. Masters and \"PvP\" allies of the remaining classes appear in the other two Scourgewar sets.\nIt also introduced the powerful keyword Death Rattle, which causes an effect when a card with the keyword enters a graveyard from anywhere. Many cards in this set also deal shadow damage or have the keyword Shadow Resistance, primarily for Limited play. Also introduced in this set are the majority of Nerubian Reputation allies, who get stronger when certain card types are in your graveyard. Among our Nerubian friends in this set is &lt;a href=\"Kilix%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Kilix the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt;. Profession masters are also introduced, though they are much more effective under the command of an old hero, as heroes now do not have professions.\nAs this was the first true set to include death knight heroes and abilities, all of the dual-class abilities can be used by death knights. This gives them an advantage in limited play, in addition to already having very powerful abilities in Army of the Dead and Corpse Explosion.\nBroderick Langforth is well known as being one of the most expensive cards in the game's history."}

In response, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, the son of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, was sent to investigate the plague along with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. They discovered that the infection spread through plagued grain and succeeded in killing Kel'Thuzad, but were unable to stop the plague from spreading. After discovering &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; had already been infected, Arthas ordered the purging of the city and suspended his mentor &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, along with the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, for refusing to carry out the order and did so himself. Arthas traveled to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to confront the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; who controlled the Scourge. With the power of the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas was able to defeat Mal'ganis but lost his soul in the process. He returned to Lordaeron and murdered his father King Terenas, then oversaw the undead overrun &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and the fall of the kingdom.\nArthas, now a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, led the Scourge in the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for the Burning Legion's invasion. Following the defeat of the Legion at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge became free from its control and Arthas returned to Lordaeron to declare himself king and scour the last remnants of humanity. However, the Lich King's powers began to weaken and so did his control over the undead. Arthas returned to Northrend and shattered the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, put on the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, and merged with the Lich King.\nPrelude.\nAfter their defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; was captured by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; for his failure. As punishment, the Deceiver destroyed Ner'zhul's body and tortured his spirit until he agreed to serve the Legion once again. His soul encased in a suit of armor which was then bound to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden hurled his creation towards &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; where it smashed into &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the first major player of the Third War, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was born. Once on Azeroth, the Lich King took control of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and he had the &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; take the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter preparing for many long months, Kel'Thuzad and his Cult of the Damned finally struck the first blow by releasing the plague of undeath upon Lordaeron.\nScourge of Lordaeron.\nDisturbance in the north.\nA rumor had started to travel around Lordaeron telling how a mysterious plague had gripped the northern lands, as the majority of Lordaeron's attention was focused on the Horde's flight and rebelling orc clans. When Medivh appeared before King &lt;a href=\"Terenas\"&gt;Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and told him to save his people, he must travel west, Terenas told him that he would remain here and defend his kingdom. To do so, he sent his own son &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who was dealing with the rebelling orcs with Sir &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, north to investigate. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; was sent from Dalaran to aid in the investigation.\nCult of the Damned.\nAfter joining &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Arthas discovered that &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;'s granaries were wrought with a plague that killed all who are infected (within a period of time) after they had encountered &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; in the town of &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; was the main distribution point for grain in the area, this meant that many other towns were in danger. As they fought their way through the infected city of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; they bore witness to a unique devastation like &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had never seen. They hunted down and attacked Kel'Thuzad for his crimes against the people. The necromancer told Arthas that he served a greater power, a dreadlord named &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, and that he was responsible for the Scourge. Enraged, Arthas vowed he would kill Mal'Ganis and they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to confront him after slaying the corrupted wizard.\nRise of the Scourge.\nWhile in &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas and Jaina's forces were attacked by legions of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas had Jaina search for Uther while he and his forces remained to protect the town from the Scourge. It was then he learned the truth behind the plague. The plague didn't just kill those infected, it turned them into the undead, and thus, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Before his army was defeated, Uther and his knights arrived and saved the town. Not long after this battle, Arthas was met by Medivh, who warned the prince to travel west to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Like his father, Arthas refused, saying his place was with his people. Jaina believed the prophet's words but Arthas would not be swayed to leave his kingdom. They continued to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the threat of the Scourge.\nCulling of Stratholme.\nUpon arriving at &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, they discovered that the grain had already been distributed amongst the townsfolk. Arthas, not wanting to deal with an entire army of undead, ordered Uther and his &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s to destroy the town. Uther was appalled by this, saying he wouldn't follow the order even if Arthas was the king. For his defiance, Arthas disbanded the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and called all those still loyal to Lordaeron to come with him. Uther took his followers and left, and Jaina quickly followed. Abandoned by his teacher and friend, Arthas continued to Stratholme to slaughter the town.\nUpon arrival, Arthas met Mal'Ganis himself. The two had a race of sorts for the lives of the town. Arthas wished to destroy them, Mal'Ganis wished to corrupt them. When the town was in ruin, Arthas demanded a final showdown with Mal'Ganis. Mal'Ganis, however, slipped away, vowing to meet him in Northrend.\nAfter the Culling, Jaina and Uther returned to Stratholme to bury the dead. Jaina was met by Medivh, who told her Arthas would only die if he went to Northrend. The prophet then told Jaina, as he had told everyone else, that she must travel west to Kalimdor, a request she answered to.\nAfter Stratholme was purged, some former paladins, now called &lt;a href=\"Deathlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Deathlords&lt;/a&gt;, committed the same heinous act in many other cities across Lordaeron. After years of constant war and suffering, some &lt;a href=\"Heretics\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt; also lost their sense of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the days since Prince Arthas took the fleet to Northrend, the Silver Hand continued to defend Lordaeron villages. They were stretched thin fighting the spread of the plague. However, the Scourge continued to grow, taking villages and its turned inhabitants, with a small help from &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; and his corrupted food supplies. When a village that &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Thomson\"&gt;Thomas Thomson&lt;/a&gt; was stationed in was turned, Thomas understood that Rivendare was a traitor and reported it to the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; paladins.\nRise of the death knight.\nAfter arriving in Northrend, Arthas discovered the brother of the dwarven king &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving at Northrend, Muradin's expedition was attacked by the undead and was cut off from the rest of the world. He had come to Northrend to obtain the runeblade &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. When word from Lordaeron called Arthas's men back home, the prince used &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; to burn their ships before turning his forces on the mercenaries. With no way to get home, he told his men that their only way home was to get the Frostmourne. When he finally found the blade, he and Muradin learned that the blade was cursed. Arthas accepted this curse and took the blade, though Muradin was believed to be killed in the process (he was knocked out with terrible amnesia). With the Frostmourne, Arthas lead an assault on the Scourge base where Mal'Ganis was stationed and killed the dreadlord. With the cause of his madness dead, Arthas fled to the wilderness of Northrend where he lost the rest of his humanity, becoming a &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. When he returned to the base camp, he slaughtered his men, raising them as mindless Scourge and death knights.\nAt the same time, the undead mysteriously vanished from the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the citizens thought that this meant Arthas had succeeded in destroying the Scourge in Northrend. In truth, the Lich King had ordered his forces to pull back in order to make the population believe that Arthas had defeated the undead and trick them into welcoming him back with open arms. Arthas returned to Lordaeron to get his just rewards. With the presence of &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;, the three enter &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; clocked. The people of Lordaeron doused them with rose paddles as they entered the throne room. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; greeted his son with open arms Arthas and, without a moment of consideration, slew his father. Soon, Capital City was engulfed by the undead and it fell soon after. During this time, Arthas ordered &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; to kill his &lt;a href=\"Vivian\"&gt;mother&lt;/a&gt; as an act of loyalty, an order that the death knight carried out by decapitating his mother. Following the murder of his father, Arthas journeyed to the grave of his fallen steed, &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, and raised him from the dead.\nWhen the Scourge attacked Tirisfal, the &lt;a href=\"Agamand\"&gt;Agamand&lt;/a&gt; family fortified their &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Mills\"&gt;mills&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Devlin%20Agamand\"&gt;Devlin&lt;/a&gt; betrayed his people and made a deal with the Scourge. After Capital City fell, the Scourge army swept across Lordaeron. Neighboring human and dwarven nations converged on Lordaeron to vanquish the Scourge. Even the elven &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, no longer an Alliance member, sent their priests to help defeat the undead. The Scourge was numerous and defeated any Alliance resistance. Ultimately, the Scourge took Lordaeron, but small pockets of Alliance resistance remained. In the meantime, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was gathering Lordaeronians to sail for &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; had to stay behind to defend those that couldn't get on the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; ships, as well as continue fighting against the Scourge. When &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; returned from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; with the mighty &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in hands, the Highlord was reported to be paring down the Scourge's numbers, and did so for several months.\nDespite this, in the following days, Arthas, under the orders of the Lich King, was given the task to bring the dead necromancer Kel'Thuzad back from the dead. To do so, Arthas had to take his remains to a place of magical power. Arthas killed his former mentor Uther in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; for the urn he was carrying. The urn carried the ashes of his father, to which Arthas simply disposed of and placed Kel'Thuzad's remains inside. The only magical nexus with the necessary power was the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, past &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, capital of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. To revive Kel'Thuzad, the Scourge would have to &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;burn Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs Andorhal fell, its desperate defenders, seeing no hope of rescue, had set the city ablaze so that the Scourge couldn't raise more warriors.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;destruction&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, the newly summoned &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; ordered his forces to gather in the heart of Lordaeron and crush any vestiges of the Alliance so that no one would follow them on Kalimdor.\nAftermath.\nEven with Arthas departing for Quel'Thalas the damage done to Lordaeron and the Scourge forces left behind ensured the land stayed with the dead. The devastating attack saw refugees fleeing west with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and heading south to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. However, life still remained within the continent as resistance movements against the Scourge were being created in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time survivors Knights of the Silver Hand &lt;a href=\"Halahk%20the%20Lifebringer\"&gt;Halahk the Lifebringer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dagren%20the%20Orcslayer\"&gt;Dagren the Orcslayer&lt;/a&gt; began to serve as a protect force for those that remained within the heart of Capital City.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;King Arthas&lt;/a&gt; would direct the Scourge (now free from Legion influence) to scour the last remnants of humanity from the Lordaeron. As such the Knights of the Silver Hand and their forces started to direct the human villagers to escape into the safety of the mountains. However, Arthas anticipating this had stationed his forces to block the mountain passes. Over a relatively small amount of time the Scourge under Arthas, Kel'thuzad, and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; would destroy the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Circle of Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Defenders%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Defenders of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Crippling%20Force\"&gt;Crippling Force&lt;/a&gt;. However, Dagren would survive and rally others to him and join &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and journey to Kalimdor.\nAt the same time a civil war within the undead (caused by the Lich King's weakening powers) would see the Alliance resistance enslaved by &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, and then entering into a partnership with the fledgling &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; after being freed. The Alliance resistance would ultimately be destroyed following the \"death\" of Balnazzar, leaving the Scarlet Crusade as the main resistance movement against the undead, both Scourge, and Forsaken, in the continent (the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; lower in number and just focused on Scourge).\nArthas returned to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; to reach the Lich King at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; as both were continuing to lose their powers. He raced against &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to destroy the Lich King. With the help of the crypt lord leader &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas was able to arrive at &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; from underground. After defeating both Illidan and Kael'thas, along with their forces, Arthas ascended to the top of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; where the Frozen Throne was located and shattered the Lich King's icy prison with Frostmourne. Arthas then picked up &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, placed it upon his head, and merged with the Lich King."}

They can track a day-old trail and snipe from the treetops with equal facility. Scouts often serve as guides for adventurers, if they are not out adventuring themselves. Though the scout is at home in the wild, they are more a guerrilla fighter than a defender of nature. Scouts are found in any race. No matter their region, from forests to mountains to swamps, all races need and train scouts as guilds and specialized fighters. Scouts are solitary and have somewhat individualistic natures.\nEpic scout.\nThe epic scout does not just master the wilderness \u2014 they control it. To enter their territory unbidden is to invite swift death from an unseen bullet or scything trap. The epic scout can track down and destroy his enemies with unnerving ease; to hide from them is impossible. As the epic scout excels at specialty offense and defense, they increase these capabilities as they advance. Stealth can be important to him as well. Almost all the abilities are useful to them. &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt; and constitution improve their fighting prowess, and dexterity is especially important if they wield ranged weapons. &lt;a href=\"Intelligence\"&gt;Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; provides more skills, while wisdom improves their healing ability and their chances to detect their foes. They freely choose to ignore charisma.\nSatyr scout.\nSatyr scouts are the antithesis of everything that night elf scouts stand for. While their hated night elf cousins fight with bows and use their abilities to tend the forests, satyr scouts prefer hand-to-hand combat, striking by surprise, and dominating nature for their demonic masters. Satyr scouts use wild healing selfishly, not bothering to aid another unless they get something out of it."}

Like other forest trolls, the Revantusks swore that one day they would have their revenge.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; gave the forest trolls that opportunity. &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; asked the trolls to ally themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In return, Doomhammer promised that the Horde would vanquish the high elves and assist the forest trolls in reestablishing the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the leader of all the forest trolls at the time, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; eventually accepted Doomhammer's offer. A few tribes of forest trolls joined their new allies on the battlefield, including the trolls in the Hinterlands. Together, they planned to attack &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt; before moving north.\nShortly thereafter, the Horde burned down the borderlands of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and slaughtered many &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; civilians. Furious at this wanton destruction of life, the elves subsequently committed all their resources to the war, which the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ultimately won.\nSeveral additional battles later, most of the vanquished &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were rounded up and placed in internment camps. In the war's disastrous aftermath, the Horde was shattered, and many forest trolls deserted their former orc allies without a moment's hesitation. The Revantusks had little choice other than to flee as well, for their numbers were far too few to liberate the captive orcs, particularly when the orcs themselves seemed uninterested in freedom. Because they continued to feel some loyalty toward the Horde, the Revantusks were the target of many attacks from other forest trolls. Eventually, the Revantusk tribe relocated to the coast of the Hinterlands, where they hoped to avoid further notice.\nThen the courageous orc &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; began reassembling a new &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He resolved that his people would return to their shamanistic traditions and establish a nation of their own. Word of the revitalized Horde and its noble goals soon reached the Revantusk trolls, who were still dwelling in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The news stirred the trolls' interest, and the tribe immediately dispatched its speediest runners to make contact with the orcs.\nThrall was wary of the trolls at first, but he came to see that the Revantusk trolls were unique among forest trolls in a fundamental way. The Revantusk tribe had never had much in the way of the fighters or resources, and so it had instead decided to specialize in the trickier art of negotiation. By the time they spoke with Thrall, the Revantusks had acquired a reputation for trustworthiness that was well deserved.\nThe trolls were impressed by Thrall and his dream. Even so, they remembered the recklessness and corruption of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the Revantusks declined to rejoin the Horde, but they did agree to a pact of friendship and mutual assistance.\nToday the Revantusk tribe continues to live in a village along the southeast coast of the Hinterlands. Due to the tribe's small size and the Revantusks' pact with Thrall, all other forest trolls regard the Revantusk trolls as weaklings and enemies. Similarly, the honorable Revantusks regard other forest trolls as traitors to the New Horde. A long-standing enmity exists between the Revantusk tribe and the Wildhammer clan of dwarves, who dwell in the Hinterlands and are considered enemies of the Horde.\nCataclysm.\nThe recent Cataclysm has seen &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Torntusk\"&gt;Elder Torntusk&lt;/a&gt;'s return to the Revantusk Village and the Revantusk tribe openly supporting the Horde. The Revantusk are battling the other forest troll tribes in the region and the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to claim the Hinterlands for themselves and the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Torntusk\"&gt;Primal Torntusk&lt;/a&gt; can be personally seen leading the Revantusk efforts in gaining control of &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20Speaker\"&gt;Revantusk Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. They are friendly to Horde players and say their tribe will always stand by the Horde.\nRelationships.\nThrall was not always so welcoming toward the forest trolls. He expressed disgust that forest trolls were ever considered a part of the Horde, he then killed several of them. This is rather uncharacteristic of Thrall, however, and may have been &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retconned&lt;/a&gt;. If it is still &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown what caused his change of heart, although it is conceivable that it was trolls in general that he despised, and thus the events with &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s jungle trolls may have changed his mind about forest trolls as well. It may also be possible that he simply feels disdain for forest trolls for abandoning the Horde, and that since the Revantusk have renewed their allegiance, he considers only their tribe worthy.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lard\"&gt;Lard&lt;/a&gt; helps protect the citizens of Revantusk village.\nAccording to the Forsaken, &lt;a href=\"Eliza%20Darkgrin\"&gt;Eliza Darkgrin&lt;/a&gt;, the Revantusk tribe is quite welcoming to the Forsaken as they have long spoken to their dead ancestors.\nWhilst their full relationship with elves is unknown, one of the authority figures in the tribe, &lt;a href=\"Huntsman%20Markhor\"&gt;Huntsman Markhor&lt;/a&gt; was known to work with Forsaken high elf, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt;. Velonara said that Markhor had been known to disagree with her and her views on arcane magics many times, but also understand their co-operation is necessary for the Horde.\nIn-game faction.\nRevantusk Trolls was a faction introduced to \"World of Warcraft\" in &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.5%20%28Release%20Notes%29\"&gt;patch 1.5&lt;/a&gt;. If a level 60 Horde player were to complete all the quests with the Revantusk trolls, they could reach 340/3000 with them. However, after &lt;a href=\"patch%201.11\"&gt;patch 1.11&lt;/a&gt;, the trolls were removed as a faction and are merely to Horde players, like the &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt; ogres.\nBefore patch 1.11, there were many rumors about the future of the Revantusk trolls as players speculated on what would become of the faction. The two most popular beliefs would be that the trolls would become a Battleground faction, in combat with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, while the other theory saw the trolls becoming a part of a new instance to be introduced to the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;. Neither rumor became reality as the faction was removed from \"World of Warcraft\".\nThe Wildhammers ended up as part of the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; battleground but despite the great enmity between the Wildhammers and the Revantusks, the reintroduced &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; takes the place as the Horde faction, possibly because the Revantusk are too small or they just have no plight with these Wildhammers as their home is in the Hinterlands.\nIn the RPG.\nThrall has been in communication with the Revantusk forest trolls, who agreed to a tentative alliance with the Horde. They find it hard to relate to the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; trolls."}

It applies a &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; which enhances the effectiveness of other rogue abilities against the target.\nUsage.\nRevealing Strike deals less damage per energy than &lt;a href=\"Sinister%20Strike\"&gt;Sinister Strike&lt;/a&gt;, so its primary use is to apply its debuff, which increases the &lt;a href=\"combo%20point\"&gt;combo point&lt;/a&gt; generation of Sinister Strike; the damage of &lt;a href=\"Eviscerate\"&gt;Eviscerate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rupture\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Tempest\"&gt;Crimson Tempest&lt;/a&gt;; and the duration of &lt;a href=\"Kidney%20Shot\"&gt;Kidney Shot&lt;/a&gt;. In almost all cases, combat-specced rogues should make sure the Revealing Strike debuff is up on their target before using any of these abilities, and remember to reapply it on new targets.\nRevealing Strike is irrelevant to &lt;a href=\"Slice%20and%20Dice\"&gt;Slice and Dice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Recuperate\"&gt;Recuperate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fan%20of%20Knives\"&gt;Fan of Knives&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of other abilities. Therefore, rogues should delay using Revealing Strike if they plan to use any of those next, since the debuff will be wasted while performing them. &lt;a href=\"White%20damage\"&gt;White damage&lt;/a&gt; is also unaffected by it, so rogues will gain some benefit by &lt;a href=\"resource%20pooling\"&gt;energy pooling&lt;/a&gt; before resuming a Revealing and Sinister Strike rotation, allowing the debuff to last through the highest possible number of Sinister Strikes and offensive finishers.\nNote that the combo point generation aspect of Revealing Strike is based on random chance, so rogues may see strings of good or bad luck when using Sinister Strike on debuffed targets. In terms of combo point generation, having the debuff up on a Sinister Strike is only \"worth\" 1/5 of a Strike on average, or 10 energy - a significant amount in the long run, but not a disaster if missed a few times. Finishing moves, on the other hand, gain a much larger and reliable advantage, so rogues should \"never\" use a finisher on a target without the debuff, unless the finisher alone is enough to kill the target outright.\nWhen using Sinister Strike to finish off a target that will die very quickly, it may not be worthwhile to use Revealing Strike, since most of the debuff's duration would go unused, and the chance that a single or even a couple strikes would have generated points is low. Revealing Strike may also be better ignored when using Crimson Tempest, depending on the number and priority of targets, since only the debuffed target would be affected."}

Further secrets of Lo'Gosh's past are revealed and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; proves far more powerful \u2014 and more vulnerable \u2014 than any, but &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt;, had suspected.\nPlot.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Wavecutter\"&gt;Wavecutter&lt;/a&gt;\", the private vessel of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, makes its way across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, carrying Lo'Gosh, Broll, and Valeera to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. During the voyage, Broll and Valeera banter about having to bow or curtsey for \"his royalness\" King Lo'Gosh, who is unamused. Lo'Gosh reflects that despite all that Jaina has told him, his past is still only a series of disconnected images. He's not sure he wants to be King Varian, and if he had a choice, he would choose to remain as a simple gladiator. However, as he has a son and a people who need him, his duty is clear. Valeera points out that Broll seems less angry than before, and he recounts his and Lo'Gosh's quest to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and restore Broll's inner balance.\nMeanwhile, deep in the ocean, a group of naga led by &lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; spot and recognize \"Wavecutter\". Morgala points out that the vessel will likely be carrying treasure or important travelers that can be captured and ransomed. Either way, the ship will pay for trespassing through naga-controlled waters.\n\"Wavecutter\"'s voyage is stopped in its tracks as the ship becomes enveloped in a whirlpool and naga warriors begin surging out of the water and onto the ship. While the three companions battle the attackers, Broll and Valeera both point out that it's like their gladiator career in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; all over again, except for less money. Enraged that her best warriors are losing against two &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, Morgala summons a giant &lt;a href=\"couatl\"&gt;couatl&lt;/a&gt; from the deep and begins using her magical trident to launch &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energy bursts at the ship. Valeera notices this, but Broll tells her to stay away and warns her of the dangers of absorbing arcane energy.\nMoments later, however, as Morgala begins charging a spell, Valeera jumps off the side of the ship, grabs the trident out of the siren's hand, and sinks beneath the waves, where she begins fighting more naga with the trident in one hand and her dagger in the other. Broll jumps in after her. Lo'Gosh remains aboard the ship, where the couatl attemps and fails to kill him by spitting deadly venom. In the water, the naga grab Broll \u2014 who has shifted into &lt;a href=\"Aquatic%20Form\"&gt;Aquatic Form&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and begin pulling him down towards the seafloor. To save him, Valeera absorbs the trident's arcane energy to propel herself downwards, allowing her to kill Broll's captors and swim back with him toward the surface.\nWhile the couatl is flying above \"Wavecutter\", Lo'Gosh hurls a harpoon that buries itself in the creature's torso, killing it and causing it to crash onto the ship, destroying a portion of the deck. Moments later, Morgala jumps of out of the water and begins attacking the human with her sword. She states that she recognizes him from having captured him once before and is amazed that such a \"passive grub\" could find the will to wield a weapon, much to Lo'Gosh's confusion.\nMeanwhile, Broll and Valeera breach the surface. Transforming back into his caster form, Broll snaps Morgala's trident in half and admonishes Valeera for recklessly tapping into arcane energy to save him. Shifting into &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;Flight Form&lt;/a&gt;, he picks up Valeera and begins carrying her back to the ship, where Lo'Gosh and Morgala are still dueling. Morgala suddenly infuses her sword with lightning and slashes Lo'Gosh across the face, giving him his distinctive crossed facial scars while simultaneously cutting open the slave collar around his neck. Lo'Gosh responds by grabbing Morgala around the throat, but as soon as he touches the siren, he experiences another rush of memories: he sees himself being attacked by naga on an island, being dragged from a ship bound for &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, sheddding tears at his &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral, and standing before &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s nobility at his coronation (with a &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;dark-haired woman&lt;/a&gt; behind him).\nBack on the ship, Lo'Gosh freezes as the memories wash over him. Morgala once again calls him a \"weakling\" and a \"shadow of a man\" and prepares to strike the killing blow. At the last moment, however, the human recovers. Yelling that he is the king of Stormwind and that \"nothing\" will keep him from his people, he cuts through Morgala's torso with a single blow, cleaving her body in half. Frightened, the remaining naga jump off the deck and disappear back into the water just as Broll and Valeera land on the ship. Lo'Gosh tells his companions that while he may be Varian the king, he is still Lo'Gosh, champion of the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Ring\"&gt;Crimson Ring&lt;/a&gt; and a friend to his friends. He tells them that they need to make repairs and resume the journey to the Eastern Kingdoms as quickly as possible, for he sees storm clouds gathering on the horizon.\nA fresh breeze brings a chill in the air. As Valeera pulls her cloak more tightly about her, she glances skyward and sees for a moment something like a &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;great, gray wolf&lt;/a&gt; blotting out the sun."}

They look similar to floating suits of crude armor. They also wield large maces and carry giant shields. The most notable revenant was &lt;a href=\"the%20Guardian\"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt;, protector of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Some are soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThey are hateful &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; creatures who are outside the domain of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s control. Bonded to base &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s, these phantom creatures live only to rage and use their powers for destruction. They have the ability to cast elemental magics according to their type. Although undead, Revenants have no affiliation with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as they have some sort of innate immunity to Ner'zhul's psychic control over undead. They remain neutral in the conflict between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nRevenants are minor &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; creatures who once served as foot soldiers for the malefic &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; when the world was young. When the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s defeated the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and chained them beneath the cold earth, the wicked revenants and their greater elemental cousins were banished to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Locked away from the world they once ruled, the fire of the elementals' hatred for the titans and their creations burned with increasing intensity. As the millennia passed, reckless mortal wizards began to summon elementals back into the physical world. Free at last, many revenants struck out against the mortals that had summoned them and set out to forge their own destiny among their native elements in the world. These evil beings exist only to inflict strife and sow elemental chaos. Though they have limited intelligence, their sheer hatred and will to destroy make them fearful opponents when encountered in the wilds of the world. Many still live on the Elemental Plane.\nNote that the RPG appears to attempt to reconcile their naming/element scheme in Warcraft III with the current system of four (and only four) distinct elemental factions:"}

It is a land of gothic spires and dark secrets, and no &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; wishes to end up here. Souls sent here by the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; tend to be prideful or have some other flaw preventing them from serving in or going to one of the other realms, and they come here to atone for their sins and hopefully be redeemed, as the alternative is being cast into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. It is the duty of the vampiric &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; to prepare the souls\u2014through unimaginable torment. Although the realm is mostly shrouded in darkness, there are parts of Revendreth where the Light has broken through the clouds and seared the earth. Many of the souls in Revendreth are vulnerable to the Light and have been chained up in these areas.\nDescription.\n\"A realm of looming keeps and gothic villages, Revendreth is home to the venthyr, the harvesters of sin. The wretched souls who arrive here may find penance for their misdeeds... or merely indulge the appetites of their keepers.\"\n\"Souls burdened with prodigious pride in life are sent to Revendreth at their end. Anima is tormented from them to feed the appetites of their keepers.\" \"Learned humility was supposed to be the destiny of the souls entrusted to our care. I fear those archaic ways no longer have a place within Revendreth.\" Pride: It is the principal reason mortal souls are delivered unto Revendreth, we exist to relieve them of that troublesome sin and to be blessed by their anima.\"\nThe major vista of the region is &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Nathria\"&gt;its gigantic castle&lt;/a&gt;, sprawling over a misty forest. The castle's entry ward itself is suffering disrepair, as are the buildings and structures across the grounds, as the region is deprived of new &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s and their precious &lt;a href=\"Anima\"&gt;Anima&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sinstone\"&gt;Sinstone&lt;/a&gt;s, gravestones with the soul's crimes listed upon it, litter each pathway. Souls sent here can etch these sins off their stones over time as they are prepared for the afterlife by the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Ward\"&gt;fog-filled forest&lt;/a&gt; is where the venthyr schedule hunts on tortured souls, sending them out with a false sense of hope and security, then track them down and \"humble\" them. The catacombs are where souls are locked away for eons until sufficiently humbled to warrant being transferred to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Atonement\"&gt;Halls of Atonement&lt;/a&gt;. There all souls must go through the Ritual of Absolution at least once to be cleansed of sin fully, and the Ritual of Judgment for their final fate to be decided. Some souls, however, are kept in Castle Nathria for the nobles to enjoy. Another notable area is the &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Ward\"&gt;Ember Ward&lt;/a&gt;, found on the western side of the region. There the Light has actually broken through and is extremely harmful to Revendreth's residents. The crumbled walls and fragmented landscape is due to the anima drought and &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe lowlands Revendreth is where &lt;a href=\"Sorrowvine\"&gt;Sorrowvine&lt;/a&gt; is found, a dark and evil vine, used by the Covenants for various ends, such as potions, venoms, and spells.\nThroughout the zone, &lt;a href=\"Sinrunner%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Sinrunners&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Dredbat%20Statue\"&gt;Dredbat Statue&lt;/a&gt;s are found to provide ground/flying transport along fixed paths for 5 &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Ruby\"&gt;Infused Ruby&lt;/a&gt;. There are also various &lt;a href=\"Carriage%20%28Revendreth%29\"&gt;Carriages&lt;/a&gt; throughout the zone that go on a fixed circular path that allows jumping on and off at your discretion. If you join the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, you will also gain access to their Transportation Network of Blood Mirrors that connect &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt; with various elevators throughout the zone.\nRevendreth is lorded over by the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Harvesters\"&gt;Harvesters&lt;/a&gt;, seven venthyr who were given special medallions by &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;. These medallions give each of them partial control over the realm and its denizens, and with enough anima even some control over the very fabric of the Shadowlands.\nGeography.\nGetting around.\nThere are multiple transport systems in Revendreth. To use some of them you must have &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Ruby\"&gt;Infused Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, which can be collected after completing &lt;a href=\"The%20Endmire%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Endmire (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo be able to more readily see and find the ones that use Infused Rubies, the &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Foreman%20Scug\"&gt;Foreman Scug&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonevigil%20Overlook\"&gt;Stonevigil Overlook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mats\"&gt;Mats&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Mad\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Mad&lt;/a&gt; sells a &lt;a href=\"Stolen%20Map%20of%20Infused%20Ruby%20Network\"&gt;Stolen Map of Infused Ruby Network&lt;/a&gt; for 5 &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Ruby\"&gt;Infused Ruby&lt;/a&gt; that lasts one day and the &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Map%20of%20Infused%20Ruby%20Network\"&gt;Enchanted Map of Infused Ruby Network&lt;/a&gt; for 100 &lt;a href=\"Infused%20Ruby\"&gt;Infused Ruby&lt;/a&gt; that is permanent.

As a war mount, he has been trained to act counter to his instincts. In battle, he serves as an extension of Anduin and an additional weapon, running down and trampling enemies, unlike regular horses who instinctively shy away from the scent of blood and avoid stepping on other creatures.\nAnduin rode Reverence to meet with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; just prior to the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and later rode the steed into war during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.

His family was slaughtered by the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, and Revil held on to an old doll as a memento for a time. He believes the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; guides his life and is extremely devout in his faith but is not as sympathetic as other priests and has a surly demeanor: for example, refusing to heal a soldier who got stabbed in an argument over food in order to teach him a moral lesson and also chiding him for his selfishness. Many have claimed him to be the angriest priest they've ever met.\nHistory.\nBeginnings and Ends.\nRevil was assigned by &lt;a href=\"Archbishop%20Benedictus\"&gt;Archbishop Benedictus&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve an artifact stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;, last seen in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;. His chest was scarred with three horizontal claw marks and he appears to be concerned about &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;. He has a small shrine in his home, where he places a torn ragdoll and prays for strength while vowing to take revenge against an unspecified foe, though most likely alluding to the worgen who slaughtered his family.\nDark Riders.\nHis search for the &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Cloak of Purity&lt;/a&gt; led him to &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; where he upset several members of the Westfall Militia after taking their kitchen, and met a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt; who was also looking for a missing artifact. Karlain warned him that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt; were acquiring artifacts and proposed that they join forces as their missing artifacts may be targeted by the same group. Revil followed Karlain to meet with his contact &lt;a href=\"Tannos\"&gt;Tannos&lt;/a&gt; but they were attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Tannos' use of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Azora\"&gt;Hand of Azora&lt;/a&gt; in the battle lured the Dark Riders to them. The Dark Riders killed Tannos and stole his artifact. Revil took a horse and followed the Dark Riders in pursuit.\nKarlain would later meet up with Revil again in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; where Revil has been aiding the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt; in investigating the Wolf Cult. Revil and a pious man named &lt;a href=\"Ambrose\"&gt;Ambrose&lt;/a&gt; aided Karlain in searching for his son. Revil had his personal motives for doing so, however, as the same Wolf Cult who abducted &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt; was the same &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; who murdered his family. The party of three tracked Mardigan and the Wolf Cult to &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt; where they witnessed Mardigan being made into a worgen. This caused Karlain to attack the worgen cult and his companions joined in the fray. The party was able to slay the vile beasts and with Karlain's help, Revil was able to exact vengeance on the worgen leader &lt;a href=\"Gervase\"&gt;Gervase&lt;/a&gt;. Their victory came at a cost however as Ambrose was killed in the foray and it was too late to prevent Mardigan from transforming into a worgen. Revil placed a doll by the corpse of his hated enemy and took the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Though he accomplished his quest for revenge he still felt unsatisfied. In an inn he encountered &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; who told him the origins of the Dark Riders. He offered him a new quest to satisfy his desire for purpose: aid him in reclaiming stolen artifacts from the Dark Riders.\nRevil reunited with Karlain and his son and used them as bait to lure the Dark Riders into his ambush. When the Dark Riders attacked them, Revil called on the Night Watch Militia and Brink, the rogue gnome, to bolster their party. When the battle turned unfavorable for the Dark Riders, one of the Dark Riders teleported the whole party to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Revil Kost wandered off and found the Cloak of Purity, the very thing he needed to ward off the &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemous&lt;/a&gt; tower's &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. He returned to aid his companions in fending off the Dark Riders. With the Cloak of Purity he was able to see the terrified human face of a Dark Rider and the location of the hoarded stolen artifacts. Both him and Brink tracked the artifacts into a hidden trophy room but it was being guarded by &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt;. The Night Watch and Revil engaged the creature while Brink used a magical amulet to send the Night Watch, The Curator, and the Dark Riders two hours in the past where the events that led them to battle one another never occurred. The gnome and the priest regrouped with Karlain and Mardigan but a false vision had caused Mardigan to become feral and hostile. Revil placed the Cloak of Purity on Mardigan and showed Mardigan the truth about how his mother died, thus calming him down and restoring the family bond between father and son. With the danger passed and their family bond restored, Karlain teleported the party out of the tower. Karlain stated his intention to search for a cure for his son which will require more investigation on the Wolf Cult. Seeing as Revil looked like a man in need of a purpose, the family invites him to journey with them on their quest. Brink, who had acquired their stolen artifacts, gave Karlain back the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Azora\"&gt;Hand of Azora&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact to Revil, and the Scythe of Elune to an unknown night elf.\nLegion.\nRevil Kost continued to track the Dark Riders. Soon after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, he was met by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Manor Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; who sought an artifact to battle the Burning Legion. Revil agreed to help them retrieve it from the Dark Riders, on the condition that he be allowed to take the other artifacts and deliver them to their rightful owners. Together they journeyed through &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;, checking &lt;a href=\"Ariden%27s%20Camp\"&gt;Ariden's Camp&lt;/a&gt; and eventually entering the &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20Catacombs\"&gt;catacombs beneath Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, where they defeated &lt;a href=\"Ariden\"&gt;Ariden&lt;/a&gt; and retrieved the artifacts.\nRevil could also be found in the &lt;a href=\"Purple%20Parlor\"&gt;Purple Parlor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. He was likely there to visit Karlain, as Mardigan was nearby.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he came back to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, now occupied by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and returned the Cloak of Purity after availing himself of its protection as he hunted the Dark Riders.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nIf we wish to complete our goals, it is clear we must work together, &lt;class&gt;.\nLet us not waste any more time."}

Revith did not particularly want to be chieftain, so he harbored no resentment toward the new arrival. In fact, M\u2019Nath slew several troggs before they ransacked Revith\u2019s personal treasury, so the Dark Iron respected the new chief. Since the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt; attack, Revith carries all his personal belongings with him. Revith is cruel, cunning and selfish. He savors bloodshed so long as it does not put him in danger. He is particularly fond of his &lt;a href=\"rings%20of%20ghostly%20duels\"&gt;rings of ghostly duels&lt;/a&gt; and has contacts that allow him to acquire more such rings cheaply. Revith is ugly, with thick scars crossing his face and a tangled, patchwork beard. Revith lost an ear to his clan's &lt;a href=\"dire%20lion\"&gt;dire lion&lt;/a&gt; during the animal\u2019s capture and hated the lion. He has a lizard familiar named &lt;a href=\"Sneak%20%28RPG%29\"&gt;Sneak&lt;/a&gt;. He was once attacked by a group of adventurers in his chambers, and forced to defend himself. After sustaining injuries he attempted to flee. Its unclear if he survived or not, but rumors persist that he may have survived and continues to plague the heroes in revenge."}

When completing a quest, the player only sees items that are made for them, out of the dozen or so possibilities. This does however mean if the reward is not something you want (an upgrade) you won't be able to pick the item worth the most gold in order to sell to a vendor as players were able to do prior to this expansion.\nThe dynamic rewards take both class and specialization into account. For example, protection warriors see dodge/parry plate, while arms and fury warriors see crit/haste plate. Thus, sometimes it is possible to see a different reward by activating a different spec."}

Several times you are assaulted by &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20of%20the%20Past\"&gt;ghosts of the past&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually you find enough pieces of the doll that you are able to put it back together for the lost little girl.\nPamela tells you about the two swords that her daddy kept: one for fighting men, and one for fighting animals. Some time he came back without his animal sword. Pamela asks you to find it, so when her daddy comes home he will be pleased.\nYou find the sword in the (ghostly) body of a wolf. Defeating the wolf, you return with the sword.\nOnce she has the sword, though, she thinks better of playing with it and asks you to take it to her uncle Carlin.\nCarlin takes the news of Pamela's death hard when presented with the sword. Still, he thinks that this 'strange gnome' (&lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;) who arrived a short while ago might be able to help change Joseph's fate.\nRelics of the past.\nChromie sets three tasks before you.\nThe (extended) annals tell of the how &lt;a href=\"Horgus%20the%20Ravager\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed in the foothills north of &lt;a href=\"Crown%20Guard%20Tower\"&gt;Crown Guard Tower&lt;/a&gt;, and how his skull remains there. The fabled sword of &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20the%20Black\"&gt;Marduk the Black&lt;/a&gt; was looted then abandoned near the road, southeast of the tower. Chromie asks you to bring them.\nYou travel to the foothills, and find a battle going on, a remembrance of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; being reenacted by ghosts. Nearby, you locate the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Horgus\"&gt;Skull of Horgus&lt;/a&gt;. Taking it, you note that the ghosts disperse.\nNext, you follow the road and come across the sword. And again, the ghosts disperse as you retrieve the item.\nChromie is glad to have the relics, telling you that they retain memories of the Scourge forces at Darrowshire.\nIn addition to those relics of the Villains, Carlin also asked you to retrieve relics from the heroes. In particular, the &lt;a href=\"Extended%20Annals%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Extended Annals of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Davil%27s%20Libram\"&gt;Libram of Davil Lightfire&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Redpath%27s%20Shield\"&gt;shield of Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt;.\nCarlin holds the annals, which describe how the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; took Davil's libram to &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. The shield was apparently broken near &lt;a href=\"Gahrron%27s%20Withering\"&gt;Gahrron's Withering&lt;/a&gt; and left there. Between then and now, though, the residents of &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt; managed to obtain both the libram and the shield.\nThe Marris Stead, when you arrive, has some ghostly hounds that bother you as you find the libram and shield, but they are easily dispatched.\nChromie sends you after the skulls of 5 of the scourge who participated in the battle. To properly identify them, Chromie gives you a crystal that will identify the proper skulls.\nThe fact that you have to demolish &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Champion\"&gt;Scourge Champion&lt;/a&gt;s to get the skulls is merely a bonus. It takes a while, but eventually you do find enough skulls for Chromie.\nReliving the past.\nChromie puts a spell upon the relics, and gives you instructions. It seems that you will take part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;! You are to place the relic bundle in the center of Darrowshire, whereupon the spirits of Darrowshire will rise again and relive the battle.\nYour instructions are:\nRedpath became corrupted, therefore he \"had to become corrupted\", you could not prevent that. But you could, and do, limit the damage he causes, and even save Darrowshire in the process. For now, or at least for certain values of \"now\".\nYou return to the ghost of Pamela, who tells you she heard the fighting end. As you talk with her, the ghost of Joseph Redpath comes to take her in his arms.\nYou talk with the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Pamela%20Redpath\"&gt;Pamela Redpath&lt;/a&gt; again. She tells you her &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;daddy&lt;/a&gt; gaver her a key to give to you, that opens a chest behind the house.\nYou open the chest, and find some powerful magical items, mementos of the recent events."}

Eventually, she settled in &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt;. She misses her sister, and the rest of her family, and asks you to see what became of them.\nThe ghost of &lt;a href=\"Marlene%20Redpath\"&gt;Marlene Redpath&lt;/a&gt; still haunts a home in &lt;a href=\"Sorrow%20Hill\"&gt;Sorrow Hill&lt;/a&gt;, near the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Andorhal\"&gt;Ruins of Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;, she hid young Pamela in a building just outside of the town itself. She does not, though, know what happened to her. She, too, asks you to look for her in the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;.\nUncovering the past.\nYou find that like her aunt, Pamela is now just a ghost. The building she was hidden in was burned, much like the rest of Darrowshire when it fell to &lt;a href=\"Horgus%20the%20Ravager\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20the%20Black\"&gt;Marduk the Black&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow, she simply wants you to find her dolly for her.\nYou go looking through the ruins.

While completing this is not required for the quest chain, you will be seeing Carlin Redpath soon anyway. And as mentioned above, you may have met Marlene before.\nMarlene wishes greatly that &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt; could be with his daughter again, but the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; twisted him into a monster. However, she has heard of a gnome with strange powers, currently residing in the ruined inn in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, one of the few buildings still \"mostly\" intact. She directs you to a monument to Joseph, in the adjoining graveyard, where his &lt;a href=\"Joseph%27s%20Wedding%20Ring\"&gt;wedding ring&lt;/a&gt; was placed in lieu of his body, destroyed during his defeat.\nSome connection still exists between the wedding ring and Joseph's spirit, as you hear it call to you (\"Save me\") as you remove the ring from the monument.\nBattling your way through the scourge haunting Andorhal, you finally meet &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; in the ruined inn. She reveals that she is a \"Temporal Investigator\" from the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, having taken on the aspect of a gnome to make people more comfortable.\nShe can't help Joseph Redpath in the here-and-now, but she does tell you that there may be a way to change his past. For that, though, she needs to learn what his past was. In the Andorhal city hall (the OTHER building still mostly standing), a copy of the &lt;a href=\"Annals%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Annals of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; can be found.\nYou search through the books littering the city hall floor and find quite a few that have been trapped in some mystic way, summoning &lt;a href=\"Decrepit%20Guardian\"&gt;Decrepit Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. \"(Hmm... opposition to changing the past? This promises that such change IS possible...)\" Eventually, you do find the Annals for Chromie, though.\nChromie casts a spell upon the book, adding pages describing the eventual fates of all the major participants. One of the new passages tells of &lt;a href=\"Carlin%20Redpath\"&gt;Carlin Redpath&lt;/a&gt;, a surviving member of the family. Chromie asks you to take the book to him.\nYou meet with him at &lt;a href=\"Lights%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Lights Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; in the eastern reaches of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems that news has not reached him yet, as he asks how &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glade\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; fares... You show him the book, and it's a new annex. He is astounded and feels he must find the truth of it.\nRelics of the past.\n&lt;a href=\"Carlin%20Redpath\"&gt;Carlin Redpath&lt;/a&gt; sets two tasks before you.\nThe (extended) annals tell of how the body of &lt;a href=\"Horgus%20the%20Ravager\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt; was thrown into a lake north of &lt;a href=\"Corin%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Corin's Crossing&lt;/a&gt;, and the fabled sword of &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20the%20Black\"&gt;Marduk the Black&lt;/a&gt; was shattered and lost in a gorge west of Corin's Crossing. Carlin asks you to bring those to him.\nYou travel to the lake, and find a battle going on, a remembrance of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; being reenacted by ghosts. Nearby, you locate the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Horgus\"&gt;Skull of Horgus&lt;/a&gt;. Taking it, you note that the ghosts disperse.\nNext, you explore the chasms west of Corin's Crossing and find more ghostly marauders wandering about. You locate the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sword%20of%20Marduk\"&gt;Shattered Sword of Marduk&lt;/a&gt; and again note that the ghosts disperse as you retrieve the pieces.\nCarlin is glad to have the relics and confirms that there is indeed some sort of power remaining in them. They also bring back memories of dark times...\nIn addition to those relics of the Villains, Carlin also asked you to retrieve relics from the heroes. In particular, the &lt;a href=\"Davil%27s%20Libram\"&gt;Libram of Davil Lightfire&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Redpath%27s%20Shield\"&gt;shield of Joseph Redpath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe libram, you learn, was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. They study it often, looking to draw strength from Davil's writings. They are... loath to surrender it. Some blood is shed, and lives lost, in the discussion that follows. You prevail, though. Leaving Hearthglen, you find yourself haunted by a Darrowshire Poltergeist, recalling the dangers of Horgus and Marduk.\nThe shield, Carlin tells you, was broken near &lt;a href=\"Gahrron%27s%20Withering\"&gt;Gahrron's Withering&lt;/a&gt; west of &lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;. Easily enough you locate the shield, though the scourge influence is strong near that farm. You dispatch several scourge-tainted spirits, and walk away with the broken shield.\nCarlin has told Chromie of the relics you have gathered and tells you of the next thing she needs for her spell: the skulls of 5 of the scourge who participated in the battle. To properly identify them, Chromie has given Carlin (who passes to you) a crystal that will identify the proper skulls.\nThe fact that you have to demolish &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Champion\"&gt;Scourge Champion&lt;/a&gt;s to get the skulls is merely a bonus. It takes a while, but eventually you do find enough skulls for Chromie, and return to Carlin with them.\nChromie has asked for the relics (including the skulls, naturally), and Carlin has bundled them up for you to take to her.\nReliving the past.\nChromie puts a spell upon the relics and gives you instructions. It seems that you will take part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Darrowshire\"&gt;Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;! You are to place the relic bundle in the center of Darrowshire, whereupon the spirits of Darrowshire will rise again and relive the battle.\nYour instructions are:\nRedpath became corrupted, therefore he \"had to become corrupted\", you could not prevent that. But you could, and do, limit the damage he causes, and even save Darrowshire in the process.\nYou talk with the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Pamela%20Redpath\"&gt;Pamela Redpath&lt;/a&gt; again. She tells you her &lt;a href=\"Joseph%20Redpath\"&gt;daddy&lt;/a&gt; said the fighting is over and he will be home soon. Her daddy told her to welcome you, should you stop by, so she made &lt;a href=\"Tea%20with%20Sugar\"&gt;tea&lt;/a&gt;.\nHer daddy also told her to thank you, and give you a key, that opens a chest behind the house.\nYou open the chest and find some powerful magical items."}

After the Legion was defeated, Rexxar served on the front lines in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, and later answered &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s call to arms in the uprising that deposed Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe wars.\nRexxar was one of the Horde warriors, a fruit from the union between &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. Rexxar was originally part of the pacifist &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;, based on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, under the watchful guard of his father, &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;. Unwelcome by both the full-blooded orcs and ogres in the area, the Mok'Nathal were secular and isolationist, wishing little else but to be left to their own devices. But their pacifist ways gave him no reason to stay, and in addition, Rexxar believed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; could help the mok'nathal find water and food. However, in time Rexxar would learn the Horde's purpose was not noble.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; considered annihilating the mok'nathal but stayed his hand. Rexxar convinced Blackhand to spare his people. Rexxar left through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The beastmaster was accompanied by a large black wolf, &lt;a href=\"Haratha\"&gt;Haratha&lt;/a&gt;, his loyal companion. Rexxar fought in several battles, including the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;last one in the Black Morass&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Horde's defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Rexxar briefly returned to Draenor. When &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; launched his own invasion of Azeroth to retrieve certain artifacts, Rexxar was stationed with &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; on the Azerothian side of the Dark Portal. He remained in the Horde's service until just after the destruction of Draenor and the second destruction of the Dark Portal. Rexxar grew sickened by the senseless killing that the orcish race seemed to favor, and particularly the constant betrayals \u2014 first by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and then by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. His resolve was further weakened when &lt;a href=\"Haratha\"&gt;Haratha&lt;/a&gt; was drained of its life essences by an orcish warlock when the wolf lept in front of the warlock's spell to protect his master. Rexxar slew the warlock but had lost his companion. He followed &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his band of survivors through the Dark Portal to Azeroth, and when discussions started on what to do next Rexxar proposed to live a peaceful life in a small piece of land where the Alliance would never find them. Grom stated that orcs are supposed to conquer, and he was never willing to leave the Alliance in peace. Enraged, Rexxar declared that he would only trust beasts from thereon out, and left the Horde to wander the world on which he was now stranded.\nThrough his journeys in the wilderness of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, he came to find a small cub next to its &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Bear%20Corpse\"&gt;dead mother&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ravenwind\"&gt;Ruins of Ravenwind&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing as they both were alone, Rexxar took the cub with him and named her &lt;a href=\"Misha\"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they traveled to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, where they roamed the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; away from civilization. But his journeys had seen nothing but wars amongst the so-called \"civilized\" creatures.\nFounding of Durotar and the new Horde.\nUpon one of his journeys, however, he encountered &lt;a href=\"Mogrin\"&gt;Mogrin&lt;/a&gt;, an orc warrior who came under attack by a group of &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;s. Rexxar tried to help the orc, but the quilboar struck a fatal blow, and the warrior fell. In his last wish, Mogrin asked Rexxar to deliver a message to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, the orc &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, in the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and to keep Mogrin's death an honorable one. Rexxar agreed and made the journey to Orgrimmar.\nWhen he arrived, he found Thrall and delivered the message, and Thrall invited him to stay a while, mentioning that this land was as much Rexxar's as it was his own. Insisting to earn his keep, Rexxar volunteered to help out around the city. He visited &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrel\"&gt;Nazgrel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, who commissioned him to retrieve &lt;a href=\"Shimmerweed\"&gt;Shimmerweed&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, kill the &lt;a href=\"harpy\"&gt;harpy&lt;/a&gt; queen &lt;a href=\"Bloodfeather\"&gt;Bloodfeather&lt;/a&gt;, and collapse the &lt;a href=\"Kobold%20Mining%20Column\"&gt;Kobold Mining Column&lt;/a&gt;s, respectively. He also received the help of &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also encountered on his journeys a jovial &lt;a href=\"brewmaster\"&gt;brewmaster&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and killed a powerful &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Noggrin%20Onetooth\"&gt;Noggrin Onetooth&lt;/a&gt;. He helped an orc &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Morg%20Wolfsong\"&gt;Morg Wolfsong&lt;/a&gt; regain his honor by killing the orc &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who had killed his party.\nAfter he had helped out Thrall's friends, Rexxar was sent to &lt;a href=\"Gar%27thok\"&gt;Gar'thok&lt;/a&gt;'s outpost where the orc surveyed the coast for activity. Rexxar fought his way to the observatory nearby and found a suspicious amount of human activity along the coast. Rexxar reported his findings to Thrall, who then sent Nazgrel with Rexxar back to Gar'thok's outpost.\nRexxar made a short detour to meet Drek'Thar at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"far%20seer\"&gt;far seer&lt;/a&gt; found the &lt;a href=\"thunder%20lizard\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt;s driven mad. Upon further investigation, they found a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"lumber%20mill\"&gt;lumber mill&lt;/a&gt; where many trees had been harvested. Rexxar was ready to destroy the mill, but Drek'Thar forbade it, citing a non-aggression treaty with the humans. Rexxar was forced to put the maddened thunder lizards down before they caused any more harm.\nUpon arrival at Gar'thok's outpost, Nazgrel and Rexxar found it razed by the humans, and so followed the trail of blood back to a human camp on the coast. Immediately hostile, Rexxar threw all treaties aside and destroyed the camp and then returned to report to Thrall.\nThrall was amazed at the audacity of these humans and questioned &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;'s involvement. Rokhan was worried, however, that the humans may strike at the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; where his people had settled. Rexxar, Rokhan, and their allies traveled by &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; to the Echo Isles where they found that the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; tribe had already come under attack.\nTheir leader, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, briefly transformed Rexxar, Chen, and Rokhan into &lt;a href=\"spirit%20wyvern\"&gt;spirit wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s so that they could assist the &lt;a href=\"bat%20rider\"&gt;bat rider&lt;/a&gt;s in destroying the &lt;a href=\"battleships\"&gt;battleships&lt;/a&gt; assaulting the coastal villages. Upon return, Vol'jin sent Rexxar to light signal pyres telling the trolls to head for the mainland. These were guarded by the lord of the &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt;.\nRexxar returned to Thrall, where the Warchief had received a summons to a peace summit with Jaina, but Rexxar didn't trust the humans and volunteered to go in his place. When he arrived at the summit, he found an ambush waiting and no sight of Jaina.\nThrall suspected that deceit was afoot and prepared a letter for Jaina in the hopes of mending the problem, then sent Rexxar to meet with her on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Island\"&gt;Theramore Island&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar and his party asked &lt;a href=\"Samuro%20%28blademaster%29\"&gt;Samuro&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;, to plant explosives to distract the guards of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; coastal settlement on &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; long enough for Rexxar to slip by. However, Samuro remembered his previous mission to eliminate an enraged &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Bloodbeak%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Bloodbeak&lt;/a&gt; who was hiding nearby, and thus had to complete it before going for the humans. Rexxar then met with Jaina, who denied any knowledge of this force and condemned any attack on Thrall. She demanded to see these soldiers for herself.\nRexxar brought Jaina back to the camp only to find it destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar and Jaina fought through the force of snake-people looking for any survivors. After finally defeating the naga, led by the naga &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Darkscale\"&gt;Lady Darkscale&lt;/a&gt; and her guard &lt;a href=\"Scilla%20Murkshadow\"&gt;Scilla Murkshadow&lt;/a&gt;, they found a single human &lt;a href=\"footman\"&gt;footman&lt;/a&gt; dying who said that the \"Admiral\" would be pleased to see Jaina safe.\nRexxar was confused at Jaina's horror but trusted her enough to follow her back to Theramore quickly. Upon arriving, however, a fleet of ships arrived and Jaina's father, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, arrived. The moment he saw Rexxar, he immediately ordered his capture, despite Jaina's pleas. Rexxar and his friends fled the city, fighting through the naval guards, and returned to the Darkspear village informing Vol'jin what had passed.\nRexxar's forces fought around &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s village to gain experience for the coming battle. He entered the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Ancients%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tomb of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and killed the &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt; king, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Talendar\"&gt;Lord Talendar&lt;/a&gt;, felled the &lt;a href=\"Eldritch%20Deathlord\"&gt;Eldritch Deathlord&lt;/a&gt; in the shallows of the ocean, laid to rest the &lt;a href=\"Revenant%20of%20Burning%20Souls\"&gt;Revenant of Burning Souls&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%27s%20Temple\"&gt;Magistrate's Temple&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20the%20Lost\"&gt;Den of the Lost&lt;/a&gt;, ended an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Wendigo\"&gt;Ancient Wendigo&lt;/a&gt;'s reign over his icy cavern. Rexxar's forces even found a minor portal to an area of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; - the &lt;a href=\"Outland%20Arena\"&gt;Outland Arena&lt;/a&gt; - and fought the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lords &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%20Zardikar\"&gt;Destroyer Zardikar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sinstralis%20of%20the%20Pain\"&gt;Sinstralis of the Pain&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Talnivarr%20the%20Sleeper\"&gt;Talnivarr the Sleeper&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the powerful &lt;a href=\"book\"&gt;tome&lt;/a&gt;s they held. Finally, he released the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mathogg\"&gt;Mathogg&lt;/a&gt; from a prison after killing his jailor, &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Gragtor\"&gt;Khan Gragtor&lt;/a&gt;.\nVol'jin made it out to inform Thrall of the imminent invasion and suggested that Rexxar go and enlist the aid of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribes along the mesas of the land of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to aid them in the coming battle. Rexxar traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; to meet with &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and when he arrived, Cairne told him to return to Thrall and tell him that he had died of a broken heart. His second, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20%28tauren%29\"&gt;Tagar&lt;/a&gt;, explained that Cairne's son, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, had been kidnapped by &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Khiragg\"&gt;Khiragg&lt;/a&gt; and that Cairne had since grown depressed and lethargic. Rexxar led an expedition to rescue &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;spirit walker&lt;/a&gt; leader, &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt;. Upon returning, Cairne was re-energized and agreed to pledge his people to the Horde and to personally return with Rexxar.\nWhen they returned to the Darkspear village, Vol'jin showed them a &lt;a href=\"Crol%27ka\"&gt;tired ogre&lt;/a&gt; who had come from &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt; with news that a new warlord had taken over the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul clan&lt;/a&gt; of ogres, and that his cruelty and brutality were leading the ogres to ruin. Vol'jin and Rexxar agreed that this was an excellent opportunity to sway the ogres onto their side. Rexxar traveled to Dustwallow Marsh and found the Stonemaul clan. Though they initially rejected Rexxar because of his mixed blood, he proved himself by running a gauntlet and returning alive. Warlord &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt; was impressed and allowed Rexxar to join the clan.\nRexxar used his new position to ask the ogres for assistance. &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt; mockingly reminded him that they were no longer friends to the orcs. Rexxar was forced to fight Kor'gall for the leadership of the clan. Kor'gall proved to be a powerful foe, and Rexxar had to rely heavily on his beast friends to defeat him. Finally, Kor'gall fell and Rexxar assumed the position of &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;. He then led the Stonemaul ogres back to &lt;a href=\"Tidefury%20Cove\"&gt;Tidefury Cove&lt;/a&gt; where Thrall was assembling the Horde. Thrall named Rexxar &lt;a href=\"Champion%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Champion of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; and gave him the honor of leading the Horde against Proudmoore's forces. After a difficult battle, they razed Proudmoore's stronghold and sent the Admiral into a retreat. Yet, Thrall knew that Proudmoore would not stop there.\nThe Horde pursued Proudmoore back to the shores of Theramore Island. Thrall sent in his foot soldiers to keep Proudmoore's forces at bay while Rexxar and his few companions wove through the &lt;a href=\"A%20Blaze%20of%20Glory%23Theramore%20City\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; to face off against Proudmoore and his most loyal retainers. In the end, Proudmoore was killed and Rexxar emerged victorious. With Proudmoore's defeat, the battleground to a halt and Jaina collapsed onto the body of her father. Rexxar attempted to comfort Jaina by telling her that, above all else, her father was a proud warrior and should be remembered as such. Rexxar, Thrall, and the rest of the Horde then proceeded to withdraw from Theramore.\nThrall invited Rexxar to return to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; with him, but Rexxar told him that his place was still in the wild but said that he would always be part of the Horde and that he would always be there when he was needed. He named the ogre &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Morokk\"&gt;Mok'Morokk&lt;/a&gt; as the new leader of the Stonemaul clan, a decision he would later come to regret, and disappeared into the barren wilderness.\nCycle of Hatred.\nRexxar alongside his bear, Misha, found an &lt;a href=\"Byrok\"&gt;old orc&lt;/a&gt; who was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;. He brought the orc to Thrall in Orgrimmar to seek medical aid for Byrok. Byrok then told Thrall about the Burning Blade clan and Rexxar was peripherally involved in the subsequent altercation between Durotar and Theramore; he defended Jaina Proudmoore, citing her loyalty to Thrall, even against her own father. Rexxar swiftly returned to the wilds.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nUnfortunately, the Stonemauls were recently assailed by the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and forced from their home. To make matters worse, Mok'Morokk was revealed as a selfish tyrant and was eventually usurped by another ogre named &lt;a href=\"Tharg\"&gt;Tharg&lt;/a&gt; with the help of an &lt;a href=\"ogre-mage\"&gt;ogre-mage&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Draz%27Zilb\"&gt;Draz'Zilb&lt;/a&gt;. Mok'Morokk fled &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall\"&gt;Brackenwall&lt;/a&gt;.\nRexxar himself, patrolling &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; with Misha at his side, assisted heroes of the Horde in destroying &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; (which became non-canon as per \"\").\nThe Burning Crusade.\nSince the re-opening of the Dark Portal, the Mok'Nathal warrior now resides in &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Stronghold\"&gt;Thunderlord Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, protecting the base from the beasts and monstrosities of Blade's Edge. The orc &lt;a href=\"Rokaro\"&gt;Rokaro&lt;/a&gt; now carries out Rexxar's duties as Champion of the Horde on Azeroth, and is located at &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; in Desolace.\nRexxar wishes to find more of his people and perhaps one day make peace with his father, Leoroxx, who remains embittered about Rexxar's decision to join the Horde. When he entered the Mountains, Rexxar was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Bladespire\"&gt;Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; ogres who captured his &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; Leokk. He also met and befriended &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Sablemane\"&gt;Baron Sablemane&lt;/a&gt;, though he does not know that Sabellian is a black dragon.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Garm%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Garm Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; revealed the location of the Mok'Nathal clan and with the help of the adventurers, a friend in disguise and his companions, he helped his clan by defeating the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmaul\"&gt;Bloodmaul&lt;/a&gt; ogres and their gronn master. He also managed to have Leokk freed and Rexxar went and killed &lt;a href=\"Goc\"&gt;Goc&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nRexxar defended the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%23Phase%204\"&gt;phase 4&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; world event.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, the most widely membered hunter organization on Azeroth, considers Rexxar one of the greatest hunters of his time. While he'd heard of the order and never doubted that the group is respectable, he considered them to be a bit dull for his tastes, and has never really been eager to aid them.\nWhile camping in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; with Misha, which was just a way north of the &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Unseen Path's headquarters&lt;/a&gt;, Rexxar was approached by the group's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;new Huntmaster&lt;/a&gt; seeking to recruit him. Rexxar gave the hunter a challenge: survive the night in the wilds much like he himself does, for he believed that the Unseen Path did too much watching and waiting without enough action, and he wanted to be proven wrong. When morning came and the hunter approached Rexxar once more, Rexxar agreed to join the organization and to send a message that they can endure, even in the face of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Rexxar and Misha can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, they are present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nRexxar is present at &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. He explains that \u2014 though he had found kinship with the Unseen Path \u2014 when the horns of war sounded and he heard Jaina had returned, he answered the call. Though he respected her difficult decision with Daelin, Rexxar says now that Jaina has gone too far and killed too many. To fulfill his promise to Thrall to protect the Horde he loves, Rexxar will fight until either the war ends or he does.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; attacked the Horde and Rexxar participated in Warfang Hold's defense, though his wolf companion &lt;a href=\"Huelo\"&gt;Huelo&lt;/a&gt; was gravely injured and had to be put out of his misery. After Warfang Hold was retaken, Rexxar spoke of how over the years and many wars he has learned that those who stand alone fall. He vowed to stand together as one with the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, Rexxar contacted &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; about a Kul Tiran &lt;a href=\"tidesage\"&gt;tidesage&lt;/a&gt; who could help them locate the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20M.%20Valentine\"&gt;Marshal M.

He, the adventurer, and &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; confronted &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt; who was sick and lay away from his family so as not to upset the children when he died of disease. Rexxar promised to ensure Zelling's family's safety if Zelling helped them, but advised against Zelling becoming a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; because his family would not accept him. Against Rexxar's judgment, Lilian called on a &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to raise Zelling. As Zelling ran off to his family Rexxar knew what was going to happen and left, not wanting to see it.\nRexxar led Horde adventurers in attacking the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; in order to claim the &lt;a href=\"Tide%20Pearl\"&gt;Tide Pearl&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact that he believed would make the Horde fleet indestructible.\nTides of Vengeance.\nRexxar and Zelling assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Norwington%20Estate\"&gt;Norwington Estate&lt;/a&gt;, where the Alliance had been storing &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and Azerite weapons that it obtained after the defeat of the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Company&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance forces at the estate were led by &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Cole\"&gt;Lieutenant Cole&lt;/a&gt;, who recognized Rexxar as Daelin Proudmoore's killer and swore to bring him to justice. When Rexxar told Cole to challenge him with honor, Cole responded that he knew all about Rexxar's \"honor\" and attacked from within an Azerite war machine instead. Cole died in the end, but after his machine was destroyed he got out to fight hand to hand. Rexxar admitted afterward that he did at least die with honor. After retrieving the Azerite and weapons, and fighting off the remaining Alliance, Rexxar prepared to leave when Zelling stopped him to ask about the fate of his family. Rexxar was hesitant at first but then assured Zelling that, as per their promise, they were safe: Zelling's wife had bought a home in &lt;a href=\"Arom%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Arom's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, and his children were well fed. After Zelling thanked Rexxar, as well as the absent Lilian, for their help, Rexxar reminded Zelling that Kul Tiras was no longer friendly territory for him and told him to stay safe.\nThe Horde sought to break out &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, a Kul Tiran traitor who attempted a coup against the Proudmoores, from her imprisonment in &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt;. Rexxar and &lt;a href=\"Arcanist%20Valtrois\"&gt;Arcanist Valtrois&lt;/a&gt; were the team assigned to do so, and Valtrois expressed unease against doing what one was told against their better judgment while Rexxar believed one guilty human being free would be worth the lives spared. Using Valtrois's illusion magic, they infiltrated Tol Dagor with her and an adventurer disguised as guards and Rexxar as their prisoner. Once Ashvane was with them, they caused a prison riot by freeing her men and then collapsed the sewer exit with bombs to cover their escape. As Ashvane left to speak to Sylvanas, Rexxar and Valtrois agreed that things had become perilous and the Horde was at a crossroads once again.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assault%20on%20Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Faction Assault on Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, Rexxar helped defend &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; against the Alliance alongside &lt;a href=\"Usha%20Eyegouge\"&gt;Usha Eyegouge&lt;/a&gt; and his old friend &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Rexxar declared that there were others who must hear of what Sylvanas had done and that they would.\nRevolution.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; called their loyalists for battle, Rexxar answered Saurfang's call. Following Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's betrayal of the Horde, Rexxar was among the Horde heroes who attended Saurfang's funeral.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nA &lt;a href=\"Rexxar%20%28Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;corrupted version of Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Vision of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nRexxar, his animal companions, and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ambassador\"&gt;Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; per the command of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; made the perilous journey across the lush and vivid reaches of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to learn the secrets of the realm and check on the Horde holdings, in order to assess the needs and statuses of the people, how the wounds from the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; were healing, and where there were still aches within the Horde. After Zekhan sent his report, Rexxar invited him to join in the mok'nathal's farewell to his old fallen wolf companion &lt;a href=\"Huelo\"&gt;Huelo&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nRexxar was surprised, but pleased, that &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; had invited the &lt;a href=\"mok%27nathal\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival held on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt; had agreed to come. Meanwhile &lt;a href=\"Rokaro\"&gt;Rokaro&lt;/a&gt;, looked forward to catching up with Rexxar during the festival. During the feast celebrating orc champions for completing the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, father and son reconnected.\nSometime later, he received word from &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; of the death of &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; to meet with him. After arriving at &lt;a href=\"Toghusuq%20Village\"&gt;Toghusuq Village&lt;/a&gt;, he also reunited with &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, who had also traveled to the village after hearing of their old friend's passing. After the trio decided to help with the restoration of the village, Rexxar reflected on that journey through &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; that led to them saving Baine and mentioned that Cairne declared how they had given him new life after safely delivering Baine back to him. As he reminisced, he declared that it was truly Bovan who brought Cairne that new life, as even with his own keen eyes they could not discover Baine's whereabouts without Bovan's vision. He then revealed that he had learned from the &lt;a href=\"spiritwalker\"&gt;spiritwalker&lt;/a&gt;s that where the bones go after one passes means very little, that what truly matters is the last memory we make, and where goodbyes are shared. Thus he admitted he had come to the village for Baine and to make that last memory for himself.\nRexxar's companions.\nAs his title of &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt; suggests, Rexxar is a master of the wild and has befriended many creatures in his travels. Though he is most often seen with his faithful bear Misha, he is also been known to call upon his other animal friends when needed. They are:\nQuests.\nThese quests were given by Rexxar before \"The Burning Crusade\" expansion. Since that expansion, they were given by &lt;a href=\"Rokaro\"&gt;Rokaro&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; until their total removal in the \"\" expansion.\nMemorable quotes.\nLegion.\nLiving in the wild you never know what will happen next, but a good hunter can survive on skill and instinct.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nStormsong Valley.\nI had found kinship with other &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;.

I respected that decision, and how difficult it was.\nBut she could not forgive what &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;did&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.

I can still see Cairne's face lighting up with joy when we returned his son.\n\"You have given me new life,\" he said.\nBovan brought that life to him. Even my keen eyes would not have succeeded in that hunt without his aid. Bovan's vision showed us exactly where Baine was being held--we merely fought our way in, and plucked him out.\nI learned something from the tauren spiritwalkers like Bovan. They said where the bones go after we pass on means little. What matters is the last memory we make. Where we say goodbye.\nI am here for Baine... but I am also here to make that memory for myself.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nRexxar, along with &lt;a href=\"Misha\"&gt;Misha&lt;/a&gt;, is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".

It's fun to do painful things in WoW. If there's a huge outcry for it we'll try to put something equally brute in the game.\" Days later &lt;a href=\"Bashiok\"&gt;Bashiok&lt;/a&gt; indicated on the forums that it will be impossible for most people to complete this Feat of Strength after \"Cataclysm\".\nHowever, Beta Build 13277 removed &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; from the criteria, and then a short time later, a blog post on the WoW Community website confirmed changes which will allow the achievement to still be obtainable after &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;The Shattering&lt;/a&gt;:\nTrivia.\nThis achievement is a reference to the Cypress Hill song of the same name."}

Both their names were changed to \"scribe\" in patch 3.3.2.\nIn the RPG.\nInscribers are &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s who have discovered the strange arts of rune-casting; a technique for channeling the arcane energy inherent in the world without the risk of arcane corruption. They are different than &lt;a href=\"runemaster\"&gt;runemaster&lt;/a&gt;s, for they pursue the arcane knowledge and spellcasting techniques of all arcanists; they seek to also add the powers of runes to their repertoire. \nRunemasters look on inscribers with some measure of hesitation, for they are proof that there is a connection between the \"pure\" arts of runecasting and the more vulgar magics of the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, inscribers seek out runemasters to teach them new runes, as well as written works that describe the power of the rune patterns. Also unlike runemasters, inscribers are more likely to use runes to enhance their companions and their possessions; whereas runemasters focus on developing a personal connection to the world's natural magic, and tend to scribe runes predominately on their own bodies.\nInscribers still use spellbooks, though these spellbooks may contain impressive formulae for channeling the power of runes that other arcanists can't make heads or tails of.\nAn inscriber has the ability to create and empower runes. Unlike the runemaster, he does not learn whole patterns; instead, an inscriber may prepare individual runes as though they were arcane spells. He keeps runes in his spellbook, just like other arcane spells.\nAffiliation.\nInscribers are most often found among &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, for these two races are most likely to have arcane aptitude as well as exposure to runic magic (usually through association with dwarven runemasters); some &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt; who have dealt with &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; runemasters have come to seek these secrets, as well.\nInscribers and scribes.\nIn World of Warcraft, one who takes on the &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; is \"not\" intrinsically an inscriber; such a person is properly referred to as a \"scribe.\" Specifically, an inscriber is a variant of the broad \"arcanist\" core class, as is the mage, the necromancer, and the warlock. While scribes employ a degree of knowledge concerning rune magic (as evident by their creation of glyphs), they are not themselves versed in the secrets of rune-casting and rune-channeling in the unique way that inscribers are."}

{"id": "62502", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=62502", "title": "Inscription", "text": "Inscription is a &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; that allows players to create &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"scroll\"&gt;scroll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"enchantment\"&gt;enchantment&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as various items such as &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Cards\"&gt;Darkmoon Cards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"off-hand\"&gt;off-hand&lt;/a&gt; tomes. Inscription includes a pseudo-\"gathering\" skill, &lt;a href=\"milling\"&gt;milling&lt;/a&gt;, allowing scribes to create base materials from &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s in a similar way to &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Disenchant\"&gt;Disenchant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Prospecting\"&gt;Prospecting&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; players benefit from a +5 racial bonus to their Inscription skill via the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20History\"&gt;Ancient History&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"racial%20ability\"&gt;racial ability&lt;/a&gt;.\nOfficial overview.\n\"Scribes weave words of power into glyphs that can improve heroes' skills and abilities, and add special effects not possible by normal means. By transferring their powers into ink, scribes can also create consumable scrolls, mystic tomes, and pieces of vellum that allow enchantments to be passed between adventurers. Like Enchanting, Inscription can help veteran adventurers further improve themselves - but inscriptions focus on augmenting class powers, not equipment.\n\"Scribes need pigments, milled from herbs, to create their glyphs - hence, Inscription is often paired with the gathering profession Herbalism. Scribes also require inking sets in order to write their words of power.\"\nTraining as a scribe.\nInscription is taught by various inscription trainers located throughout the world. Prospective scribes must be level 5. Initial training costs for most techniques, granting the first skill point of 300 in &lt;a href=\"Classic%20inscription%20techniques\"&gt;Classic inscription techniques&lt;/a&gt; or 75 to 175 in all other inscription techniques. The exception is &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20inscription%20techniques\"&gt;Draenor inscription techniques&lt;/a&gt; which requires purchasing &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20Inscription%20%28item%29\"&gt;Secret of Draenor Inscription&lt;/a&gt; for and being &lt;a href=\"Level\"&gt;Level&lt;/a&gt; 10.\n&lt;a href=\"Inscription%20trainers\"&gt;Inscription trainers&lt;/a&gt; are available in the first town outside of every starting area, where Classic and Cataclysm recipes can be learned. Trainers for other techniques and their corresponding recipes may be found in areas that were added in their expansions.\nThe following are the types of techniques available, the skill levels they can reach and the expansions they cover.\nItems produced.\nInscription requires a &lt;a href=\"Virtuoso%20Inking%20Set\"&gt;Virtuoso Inking Set&lt;/a&gt;, sold by Inscription vendors near most of the trainers. Many recipes also require &lt;a href=\"Light%20Parchment\"&gt;Light Parchment&lt;/a&gt;, which is only available from trade goods, Engineering, and Inscription supplies vendors.\nTools and accessories.\nThe Virtuoso Inking Set may be replaced with either a &lt;a href=\"Scribe%27s%20Fastened%20Quill\"&gt;Scribe's Fastened Quill&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Scribe%27s%20Resplendent%20Quill\"&gt;Scribe's Resplendent Quill&lt;/a&gt;. Additional accessories can be crafted by a &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafter&lt;/a&gt;.\nBasic materials.\nBase crafting materials are obtained from milling herbs. This creates various pigments, which are in turn used to create inks. Glyphs and scrolls are created from inks, while tomes and Darkmoon cards require both and inks.\nGlyphs.\nThe \"meat and potatoes\" of Inscription, glyphs comprise the majority of its recipes. Each glyph provides a modification to a specific class ability.\nEach glyph requires ink and a parchment to create. Most glyphs require one ink, while some glyphs require two inks. Glyphs stack to 20 and are not bound, so they can be traded or sold. Each glyph icon is color-coded to match the class it can be used by.\nGlyphs are learned from trainers and &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt; drops called &lt;a href=\"technique\"&gt;technique&lt;/a&gt;s, or discovered through research.\nThe following research can be performed or scrolls/books can be used at the indicated Inscription skill level:\nDarkmoon cards.\nScribes are able to create various Darkmoon cards, which players can combine into decks and turn in to &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; NPCs for various equipment rewards. These cards include higher-level cards which were previously only obtained from mob drops, and new lower level cards. High level decks can only be turned in when the faire is in town, but lower level ones can be used to summon an NPC at any time, in any location. All the cards, decks and rewards are tradable.\nEnchantment vellums.\nScribes could once create various &lt;a href=\"vellum\"&gt;vellum&lt;/a&gt;s that could hold varying levels of armor or weapon enchantments, but instead now simply make one type of vellum, &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Vellum\"&gt;Enchanting Vellum&lt;/a&gt;. They do not bind and can be sold or traded to &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanters&lt;/a&gt;, who can then sell enchanted scrolls on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; or can &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; them. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, Enchanting Vellum is now sold by &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; vendors.\nOff-hand tomes.\nScribes are able to produce several &lt;a href=\"BoE\"&gt;BoE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"off%20hand\"&gt;off hand&lt;/a&gt; tomes. Each requires a fairly hefty amount of raw materials. Players should be aware that wielding an off hand item precludes the use of &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;ing, or two-handed weapons.\nShoulder inscriptions.\nMaster scribes are able to apply permanent augments to their shoulder items, which causes them to become soulbound. \nCrystals and tarots.\nCrystals are used to increase the item level or reroll the stats of Inscription-crafted weapons. Tarots are used to increase the item level of Inscription-crafted trinkets or off-hands.\nVantus runes.\nVantus runes increase a player's &lt;a href=\"versatility\"&gt;versatility&lt;/a&gt; while in a specific dungeon or fighting a specific boss. Legion runes increase versatility by 1,500.\nFortune cards.\nScribes can also create fortune cards like &lt;a href=\"Mysterious%20Fortune%20Card\"&gt;Mysterious Fortune Card&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Card%20of%20Omens\"&gt;Card of Omens&lt;/a&gt;. When used, they turn into a random card that can be sold to a &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; for anywhere between and ."}

These include:\nInspiration does not stack with the restoration shaman's third tier talent &lt;a href=\"Ancestral%20Healing\"&gt;Ancestral Healing&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough Inspiration can proc from any of the listed spells, as the effect is of a fixed nature (not proportional to the spell's effect) and does not stack, spells that affect multiple targets (such as &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Prayer of Healing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt;) are far more useful for attaining this effect; even if the amount healed is small, the full effect is still granted. For Holy priests, Circle of Healing is ideal for procing Inspiration; &lt;a href=\"Penance\"&gt;Penance&lt;/a&gt; also provides an increased proc chance, with each of its 3 ticks having a chance to crit."}
