{"id": "15783", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15783", "title": "Quiver", "text": "Quivers are a type of &lt;a href=\"Bag%23Ammo%20bags\"&gt;ammo bag&lt;/a&gt;. They contain stacks of &lt;a href=\"arrow\"&gt;arrow&lt;/a&gt;s used by &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;-wielders and &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;-wielders (as opposed to &lt;a href=\"Ammo%20Pouch\"&gt;ammo pouches&lt;/a&gt;, which contain stacks of &lt;a href=\"ammo\"&gt;ammo&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"shot\"&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bullet\"&gt;bullet&lt;/a&gt;s) used by &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;-wielders). WoW makes no distinction between arrows for bows and arrows for crossbows. \nOn its icon on the action bar where the quiver is equipped, a quiver will display the total number of the arrows that the quiver holds (the number of shots remaining), up to three digits (999). These do not have to be the same type of arrow, but each slot in the quiver will hold only one kind of arrow. When the number of shots remaining exceeds 1000, the number is not displayed.\nWhen the currently equipped stack of arrows runs out of arrows a quiver will automatically re-equip another stack of the same type of arrow, if one exists in the quiver. This way the player will not have to worry about reloading; simply placing several stacks of the same arrows in the quiver. It is advisable to not mix kinds of arrows in a quiver in order to avoid having shooting occasionally halt, waiting for a manual reload.\nQuivers, before patch 3.1, provided a &lt;a href=\"Rate%20of%20Fire\"&gt;rate of fire&lt;/a&gt; bonus, from 10 percent for low level quivers to 15 percent to high level quivers. Since patch 3.1 this has changed. Patch notes \"Ammunition: All types of gun and bow ammunition now stack to 1000. All quivers and ammo pouches no longer provide haste. 15% ranged haste is now built into the hunter's Auto Shot.\"\nA quiver or pouch adds no real benefit other than organization. Any character can buy and equip a quiver in a bag slot. Any character can buy and carry arrows and can use the quiver to store the arrows. Only &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s can use or train to use &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s which fire arrows. The roles and mechanics of rogues and warriors do not use large quantities of arrows; lacking the hunter's &lt;a href=\"autoshot\"&gt;autoshoot&lt;/a&gt; capability, manually firing each shot, having no special abilities that require shooting, primarily shooting (or &lt;a href=\"throw\"&gt;throw&lt;/a&gt;ing, rather than shooting) to &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; and doing the bulk of the damage through melee, often using &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"charge\"&gt;charge&lt;/a&gt; rather than shooting to engage an opponent; thus they generally forgo an ammo bag in favor of one or two stacks of ammo in a general purpose bag. So only a hunter has the need for the ability of the quiver to feed a large quantity of arrows to the ammo slot. \nA shooter can use more than one quiver, but will find that this is unnecessary and that they need the &lt;a href=\"bag%20slot\"&gt;bag slot&lt;/a&gt;s for normal &lt;a href=\"bag\"&gt;bag&lt;/a&gt;s.\nCurrently available quivers:"}

In mid-air she shifts out of &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;Flight Form&lt;/a&gt;, then (while falling toward the enemy) shifts into bear or cat form and &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Charge%20%28Bear%20Form%29\"&gt;Feral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Charge%20%28Cat%20Form%29\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;s. This brings the falling Druid toward the enemy, and when properly executed, the druid takes no falling damage.\nHow to perform a successful RAWRbomb.\nThe hardest part of this is the timing. You can't quite look straight down, so you're always at a small angle forward. When you have the camera facing downward, pressing 'forward' makes you fly in the direction the camera is facing, rather than parallel to the ground so it can be hard to follow. \nIt is necessary to lead the target enough that your fall time doesn't allow them to walk out of your charge range, but you need to be high enough to allow furor's 'instant' 10 rage time to activate. \nPracticing may help; have a friend swim into water deep enough to prevent fall damage, and start a duel. Use this to learn what 'in range' looks like at various heights, and exactly how far you have to fall before furor activates. Then have your friend move around to help you learn to lead moving targets.\nAdvanced techniques.\nThese all require more height, however, due to the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; and thus increasing the risk of perfoming instead a RAWRsplat.\nRAWRsplat.\nThis is the unfortunate result of a failed RAWRbombing. You drop to the ground, take falling damage and leave yourself open to your enemy's counterattack, and look exceedingly foolish. If the target is an enemy player then the enemy's \"&lt;a href=\"WTF\"&gt;WTF&lt;/a&gt;?\" moment of suddenly seeing a large bear plummet to its near-death may give you enough time to escape, however.\nThe RAWRbomb macro.\nA spammable macro that will dismount you or shift you out of form, into bear form, and feral charge your target. \nBear Rawr Bomb\n /dismount\n /cancelform [nostance:1]\n /cast [nostance] Dire Bear Form; [stance:1] Feral Charge (Bear Form)\nCat Rawr Bomb\n /dismount\n /cancelform [nostance:3]\n /cast [nostance] Cat Form; [stance:3] Feral Charge (Cat Form)\nSince if you are already in bear/cat form this just feral charges, you can replace your normal feral charge button with it and save one. \nStealth Rawr Bomb\n /dismount\n /cancelform [nostance:3]\n /cast [nostance] Cat Form; [stance:3,stealth] Feral Charge (Cat Form); [stance:3] Prowl\nThis requires slightly more height than a standard Cat Form RAWRbomb, as you will cast Prowl (which does not trigger the GCD) before Feral Charge. It can also be used to perform a \"HALO jump\" (flight to prowl) when you're low enough that you won't take fall damage in Cat Form, but high enough that you'll be able to Prowl before landing. \nAs of 3.0.2, RAWRBombing requires that you cast Feral Charge (Bear Form)/Cat\nPossible Modifications: \nNotes.\nIt may be possible to use a &lt;a href=\"small%20pet\"&gt;small pet&lt;/a&gt; as a targeting reticle for the RAWRbomber. I experimented with this some using &lt;a href=\"Speedy\"&gt;Speedy&lt;/a&gt; the turtle from the &lt;a href=\"Children%27s%20Week\"&gt;Children's Week&lt;/a&gt; questline. A pet that stays in the same position relative to you and moves predictably would be the most useful; &lt;a href=\"Egbert\"&gt;Egbert&lt;/a&gt; and his random scrambling would make targeting much more difficult.\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s can achieve a similar effect with &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Intercept%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Intercept (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly &lt;a href=\"Intervene\"&gt;Intervene&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt;s can do this with their &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Charge\"&gt;Demon Charge&lt;/a&gt; spell.\nHistory.\nThe first iteration of this concept still available on the official WoW forums was by Mir of , who originally called it 'rawrbear', as quoted in his message below:\nRAWRbomb quickly became more widespread, but other names occasionally appear such as BirdBearBomb, , bearbomb, and bearpedo.\nAn ASCII diagram on how to successfully Rawrbomb was drawn by Aledoresta of :\nThe definitive RAWRbomb Instructional Video by Xxorn of can be seen &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D57h3RPsEddg\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This includes several RAWRsplats, and shows the effect of latency, as he hits the ground and then charges taking no fall damage."}

Random number generators (or, more correctly, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator\"&gt;pseudorandom number generators&lt;/a&gt;) are algorithms used in computing when an outcome needs to be as random as possible. A computer can't generate completely random numbers on its own, so it uses a complex algorithm designed to get as close to random as is practical. These algorithms are used in the game any time an event has a probability of happening - whether that be &lt;a href=\"Critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hits&lt;/a&gt;, the spread of &lt;a href=\"weapon%20damage\"&gt;weapon damage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Proc\"&gt;procs&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Missile%20Barrage\"&gt;Missile Barrage&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sudden%20Doom\"&gt;Sudden Doom&lt;/a&gt;, or to determine which loot drops from a &lt;a href=\"raid%20boss\"&gt;raid boss&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term \"RNG\" is frequently used in conversation to mean \"luck\" or \"lucky\", as in \"bad RNG\" and \"good RNG\". For example:\n \nIn this post, &lt;a href=\"Ghostcrawler\"&gt;Ghostcrawler&lt;/a&gt; is contrasting the damage reduction provided by &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; and by &lt;a href=\"dodge\"&gt;dodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"parry\"&gt;parry&lt;/a&gt;, which are collectively called \"avoidance\". Armor is a set reduction to all incoming attacks - a 60% armor value means that all melee attacks are reduced by 60%. Dodge and parry, on the other hand, are a percentage chance to completely avoid the attack and take no damage from it. It is possible to be unlucky (or get \"bad RNG\") and have a streak of hits that are not avoided, which can cause very high incoming damage and may cause sudden death.\nRNG is frequently viewed in a negative light because of this \"bad RNG\" effect, although it can be equally possible to get \"good RNG\" that results in a favourable outcome such as a long streak of blocked or parried attacks. In a raid setting where bad luck can lead to a wipe, some raiders prefer the certainty of non-random abilities to the possibility, however remote, that bad luck might cause disaster.\n\"Bad RNG\" and its unpopularity with some players was acknowledged by &lt;a href=\"Jeffrey%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeffrey Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; at the 2009 Game Developer's Conference, where he talked about \"progressive percentages\" in quest item drop rates.\nWe found that this had a lot of problems where players would run into streaks, and they only remembered the shitty streaks. So what we decided to do was we took a page out of Warcraft 3, which had a very elegant design which they referred to as 'progressive percentages.' ...In Lich King, every creature that is part of the collection quest has the item 100% of the time, but we do a progressive system where we up the chance the player [gets the item] each time he kills it. The problem was, when we put it live in the beta--and we didn't tell anybody this--we found that while it was great that it got rid of the bad streaks, it also got rid of all the good streaks. And overall we needed to raise the base drop percentage to around 45%.\nThe elimination of the \"bad RNG\" factor of killing hundreds of mobs for a single quest is important, especially given the difficulties of preserving the effects of \"good RNG\" at the same time. This topic is discussed in more detail in the paper &lt;a href=\"http%3A//math.arizona.edu/~ercolani/pyzdek.pdf\"&gt;Linear Regression of Progressive Percentage in World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;."}

This new realm type, called RP-PvP, was finally introduced in &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.8\"&gt;Patch 1.8&lt;/a&gt;.\nIdeally these realms would be the perfect choice for roleplayers who want to have less restrained, more spontaneous PvP experience than they would on realms with the PvE ruleset, and free of &lt;a href=\"bluewall\"&gt;bluewall&lt;/a&gt;ing. However, RP-PvP realms have a large share of players who break the RP policies, as well as those who engage in &lt;a href=\"ganking\"&gt;ganking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"corpse%20camping\"&gt;corpse camping&lt;/a&gt;, and other kinds of &lt;a href=\"griefing\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt;. If you come from a RP or PvE server, you may quickly come to realize this world as much more hostile and irritating then you may have expected.\nDifficulties.\nIt is not true that most RP-PvP'ers don't RP. There is a less \"noticeable\" focus on RP because, plain and simply, people are trying to kill you constantly. Many would agree that PvP'ers in general have a more competitive mind set, and RP time is divided between time spent trying to get decent gear to survive or victimize more effectively. Another common misconception is that RP policies on RP-PvP realms are less strict than on normal RP realms, this is completely false. However, the enforcement of rules tends to vary server to server as it does on all types of servers.\nThe most frequent difficulty on RP-PvP or normal RP servers comes from the expectations of disgruntled would be role-players. A small percentage have their own idea on the way RP should be, that don't feel there is enough RP, or maybe simply feel left out. As a result, forum threads declaring that RP is dead are commonplace."}

Ra bestowed life on the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, who know him as Ra-den or Ra-Den, which means \"Master Ra\" in &lt;a href=\"mogu%20%28language%29\"&gt;their tongue&lt;/a&gt;. The Highkeeper has also simply been referred to by the mogu as The Storm and later \"the sleeping keeper\", while &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; has referred to him as \"the storm lord\" or even \"the storm god\".\nThousands of years ago, Ra was defeated by , who stole the keeper's power and used it to establish his &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt;. Ra was thereafter chained beneath the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of Lei Shen's power until he was ultimately freed by mortal &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Years later, Ra joined the fight against the newly awakened &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; but was pulled into &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; and corrupted, forcing Azeroth's heroes to end his life.\nBiography.\nWar against the elementals.\nMuch like the other &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, Ra was created by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s in order to wage war upon the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; who had infested &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As the titans' colossal forms prevented them from taking direct action without harming or destroying Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;, the titan &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; instead empowered titan-forged who'd then be known as &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;s to do battle in their stead. Much like , Highkeeper Ra was empowered by , the Highfather of the Pantheon. Ra was also entrusted with &lt;a href=\"the%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;the Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; by Aman'Thul. The Highkeeper used it to bestow life on the titan-forged &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; race, and he wielded it in the battle against the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt; of the Old Gods for years beyond counting.\nTo reach the Old Gods, the titan-forged first needed to defeat their terrible servants, the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s. The keepers resolved to divide and conquer their enemies, and so decided to split up and send each group of titan-forged to battle a specific lord. Keepers Ra, and were assigned to wage war on . Using their mastery over skies and storms, the three keepers managed to defeat the Windlord atop his lofty domain. However, even though the lords had been defeated, the keepers knew that they would return in time. Ra soon found a solution, and, together with the titan-forged sorceress , he forged the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; to imprison the chaotic elementals. He then sealed its gates using &lt;a href=\"The%20Highkeeper%27s%20Ward\"&gt;The Highkeeper's Ward&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrdering of Azeroth.\nAfter the Old Gods were defeated and imprisoned beneath the surface of Azeroth, the titan-forged set out to install two powerful machines to help nurture the maturing &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth: the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt;. Ra set out to install the latter forge in the southern reaches of Azeroth, but on the way there he discovered the remnants of the slain Old God , including its &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;monstrous heart&lt;/a&gt;. Ra resolved to seal these remnants in a subterranean vault that would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Vault of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, and assigned his &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; servants to watch over it and the surrounding lands.\nEventually, Ra and his followers reached their destination and, once they had installed the Forge of Origination, created the great fortress of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the southernmost base of operations for the titan-forged. The Highkeeper assigned some of his &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"anubisath\"&gt;anubisath&lt;/a&gt; servants to safeguard the area, while he himself continued further west to create the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt; to serve as a prison for the Old God . Once this task was done as well, Ra spent the following ages roaming and watching over the southern regions of Azeroth. The mogu who answered directly to Ra were known as the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, Ra was present during the empowering of the primitive &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and the creation of the five &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. The Highkeeper channeled some of the powers of his creator, , into the bronze dragon , granting him powers over time.\nThe titans closely watched the actions of the titan-forged unfold and eventually departed the world, confident that Azeroth was safe in the hands of their servants. On a stormy day, Ra and his mogu followers ascended a colossal mountain to see the titans off. The legends say that the Highkeeper slammed his weapon against his shield, causing the rain to cease and the clouds to part while the mountain beneath their feet rose higher and lightning and fire illuminated the skies so that Ra and his followers could better glimpse the titans. Lastly, the winds howled a sorrowful farewell.\nThe spirit of Aman'Thul.\nOne day, while the keepers were carrying out their work on Azeroth, they suddenly felt a great influx of power, and a surge of fragmented memories washed over them. Puzzled, the keepers sent a message to the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, asking what just happened and why, but never received a reply. After a very long time, Ra realized that this was no mere anomaly, but the very last remnant of the Pantheon's spirits after the traitor had slain his brethren. The Highkeeper struggled to accept the death of the Pantheon, and carefully extracted the lingering power of before storing it in a mountain vault near the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. He thereafter retreated into the catacombs beneath the land, depressed, to meditate on what he had learned, giving up his task of protecting the planet and leaving his titan-forged servants to continue their work alone.\nLei Shen.\nThe mogu continued to serve their master for many ages, even as Ra-den fell mysteriously silent. Some time thereafter, however, the mogu were struck by the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, which turned them from stony beings into creatures of flesh and blood. Soon, the mogu fell to infighting, and still, their master said nothing. Long thereafter, during the &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20a%20Hundred%20Kings\"&gt;Age of a Hundred Kings&lt;/a&gt; when mogu warlords fought for dominion, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; rose to power. Lei Shen announced his intent to \"awaken the gods\", and only his most loyal of followers followed him into the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Thundering%20Mountain\"&gt;Thundering Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where Ra resided. What the young warlord found was illuminating: the titanic watcher Ra-den, who stood guard over a powerful titan device, the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Highkeeper showed no reaction upon seeing Lei Shen, even as the mogu began asking him questions about the mogu's purpose. Weeks passed, and Lei Shen grew more and more frustrated, and still, Ra said nothing. When the mogu realized that Ra was not contemplating some grand plan, but had simply given up hope, Lei Shen unleashed his anger upon the keeper, accusing him of abandoning the work of the titans. The harsh words finally woke Ra from his stupor, and the highkeeper brought the mogu to the place where he had stored the lingering soul of Aman'Thul. The revelation that the titans were dead did not, however, cause Lei Shen to fall into despair like Ra had. Instead, the mogu decided that if the Pantheon were dead and their servant refused to continue their work, he would do so himself. Without warning, Lei Shen incapacitated Ra, bound the keeper in great chains, and stole not only the keeper's power but also the power of Aman'Thul (though he never succeeded in harnessing Ra's &lt;a href=\"The%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Highkeeper%27s%20Ward\"&gt;artifacts&lt;/a&gt;). Then, with his newly acquired powers, Lei Shen dubbed himself the Thunder King and established &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;tyrannical rule&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; until the time of his death. Ra-den himself was confined to a &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Cell\"&gt;Hidden Cell&lt;/a&gt; beneath the Thunder King's capital, the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThousands of years later, Ra-den was found chained beneath the Throne of Thunder by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Broken by millennia of imprisonment and torture, Ra came to the conclusion that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was twisted, beyond redemption, and that the only answer to corruption was destruction. He was however stopped by the adventurers, who managed to give him a small amount of hope for the world. While he did not believe that the mortals could stop the approaching, all-consuming darkness, he believed they had earned the right to try. Ra vanished in a flash of lightning, and would not be heard from again until years later.\nLegion.\nA &lt;a href=\"Memory%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;vision of Ra&lt;/a&gt; wielding &lt;a href=\"The%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;The Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; appears in the &lt;a href=\"Guo-Lai%20Halls\"&gt;Guo-Lai Halls&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; explains his story.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter being freed from the Throne of Thunder, Ra-den took refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Silent%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Silent Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by his mogu servants, the &lt;a href=\"Rajani\"&gt;Rajani&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the Old God &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s awakening, adventurers and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Speaker Magni&lt;/a&gt; sought the Highkeeper out for help with using the &lt;a href=\"Engine%20of%20Nalak%27sha\"&gt;Engine of Nalak'sha&lt;/a&gt; to power the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon against the Old God. However, Ra declared that the coming darkness was too great for even Azeroth's champions to defeat since it had taken the combined might of all the keepers to defeat the Black Empire thousands of years earlier. In response, the Rajani leader &lt;a href=\"Stormspeaker%20Qian\"&gt;Stormspeaker Qian&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%27s%20Trophy\"&gt;trophy&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Vil%27raxx\"&gt;one of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kri%27vin\"&gt;the generals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torsheg\"&gt;threatening&lt;/a&gt; the Vale in the hopes of convincing the Highkeeper that action should be taken. Upon being presented the trophy, Ra cynically noted that Azeroth's enemies were innumerable and stated that the scales would sooner or later tip against the world. Yet despite his bleak outlook, he also acknowledged that he had been wrong before. Ra decided to give the mortals a chance to prove him wrong once more and revealed that the Engine of Nalak'sha could be reached through the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the champions to reactivate the structure.\nWith his hopes restored, Ra left the Rajani in defense of the Engine and traveled with the adventurers to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of Heart&lt;/a&gt; in order to help them restore the Forge of Origination. Later, after adventurers returned from their first foray into one of N'Zoth's &lt;a href=\"Horrific%20Vision\"&gt;Horrific Vision&lt;/a&gt;s, the Old God attacked the chamber, opening a portal to &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt; and releasing its forces into the facility. Ra fought against the Old God's minions alongside the other defenders of the chamber, but once it became clear that N'Zoth was about to overtake the facility, Ra turned to the adventurer and told them to save Azeroth, no matter the cost. The Highkeeper then charged at the portal to Ny'alotha and used a lightning attack to destroy it, but was in the process pulled into the realm. According to Magni, the Chamber of Heart and all of Azeroth would've been N'Zoth's for the taking had it not been for Ra's sacrifice.\nWithin Ny'alotha, the despair he had harbored for so long overwhelmed the last of Ra's hope and caused him to become completely corrupted into a servant of N'Zoth. He was eventually &lt;a href=\"Ra-den%20the%20Despoiled\"&gt;confronted and killed&lt;/a&gt; atop the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Desolation\"&gt;Terrace of Desolation&lt;/a&gt; by the champions of Azeroth, much to Magni's sorrow.\nSpeculation.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; being \"cast from the maker's flesh\", as well as the large wounds on Ra's body, together imply that it was literally made from Ra's flesh."}

As he went to help fight in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, his homeland was laid waste. When he returned from the war Morgan could not find his wife &lt;a href=\"Lys%20Ladimore\"&gt;Lys&lt;/a&gt; nor their children. He went mad, and in his madness killed several innocents. When he came to, he saw what had come to pass and committed suicide. His body was reanimated and became an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; monstrosity known as &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Ladim\"&gt;Mor'Ladim&lt;/a&gt;, who once roamed near &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; and killed indiscriminately.\nThe Story of Morgan Ladimore.\nMorgan Ladimore was a great and noble knight who fought in defense of the innocent, the poor, and the afflicted. For many years, he worked diligently throughout the outlying areas of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, bringing relief to the suffering and swift justice to evildoers.\nHe was married to a young girl named Lys in the summer of his eighteenth year. They were much in love with each other and would eventually produce three children, a son and two daughters.\nMorgan was thirty-two when war broke out in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Morgan was called to the side of the legendary paladin &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; to fight against the orcs and the undead. Leaving his wife and children in the safety of his home, Morgan left for war.\nThe years passed and the war dragged on, and Morgan would witness many horrific events, including the disbanding of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Paladins of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the death of Uther and the spread of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt;. The only thing that kept him from the brink of madness was the knowledge that he would someday be reunited with his wife and children.\nMorgan would eventually return to his homeland, but find it nothing like how he remembered it. The once verdant forest was corrupted and teemed with the undead and other dark forces. Destroyed houses and farms could be found everywhere, and the cemetery near Raven's Hill now dominated much of the area. A shocked and bewildered Morgan eventually made his way to his home, only to find it in ruins. Not knowing what had befallen his homeland, he headed towards the village to find answers, and, he hoped, his wife and children.\nMorgan inquired about his family, but could not find any answers. A priest in &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, as it was now called, said that he might search the cemetery at &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt; for a gravestone. Morgan refused to believe that his family was dead, and continued to search every farm and house in Duskwood, but to no avail.\nMorgan rode from Darkshire to nearby &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;, thinking that perhaps his family had fled. On his way there, he decided, against his better judgement, to stop by the Raven Hill cemetery. Morgan spent hours walking amongst the gravestones. He recognized many names of people that he knew and became more and more distraught. Then he saw them: a small, untended plot amongst the many with three small gravestones. A feeling of dread washed over him as he approached. Morgan brushed off the dust of the most prominent gravestone to reveal the name on it. Simply carved upon the grave, letters spelled out his worst fear:\nLys Ladimore\nBeloved Wife and Mother\nMorgan's apprehension turned to dismay and then to grief, and he fell to his knees weeping. For hours he stared at that one grave, begging the cold stone for forgiveness and sobbing apologies. Then, hours later, something in him snapped and he began to lash out. He brought &lt;a href=\"Archeus\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt; out of its scabbard and began to rain blows on the gravestones, screaming in rage. Blind in his fury, he lashed out and swung wildly, catching the notice of a trio of the cemetery's attendants. As they turned to restrain him, he turned his focus to them, hurling accusations of guilt upon the innocent attendants, then killed them all.\nLater, when the rage had passed, realization crept into Morgan's mind, and he saw his bloody sword driven into the chests of one of the attendants. Driven to the brink by his emotions, he removed his belt knife and plunged it into his heart.\nMorgan Ladimore's body and the three bodies of his victims were found the next day. He was quickly buried, without ceremony, in a hastily dug grave on the outskirts of the cemetery. Because Morgan committed murder against innocents, something that went completely against his beliefs and his nature, and because of the grief that he held in being unable to save his family, Morgan could not die a peaceful death, and lived on as one of the restless dead.\nOnly days later, his grave was disturbed, and his body could not be found. The being that was Morgan now wanders Duskwood, consumed by his grief over the loss of his wife and children and his own self-hatred. &lt;a href=\"Mor%27Ladim\"&gt;Mor'Ladim&lt;/a&gt;, as he now calls himself, roams Duskwood with mindless vengeance and hatred, and has been known to commit murder indiscriminately.\nA Daughter's Love.\nUpon quest completion, Morgan Ladimore appears as a spirit and speaks to the player: \"My sword Archeus served me well in life, but as at last my spirit may pass from the unhappy existence, I need it no longer. I shall cling to the love of my daughter and hope that I will find forgiveness under the Light for my sins.\""}

He was urged to turn away from that evil magic, but he could not resist, and was banished. Morganth took with him a powerful book \u2013 &lt;a href=\"Ur%27s%20Treatise%20on%20Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Ur's Treatise on Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt;, though he failed to break the seals placed on it by the mages of Stormwind.\nMorganth made an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock orcs&lt;/a&gt; led by , the Blackrock Warlord. Fueled by the evil magic of Morganth, the Blackrock orcs attacked &lt;a href=\"Stonewatch%20Keep\"&gt;Stonewatch Keep&lt;/a&gt; in Redridge. They fought with horrific savagery and captured the Keep. Shortly after their victory, Morganth turned on his orcish cohorts. He constructed an arcane tower, the &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Ilgalar\"&gt;Tower of Ilgalar&lt;/a&gt;, and used his powers to build a small army of &lt;a href=\"Shadowhide%20Gnoll%20Clan\"&gt;Shadowhide&lt;/a&gt; gnolls led by , to serve his malicious bidding. Both orc and man have fallen victim to the brutes that serve Morganth.\nMorganth communicated with the Shadowhide gnolls through the magical pendants. , mage of &lt;a href=\"Tower%20of%20Azora\"&gt;Tower of Azora&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, spent months of research to find a way to communicate with the gnolls through these pendants. He wants to learn how to send an attack through the pendants, to immobilize any Shadowhide gnolls who wear them. Theocritus has also developed a means of spying on his rival, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Azora\"&gt;Eye of Azora&lt;/a&gt;, and could view him from afar, though his final purpose is to study Morganth's thoughts.\nIt's known that Morganth was searching for the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems that he has no success in his search. Judging by artifacts found in Tower of Ilgalar, Morganth was interested in researching the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAlso, the mages of Stormwind wanted to have Ur's Treatise on Shadow Magic returned because they fear that Morganth may find a way to open it and read its contents. Theocritus tasked the adventurers of the Alliance to kill Morganth.\nTactics.\nIn combat, he is able to summon a &lt;a href=\"succubus\"&gt;succubus&lt;/a&gt; and a huge &lt;a href=\"Minion%20of%20Morganth\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; to fight on his side. He is also protected by 2 &lt;a href=\"Shadowhide%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Shadowhide Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt;s.

Though he only speaks &lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Nerglish&lt;/a&gt;, it is clear that Morgl wants to borrow the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"artifact\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; weapon. If the player gives him their weapon, they gain the Borrow Artifact (\"Someone is borrowing your artifact\") debuff. When given &lt;a href=\"The%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;The Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;, Morgl waves it around for a bit, before giving it back to the player. When given the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Doomhammer (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;, Morgl hits a bunch of rocks with it. When given &lt;a href=\"Sharas%27dal%2C%20Scepter%20of%20Tides\"&gt;Sharas'dal, Scepter of Tides&lt;/a&gt;, he will grant 50 Artifact Power directly to the weapon.\nIn Hearthstone.\nMorgl is the alternate hero (player character) for the shaman class in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". He is obtained by a special promotion similar to \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\"'s &lt;a href=\"Recruit-A-Friend\"&gt;Recruit-A-Friend&lt;/a&gt; system. His flavor text reads: \"Mrrgl mrrgl mrrrrrrrgl. Mrrrrrgl! Mrgl?\" Morgl was first mentioned in the flavor text of the card, 19 months prior to his release: \"He pays homage to Morgl, the great murloc oracle! (Who doesn't??)\"\nWhile most murlocs are more likely to have visitors for lunch than they are to invite them over for tea, Morgl the Oracle has wisdom, wit, and the wherewithal to fight the good fight. His language skills aren't quite up to &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Finley%20Mrrgglton\"&gt;Finley&lt;/a&gt;'s level, but his command of the elements is unmatched.\nIn addition, Morgl appears as a rare Caster mercenary in the game mode.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

She participated in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;war against the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and later served as a guard in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; before being assigned as one of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s personal guards during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. She is married to a blacksmith and has eight children.\nBiography.\nMorka fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; in defending the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. At some point she fought against a &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; alongside about three dozen others. When the pit lord fell to the ground, Morka struck the killing blow with her hammer against his head, which as far as she was concerned meant that she had first call on the spoils. She claimed a piece of plate strapped to the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;'s finger, which her blacksmith mate reshaped so she could wear it strapped against her thigh. As she later told Saurfang, however, Morka didn't travel to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, nor did she participate in the battles at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; or on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, as she \"wasn't invited\".\nAfter the Legion's defeat, a few weeks prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Morka served as a guard in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. One morning, she and several other guards, including a &lt;a href=\"Hiamo\"&gt;tauren whose name she couldn't remember&lt;/a&gt;, sat atop one of the city's battlements, drinking and laughing, until they were discovered by High Overlord Saurfang, who gave them a long, furious lecture about their incompetence for being drunk on duty while &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; crawled over the city. He ordered them to remain atop the battlements for the next two guard shifts, after which he would contemplate a suitable punishment. The guards numbly returned to their posts, but Morka later realized that the High Overlord hadn't asked any of their names and thus wouldn't be able to punish them after all.\nA time thereafter, after Saurfang announced that anyone who killed an Alliance spy in the city would be rewarded with a thousand gold coins, Morka spotted and caught a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; rogue. However, moments later, someone that smelled like a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; laid his dagger at her throat from behind and forced her to let go of the spy. Morka managed to grab the assailant's blade, but he threw exploding powder in her face that momentarily blinded and deafened her, allowing him to escape. An hour later, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; brought Morka to Saurfang, who revealed that the human who attacked her was actually Nathanos and that they had to let the spy escape as part of Saurfang's ongoing efforts to deceive the Alliance. Saurfang invited Morka to serve as one of his personal guards in an upcoming military effort, which she accepted. The day after the conversation, Morka realized that Saurfang had mentioned her fighting alongside him at the Crossroads, meaning that he remembered her from the Orgrimmar battlements but had decided to give her a second chance.\nWeeks later, Saurfang led the Horde army in marching through the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, officially to travel to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; but truthfully to attack the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. When the army changed directions and began heading north, Morka was initially as surprised as the other guards but soon put the pieces of Saurfang's grand plan together. When Saurfang openly announced the Horde's intent to attack Darnassus at the border between the Barrens and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Morka joined the other soldiers in cheering \"For the Horde!\".\nAfter days of fighting in Ashenvale, Morka accompanied Saurfang in the town of &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, whose inhabitants appeared to have been slaughtered by Horde rogues. At the inn, she spotted and revealed a &lt;a href=\"Tavar\"&gt;night elf rogue&lt;/a&gt;. When night elf forces, including &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; himself, ambushed the town, Morka reluctantly obeyed Saurfang's orders and fled with a container of maps to deliver to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;. However, she later returned and led the effort of rescuing the wounded Saurfang from the rubble of the Astranaar inn after he was defeated in a duel with Malfurion.\nAfter Sylvanas ordered Saurfang and Nathanos to find a way into &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, she also told the High Overlord to leave the siege weapons and any of his guards who could swim under her command. Morka wanted to accompany Saurfang, but he told her to obey the warchief's orders. She thus volunteered to be among the raiders who swam out to attack the night elf ships off the coast of Darkshore while the Horde's siege weapons barraged the ships from the shore. Morka and fourteen others (including Hiamo, the tauren she had shared drinks with in Orgrimmar) swam underwater past the night elf fleet, then climbed into the nearest kaldorei vessel from the seaward side, killing most of the crew and forcing the rest to commandeer the ship toward &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nMorka's subsequent fate is unclear. After Sylvanas ordered her forces to burn Teldrassil, Saurfang saw a couple of kaldorei ships and captured vessels trying to move away from the flaming World Tree as burning branches rained down on them."}

In life, he was a talented and loyal servant, though somber and somewhat paranoid due to the strange visions he received due to living within the walls of Karazhan. During \"\", he can be found as a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;, tending to guests in the &lt;a href=\"Banquet%20Hall\"&gt;Banquet Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. It is later revealed that he is revived as an undead every time he is destroyed, though seems to be unaware of who- or what is responsible.\nHe is aware of his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; state and of being mysteriously revived over and over. If he had his preference, he would like to die permanently, but makes do with continuing his steward work of keeping the tower clean.\nBackground.\nBefore the Horde.\nMoroes was a friend of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. He agreed to stay with Medivh and help maintain Karazhan, becoming Medivh's castellan. He had always disapproved of the way Aegwynn insisted on detaching herself from the world. As the &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;darkness&lt;/a&gt; within Medivh began to grow and the Guardian's isolation was blamed as the cause, Moroes suggested that, if he could not trust the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, he could invite people from the regions surrounding Karazhan for a banquet instead. Surely they could not have ulterior motives other than curiosity, and the company would do him good. In the years to follow, Medivh would host many galas and his mood did indeed improve.\nDuring one such gala after Medivh opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Aegwynn arrived and confronted her son only to learn he was possessed by Sargeras. During their magical duel, Sargeras ripped the lives out of the hundreds of guests fleeing Karazhan with only Moroes spared. Afterward, Moroes seemed driven half-mad by what he had witnessed. Medivh - unaware of the full truth of what happened while Sargeras controlled him during the duel and thinking the guests' death was an accident - tried to ease Moroes's pain by erasing the memories of the event. But even so, Moroes was never the same again.\nThe Last Guardian.\nMoroes was described an oddly thin man, too thin. It made &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; think Medivh mutated animals to serve him. He was also ghostly in appearance, who wore horse blinders over his eyes in order to escape the wandering visions that plagued Medivh's tower. He described to Khadgar (who had traveled from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to serve as Medivh's apprentice) how he had seen a vision of himself breaking one of &lt;a href=\"Cook%20%28The%20Last%20Guardian%29\"&gt;Cook&lt;/a&gt;'s crystal dishes and \u2014 despite trying to avoid doing so \u2014 ended up shattering it anyway; he wore the blinders until the day he died. When Khadgar and Garona revealed the truth about Medivh, the apprentice told Moroes to take Cook and leave the tower. He gave them a whistle to summon a gryphon but did not leave as he had nowhere to go. He was killed by Medivh, who was in the final stages of madness, and was buried beside both his master and Cook at &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Morgan's Plot&lt;/a&gt; outside of Karazhan. It seemed that Moroes wasn't surprised that he was murdered by Medivh. However, Medivh later raised him as an undead creature as mad as his master was.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nHe is one of the first bosses encountered by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. He wields two wicked daggers when attacking and seems to have retained much of his personality during life since after wiping the raid he states Medivh will return from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe party he \"holds\" in the tower's Banquet Hall includes ghosts of relatives of &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; noblemen as guests. Names of all of the NPCs in the Hall, including &lt;a href=\"Ebonlocke\"&gt;Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; who refuses to take part in the festivities, can be found as names of notable citizens of the &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; town.\nMoroes attacked &lt;a href=\"Lieren\"&gt;Lieren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loania\"&gt;Loania&lt;/a&gt; at some point.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nMoroes is one of many possible old characters who can appear at the inn at the &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. After years of being killed only to be revived by some unseen force again and again, the chiefest of Moroes's many desires is now the comfort of true death.\nHe will settle, however, for a &lt;a href=\"Horribly%20Acidic%20Solution\"&gt;Horribly Acidic Solution&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Docks\"&gt;Iron Docks&lt;/a&gt; to help him clean the scuff marks left behind by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s in the Karazhan dining hall. In exchange, Moroes provides some of his &lt;a href=\"Moroes%27%20Famous%20Polish\"&gt;famous polish&lt;/a&gt;. He starts &lt;a href=\"Feeling%20A%20Bit%20Morose\"&gt;Feeling A Bit Morose&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Expensive\"&gt;Bloody Expensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nA &lt;a href=\"vision%20of%20Moroes\"&gt;vision of Moroes&lt;/a&gt; makes a cameo in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, offering a young Khadgar blinders just as in \"The Last Guardian\", when Khadgar reminisces of his apprenticeship under Medivh.\nSome time later, Moroes is overlooking the ruined village and killed &lt;a href=\"Apprentice%20Darius\"&gt;Apprentice Darius&lt;/a&gt;, while noticing the Legion forces marching into the tower. Moroes recognizes it as a sign of &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s return and the demons entered into the tower.\nWithin Karazhan, he comments that the master has not been himself of late and would think of \"drown his sorrows\" would make him feel better. Unfortunately, he was slain by the adventurers once again and said that it was an honor to serve.\nHe drops his &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Pocket%20Watch\"&gt;Broken Pocket Watch&lt;/a&gt; and in order to attempt to free him from this curse, the hero has to do various tasks at their order hall in order to set up a meal at &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Morgan's Plot&lt;/a&gt; for the dinner party. After the table is set up, the player rings the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Bell\"&gt;Master's Bell&lt;/a&gt; to call on the butler and tells him that his master is dead and no longer does he need to serve him. Moroes explains that the master still controls his physical body but the player says that his spirit is free to do what it wills. He then questions them if they need a servant, they said yes but not as a servant.\nMoroes then becomes a &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall%20followers\"&gt;Follower&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGarrisons.\nMay I take your cloak?

Several months later, he prepared a gryphon for Medivh who was to join the Stormwind army against the invading trolls in . While setting off, Moroes inquired about the fel research and offered the Guardian help. Medivh stated that the research will take years.\nWarcraft.\nWhen the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s on led and to Karazhan to summon Medivh, Moroes greeted them and guided them to his master, but as Medivh's exertions in battling the began to take their toll, Moroes pleaded with the Guardian to cease his travels to aid the forces of Stormwind, and instead stay within the tower.\nMoroes had known of his master's struggles with the fel for some time, and would aid him in recovering each time, believing that he would continue to succeed in mastering the corruption. After the tower's community of servants was sent away, Moroes did not seem entirely happy with his master's isolation, commenting on the arrival of Lothar that his familiar face would do the Guardian good.\nDespite his efforts to aid and assist his master, Moroes was unable to prevent Medivh from succumbing to the fel, although he did provide one last service, his soul being drained by the Guardian and used as fuel in the ritual to open the Azeroth side of the Dark Portal. Horrified by the final corruption of his master, Moroes' last wish was that he had died before the moment had ever come.\nSpeculation.\nSince he was affiliated with Kirin Tor, he could probably also be a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; but that's not stated or shown."}
{"id": "492785", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=492785", "title": "Moroes (tactics)", "text": "Moroes is Karazhan's steward and can be found tending to guests in the &lt;a href=\"Banquet%20Hall\"&gt;Banquet Hall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Karazhan%20%28raid%29\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Along with four special invited patrons, Moroes fights any uninvited guests to the death. Moroes is the second &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; and the first mandatory boss found in this raid instance, and his defeat allows access to the &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Event\"&gt;Opera Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nThe Moroes encounter tests your raid's ability to control several targets while also maintaining high DPS. Success requires a solid control strategy for his four dinner guests. If allowed to go free, they will quickly put an end to the &lt;a href=\"squishies\"&gt;squishies&lt;/a&gt;. Control must be established immediately on the pull and maintained throughout the fight.\nOnce control is established, the encounter becomes a race between the raid's damage output and the building damage caused by Garrote. Each time a Garrote is applied, the strain on the healers increases. Moroes must die before the healing needed becomes too much to handle.\nThe dinner guests (adds).\nMoroes has four different random dinner guests (&lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s), consisting of the members of &lt;a href=\"Nobles%20of%20Darkshire\"&gt;Noble House of Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, from the following list in every instance. Each add is based off a &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"spec\"&gt;spec&lt;/a&gt;. The following table lists them in a good kill order:\nEncounter priorities.\nThe encounter is very difficult, especially for first-timers, the more you do the encounter, the easier it becomes.\nIt is highly advised that you prioritize your kills, and the way you choose to organize your list is as the raid chooses, however, here is a list of the most common and easiest way to down the guests and Moroes:\n1) Healers: &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Catriona%20Von%27Indi\"&gt;Lady Catriona Von'Indi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Keira%20Berrybuck\"&gt;Lady Keira Berrybuck&lt;/a&gt; will constantly buff and heal the other guests, they will make the encounter much longer, which means more Garrotes, which results in a wipe.\n2) Mana Burner: &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Dorothea%20Millstipe\"&gt;Baroness Dorothea Millstipe&lt;/a&gt; will Mana Burn members of the raid, the last thing you need is her Mana burning the Healers.\n3) Stunner: &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rafe%20Dreuger\"&gt;Baron Rafe Dreuger&lt;/a&gt; will use Hammer of Justice, the stun can result in loss of aggro, which means you will lose control of the Baron, and he can go prattle with the rest of the group.\n4) Warrior: &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Robin%20Daris\"&gt;Lord Robin Daris&lt;/a&gt; will be the least of your problems after the preceding members are done with, and he should go down quickly, just make sure to stay out of his Melee range when he casts Whirlwind.\n5) The Pinnacle: Finally, take Moroes down before he Garrotes any more of you, Moroes will Enrage on 30% health, and will no longer cast any spells, so that shouldn't make much of a difference on the encounter. He should be downed last if Lord Crispin Ference is not one of the guests.\n6) Survivalist: &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Crispin%20Ference\"&gt;Lord Crispin Ference&lt;/a&gt; takes a really long time to kill, and thus should be that last on your priority list, just make sure Moroes is down when you decide to attack him\nAs many adds as possible should be &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;led. The adds can be controlled with the priest's &lt;a href=\"Shackle%20Undead\"&gt;Shackle Undead&lt;/a&gt;, the paladin's &lt;a href=\"Turn%20Evil\"&gt;Turn Evil&lt;/a&gt;, the hunter's &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt;, off-tanking, snares (with kiting), and stuns. Be careful when using a paladin to fear the adds, since if an add exits the room, the encounter resets.\nShackles can be maintained until Moroes is dead. Adds for which no shackle is available should usually be killed before Moroes. One good sequence is to follow the above list from top to bottom - the priests have the least health and require no tank, the paladins can dispel, and the warriors take longer to kill due to their high health (particularly Ference).\nGarrote.\nMoroes vanishes every 30 seconds, and upon return randomly Garrotes a raid member. Garrote is a bleed effect and deals 1,000 damage every three seconds for 300 seconds (5 minutes, for a total of 100,000 damage). After he garrotes, Moroes immediately returns to the highest threat target. Garrote can be removed by the following abilities only:\nSince the possibilities to remove Garrote are limited, there is no choice but to heal through it on most raid members. One active HoT from a well-equipped healer should be enough. Group heals work well when multiple targets are garroted.\nIn theory, all Garrotes are automatically removed when Moroes is defeated. However, sometimes they persist even after Moroes dies. Resetting the encounter does \"not\" remove Garrotes.\nDying from Garrote does not inflict a durability loss penalty. It is a good idea to plan ahead (while clearing other bosses) and save all combat resurrection cooldowns for Moroes. Do not cast soulstones before the encounter, but wait until an important target is garroted, and only then soulstone. This method of garrote removal has the advantage that the resurrection restores some mana. If a raid member is garroted and a combat resurrection is planned, the player should quickly spend all his mana, then just die and be resurrected.\nIf possible, Garrote should always be removed from a priest that is maintaining a shackle. All healers are important too. Damage-dealing classes should be cured only towards the end of the fight, while the tanks should never get the Garrote removed \u2014 they are the main heal targets anyways, and the Garrote breaks the Gouge.\nGouge and the tanks.\nGenerally, two tanks are needed on Moroes. The off-tank must always be second on the threat list, because Moroes periodically gouges the main tank then turns to his target with the second-highest threat. This must be the off-tank. However, it is possible to avoid the gouge by turning your back to him, and backing up slowly until you can use your attacks.\nSince the off-tank gets hit only while the main-tank is Gouged, rage may be a problem. To counter rage-starvation, the off-tank can grab one of the adds to act as a rage battery. This also controls that add.\nIf available, a third tank can handle the adds that require tanking, or one of the two Moroes tanks can do the job.\nAs a variant, a paladin can tank Moroes and all four adds. The paladin firsts casts Blessing of Sacrifice on a temporary off-tank (or a warlock who can then use Hellfire to cause the paladin some damage) and later on a Garrote victim. This breaks Gouge as soon as the Garrote ticks or the hellfire passes some damage. If Baron Rafe Dreuger is present, the raid stun-locks, silences, and kills him quickly, so that he cannot stun the tank.\nDealing with Blind.\nMoroes casts Blind on his closest enemy that is not his current target. This is a poison-based disorient effect that causes the victim to temporarily lose aggro and wander aimlessly for ten seconds. It is broken by damage. It is devastating if Moroes Blinds the off-tank then Gouges the main tank, as he will then generally attack a healer.\nTo avoid this, assign a non-tank character to stand on top of Moroes at all times. This character takes the Blinds instead of the off-tank.\nNaturally, paladins, druids, and shamans should remove the Blind effect. Shamans should keep down a &lt;a href=\"Poison%20Cleansing%20Totem\"&gt;Poison Cleansing Totem&lt;/a&gt; to help with this.\nPreparing for battle.\nGiven the random nature of the adds and the raid's composition, every Moroes fight is different. The raid must make a plan before the pull and stick with it. This fight requires more planning than anything that comes before it in the game.\nExecuting the fight.\nOnce a plan is established, it's time to execute it.\nPull Moroes, kill targets, and off-tank targets to one side of the room. Pull shackle and trap targets to the other side and control them there. This makes it less likely for the crowd-control to break from AoE attacks, dispels, or cleanses. The tanks generate threat on Moroes and any off-tank targets, while the controllers shackle or trap, then switch to healing or attacking as quickly as possible.\nUse all cooldown abilities available to attack and kill the first target as quickly as possible. The fight becomes considerably easier to control once one or two targets die. There's no reason to save damage-dealing cooldowns for Moroes. Focus fire on the planned kill targets, in order, until Moroes dies.\nThe tank calls out when he is gouged, so that healers can switch focus to the off-tank.\nAnyone who is controlling an add calls out when there is a problem so that someone else can help.\nOnce all non-shackled adds are killed, the raid may kill Moroes next to speed up the fight and reduce the pressure from multiple garrotes, or kill the shackled adds to remove the risk of them getting loose and causing trouble.\nAfter Moroes is dead, the raid may kill any remaining adds or despawn them by leaving the room.\nClass specific tips.\nPaladin.\nPaladins should use Divine Shield to remove Garrote from themselves. They can use Blessing of Protection to remove it from important raid members it lands on, generally priests. A reduced cooldown on Blessing of Protection (&lt;a href=\"Guardian%27s%20Favor\"&gt;Guardian's Favor&lt;/a&gt;) is a big bonus in this fight.\nPaladins can use Blessing of Sacrifice on a Garroted party member or the off-tank to mitigate the damage. This can make a difference for low-health casters and breaks Gouge on paladin tanks. \nWhile Turn Evil is not reliable long-term crowd-control, it is useful to protect healers and other crowd-controllers, should a target get loose. To avoid resetting the encounter, do not use it near either of the entrances to the room.\nA paladin that is assigned to crowd-control duties can use one of the following macros to cast Turn Evil without losing his current target:\n /cast [target=Lord Robin Daris] Turn Evil\n /clearfocus [modifier:shift] [target=focus,dead] [target=focus,noexists] \n /focus [target=focus,noexists] \n /script SetRaidTarget(\"focus\", 1) \n /cast [target=focus] Turn Evil\nSee &lt;a href=\"Useful%20macros/Priest%23Shackle%20Undead%20and%20focus%20on%20target\"&gt;Useful Priest Macros&lt;/a&gt; for detailed examples and explanation.\nPriest.\nShadow priests generally have more spell hit than Holy Priests, and are thus better at maintaining Shackles. Re-cast the shackle every ten seconds or so to reduce the possibility of a target getting loose. If a shackle target does get loose, make sure to call for help.\nThe following macros are useful for casting the shackle without losing your current target:\n /cast [target=Lord Robin Daris] shackle undead\n /clearfocus [modifier:shift] [target=focus,dead] [target=focus,noexists] \n /focus [target=focus,noexists] \n /script SetRaidTarget(\"focus\", 1) \n /cast [target=focus] Shackle Undead\nSee &lt;a href=\"Useful%20macros/Priest%23Shackle%20Undead%20and%20focus%20on%20target\"&gt;Useful priest macros&lt;/a&gt; for detailed examples and explanation.\nAn addon called &lt;a href=\"UberShackle\"&gt;UberShackle&lt;/a&gt; can also be helpful in reshackling Moroes adds.\nWarlock.\nThe following macro will allow a warlock &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; to build threat on a shackle target without breaking the shackle. If the shackle breaks, the target will attack the Voidwalker instead of the priest.\n /clearfocus [modifier:alt]\n /focus [target=focus,noexists]; [target=focus,dead]\n /clearfocus [target=focus,help]\n /petstay\n /petfollow\n /cast [pet:voidwalker,target=focus,exists,harm] Torment; Torment\nHit the macro while holding down the alt key to set the focus. Keep the Voidwalker in passive, and repeatedly hit this macro during the fight to use the &lt;a href=\"Torment\"&gt;Torment&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Tongues\"&gt;Curse of Tongues&lt;/a&gt; on the caster adds to slow down mana burn and heal spells.\nHunter.\nHunters can chain-trap one add indefinitely. This is made easier by survival talents or the &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Lord%20Armor\"&gt;Beast Lord Armor&lt;/a&gt; set bonus. They can also kite.\nHowever, given the importance of high damage output in this fight, it is not always a good idea to trap or kite for a long time. If the hunter is busy trapping, he can't put out as much damage. It may be best to pull a target into a trap, drop a second trap, and trust in an off-tank to pick up the trap target before the second trap breaks.\nHunters can use &lt;a href=\"Misdirection\"&gt;Misdirection&lt;/a&gt; to help the off-tank maintain threat on Moroes.\nHunters can drop a Freezing Trap on any (player) priest that is keeping a target shackled. If the shackle breaks, this will give the priest time to re-shackle the target instead of taking hits.\nHunter pets specced for armor and stamina can tank kill targets, so long as they get heals.\nWarrior.\nAny spec of warrior can off-tank Moroes and tank kill targets.\nIntervene does not appear to catch Garrote.\nShaman.\nShamans should drop Poison Cleansing Totems to get rid of Blind. They should also be prepared to die and reincarnate if they get Garroted.\nDruid.\nDruids can switch into bear form and use Growl to protect any healers or crowd-controllers that get unwanted attention. They should generally save their Rebirth battle resurrection for priests that are maintaining shackles.\nMage.\nMages can and should use Ice Block to get rid of Garrote.\nRogue.\nUse &lt;a href=\"Numbing%20Poison\"&gt;Numbing Poison&lt;/a&gt; on the caster adds to slow down mana burns and heals."}

Raid members with 9k health or more can survive a combination of earthquake and watery grave without being healed - this is nice to have, but not absolutely necessary.\nThis fight is aggro sensitive, thus &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Salvation\"&gt;Blessing of Salvation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tranquil%20Air%20Totem%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tranquil Air Totem (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; should be used liberally.\nSetup.\nThe raid should stay well away from the waterfalls, so that nobody takes collateral damage from watery graves. A good spot is on top of the stairs to the next room. It's possible to sneak past the boss and pull him from there. Morogrim should be tanked upstairs on the platform. Two healers should be designated to take care of the watery grave victims and set up downstairs, the paladin tank, a \"heal aggro\" warlock and a healer for the paladin can set up at the bottom of the stairs too.\nThe raid sets up at the edge of the platform on top of the stairs, so that the ranged damage dealers can switch from Morogrim to the murlocs just by rotating in place.\nMurloc waves.\nThe main problem in this fight is to control the murlocs after the earthquakes. All raid members must be careful not to draw murloc aggro, particularly healers should resist their urge to immediately get the earthquake damage under control. After the tanks have solid aggro, the murlocs are killed by &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Seed of Corruption&lt;/a&gt;.\nPaladin Tank.\nA paladin is the best choice to tank the murlocs, he should need only about 5 seconds to build solid aggro on all murlocs. To maximize the paladins healing aggro, one warlock can be designated as heal target for him. That warlock should &lt;a href=\"Lifetap\"&gt;Lifetap&lt;/a&gt; to keep his health low, and since warlocks can increase the healing they receive, spamming max rank &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Light%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Holy Light (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Righteous%20Fury\"&gt;Righteous Fury&lt;/a&gt; generates a lot of healing aggro.\nNon-Paladin Tank.\nIn this case a few druids and/or warriors have to do the job. To give them more time to build aggro, the murlocs can be slowed down with &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Trap\"&gt;Frost Trap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Piercing%20Howl\"&gt;Piercing Howl&lt;/a&gt;. The basic principle remains the same.\nHealer Tanking.\nIf none of the above two methods work, it's also possible to use the healers as a sort of kiters. The mages and warlocks set up an AoE kill zone north of the stairs. All healers stay directly south of that zone, and spam heal like mad. The murlocs spawning in the north run through the kill zone when trying to reach the healers, and simply die. When all northern murlocs are dead, the healers move through the AoE to the north, so that the southern murloc group meets the same fate.\nGlobules.\nWhen Morogrim starts to summon these, the raid should just reposition out of globule range (inside the doorway to the next room). Globules damage can be entirely avoided. His next ability is Tidal Wave, which deals unavoidable damage and inflicts a de-buff that reduces attack speed by 400%. This is particularly debilitating to Death Knights, as it seriously slows their rune regeneration rate.\nSoloing Morogrim Tidewalker.\nThis is a relatively simple encounter, with little damage being taken by the player.\nAs Morogrim does not target the person highest on the threat list with Watery Grave, that spell is never cast when players solo him.\nHe will occasionally cast Earthquake, dealing unavoidable damage and attracting the attention of packs of murlocs. Simply use &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; on the murlocs and continue attacking Morogrim.\nWhen he reaches 25% health, he will start summoning Watery Globules that will move towards you and burst for 6000 damage each. Simply kite Morogrim away from the Watery Globules, deal with incoming murlocs and continue to whittle down his health.\nHe drops 250 gold, 3 &lt;a href=\"Tier%205\"&gt;Tier 5&lt;/a&gt; tokens and 1 epic item."}

Unnatural phenomena are corrupting and destroying the marsh's native flora and fauna. This disturbance has been traced to the foreboding Coilfang Reservoir. It is rumored that the leader of this mysterious edifice is none other than the infamous Lady Vashj. Only you can discover her nefarious plans and stop them before it's too late. Coilfang Reservoir is divided into four areas, three of which are five-man dungeons (the Slave Pens, the Underbog, and the Steamvault), in addition to the 25-man raid dungeon, Serpentshrine Cavern.\"\nCoilfang Reservoir is the name for a naga-dominated compound that lurks under Zangarmarsh's deepest waters. The reservoir, punctured throughout by massive open pipes and pistons, seems big enough to house armies - and, yet, its purpose isn't strictly military. \nHere, concealed by the cold fathoms, Lady Vashj's naga ply their resources - the exotic flora and fauna of the cavernous Underbog, the Broken who toil in their claustrophobic Slave Pens, and the arcane machinery they've constructed in the Steamvault - towards a catastrophic goal set forth by Illidan the Betrayer. Unopposed, they will drain Zangarmarsh's waters, and claim dominion over the dry bog that remains."}

Instead of fighting or fleeing, Kel'Thuzad decided to cooperate and become the apprentice to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and \"with enough training, he could surpass the necromancer or catch the man off guard.\" The wraiths teleported Kel'thuzad inside the citadel, they led him into a cavern with stairs, the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, where they began to ascend. At the top, he found an ice block instead of a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, it was the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.

If the Borean Tundra is already a place of inhospitable cold, the brittle air of Coldarra is far beyond that. The island rises high above the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt;, presenting high, craggy cliffs in all directions and no way in without flying. It's always covered in snow, maybe because of a trick of ocean currents. This is the ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Spell-Weaver&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWhen Malygos, lost most of his dragonflight during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, killed by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, he hid out in Coldarra for thousands of years, slowly going mad.\nPrior to the Nexus War, rifts that seeped magical energy opened up in the island's face and beneath the water around it, a sign of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;'s plotting that set off little quakes up and down the coast.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, the blue dragonflight spread to nearby regions of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, while Coldarra was used as a place to train the ones who hatch to fight. The Kirin Tor also set up a camp on the edge of Coldarra called &lt;a href=\"Transitus%20Shield\"&gt;Transitus Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; judged that all the mortal spellcasters around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; were using too much &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, he decided to fix this problem his way, by imprisoning and destroying all mortal &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and realigning the flow of magic to point toward Coldarra.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; arrived to Coldarra, but was stopped by a patrolling &lt;a href=\"Tarecgosa\"&gt;Tarecgosa&lt;/a&gt;, stating that Coldarra was no place for mortals.\nDuring the event of the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt; at the center of Coldarra, in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; became the new leader of the blue dragonflight.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, areas around the Nexus were besieged by &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; projections. The area was defended by &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; and an adventurer.\nGetting there.\nColdarra is only accessible via flying mount or via the &lt;a href=\"flight%20point\"&gt;flight point&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Ledge\"&gt;Amber Ledge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Beryl%20Point\"&gt;Beryl Point&lt;/a&gt;. This flight point becomes accessible only after completing the quest &lt;a href=\"Nick%20of%20Time\"&gt;Nick of Time&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Too%20Close%20For%20Comfort\"&gt;Too Close For Comfort&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nColdarra is the most isolated part and the only inhabited island in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The only access point is a bridge called the &lt;a href=\"Frostbridge\"&gt;Frostbridge&lt;/a&gt; that runs across the &lt;a href=\"Westrift\"&gt;Westrift&lt;/a&gt;, and to get across it you have to gain the permission of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s guarding it. No one sets foot on Coldarra unannounced or uninvited. The nearest region to the island is the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; located to the east across the Westrift.\nColdarra is an irresistible lure for &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, is unquestionably the most powerful &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spellcaster\"&gt;spellcaster&lt;/a&gt; in all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and designed not only most spells but the theories behind them. His libraries could make any &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; powerful beyond their dreams, and even a few words with the ancient blue dragon could grant power and wisdom most mortals never achieve.\nDescription.\nColdarra is a suiting name for this island as it is entirely made of ice, with great jagged peaks that rise from the cold ocean like pale blue fangs. Some of those peaks rise high enough that you can see all the way to &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; and even to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Although it seems a harsh place, &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s live here. Probably the cold doesn't bother them as they are the only inhabitants in the island, with the exception of the occasional &lt;a href=\"sheep\"&gt;sheep&lt;/a&gt; or mountain &lt;a href=\"goat\"&gt;goat&lt;/a&gt;. Rumors say that visitors sometimes stay to study with Malygos or record his tales, but no one settles permanently as the dragons don't allow it. This also means Coldarra has no &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; presence whatsoever. Even the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; probably knows better than to invade this place as he wouldn't gain much by trying, plus he might anger the dragons into retaliating. So the Scourge stays on the mainland and the dragons live in peace with their thoughts and their magic and their icy cliffs.\nHistory.\nThe blue dragons say Malygos, the oldest and greatest of their kind, created the spells that set the sky and the earth into motion. Harnessing the world's &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and developing these spells took millennia. He settled in some icy cliffs during that time, a place that would be later known as Coldarra. Other blue dragons joined him, though many lived elsewhere in the north. Then the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; attacked the blue dragons, slaughtering them by the dozens. The survivors fought back but were no match for Deathwing's ferocity. In the process, their homes were destroyed and the land so damaged it could never recover. That area became the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and Malygos, in his rage and grief, split his home from the rest of the land, creating the gap later named the &lt;a href=\"Westrift\"&gt;Westrift&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remainder of the blue dragon race settled on Malygos's island, which they named Coldarra, and carved out homes of their own. They gave up the war against Deathwing and the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and chose to withdraw from the world. Soon they lost themselves in study, though they always look toward the Dragonblight and the spirits of their kin still lingering there.\nThere is an old &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; legend that says at some point a few centuries back, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; came to Coldarra to see Malygos. This man was a &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt; and wished to exchange ideas. The great dragon chose to see him, and had the man flown to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. For months they communed and formed a great friendship, but then the man returned to the world and his duties. He came back several times, however, and finally Malygos ordered a &lt;a href=\"Frostbridge\"&gt;bridge&lt;/a&gt; fashioned across the Westrift so his friend could approach unaided.\nGeography.\nColdarra is a large island and it is roughly a third as long as the mainland, though only as wide as the tip of the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. Coldarra has no beaches and no gentle shore \u2014 its edges rear up as cliffs from the surrounding water. Most of the island is rock covered by thick ice, though here and there enough dirt has gathered to produce tough grass or small bushes. The dragons themselves live in caves fashioned from the cliffs and mountains, or in handsome stone buildings carved into the peaks. The island has no roads or bridges, save the &lt;a href=\"Frostbridge\"&gt;Frostbridge&lt;/a&gt; that links to the mainland. Dragons fly everywhere, and carry guests from place to place. An experienced climber could scale the peaks, though, if he had their permission or somehow evaded their notice.\nColdarra has only one real settlement, the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;, an extensive series of caves and tunnels that riddle the region and home to the blue dragonflight. Since blue dragons are solitary creatures, they prefer to live alone and meet only for discussion, flight or mating. The solely exception to the dragons' solitary existence is the Nexus, which is also Malygos's home and the dragons' center of knowledge.\nA cure for the Scourge?\nAn ancient scroll found in a Northrend ruin mentions a spell that can remove &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; from a huge number of creatures at the same time, laying the undead creatures permanently to rest. Such a spell could rid the world of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; for good and strip the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; of his power. The scroll has no details, but if such a spell does exist the blue dragons of Coldarra may know about it, and possibly even have it. All that would remain would be to gain access to the island and ask them \u2014 or, barring that, sneak onto the island unnoticed, then sneak into the Nexus and search for the spell without getting caught.\nSpeculation.\nColdarra is a portmanteau of \"cold\" and \"caldera\" suggesting that maybe long ago, before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; formed into an arctic tundra, it was the site of a large volcanic crater. Or perhaps it was simply a volcano that erupted during the Sundering and formed into a caldera. It is unclear whether the volcano itself is dormant, but given extreme damage sustained by the Sundering, the molten cavity could have collapsed there by rendering Coldarra completely lifeless."}

It is an important bunker as it stands on top of the hill guarding the &lt;a href=\"Icewing%20Chokepoint\"&gt;Icewing Chokepoint&lt;/a&gt;, the first chokepoint in alliance territory which the horde must pass.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Bunker\"&gt;Stonehearth Bunker&lt;/a&gt;, it is protected by 4 &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Bowman\"&gt;Stormpike Bowmen&lt;/a&gt;. There are no archers on the ground floor, all are located at the top of the bunker. The archers can often be taken out from outside the bunker by ranged horde players (hunters, priests, warlocks) - something not always possible for the horde towers due to the fact that horde towers are taller with the archers located at the top. It takes 4 minutes to fully capture and destroy the bunker. The archers will respawn after a length of time, if the bunker remains under alliance control.\nIt is not uncommon for a few horde players to capture the bunker whist the rest of the horde players assault &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Outpost\"&gt;Stonehearth Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Bunker\"&gt;Stonehearth Bunker&lt;/a&gt; - the latter clearly visible from the bunker, just at the bottom of the hill a short distance away. However, horde players attempting to capture Icewing Bunker must be aware that &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Graveyard\"&gt;Stonehearth Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; is found just southeast of the bunker, also in a visible range \u2013 making the defence of Icewing Bunker relatively easy when the graveyard is under alliance control unless a fairly strong horde force is able to stall and hold them off. Because of this, any horde players that are attempting to capture bunkers solo should avoid this bunker and instead, travel further north towards &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Baldar\"&gt;Dun Baldar&lt;/a&gt;. However, once &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Graveyard\"&gt;Stonehearth Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; is taken by the horde, the defenses can be easily overcome.\n&lt;a href=\"Wing%20Commander%20Guse\"&gt;Wing Commander Guse&lt;/a&gt;.\nIcewing Bunker holds the captured horde &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Commander%20Guse\"&gt;Wing Commander Guse&lt;/a&gt;. When a horde player talks to &lt;a href=\"Guse\"&gt;Guse&lt;/a&gt;, they can rescue and send her back to &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Village&lt;/a&gt;. If she safely arrives back to &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Village\"&gt;Frostwolf Village&lt;/a&gt; horde players will be able to turn in &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Soldier%27s%20Flesh\"&gt;Stormpike Soldier's Flesh&lt;/a&gt; (150 in total) to enable an aerial assault. &lt;a href=\"Guse\"&gt;Guse&lt;/a&gt; will attack &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Graveyard\"&gt;Stormpike Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; with enough &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Soldier%27s%20Flesh\"&gt;Stormpike Soldier's Flesh&lt;/a&gt; turned in, and her &lt;a href=\"War%20Rider\"&gt;War Rider&lt;/a&gt; scout beacon is placed in the east &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Field of Strife&lt;/a&gt; crater.\n Horde Quest: &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20Air%20-%20Guse%27s%20Fleet\"&gt;Call of Air - Guse's Fleet&lt;/a&gt;"}

{"id": "190489", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=190489", "title": "Ichoron", "text": "Ichoron is a &lt;a href=\"Revenant%23Revenant%20types\"&gt;water revenant&lt;/a&gt; boss located in &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;. If released, she is one of the first two bosses in the instance. The releases are random, so it is possible that you will not fight her.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"A foolish apprentice summoned this revenant from the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, only to discover that disgruntled soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s make poor pets. Ichoron slew her would-be master and has rotted in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt; ever since, eager to wreak vengeance on her jailors.\"\nStrategy.\nIchoron initially comes out with a \"Protective Shield\" buff with 35 charges that reduces any damage by 99%. Any attack or spell hit made on Ichoron will remove one charge. When all of the charges are gone, her shield will erupt, costing her 30% (170K on heroic) of her total health. The eruption will also knock nearby players back, causing damage. She will become untargetable and about ten low-health &lt;a href=\"Ichor%20Globule\"&gt;Ichor Globule&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn around the room and move directly toward her. When a Globule reaches her or when there are no Globules left alive, she will become targetable again. This cycle will repeat: 35 Charges, Shield Eruption, Globules summoned.\nEach Globule that reaches her once she is up will restore a small percentage of HP. Killing the Globules causes them to erupt, dealing damage and knocking back nearby players.\nWhen she goes below 25% health (which is usually after three cycles) she will no longer have a shield or summon Globules, but will enrage, hitting hard. This final phase is a simple DPS race.\nTanking spots.\nA good spot to tank Ichoron is up the stairs to the back of the platform by the entrance. This bottlenecks incoming Globules, making them much easier to AoE down and giving them farther to run. Another suitable spot is in the pool which Ichoron emerges from, as no Globules spawn there. These locations also work in combination with the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Control%20Crystal\"&gt;Defense Control Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nShield phase.\nDuring the shield phase Ichoron is practically immune from damage. Tanks will want to focus on abilities that directly give aggro, and not depend on abilities that require damage done to gain aggro. DPS should use quick-hitting attacks, rather than slow attacks with high damage, as what counts in this phase is the number of attacks, not the damage done.\nGlobules phase.\nWhen the Globules spawn, they should be stopped from reaching Ichoron. Because they explode when they die, players should avoid being close to them. The Globules die easily, and can either be killed with the &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Control%20Crystal\"&gt;Defense Control Crystal&lt;/a&gt;s or with DPS.\nUsing the crystals requires some coordination: one player should be assigned to activate a crystal at the right moment, and the other players should be aware that the crystals will be used. Activating a Defense Control Crystal after Ichoron's bubble pops will kill all Globules and, if timed right, can stop any from reaching her. The crystals are the key to the Heroic achievement &lt;a href=\"Dehydration\"&gt;Dehydration&lt;/a&gt;. Note that using a crystal will cause all of the Globules to explode at the same time and can kill players if they are close to a group of Globules.\nUsing DPS requires a good tanking spot and well aimed, preferably ranged, AoE and other quick damage. The advantage is that it does not require any coordination, though players should still keep their distance from the Globules. \nWhen Ichoron resurfaces (because a Globule reached her or all Globules were killed), the tank should pick her up again as quickly as possible.\nFinal phase.\nThe final phase is a straightforward &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;. Because there is no more shield, tanks can use their normal methods of holding aggro again.\nNotes.\nIchoron's Protective Bubble severely reduces tank and DPS aggro, but does not reduce healer aggro.\nFrost Resistance helps reducing the damage from the attacks by Ichoron.\nUsing a &lt;a href=\"Defense%20Control%20Crystal\"&gt;Defense Control Crystal&lt;/a&gt; will block the &lt;a href=\"Defenseless\"&gt;Defenseless&lt;/a&gt; achievement in Heroic. This is no a great drawback, as players will have plenty of opportunities to get this achievement in runs that do not involve Ichoron.\nIn Hearthstone.\nIchoron appears as that can be encountered in the single-player experience in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "109899", "revid": "40286632", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=109899", "title": "Identifying buffs using textures", "text": "In some circumstances, it may be benefecial to use spell textures, rather than names, to identify buff and debuff effects - textures require no additional localization, while buff names will require to be localized for every language your addon should support. This HOWTO describes an easy mechanism to find out if a certain unit is affected by a specific buff or debuff.\nIterating buff / debuffs.\nWhile we could write separate functions for buffs and debuffs, it's easier to write a single \"iterator\" function and pass the desired spell effect type as an argument - effectively cutting down the amount of code required for the whole routine. We can get the buff's texture from &lt;a href=\"API%20UnitBuff\"&gt;UnitBuff&lt;/a&gt; and debuffs from &lt;a href=\"API%20UnitDebuff\"&gt;UnitDebuff&lt;/a&gt;:\n name, rank, iconTexture, count, duration, timeLeft = UnitBuff(unit, buffIndex [, castable]);\n name, rank, texture, count, debuffType, duration, timeLeft = UnitDebuff(unitID, debuffIndex [, removable]);\nThe effect's texture is the third return value of both functions, but UnitDebuff has one more return value - which means that we'll need to store all seven return values in order to return them. \"Castable\" and \"removable\" arguments allow us to save iterations of the loop if we're only interested in buffs/debuffs the player can cast/remove, so we should allow access to those from the iterator function. For both functions, index starts at 1 and goes up until the function returns nil -- while a while loop is ideal, we can use an infinite loop, and call break; when nil is encountered to save iterator calls. So far, our inner iterator loop would look something like:\n qFunc, unit, castable, id, match = UnitBuff, \"player\", 1, nil, \"SomeEffectTexture\"; --\n while true do\n local name, rank, texture, count, type, duration, timeleft = qFunc(unit, id, castable); -- note UnitDebuff returns; we simply don't care about the names at this point, but we need all seven.\n if not name then\n break; -- There are no more buffs / debuffs, exit infinite loop\n end\n if string.match(texture, match) then\n return name, rank, texture, count, type, duration, timeleft; -- We've found a match\n end\n i = i + 1; -- Go for the next index\n end\nThis would tell return the proper UnitBuff/UnitDebuff returns if the target is affected by a matching buff/debuff, or nil if it's not. Stopping here is good enough; we can, however, make things even better by allowing you to detect multiple textures with the same texture by using another index argument, and then decrementing it on matching effects until we hit zero, returning the found buff entry. Everything combined, the iterator function is:\n function iterateQueriableEffect(qFunc, unit, matchTexture, id, castable)\n id = id or 1; -- default value, making id optional;\n while true do\n local name, rank, texture, count, type, duration, timeleft = qFunc(unit, id, castable);\n if not name then\n break;\n end\n if string.match(texture, matchTexture) then\n id = id - 1;\n if id == 0 then\n return name, rank, texture, count, type, duration, timeleft;\n end\n end\n end\n end\nUsing the iterator function to query effects.\nWith the background code written, we can now use it to query actual effects. Wowpedia has a list of &lt;a href=\"Queriable%20buff%20effects\"&gt;buff and debuff textures&lt;/a&gt; with associated names; suppose we wanted to know whether the player is buffed with Mark of the Wild: motw is a buff (so we need UnitBuff), player's unitid is \"player\":\n name, rank, texture, count, duration, timeLeft = iterateQueriableEffect(UnitBuff, \"player\", \"Spell_Nature_Regeneration\");\n if name then\n message(\"Player is buffed with \" .. name .. \" (\" .. rank .. \")\");\n else\n message(\"Player is not buffed with Mark of the Wild.\");\n end\nOr if we wanted to know whether the target is sapped(UnitDebuff, \"target\"):\n name, rank, texture, count, debuffType, duration, timeLeft = iterateQueriableEffect(UnitDebuff, \"target\", \"Ability_Sap\");\n message(name and \"Target is sapped!\" or \"Target is not sapped\"); -- shorthand if syntax -- if name is non-false and non-nil, the first message appears, otherwise, the second.\nOther interesting uses.\nYou can find out whether the unit is affected by a debuff you can remove (by using the castable argument, which doubles up as removable for debuffs):\n name, rank, texture, count, debuffType, duration, timeLeft = iterateQueriableEffect(UnitDebuff, unit, \".\", 1, true); -- \".\" matches all textures, so we only have to get a return from UnitDebuff(unit, id, true) for this to return something.\nYou can also use the id argument to find all buffs/debuffs with the same texture on target; for example, \"Spell_Fire_FireArmor\" is used for almost all fire-shield effects - Fire Ward, greater protection potions, warlock imps' fire thorns spell... suppose you wanted to iterate through them:\n local i, out = 1, \"\";\n while true do\n local name, rank = iterateQueriableEffect(UnitBuff, unit, \"Spell_Fire_FireArmor\", i);\n if not name then break; end\n out = out .. (out == \" and \" or \", \") .. name;\n end\n message(\"Following debuffs on unit share Spell_Fire_FireArmor texture: \" .. out);\nNote that the last example is somewhat inefficient - you would be better off acquiring all the buff names in a single local loop rather than iterating through buffs multiple times to find all occurrences of a certain texture.\nList of buff textures.\nSorry for putting some German text in here but I don't know the English client's equivalents. Feel free to change them to the English ones.\nIn general, it's not the effects name, it's the icon's name; Demon Skin and Demon Armor is therefore virtually the same. This can be useful because it will not require an update when the Rank value changes.\nMacro for querying in-game.\ncodice_1\nResults in something along the lines of:\n B 1: Interface\\Icons\\Spell_Holy_WordFortitude\n D 1: Interface\\Icons\\Ability_Gouge\n B 2: Interface\\Icons\\INV_Jewelry_Talisman_07"}

The Idol is shaped like and connected to a &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and connects Broll with the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"pitlord\"&gt;pitlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; attacked Broll with &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel energy&lt;/a&gt;. When Broll fell he dropped the idol, and it is said that Azgalor struck the idol with his sword, &lt;a href=\"Spite\"&gt;Spite&lt;/a&gt;, and infused it with fel energy. Broll's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Anessa\"&gt;Anessa&lt;/a&gt;, tried to save Broll from the corrupting energies of the idol, but she was too late, the idol exploded and killed her instantly. After the battle Broll felt it was his fault that his daughter had died; his grief and fury caused the spirits of the wild to abandon him: the &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"crow\"&gt;crow&lt;/a&gt;. But one spirit remained with him, the spirit of the &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted by fel magic and feeding Broll's rage.\nThe corrupted Idol of Remulos was thought lost by Broll and the Druids. However, Broll found out at &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; that the corrupted Idol had been retrieved by the &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20tribe\"&gt;Thistlefur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, corrupting them. For this matter, Broll and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'gosh&lt;/a&gt; flew with help of the &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sharptalon\"&gt;Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20Hold\"&gt;Thistlefur Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to cleanse the corrupted idol of its fel energies. They eventually succeeded in cleansing the idol, but only after battling the green dragon that was linked to the idol, and a horde of corrupted furbolgs. In cleansing the idol, Broll was able to once again commune with the other spirits of the wild and soothe his rage.\nBroll and Lo'Gosh brought the idol to &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted to make sure that it truly had been cleansed. After studying the idol, he decided that it would be best if Broll left the idol with him in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nFandral later attempted to use the idol to heal &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;'s various &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;plights&lt;/a&gt;, only to be spurned by &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; himself. Deciding the Idol would be integral to saving Malfurion Stormrage from the &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Nightmare Lord&lt;/a&gt;, Broll stole the Idol. After travelling with &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lucan%20Foxblood\"&gt;Lucan Foxblood&lt;/a&gt;, the three of them discovered that it was &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; who had loaned his power to craft the Idol."}

He wielded the blade &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, meaning \"troll slayer\" in the ancient human tongue.\nBiography.\nIgnaeus and his people originally dwelled among the slopes of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. Arathor's founders, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;King Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi tribe&lt;/a&gt;, struggled for weeks to conquer the Alteraci. Thoradin was confident he could eventually conquer the tribe, but decided to change his tactics to prevent needless bloodshed and marched up the mountain with only his greatsword &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt; in hand to challenge Ignaeus to a duel. Before long, Ignaeus emerged from the forest, his skin dyed red with his own tribal markings and his blade sharpened and hungry for death. He dwarfed Thoradin in size and strength, but the Arathi leader had intentionally chosen the duel on a day when the mountains were enveloped in thick fog. Thoradin used the weather to his advantage to avoid Ignaeus' swings and disarm his foe. Rather than killing his opponent, Thoradin then plunged Strom'kar into the earth and extended the hand of peace, thereby winning the Alteraci to his side.\nAfter Thoradin united the human tribes into the nation of Arathor and founded the capital of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; began encroaching on Arathor's borders. Thoradin sent two of his most prominent generals\u2014Ignaeus and &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to to gather intelligence on their foe and prevent the trolls from straying too deep into the empire. Ignaeus and his northlanders stalked well beyond Arathor's borders, slaughtering any trolls they came across. Ignaeus earned the name \"Trollbane\" for the amount of Amani blood he spilled. During the Troll Wars, Ignaeus and Lordain acted as the vanguards of Arathor's armies, and the Alteraci leader became famous for riding into battle with Trol'kalar in hand.\nAfter the departure of Thoradin's ruling descendants one thousand years or so after Strom's founding, Ignaeus' descendants\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%20family\"&gt;Trollbane family&lt;/a&gt;\u2014ascended to the throne by rebuilding Strom's crumbling infrastructure and renamed it &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;."}

It was created eons ago by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; for the purpose of imprisoning most of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"air%20elemental\"&gt;air elemental&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s defeated the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, their servants, the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, were banished to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, a prison where they were contained to protect the new world from their chaotic nature. Imprisoned for all the eternity, the different &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Lord\"&gt;Elemental Lord&lt;/a&gt;s fought each other, until each of them claimed a portion of the plane for themselves. The domain of the &lt;a href=\"air%20elemental\"&gt;air elemental&lt;/a&gt;s is Skywall, a realm of lightning and wind, ruled by &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir the Windlord&lt;/a&gt;, elemental lord of air.\nBut, no matter each lord got to rule over his own realm, the different elementals kept fighting for supremacy and expansion, one of the worst of those battles becoming known as the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sundering\"&gt;Elemental Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan the Wind Seeker&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"elemental%20prince\"&gt;elemental prince&lt;/a&gt; of air, was betrayed by &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Geddon\"&gt;Geddon&lt;/a&gt;, the lieutenants of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, elemental lord of fire, who consumed most of Thunderaan's essence, and stored what little remained of it within a &lt;a href=\"Bindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;talisman of elemental binding&lt;/a&gt;, which was shattered in two flawless pieces, assigned to his lieutenants.\nLong ago, the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; weaponsmith &lt;a href=\"Irmaat\"&gt;Irmaat&lt;/a&gt; secretly observed the Skywall and its creatures. At one point, he summoned and bound four powerful &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; lords within a set of scimitars. Later, he wanted to empower the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt; with the ultimate power within the Skywall: that of Al'Akir himself. The weaponsmith cast his spell, intending to open a portal to the Skywall and bind Al'Akir's essence. Unbeknownst to him, however, Al'Akir set a trap for the weaponsmith: when Irmaat tried to heft his new weapons, they unleashed a great hurricane which destroyed the smith and the city of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahmtul\"&gt;Ahmtul&lt;/a&gt; and hurled the weapons miles away.\nCataclysm.\nHowever, it wasn't until recently, when &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; blasted from the Elemental Plane into the world, causing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, that the elementals were able to roam freely across Azeroth once again. Allied with Deathwing, their air elementals assault the recently discovered desert of Uldum, threatening to overrun the world once again.\nSkywall became - to some degree - accessible to players in \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\". While it does not exist as a separate &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;, the two dungeons &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;The Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, a level 82-84 5-man dungeon (including a &lt;a href=\"HC\"&gt;HC&lt;/a&gt; version for level 85) and &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Throne of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, a 10/25 raid (also including HC versions) with &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; as the final boss, are set in it. Both can be entered from towers floating high above &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; around and respectively.\nLegion.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;, his former lieutenants plunged Skywall into turmoil. Lingering rifts in the Skywall allowed the &lt;a href=\"djinn\"&gt;djinn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Typhinius\"&gt;Typhinius&lt;/a&gt; to leave quietly and find the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. When Typhinius returned to the Skywall with the weapons, he immediately set out to end the air elementals' civil war. He overpowered his enemies and flung the spirits of those who had opposed him into the other elemental realms. The war in the Skywall had caused more damage than Typhinius realized. It would take time for the air elementals to regain their strength.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Grandmaster&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Broken%20Temple\"&gt;Order of the Broken Temple&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Essence%20of%20the%20Whirlwind\"&gt;Essence of the Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Nader\"&gt;Nader&lt;/a&gt; to break into the Skywall in their quest to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20the%20Heavens\"&gt;Fists of the Heavens&lt;/a&gt;. In response to their presence, the elemental &lt;a href=\"Typhinius\"&gt;Typhinius&lt;/a&gt; ordered his minions to kill them, which resulted in the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Kaeled\"&gt;Kaeled&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Na%27ser\"&gt;Na'ser&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Melezan\"&gt;Melezan&lt;/a&gt;. Outraged Typhinius sent the &lt;a href=\"storm%20dragon\"&gt;storm dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zaurac\"&gt;Zaurac&lt;/a&gt; to slay the two which backfired when the mortals used the defeated dragon to reach Typhinius, who was subsequently slain. With the Fists of the Heavens in their possession, Li Li and the Grandmaster left the Skywall.\nAs part of their &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20Campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; sought to gather the four Elemental Lords to stand against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and so decided to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt; to replace the fallen Al'Akir. Thus the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;Far&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt; obtained &lt;a href=\"Thunderfury\"&gt;Thunderfury&lt;/a&gt; from the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Wray\"&gt;Wray&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, and brought the blade to the &lt;a href=\"Vortex%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Vortex Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, and empowered the blade with the &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Skywall\"&gt;:Heart of Skywall&lt;/a&gt; taken from &lt;a href=\"Vortos\"&gt;Vortos&lt;/a&gt;, Duke of the East Winds. With the heart, Thunderaan was reborn and became the new Windlord. Thunderaan promised that the armies of Skywall would stand shoulder to shoulder with the mortal races against the Legion.\nHowever despite this pledge, &lt;a href=\"Alacris\"&gt;Alacris&lt;/a&gt; sided with the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s and attempted to spark a rebellion while &lt;a href=\"Mistius\"&gt;Mistius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeph\"&gt;Zeph&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tulmos\"&gt;Tulmos&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other lieutenants directly opposed the new Windlord and began attacking the Earthen Ring and undermining the war effort.\nIn time, the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Wind\"&gt;Conclave of Wind&lt;/a&gt; would reject Thunderaan's rule declaring that &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Sarsarun\"&gt;Prince Sarsarun&lt;/a&gt; was the true heir of Al'Akir. Seeking to regain their allegiance, Thunderaan tasked the Farseer with defeating the Conclave, who impressed with Thunderaan's champion swore their allegiance to Thunderaan.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the reawakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, many air elementals were called forth by the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, who summoned them as their reinforcements through elemental gateways linked to Skywall.\nIn the RPG.\nThe air above the middle tier of the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; looks much like &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s sky at first glance. A yellow sun, immobile and persistent, hovers in the air, surrounded by drifting clouds and other, more violent storms. Birds and much stranger creatures flit about. Above the sun, invisible from the ground lies the fortress of the &lt;a href=\"air%20elemental\"&gt;air elemental&lt;/a&gt;s. Thick stone walls, fashioned of rock stolen from the earth below, hang suspended by permanent cyclones in the shape of pillars. Lightning and strong winds constantly swirl about the Skywall, making a natural flight in the vicinity all but impossible. Inside the fortress, &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al\u2019Akir the Windlord&lt;/a&gt; holds court, ruling over his elemental kin. He enjoys watching over the rest of the plane, traveling in the guise of a thundercloud."}

One of the most ambitious of these creatures, Slabhide hopes to earn Deathwing's favor by exterminating any intruders brazen enough to enter the Stonecore.\"\nStrategy.\nThe approach to this boss will entail having stalactites falling in your path. Once you reach an open space, you will have to wait for Slabhide to catch up with you.\nPhase 1.\nThis is a ground phase, Slabhide will randomly cast Sand Blast which causes a frontal cone of damage; this should only hit the tank.\nIn addition to this, he will also cast Eruption on random raid members. This causes a dust effect at your feet, you should move out of this as soon as you see it. After a few seconds this will cause 10,000 damage and create a lava pool which will deal an additional 5,000 damage per second to anyone standing in it.\nPhase 2.\nWhen Slabhide flies up into the air, he will cause stalactites to fall among the group, you should avoid these as well as any lava pools that have not despawned.\nAt the end of the phase, Slabhide will come back into the ground phase. However, the stalactites will still be present. Phase 1 will have the same mechanics, but the stalactites will hamper the player's line of sight causing issues with healing so awareness of positions of the tank/healer is required.\nHeroic Difficulty.\nIn heroic mode, the fight stays the same, but after the initial air phase Slabhide will start casting Crystal Storm, an AOE effect that must be avoided. Hiding behind the stalactites dropped in the air phase will allow you to avoid the damage from these. However it is worth noting that this appears to not be effective if you are still within melee range.\nSince it is still very easy to go out of the healer's line of sight while hiding from Crystal Storm, it is a good idea to mark the tank or healer so that as many party members as possible can join up in one place.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Slad'ran, a &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;, is the former high prophet of &lt;a href=\"Sseratus\"&gt;Sseratus&lt;/a&gt;, the Drakkari serpent god. \nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; began their invasion of Zul'Drak, the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; decided to sacrifice their animal gods in order to obtain their considerable power in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. As the high prophet of Sseratus, Slad'ran took no pleasure in killing his god, but he did it all the same with the mindset that it might help them save their home, transforming himself into something half-serpent when the sacrifice transferred the immense power of Sseratus to him. He then swore vengeance on the Scourge for what they'd \u201cmade\u201d him do.\nFor a time, he, &lt;a href=\"Moorabi\"&gt;Moorabi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gal%27darah\"&gt;Gal'darah&lt;/a&gt; held Gundrak. He stood guard over the &lt;a href=\"Den%20of%20Sseratus\"&gt;Den of Sseratus&lt;/a&gt; within the subterranean chambers of Gundrak, where he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Slad'ran took no pleasure in sacrificing the loa he had served all his life. As the powers of his god surged into him, the high prophet swore that the Scourge would suffer for the atrocities the Drakkari trolls were forced to commit.\"\nRegular strategies.\nMake sure your group runs out of the Poison Nova. Have one player on add duty to kill the small snakes that run into the fight.\nAlternatively, if you want everyone on dps duty, Slad'ran may be kited far away from his regular room, for example across the watery area and up to the next doorway to the next room. When the group is far enough away, the small green snakes will not be able to locate you and will pile up in front of two of the snake statues in Slad'ran's room. The bigger snakes will still find you, but not having to deal with the snake wrap stun simplifies the fight a lot, especially if the group has low dps(such as 3 manning etc).\n\"Note: The green constrictor snakes no longer pile up, and will find you in the next room as of patch 3.08.\"\nHeroic strategy.\nIt's possible to tank Slad'ran virtually anywhere in the room, though creating a choke-point of some kind between the tank and healer is recommended. Regardless of where the party stands, it's best for ranged DPSers and healers to stand at max range to avoid the Poison Nova. One tanking spot is simply in the middle of the room, while other groups might prefer to pull him into the choke point at the stairs so the adds will bunch up. When using the hallway strategy, be mindful of distance so the healer can avoid Poison Nova, while not being so far that if the tank moves, range or LoS is broken.\nStrategies involving LoSing the Poison Nova, kiting the boss, fighting in the water, or pulling far up the stairs are generally not viable because of patches from Blizzard.\nIf the group grossly out-gears the encounter, it's possible to just tank and spank while AoEing. But if the party is struggling, the key is to handle the adds to avoid the snake-wrap. It's like a DPS race with the timer being the number of adds the party can handle. A snake-wrap on the healer of a party that is struggling will be a wipe. By choking the adds in the hallway, it may be easier for the tank to draw threat as the adds run past him toward the healer. If the adds keep getting away and to the healer, the party either needs to AoE more to kill them, or the tank needs to stop hitting the boss and just focus on add threat. Typically, the tank can sunder and build threat until around 65% of the boss's health, then the adds start to become plentiful. Either AoE needs to increase or the tank needs to start taunting and hitting the adds rather than the boss. Remembering to immediately use and keep stacked any abilities that reduce the armor of, or increase the damage taken by, the boss will help DPS to proceed as quickly as possible and reduce the duration of the fight.\nA strategy to help slow adds and position healer out of range is to have a Hunter and someone who can off-tank and DPS easily (feral druid). Position is key even though Blizzard took away the LoS bug there is still a way to slow down adds and keep healer and range safe that is on the ramp coming from the entrance. Position the fight on one of the levels while the healer is standing on the one on the diagonally opposite side. On the next one down have the Hunter place a freezing trap between that landing and the tank to slow down adds which might get past. Have the main tank aggro as much as possible (however it seems the adds can slither right by the main tank even in the small space) that is what the frost trap is for to slow down adds so hunter can AoE them out also there to save healer in case they get to them. If the main tank is snake-wrapped have the OT pull aggro (this is why a feral druid is good) till the debuff on the main tank goes away.\nThe adds have approximately 6500 health and are not elite. For warrior tanks, it may be beneficial to put vigilance on the healer for the ability to quickly taunt snakes off him. If the party is going to wipe, it typically happens within the first 50% because the snakes will start to wrap and someone (usually multiple people) will die. If this happens, the party is letting too many adds live. If however, the boss reaches 50% and the party isn't being wrapped and appears to be in good shape, blow cooldowns to finish him off. This fight is busy but happens quickly.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

To get this rotation up and running requires some learning effort, and is for the serious gamers only, but it results in very high damage in PvE as in PvP.\nFirst a list of restrictions and points to be aware of:\nQuartz or another cast time bar addon helps greatly when trying to make this work. Players also need to develop a good sense of timing and the ability to think on their feet and adapt when they're forced to move around or get knocked back.\nTalent Spec.\nThe two points for Improved Slam can easily be fitted in the standard 31/30/0 Mortal Strike/Flurry build. The Slam rotation aims for improved raid/group performance, and it's less dependent on Flurry, thus it's advisable to move at least two points from Flurry to &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Frenzy%20%28warrior%20talent%29\"&gt;Blood Frenzy (warrior talent)&lt;/a&gt;. It's even possible to do away with Flurry and go &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/warrior/talents.html%3F050050113525100230012000505003200521200000000000000000000000000000\"&gt;36/25/0&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rotation.\nThe basic idea is to follow each auto-attack first by a slam, and then by some other move. The preferred \"other\" move is of course &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;, but if MS is on cooldown, &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt; or (if both are out) anything else can be used. The result looks like this: auto, slam, MS, auto, slam, WW, auto, slam, MS, auto, slam, X. X can be anything like refreshing a &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Shout\"&gt;Battle Shout&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe sequence starts by waiting for an auto-attack immediately followed by Slam. After the global cooldown comes Mortal Strike. The next auto-attack is again followed by Slam, this time MS won't be ready, so Whirlwind is used instead. The third auto-attack can be followed by MS again, while on the fourth WW and MS will both be cooling down, so it can be followed by any other ability on the global cooldown (e.g. a shout or &lt;a href=\"Thunderclap\"&gt;Thunderclap&lt;/a&gt;).\nThe above image assumes that the time between auto-attacks is 3.5s, which results in some slack (which is good -- humans need some reaction time). &lt;a href=\"Flurry%20%28warrior%20talent%29\"&gt;Flurry&lt;/a&gt; may sometimes confuse things, because it will move the auto-attacks out of sync with the global cooldown. If the weapon is too fast or Flurry procs too often, it's a good idea to look for a slower weapon or move points away from Flurry.\nThis rotation can be pretty rage intensive, &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Totem\"&gt;Windfury Totem&lt;/a&gt; helps a lot to keep it going. It will get easier with practice and better gear."}

The top floor is empty except for the bartender &lt;a href=\"Jarel%20Moor\"&gt;Jarel Moor&lt;/a&gt;, which advises patrons to \"stay away from the shadows\".\nBeneath the pub, the basement and catacombs serve as host to the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, they are used as training grounds for new recruits in the kingdom, and for transferred students from &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Within the hidden enclave, the warlock community study and practice the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt;, sheltered from the rest of the population. Among the warlock masters, &lt;a href=\"Demisette%20Cloyce\"&gt;Demisette Cloyce&lt;/a&gt; is one of the oldest and most respected members of their circle, while &lt;a href=\"Spackle%20Thornberry\"&gt;Spackle Thornberry&lt;/a&gt; was once in charge of selling demonic grimoires to the apprentices. To ensure that their lair is not revealed, warlocks are not allowed to tell anyone about it, and they assassinate those who try to reveal their activities. When asked about, the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City%20Guard\"&gt;city guards&lt;/a&gt; replied they don't know of any warlock trainers in the city, however, they mentioned some sightings of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic activity at the Slaughtered Lamb and advised concerned &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to check there.\nRather eerily, below the warlock trainer's area there is another area of the Stormwind catacombs, with some empty, open coffins across the floor.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Surena%20Caledon\"&gt;Surena Caledon&lt;/a&gt; was a student of &lt;a href=\"Gakin%20the%20Darkbinder\"&gt;Gakin the Darkbinder&lt;/a&gt; in the Slaughtered Lamb's, however, she ended up running away with a &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Erlan%20Drudgemoor\"&gt;Erlan Drudgemoor&lt;/a&gt; and a bloodstone choker offered by her master. Eager to recover his property, Gakin sent a warlock apprentice to kill her and let them use the choker to invoke and dominate a &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Baurles%20K.%20Wishock\"&gt;Lord Baurles K. Wishock&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; were hiding in the basement below the tavern, he caused a stir amongst the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; and lobbied for a full investigation, intending to petition the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; to shut down the establishment. In reality, Wishock had spent his days at the tavern consuming liquors, without ever paying his tabs, and was at the time looking for a way to escape his debt. Before he could garner enough support to cause grief, &lt;a href=\"Zardeth%20of%20the%20Black%20Claw\"&gt;Zardeth of the Black Claw&lt;/a&gt; sent an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to collect ingredients for a beverage, which unbeknownst to them was poisoned, and later caused Wishock's death after consumption. Consequently, the warlocks were once more able to practice their ways without disturbance.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, all warlocks were trained under the auspices of the masters of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, but after its irradiation, they moved to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; decided to keep a careful watch on them. In these conditions, the warlocks of Ironforge were forced to send their novices to Stormwind for training. However, &lt;a href=\"Gakin%20the%20Darkbinder\"&gt;Gakin the Darkbinder&lt;/a&gt; expressed his anger since they are limited in terms of rooms and teachers, and because he feared that all the increased traffic would attract attention sooner or later on them.\nDuring their training, the warlock masters sent their apprentices to some of their fellow associates out of the kingdom, notably &lt;a href=\"Gakin%20the%20Darkbinder\"&gt;Gakin the Darkbinder&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; to master a &lt;a href=\"Dreadsteed\"&gt;dreadsteed&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Takar%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Takar the Seer&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; for help to conjure a &lt;a href=\"sayaad\"&gt;sayaad&lt;/a&gt;. The young warlocks also learn from the &lt;a href=\"Ratchet%23Warlock%20coven\"&gt;Ratchet warlock coven&lt;/a&gt;, among them &lt;a href=\"Strahad%20Farsan\"&gt;Strahad Farsan&lt;/a&gt; to learn the invocation of the &lt;a href=\"felsteed\"&gt;felsteed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"felhunter\"&gt;felhunter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Menara%20Voidrender\"&gt;Menara Voidrender&lt;/a&gt; to get powerful artifacts and equipment.\nWhen they summon &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s to defeat and bind them, the warlocks descend into the catacombs to set up the summoning circles there.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; began to take note of the warlock's power and their value to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to a warlock &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s deeds. Consequently, the elders in the city's community ranks took notice of their progress and dedication, and among them, &lt;a href=\"Demisette%20Cloyce\"&gt;Demisette Cloyce&lt;/a&gt; summoned and met the warlock adventurer about the creation of a powerful weapon, which was ordained by the king himself in recognition of their achievements.\nAt some point, Demisette learned from a reliable source that the was concerned about collaboration between &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. In order to prove their value to the Alliance, and to get powerful &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; binding stones used by the cult for studies, she summoned the warlock adventurer and sent them on a mission at the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nOne year after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; warlock found &lt;a href=\"The%20Codex%20of%20Xerrath\"&gt;The Codex of Xerrath&lt;/a&gt;, and met &lt;a href=\"Sandahl\"&gt;Sandahl&lt;/a&gt; at the Slaughtered Lamb to learn more about it. The warlock trainer explained them that after &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; was defeated, six of the greatest warlocks of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; gathered together as the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;, and decided to teach all warlocks advanced forms of magic stolen from their defeated foes, such as &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and Deathwing himself. Among the warlocks, &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt; had the duty to share their wisdom and knowledge, and thus sent a few &lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20the%20Masters%20%28Part%201%29\"&gt;tomes&lt;/a&gt; to the warlock community of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, a few warlocks traveled from the Slaughtered Lamb to the &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt;, where they joined the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Netherlord&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was sent by &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt; at the behest of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Neferset\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; to cure them of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their loyalty. After becoming exhausted from converting the population of Neferset into their stoney bodies, the Neferset turned on him, trapping him within the tower at the center of their lost city. After slaying the leaders of the city, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s accidentally freed Siamat. He was then defeated within the crumbled ruins of the tower that imprisoned him.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Purging the Nerferset tol'vir's curse of flesh left the fearsome elemental Siamat severely drained. It was during this moment of vulnerability that the tol'vir struck and magically imprisoned Siamat at the center of their ancient sand-swept city.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: Winds of the South, Rise!\nSiamat begins the encounter flying above his platform, nigh invulnerable to any damage taken.\nStage Two: Cower Before the Storm!\nAfter the players kill three Servants of Siamat, Stage two begins with Siamat landing on the platform and becoming vulnerable to damage.\nStrategy.\nStorm Clouds (with a white appearance) appear throughout the fight and slowly rotate around Siamat, dealing damage and knocking back any player below them. Everyone should watch for them and run from it if they see one come near.\nIn phase 1, Siamat takes only 10% damage and summons Minions and Servants.\nThe Minions of Siamat should be kited away from the group and killed by a designated DPS. They don't hit very hard. Hit them a couple of times to get aggro, then interrupt their spellcast. Kite them away from the group and kill them. It's good to kill them all in the same general area so the green storms that they drop are easy to avoid. The green storms do not expire.\nThe Servants of Siamat should be picked up by the tank, then killed. Move away when they die, since they will (after a two-second cast) apply the Lightning Charge debuff to everyone in melee range.\nWhen the third Servant of Siamat is killed (the specific, third one that spawns), the fight will progress to phase two. Siamat will drop his shield and cause the players to bounce around for a while. Then he will attack the party with elemental attacks. This is the time to burn him down; ignore any adds. If you have controlled the fight by killing Minions away from the group, and avoided Lightning Charge, the damage taken will be manageable.\nIn Hearthstone.\nSiamat appears as in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His effect allows the player to choose two to give him, and his flavor text reads: \"TAUNT. TAUNT.\"\nHe also appears as that can be encountered in the adventure.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

In secret, Sicco was filled with envy for Gelbin and desired the position of high tinker for himself, a lust for power that led him to become &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;'s greatest traitor. When the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s invaded Gnomeregan, Thermaplugg convinced Mekkatorque to flood the city with radioactive gas in order to kill the invaders. He secretly planned to let many of the gnomes die from the gas as well and blame the deaths on Mekkatorque. However, the radiation proved deadlier than Thermaplugg had anticipated, wiping out the majority of the gnomes and turning many of the survivors, including Thermaplugg himself, into &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s while Mekkatorque led the remaining survivors into exile.\nDriven completely mad by the radiation, Thermaplugg declared himself \"king of the gnomes\" and took control of the leper gnomes in the ruined city, still obsessed with the end goal of either ruling over the gnomish race or destroying it entirely. Upon learning of his old friend's betrayal, Mekkatorque ordered &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; to kill him, but Thermaplugg eluded every attempt on his life. In the leadup to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Mekkatorque rallied the gnomes and other races of the Alliance to join him in , an assault that succeeded in retaking Gnomeregan's surface and ultimately led to Thermaplugg's death.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nIn his youth, Sicco Thermaplugg was the closest friend of &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;. Gelbin helped him graduate from &lt;a href=\"Gearshaft%20University\"&gt;Gearshaft University&lt;/a&gt;, and when the two of them graduated together, Sicco gifted Gelbin a pair of &lt;a href=\"mithril\"&gt;mithril&lt;/a&gt;-rimmed spectacles. Gelbin wore them constantly for decades thereafter.\nGelbin subsequently employed Sicco at his foundry, and the two worked together on many of the inventions that launched Gelbin to fame. All the while, Sicco secretly grew to resent his friend, believing that he coasted by on unpredictable \"genius\" while Sicco himself had to work for recognition. In reality, Gelbin considered Sicco to be one of the brightest gnomes in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and was always vocal about his gratitude for his friend's help. However, he also believed that while Sicco had creative ideas, he was too impatient, sloppy, and \"&lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;-esque\" in his work. At one point the two worked together on the first &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt; prototype, with Gelbin assigning Sicco to ordnance design in the hopes that he would step up to the task. Sicco's figures proved as dangerously imprecise as ever, so Gelbin secretly reworked them before sending them off to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. In spite of this, he still allowed Sicco to take credit for the guns, simply because they were friends.\nFor his achievements, Gelbin was ultimately elected &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;high tinker&lt;/a&gt; of Gnomeregan. This infuriated Sicco, who thought that he should've had the position instead. In addition to being envious of Gelbin's position, Sicco was also frustrated by how the gnomes traded away their inventions and weapons to allies instead of using them to expand the power of their nation, a failing he laid entirely at Gelbin's feet. Unaware of his friend's true feelings, Gelbin lifted Sicco to a prominent role in the &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Court\"&gt;Tinkers' Court&lt;/a&gt; in spite of worrisome and increasingly flawed performance, and he went on to serve as Gelbin's chief advisor for many years.\nAt one point, the mekgineer &lt;a href=\"Oglethorpe%20Obnoticus\"&gt;Oglethorpe Obnoticus&lt;/a&gt; earned the respect of the Tinkers' Court by creating an unbeatable robot. Sicco stole the blueprints, created his own, giant version\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Pummeler%209-60\"&gt;Crowd Pummeler 9-60&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and set it loose in Gnomeregan. The ruling council believed Oglethorpe to be responsible and banished him from the city. The crowd pummeler remained in Sicco's possession as one of his favorite (stolen) inventions.\nFall of Gnomeregan.\nAt the onset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the lower parts of Gnomeregan were invaded by &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s that had been released from &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. Not wanting to divert resources from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s battles in the Third War, Gelbin kept the invasion secret from the rest of the Alliance. Years later, it would be rumored that Thermaplugg somehow knew of the trogg invasion beforehand and allowed it to happen, or that he was even the mastermind behind the entire event. These reports have never been verified, but Mekkatorque believes they could be true. Either way, Sicco decided to use the war as an opportunity to seize Gelbin's power and prestige for himself, and engineered a plan to that effect with the help of his assistant &lt;a href=\"Telzo%20Sparkspanner\"&gt;Telzo Sparkspanner&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter five years of siege, the troggs breached Gnomeregan's engineering quarters, gaining access to dangerous and unstable materials that could lead to the city's destruction. Gelbin was at a loss for what to do and turned to Sicco for help. The latter proposed a brutal plan: detonate a bomb to bathe the overrun parts of the city in lethal, radioactive gas. He claimed to have tested the gas beforehand and to have evidence of its lethal effect on the troggs. He showed Gelbin falsified numbers on its density and volumetric weight, making it seem as though it would stay in the trogg-infested lower sections of the city and poison the invaders as they emerged from the depths while the gnomes waited safely in the upper urban tunnels, protected from the gas by Sicco's own Kleen Wind Domicilic Filters. Gelbin eventually agreed to the ploy since it seemed to be the only way out of the invasion, wouldn't require any help from the rest of the Alliance, and seemed better than waiting for a disaster to destroy the city. In reality, Sicco intended for the gas to anger the troggs and kill the gnomes. He calculated that thirty percent of the gnomes would die\u2014a \"statistically meaningful number of corpses\" that he could lay at Gelbin's feet, after which he would swoop in and defeat the troggs, prompting the gnomes to elect him as their new high tinker.\nWhen the bomb went off, the gas rose to fill the entire city just as Sicco had planned, irradiating gnomes as well as troggs. Although the gas did kill troggs, most simply shambled through it, growing wilder as they became irradiated. Meanwhile, the gnomes who sat waiting in their homes choked to death when the toxic clouds sifted through Sicco's wind filters. However, the gas turned out to be much more effective than Sicco had anticipated and ended up killing nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race in a matter of days. In addition, many of the survivors were mutated into insane &lt;a href=\"leper%20gnome\"&gt;leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn another miscalculation, the disaster did not cause the gnomes to turn against Gelbin as Sicco had intended; instead they continued to love and follow him as their leader. The high tinker led the healthy survivors in evacuating the city and fleeing to Ironforge. According to one source, Sicco was left behind in Gnomeregan during the evacuation, trapped in the horror he had created, while other sources state that he disappeared shortly \"after\" the evacuation. Either way, the radiation twisted Sicco into a leper gnome as well and rendered him insane. He easily recruited the other leper gnomes and seized control of the toxic city, installing himself as its new techno-overlord and proclaiming himself the king of the gnomes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nSicco ruled over Gnomeregan from the &lt;a href=\"Tinkers%27%20Court\"&gt;Tinkers' Court&lt;/a&gt;, driving a massive, cauldron-shaped prototype armor suit and surrounded by leper gnome and trogg minions who were numerous and crazed enough to defend their king against any intrusion from the surface world. With the cunning to destroy everything around him and no thought for his own life, Sicco was dangerous enough that even the monsters of Gnomeregan came to fear him.\nHe continued working on new inventions but was as impatient as ever, rushing each new invention into the field and moving on to the next project without testing their safety and effectiveness. The &lt;a href=\"Electrocutioner%206000\"&gt;Electrocutioner 6000&lt;/a&gt; was his first attempt to harness electricity as a weapon via a super-charged &lt;a href=\"mechano-tank\"&gt;mechano-tank&lt;/a&gt;, but only a single soldier survived piloting it. He also personally guarded the blueprints to a new \"&lt;a href=\"super%20rig\"&gt;super rig&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Thermaplugg%27s%20Safe\"&gt;a safe&lt;/a&gt; in the Tinkers' Court. Thermaplugg was in contact with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, as shown by the presence of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Agent\"&gt;Dark Iron Agent&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Ambassador\"&gt;Dark Iron Ambassador&lt;/a&gt; in Gnomeregan, and the Dark Irons were involved in the making of the aforementioned rig. There is evidence that Sicco may have been working on a cure for the leper gnomes' condition.\nGuilt and grief over the loss of Gnomeregan weighed heavily on Gelbin, but not as much as confusion over his old friend's betrayal: the gnomes as a race had always relied on each other, and it was inconceivable for a gnome of all races to harm his own kind in search of power. Gelbin later reflected that Gnomeregan had fallen because he'd trusted his friend to be a friend, or at least to be a gnome, and that Sicco was neither. As part of efforts to retake the capital, Gelbin ordered Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Sicco. A band of heroes took up the mission and returned with a tale of victory. However, after analyzing their claim, Gelbin realized that the mechanized overlord they'd defeated in Gnomeregan was likely nothing more than a clever facsimile of Thermaplugg, and that defeating his nemesis would take a more robust approach. Some &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s also wanted to send adventurers to fight Thermaplugg in order to get their hands on the super rig blueprints.\nOperation: Gnomeregan.\nAfter years of planning, Gelbin put into action , an assault to liberate the city and bring the real Sicco to justice. In response, Sicco prepared his own forces and deployed \"&lt;a href=\"Mekgineer%20Thermaplugg%27s%20Brag-Bot\"&gt;Brag-Bots&lt;/a&gt;\" to spread his propaganda in &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter capturing the entrance, Gelbin's forces headed for Thermaplugg in the heart of the city. In response, Sicco sent forth hordes of troggs led by &lt;a href=\"Gasherikk\"&gt;Gasherikk&lt;/a&gt; and leper gnome soldiers led by &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Boltcog\"&gt;Commander Boltcog&lt;/a&gt;. When Gelbin's forces continued to push through, Sicco revealed an ace: the &lt;a href=\"Irradiator%203000\"&gt;Irradiator 3000&lt;/a&gt;, a device similar to the original radiation bomb that had poisoned Gnomeregan but twenty-six times more powerful. It began a ten-minute countdown to explosion until Sicco realized his underlings had left the factory setting on and intervened, reducing the timer down to ten seconds and forcing Gelbin's forces to immediately teleport back to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge. However, Gelbin stated that with the surface of the city retaken, Thermaplugg had only bought himself time.\nCut Short.\nAs the push to retake Gnomeregan continued, Sicco set a trap in Gelbin's old living quarters in &lt;a href=\"sector%2017\"&gt;sector 17&lt;/a&gt; by tying a tripwire to the high tinker's old spectacles, which had been left behind during the original evacuation. After his troops did a sweep of the area, Gelbin headed into the quarters alone and unarmed and picked up the glasses, realizing too late that it was a trap. Sicco closed the doors to the room and sent in three troggs to kill the high tinker while gloating via intercom about how his death would devastate the gnomes. Gelbin used his surroundings to hold off the troggs and kept talking to Sicco in order to keep him distracted, mockingly pointing out how his genocide plan hadn't resulted in him winning any elections. In response, Sicco expressed his frustration over how the gnomes had gone against all \"logic\" by staying loyal to Gelbin even after the fall of Gnomeregan, and he exclaimed that he was glad that the gas had killed as many as it had since the gnomes \"needed this purge\".\nBy exploiting the sloppy way in which Sicco had engineered the trap, Gelbin managed to dispatch the troggs. Before the high tinker could escape, Sicco arrived with dozens of more troggs to deal with him personally, driving a new, agile, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;-sized battle suit; he explained that the previous suit had proven too bulky, and that the king of the gnomes should see eye-to-eye with the other rulers of the land. He and Gelbin exchanged words, with Sicco expressing bitterness over how he'd never received the recognition he thought he deserved while working under Gelbin. In response, Gelbin revealed how he'd allowed Sicco to take credit for the &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt; guns that Gelbin had secretly reworked because of their friendship, and for a moment the surprised Sicco looked more like the bright young gnome that Gelbin had once befriended. However, the moment passed, Sicco declared that this was only an example of Gelbin's weakness, and prepared to kill him.\nGelbin had a backup plan: he took advantage of the trap mechanism he'd repurposed and released a tensely wound spring that had been holding up more weight than it should have been, instantly decapitating every trogg in the room and cutting Thermaplugg's suit in half, severing his legs from his body. However, Sicco survived due to the suit cauterizing his wounds, likely with minimal blood loss. Gelbin decided to leave him for dead so that his suffering would be prolonged, citing it as an appropriate punishment for his crimes against the gnomes. He decided that if the rats or the troggs didn't kill Thermaplugg, then he'd think of no one better to lead the troggs than one of their own.\nCataclysm.\nAlthough Operation: Gnomeregan didn't succeed in retaking the city itself, it allowed the gnomes to establish &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt; at its entrance. Thermaplugg remained in hiding in Gnomeregan and sent his minion, &lt;a href=\"Razlo%20Crushcog\"&gt;Razlo Crushcog&lt;/a&gt;, and a force of leper gnomes to harass Mekkatorque's forces on the surface in order to prevent them from rebuilding and finishing their reclamation of the capital. The gnomes later killed Crushcog with help from their &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; allies; with his defeat, Sicco couldn't afford to send any more of his followers to the surface, and Gelbin stated that the mekgineer's defeat was imminent.\nThe &lt;a href=\"G-Team\"&gt;G-Team&lt;/a&gt;, an elite group hired by the high tinker to retake Gnomeregan, later recruited &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Sicco himself, and they finally managed to defeat the mekgineer. The unique equipment Sicco carried, such as the &lt;a href=\"%3AElectromagnetic%20Gigaflux%20Reactivator\"&gt;:Electromagnetic Gigaflux Reactivator&lt;/a&gt;, was returned to &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping.\nShadowlands.\n&lt;a href=\"Flavor%20lore\"&gt;Some say&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"%3AMord%27al%20Eveningstar\"&gt;:Mord'al Eveningstar&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; known for torturing the smallest souls in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, was known in life as \"Thermaplugg\".\nIn the RPG.\nMekgineer Sicco Thermaplugg was once a brilliant and wise tinker, who despite being incredibly frail even at a young age, was destined to be High Tinker. He cunningly laid the way to the seat, charming people to his side and cranking out one great invention after the next. He worked unceasingly toward his goal, for Thermaplugg planned not only making High Tinker, but also becoming the gnome's first true king in over four hundred years. He envisioned a great kingdom out of Gnomeregan, carved out of the entire western half of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, even if it meant relocating the nearby dwarven communities in the name of progress. Nothing would stop him! However, his closest friend, &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, ruined all of his goals when the council of tinkers decided that Thermaplugg was too ambitious and chose Mekkatorque instead.\nIt was his idea that, during the trogg invasion, the gnomes shut themselves from the world. Thermaplugg claimed that the world outside didn't need to be bothered by gnomish problems, for he had an idea that would both destroy the image of Mekkatorque and win him the throne. After weeks of debate, he convinced Mekkatorque to flood the halls of Gnomeregan with radiation via a bomb, thus killing the troggs. If a few gnomes died in the process, he stated, it would be a worthy sacrifice for saving the entire race.\nHowever, due to reasons even Thermaplugg can't remember, he found himself locked inside Gnomeregan when the bomb release began. Despite his age and frailty, he did not die. Some speak that it was his ambition that saved him, while others say he hid and suffered the least of the poison. Despite this, he lived and mutated into a leper gnome. The radiation killed more gnomes than troggs, and many other gnomes in Gnomeregan's walls also suffered from radiation and became leper gnomes. However, in the ensuing chaos, Thermaplugg had begun calling himself a king. To this day he rules over the leper gnomes and continues fighting the troggs. He controls his land with a tyrannical fist, destroying outsiders as rapidly as any other enemy.\nHe keeps to himself most of his time since becoming king of Gnomeregan, working on insane world-conquering inventions. Thankfully, few if any will ever see the light of day. Paranoid beyond rational thought, Thermaplugg destroys anything that disturbs his work, even his own leper gnome servants. Recently, however, he opened up negotiations with the Dark Iron dwarves, allowing them use of Gnomeregan's tunnels in exchange for a part of Ironforge to call his own. No one knows what may become of this alliance, but it won't be good.\nRumors say that the Dark Iron dwarves and Mekgineer Thermaplugg, head of the leper gnomes in fallen Gnomeregan, seek an alliance.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThermaplugg appears as in the \" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"He was obsessed with explosives until he discovered knitting. Now he yells, \u201cSWEATERS! MORE SWEATERS!\u201d\""}

The stalwart Dwarven pilots have even been known to ram enemy structures at high speeds and reduce whole fortifications to dust under the Siege Engines' steel treads. \nInformation.\nThe Siege Engine is designed to destroy buildings. Siege Engines possess siege-based attacks and are also the only unit to possess fortified armor, meaning that their only bane are other siege-damage units. Siege Engines also serve as effective anti-air units once Barrage is researched, as it allows them to attack numerous aerial units in the process. A small group of Siege Engines can essentially drive away clusters of weak aerial units, and stronger ones such as &lt;a href=\"Chimaera%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s will have trouble destroying them thanks to their fortified armor protecting them greatly from their attacks.\nAs much as the &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Machine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Flying Machines&lt;/a&gt; are arguably better in some cases over Siege Engines, Flying Machines can be easily destroyed by well placed &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Batrider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Batrider&lt;/a&gt;s, or in general battles against &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s. If the Flying Machine cannot cut it in battle against numerous aerial hostiles, start producing Siege Engines; six to seven of them with good tanks to soak damage can easily make a difference against opponents with massed aerial units.\nIf the map has a Goblin Laboratory, buy several &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Zeppelin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Goblin Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s. Though it does set back the player a bit in gold and only two can fit in each one, the zeppelin can ferry the Siege Engines to their destination a lot faster. \nThere are numerous counters against Siege Engines.\nThe most effective strategy is to bring in artillery units such as &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20Team%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mortar Team&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Demolisher%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s, whose high Siege damage makes short work of Siege Engines. \n&lt;a href=\"Raider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Raider&lt;/a&gt;s can also Ensnare the Siege Engines if they attempt to run away, and their Siege damage makes them effective against the Siege Engine's fortified armor.\nIf the Siege Engines attempt to target a base, have as many workers as possible attempt to repair the damage. Defensive towers lining the town hall can also deal some damage, with human players having the greatest advantage due to their &lt;a href=\"Cannon%20Tower%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Cannon Tower&lt;/a&gt;s. Building with 1x1 gaps between your buildings also forces the Siege Tank to either attempt to go around or destroy it, wasting time that could have been used to attack the town hall.\nNight elf players can uproot their Ancients, changing their armor type from Fortified to Heavy, meaning the Siege Engine deals less damage to them."}

Occurring around seven years after the original opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the battle saw the two factions clash for ultimate mastery of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and served as one of the closing conflicts of the war.\nFor over a year, the Alliance and Horde had fought a brutal war across the length of the continent. However, with the Horde's strategic defeat during the siege of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, the tide began to finally turn in favor of one side. &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; subsequently retreated with his forces to the south, gathering at the landmark of Blackrock Mountain to stage a final stand.\nThe pursuing Alliance, led by the famed commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, eventually caught up with and engaged the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. After a long and grueling battle, the Alliance army emerged victorious. The shattered Horde remnants largely fled back to the Dark Portal (and on to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;) in the wake of the defeat, though another major engagement would take place in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; between the two sides before the war fully concluded.\nAs both sides intended, the battle at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; firmly decided the outcome of the Second War; ultimately cementing the Alliance of Lordaeron as the victors. In large part due to the heroics of the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance's success may also be attributed to the orcs' lack of reinforcement. Several clans, including the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; were unable to reunite with Doomhammer's army following the retreat and were thus helpless to aid in the battle.\nHistory.\nDoomhammer's stand.\nThough long-term victory in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; fluctuated wildly throughout the conflict, the events that transpired during the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; finally allowed one side to secure the upper hand. Betrayed by the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and outmaneuvered by his &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; foes, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was ultimately forced to break off his attempt to take the capital. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; subsequently began a long retreat from Lordaeron itself, hoping to regroup to the south and potentially salvage the ill-fated campaign.\n&lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; had commanded the Alliance armies since the coalition's inception, and had battled with the Horde across the length and breadth of the continent. Sensing that victory was within sight, Lothar ruthlessly pursued the retreating &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, liberating the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; nations in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; along the way. Bolstered by these new races (who quickly joined the Alliance), Lothar's army continued its advance. After seeing that &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was cleaned of all Horde forces, &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; and his men joined up with Lothar and the main Alliance army.\nDoomhammer, too, recognized that the war's conclusion was imminent, and that a final battle would soon decide the fate of his Horde and his people. With this in mind, the Warchief ordered a halt to the retreat, and began gathering his forces and fortifying his position at one of the Horde's most stalwart bastions on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde now needed any reinforcements it could draw upon, and Doomhammer dispatched messengers back to the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to call upon the overly-bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;orc clans&lt;/a&gt; left behind during the initial invasion of Azeroth. Additionally, orders were also sent to &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Chieftain Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; to gather any remaining &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s they could (including their matriarch &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;) and bring them to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, messages were also sent to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, at the time still returning by sea from defeating &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. They were informed of the Horde's new rendezvous point and told to make haste there in anticipation for the upcoming battle.\nDespite a delaying action carried out by the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance march south continued at a staggering pace, greatly aided by the actions of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Before long, and far too soon for Doomhammer's liking, the army under Anduin Lothar arrived at the outskirts of the Burning Steppes. No other choice remained now but to prepare for the deciding engagement of the Second War.\nBattle of Blackrock.\n&lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; watched as the vast &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army, thousands strong, began to wind its way into the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; region, edging ever closer to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s position. The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; commander did not engage the enemy immediately; the Horde was outnumbered (but not by a large margin) and the necessary reinforcements had failed to materialize. &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Crestfall\"&gt;Attacked on the sea voyage home&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; would not arrive in time, and neither would the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; nor any forces from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; itself. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt;, too, had not yet arrived from &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; with their desperately-needed &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; wasted no time, and quickly arranged his units around the enemy stronghold built into &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, effectively beginning a siege. Though the spire was protected by formidable gates, the Alliance immediately set to work with their siege weapons, hammering the defenses relentlessly.\nThough Doomhammer was deeply troubled by the course of the war, he refused to despair at this time of crisis. Instead, he resigned himself to fighting his enemies with all the energy he could muster, even if doing so meant a certain, but honorable, death. The Warchief now rallied his people within the confines of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. He reminded them of the Horde's power, the many victories it had accomplished, and the desperate nature of the battle ahead. He challenged each of them to show their devotion to the cause by throwing themselves on the Alliance armies before them.\nAs Lothar's forces were still preparing for a siege, the gates of Blackrock Mountain suddenly burst open and the Horde garrison spilled out. Though he knew he could not defeat the Alliance through sheer forces, Doomhammer adopted a new plan that he believed could yet secure victory. Having observed much of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; culture throughout the war, the Warchief was convinced that if he could slay the Alliance's commander, the rest would lose heart and crumble. Thus, he directed the charge to cut a path straight to Anduin Lothar, and personally led the attack at the head of his elite guard composed of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. In addition to them, the Horde's vanguard was also made up of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;unarmored orc berserkers&lt;/a&gt;, wielding their weapons with mad abandon, hacking and stabbing everything within their reach. These savage warriors started repelling the humans, who fell back before their frothing attack.\nLothar's troops, though numbering slightly more than their adversaries, were taken wholly unaware by the sudden and unexpected assault. They had largely been preparing to wait out the Horde, and the orcs now overran their forward siege lines amidst the initial chaos. Before long, Doomhammer's charge had reached Anduin Lothar's position, though the veteran commander accepted the challenge rather than flee. Lothar and Doomhammer, Supreme Allied Commander and Warchief, now engaged in deadly close-quarters combat, even while the battle for Blackrock Mountain raged around them.\nAs their duel progressed, a kind of hush fell over the area and each side began to watch, transfixed, as their leaders clashed again and again with &lt;a href=\"Great%20Royal%20Sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt;. Both warriors were closely matched, and the outcome of the fight remained uncertain for a time. Eventually, however, Orgrim Doomhammer's sheer strength, prime youth, and ferocity gained him the upper hand. With one swing, the Warchief shattered Lothar's greatsword, driving the human commander to his knees. With a final blow, he brought his weapon down on Lothar's skull, killing him instantly.\nThe tide turns.\nDoomhammer was quick to proclaim his victory to those looking on. Having witnessed the outcome of the titanic struggle, the Horde warriors became inspired and cheered this great victory. They pressed their assault, pushing ruthlessly against the now-demoralized Alliance ranks. With their revered commander slain before their eyes, many of the Alliance's troops began to despair and lose the will to fight. Resistance to the orcs' onslaught was at serious risk of collapsing, before the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; chose to take action.\nTuralyon had acted as Lothar's lieutenant since the beginning of the Second War, and (like many) had looked to the knight-commander for guidance and inspiration. Seeing his friend and mentor slain before his eyes did not, however, have the ruinous effect that Doomhammer intended. Steeling himself with his values as a paladin of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and understanding that giving in to sorrow would neither bring Lothar back nor avenge his death, Turalyon instead turned his attention on the situation around him.\nTaking charge of the Alliance forces, Turalyon unleashed all the holy powers at his disposal. &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; radiated from his person, blinding those around him (including Orgrim Doomhammer) and forcing the battle to a standstill. Without hesitation, he picked up Lothar's shattered sword from where it had fallen and declared to Doomhammer that he would pay for his crimes against this world and the people of it. In response, Doomhammer swung up his hammer but Turalyon disarmed it with the broken sword's blade. Surprised and recognizing his end, Doomhammer lowered his head to accept death. \nTuralyon, however, chose instead to strike the orc with the flat of the blade, knocking him to his knees before collapsing unconscious next to Lothar. He then called on his allies around him to pull themselves together in this dark hour, as Lothar both would have done himself and expected of each and every one of them. He reminded them of why the Alliance had been created, why they were there in the first place. They needed to stop the Horde, to prevent it from doing any more harm to their loved ones and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;their world&lt;/a&gt;. For the Alliance and for Lothar, Turalyon called on all those gathered to fight with him for the final victory.\nFinally, Turalyon addressed Doomhammer and his soldiers, condemning them for their actions and promising them a swift death, save for the Warchief himself who would stand trial in the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; he had so desperately desired to seize.\nWith their hope and faith restored, the soldiers of the Alliance produced one great battle cry before crashing into the stunned Horde lines. Turalyon himself led and charge and struck the first blow, his fellow &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s alongside him. The orcish armies swiftly buckled under the renewed onslaught, their organization and discipline largely disintegrating. Some fled north, east, and west to escape the carnage, while a great many others rushed in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to escape back to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe most dedicated continued fighting just outside the spire, though the battle was lost. Under Turalyon's orders, the Alliance troops overwhelmed these holdouts, disarming but not annihilating them. Instead, they were bound in chains alongside their fallen &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, now prisoners of the great conflict.\nAftermath.\nThe Siege of Blackrock Spire would ultimately be the second last major battle of the war, with the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;final one&lt;/a&gt; taking place around the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; not long after.\nSeveral orcish clans that had not taken part in the final battle at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; soon found themselves stranded on the new world. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, arrived at the battlefield only after the conflict had ended. When the Alliance in the area finally departed, they reoccupied the fortress in the mountain, and established &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;their own Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; too had failed to arrive at the battle in time. Upon learning of the outcome, they chose to remain in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to evade the notice of the now fully-ascendant Alliance of Lordaeron. The &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; found itself in a similar predicament, arriving both in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; and at the Dark Portal too late to be of aid. They would ultimately disappear into the wilds near the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; to bide their time.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; prisoners taken in the battle, including &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; himself, were taken back to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in chains. There, their fate was decided by the combined leadership of the Alliance, with the decision eventually being made to put the survivors in new &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time after the end of the Second War, a statue was constructed to commemorate &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;'s sacrifice during the battle at Blackrock Mountain. With its sword pointing directly to the spire itself, looking to the skies as if daring them to battle. The statue was constructed using the labor of orc prisoners from the war, an irony Turalyon appreciated.\nThe outcome of the battle at Blackrock Mountain served cement &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;'s position as leader of the Alliance's armies in the field. Following his decisive victory there and the subsequent end of the war, he remained in command, and would eventually lead the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; into the orc homeworld itself during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; two years later."}

Many had abandoned their homes with little but the clothes on their back and tools and other professions they had on them when they fled. They knew their homes would be destroyed, and would have to be rebuilt later. Terenas had few men to defend the city walls. The king had not expected the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to attack the city and most soldiers had as such previously left with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;.\nKing Terenas witnessed the Horde swarm across the lake. Some had crossed over by use of rough bridges. From his vantage point, he couldn't see any siege weapons other than a log to be used as a battering ram.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s reached the walls, Terenas ordered the soldiers to drop hot &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; on them. The remaining soldiers tipped large cauldrons over the ramparts letting the boiling oil pour down the side of the walls. The oil spilled across the leading orcs, drenching them completely. They screamed in pain as it burned away their flesh. The entire front rank crumpled, writhing and twitching. A few staggered away but most were dead. The Alliance forces prepared more oil to drop on the heads of the Horde. While the oil would run out after a few more attempts by the Horde, they knew they had several weeks' worth of food and supplies and would be able to hold out during a long siege if need be.\nThe Alliance forces under &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; reached the valley leading to Lordaeron. They had ridden hard, with &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and cavalry, with the infantry marching behind them. They had traveled west through the foothills of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; and emerged north of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, so they could swing back down and come at the city from the wide plain behind it, where the main gates were located. The Alliance forces clashed with the besieging Horde forces, the horsemen scattering the front line while the Lordaeron defenders rained arrows and fire down on the orcs. The success lasted for some time until the overwhelming might of the Horde pushed them back. The &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s were forced back by the sheer number of the Horde and for every orc they killed, another would appear with three more beside him. The Horde managed to push them across the river and left a portion to hold them while the rest turned to pound the city walls. Slowly the orcs started to climb up the walls and bring down the defenders one by one while ammunition started to run dangerously low.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; had led his surviving warriors to aid his old friend who arrived in the mountains. Knowing that he needed to do something quickly to prevent the whole Horde from arriving into Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; king personally led his soldiers to attack and block the passes. Though the Horde already had enough strength to storm the city, this small action would prove to be important later.\nAt Lordaeron, the battle raged even fiercer and the gates were starting to crack. Terenas ordered the gates to be blocked with everything they had, knowing that they were not going to hold for long.\nJust as the gates were about to fall, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; received news from the &lt;a href=\"dragon%20rider\"&gt;dragon rider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Torgus\"&gt;Torgus&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; had taken the rest of Horde across the sea. The &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; saw that despite the fact that the city was about to fall, he had already lost a large number of his standing troops. Desperate, he quickly ordered his reserves to the field only to find them already slaughtered by Stromic knights and warriors. Though knowing that they did not have the numbers to stand against the Alliance, Doomhammer nevertheless ordered the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, which provided a bulk of the standing troops to track down Gul'dan, hoping that he had done the right thing.\nThis action was all the Alliance needed and the human knights and &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s crossed the bridge clashing with the surviving orcs. With no sign of reinforcement and cornered by the Alliance and Lordaeron forces on one side and Stromgarde troops on the other, the standing orc forces retreated. The Alliance had won."}

The majority of Dalaran's citizenship was evacuated prior to the battle. &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; was able to sense the wizards and revealed to &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; that the auras causing the damage to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; would disperse upon the deaths of their casters. With a clear target in the mind for their mission of claiming the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge began the invasion of Dalaran and quickly slew the first wizard and freed the first level of Dalaran of the aura harming them. Additionally, Arthas and Kel'Thuzad freed creatures that the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; had caged for studying and that engaged the Kirin Tor in battle as well.\nWith their new unexpected allies in tow, the Scourge was able to locate the second wizard (who had hidden himself) and destroy the second Kirin Tor outpost in the city. With the outpost destroyed the Scourge began to ready themselves for their final push against Antonidas. However, while the first wizard was camped in the entrance of Dalaran and the second hidden (each with a few defenders), Antonidas had a whole army defending him as he kept up the final aura.\nWith no other course of action, the Scourge engaged said army in battle and after a fierce intense battle, the undead were victorious. Arthas, Kel'Thuzad and &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; entered a vault where Antonidas awaited them. Although the battle was fierce, Antonidas was slain, and the Book of Medivh fell into the hands of Kel'Thuzad. Tichondrius also took the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; at the same time.\nThe Scourge moved to a hill outside Dalaran where Kel'Thuzad worked on the summoning spell while Arthas and his units defended him. The remnants of the mages had regrouped and now sent numbers of mages on the Scourge. The effort was ultimately fruitless as the demons were successfully summoned. In addition to various troops, the great &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kazzak\"&gt;Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; were summoned as well. The summoning was complete with the coming of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; who, moments later, razed the city's spires to the ground.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Kilnar%20Goldensword\"&gt;Kilnar Goldensword&lt;/a&gt; was killed by Arthas himself when the Scourge attacked Dalaran."}

The first phase of his plan was an attack on Khaz Modan, aimed at gaining access to metals and fuel that could be used for building a fleet of ships. Doomhammer achieved this goal quickly, crushing a number of Bronzebeard dwarven armies and citadels in the process. He then constructed a fleet of &lt;a href=\"Transport%23Horde%20Transport\"&gt;transports&lt;/a&gt;, using it to sail most of his warriors to the southern coast of Lordaeron and begin a campaign against the humans. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20Clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow Clan&lt;/a&gt; were left behind to complete the conquest of Khaz Modan and consolidate the orcs' control over the Ironforge Mountains.\nThe dwarves of Ironforge had received missives from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; when the Alliance was being formed, but the Horde's invasion cut off their communications to this new Alliance as well as their Wildhammer cousins at &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. As the orcs conquered nearby dwarven citadels, however, the survivors from these citadels fled to Ironforge and bolstered the capital's defenders. Ironforge soon became the only dwarven stronghold in Khaz Modan that had not fallen, but Kilrogg's Bleeding Hollow were unable to crack it. Each assault ended with the deaths of many good orc warriors, with little gains to show for it.\nBreaking the siege.\nThe Bleeding Hollow continued to batter the &lt;a href=\"gates%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;gates of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and the rocks around it for months, as the rest of the Horde fought against the Alliance across continental Lordaeron. Doomhammer eventually withdrew from his own &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;siege against Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and retreated to Khaz Modan, hoping to regroup with Kilrogg's forces before marching north again. The warchief assumed that Khaz Modan had long been conquered, and he was surprised to learn that this was not the case.\nKilrogg advised Doomhammer that it would be imprudent to abandon the siege now, as it was keeping the Bronzebeard nation contained. If the dwarves were allowed to leave Ironforge, Kilrogg argued, they would fall upon the Horde and force it to fight two armies instead of just one. Doomhammer conceded, ordering Kilrogg to keep as many warriors as he needed to hold the dwarves in Ironforge and harry the approaching humans, while the rest joined the bulk of the Horde in their march to Blackrock Spire. He hoped that Kilrogg would later be able to complete the siege and attack the Alliance from behind as they pursued the Horde.\nThe Alliance did not pass Ironforge by, however. On the recommendation of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; led an assault against the Bleeding Hollow orcs and caught them off guard, as they were still focused on attacking the city gates. An entire row of orcs was mowed down before they could turn to face the Alliance. As the Alliance pressed their attack, Ironforge's heavy doors opened with a supporting attack from the besieged dwarves. The two armies quickly cut down the orcs between them. With that done, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni&lt;/a&gt; promised &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; the support of his people, and sent his brothers &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt; to lead a force to the impeding &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegacy.\nThe role of the Alliance in liberating Ironforge and Khaz Modan during the Second War strengthened relations between dwarves and humans; King Magni Bronzebeard's gratitude kept his people in the Alliance during times when it was beginning to &lt;a href=\"The%20Alliance%20Splinters\"&gt;splinter&lt;/a&gt;. \nLikewise, the siege's length kept the Bleeding Hollow Clan away from most of the Second War's campaigns. This may have contributed to them remaining a viable fighting force during &lt;a href=\"the%20Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;the Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;."}

The battle was also a conclusion to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s actions during the Cataclysm and the &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; campaign, as the infamous &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; prepared to make a final stand against his enemies and former allies.\nThe siege itself began as the combined campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; pushed the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; of Garrosh Hellscream to the very gates of Orgrimmar itself. This happened alongside a naval blockade and landing at &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and before long Hellscream's enemies stormed the city and drove into its &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;underground reaches&lt;/a&gt;.\nExtremely diverse, the attacking forces were made up of the Alliance military led by King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to the many &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; races that turned against the Warchief due to his actions; most Horde leaders also rallied against Hellscream, most notably &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, the orcish loyalists of the True Horde were bolstered by hired &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20the%20Klaxxi\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, and the power of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the end, Garrosh's army fell to the overwhelming strength of the forces arrayed against them, with the Warchief himself confronted and defeated by their strongest &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; deep beneath the city. Captured, Garrosh was spared by &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde and Alliance leadership, who agreed that he should stand trial for his crimes in Pandaria.\nThe end of the siege marked the temporary conclusion of war between the Alliance and Horde, as a tenuous ceasefire was struck between King Wrynn and the Horde's new Warchief, Vol'jin. Despite his defeat, Garrosh would not remain in chains and eventually escaped to instigate the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nAfter being lifted from his depression by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall made Garrosh the overlord of his armies during the war with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the glory he received for participating in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and later being declared &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh's bloodlust and ambition only grew with time. The &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Destruction of Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"De-Subjugation\"&gt;oppression&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, use of &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;evil magic&lt;/a&gt;, and the thoughtless endangerment of the non-orc races drove his allies away from him. Garrosh's paranoia about his supposed allies culminated in his attempted &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. Soon it became clear to Vol'jin that Garrosh did not want the Horde to be a family of the downtrodden, but rather an instrument to building up orc power.\nFed up with Garrosh's tyranny, Vol'jin set about uniting the dissenting leaders of the Horde under the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance, who had also suffered from Garrosh's warmongering, also wished to depose the mad warchief. The Alliance contacted Vol'jin and helped his uprising in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. In exchange, the Horde rebels would try to secure &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; for them when their fleet came.\nPreparations for the Siege.\nHigh King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; has rallied the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; war fleet and has managed to breach &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s blockade over &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Their fleet comprising of reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;; has begun to converge on &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. With the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; distracted by the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance fleet made plans to take Garrosh's forces by surprise and make landfall on &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;; thus opening up a second front to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and barring any enemy reinforcements coming from the sea. Furthermore, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s command began marching with siege weapons towards &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, planning to use them once &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Before%20the%20Gates\"&gt;gates&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the meantime, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; rallied their forces, gaining control of most of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. They also obtained the support of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; rebels, which supplied them with heavy siege weapons. Many orcish citizens of Durotar who opposed Garrosh joined the rebelling forces as well. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; sent reinforcements across the sea from Lordaeron, and planned to regroup with the rest of the rebels once the Alliance secured &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Orgrimmar to rally any dissidents they can find and if possible, Thrall will attempt to confront Garrosh himself. Vol'jin later sent the &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; to investigate why people were disappearing in Durotar. Their investigation led them to &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;, where the Gob Squad discovered that Garrosh's forces have been hatching &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt; eggs, proliferating weapons, and dealing with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shamanism&lt;/a&gt;. All evidence pointed to Garrosh planning some sort of invasion and also searching for some sort of artifact in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The Gob Squad reported their findings to Vol'jin, who no doubt suspected Garrosh of plotting something nefarious.\nGarrosh, however, was prepared for the siege and managed to bring reinforcements to the city before the start of the rebellion. The &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;'s command was tasked with protecting the port against the invading naval forces. &lt;a href=\"General%20Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; and his forces were sent to defend the main gate, and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; legions were placed inside the city, guarding the underground entrance to Garrosh's compound. The &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt; brought heavy cannons, anti-air batteries, and their inventions to help defend Orgrimmar. Garrosh also gained the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt;, bolstering his forces from them as well.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; and a goblin excavation team discovered the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Vault of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; and brought the titan cache containing the dormant &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh went to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. At the Vale, Garrosh fought &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and used the energy of the Vale's pools to revive the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;'s heart. Once the revitalized Heart of Y'Shaarj was his to utilize, Garrosh planned to use it as his ultimate weapon against his enemies.\nChampions of the Alliance and Horde followed &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Cho\"&gt;Lorewalker Cho&lt;/a&gt; through the scarred &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the cause of its destruction. As they explored the unearthed &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; ruins, the raiders encountered &lt;a href=\"Immerseus\"&gt;Immerseus&lt;/a&gt;, a living essence of the Vale's pools that was corrupted by &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; influence. After defeating Immerseus, the group returned to the surface. There the group fended off &lt;a href=\"The%20Fallen%20Protectors\"&gt;the corrupted spirits of the Vale's fallen protectors&lt;/a&gt; at the place where the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Pagoda\"&gt;Golden Pagoda&lt;/a&gt; once stood. Afterwards, the adventurers proceeded to what remains of &lt;a href=\"Big%20Blossom%20Excavation\"&gt;Big Blossom Excavation&lt;/a&gt; and the titan vault that was uncovered before the disaster. Inside, the construct &lt;a href=\"Norushen\"&gt;Norushen&lt;/a&gt; was trying to quarantine the heart chamber and attacked the adventurers, believing they were corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;. After Norushen was defeated, it acknowledged the adventurers' good intentions to cleanse the corruption and allowed them to enter. In the heart chamber, they discovered a wounded Taran Zhu blaming the outsiders for the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;'s release. Lorewalker Cho escorted Taran Zhu out of the vault while Norushen and the adventurers attempted to vanquish the Sha of Pride. The Sha of Pride was ultimately defeated by the adventurers, but not before the Sha killed Norushen. Lorewalker Cho brought &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to aid in the fight but when they arrived, the Sha was already vanquished. Jaina and Lor'themar found &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; in the heart chamber and discovered that Garrosh was responsible for the Vale's destruction. Although tensions remained high between the Horde rebels and the Alliance, the two factions agreed to a temporary alliance in order to bring Garrosh to justice.\nBeginning of the Siege.\nAfter securing the flanks and the arrival of all of the troll, orcish, goblin, and tauren rebels to Razor Hill, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; made its march towards Orgrimmar.\nBlood elf, Forsaken, and eastern orcish rebel forces began sailing across the seas after regrouping in Lordaeron and Pandaria, securing both from Garrosh's remaining forces there. The Alliance's main armada, boarded by most of their leaders, set sail from &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and rendezvoused with the rebel armada to form a united front during their landfall on &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin's forces had not been able to secure the bay, however, and the united armada was met with hostile Dragonmaw orcs, who have fortified themselves along the bay's shore. The united armada stormed &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Landing\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Landing&lt;/a&gt;; defeating the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; and bringing down &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and her mighty proto-dragon, &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s forces set up camp a distance from the gates, barely holding off Garrosh's forces. They've sustained heavy casualties and lost all of their &lt;a href=\"vehicle\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, leaving Vol'jin and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; little choice but to endure the skirmishes with the Kor'kron until reinforcements arrive. Eventually, the Alliance and rebel reinforcements regrouped with Vol'jin's forces, turning the tide of battle. Together, they clashed with the Kor'kron in an epic battle in front of the gates; with &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Helix Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt;'s creation, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Iron Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt;, barring the united force's advance. The mighty heroes eventually destroyed the mechanical scorpion, but the rebellion still lacked the means to besiege the city and more Kor'kron reinforcements were approaching. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; dispatched the Kor'kron reinforcements while their &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s demolished the gates of Orgrimmar. With the gates down, the united forces began invading the city.\nPath to the Underhold.\nThe united forces surged into Orgrimmar, rescuing captured Horde and Alliance civilians and prisoners (many of which were tortured) \u2014 two of which included &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gamon\"&gt;Gamon&lt;/a&gt;. The army went on to dispatch Garrosh's most powerful &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, who wielded twisted and polluted versions of their elemental powers. After defeating them and numerous Kor'kron, the army met up with an injured &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Eitrigg told the heroes that Garrosh was holed up in a &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;compound&lt;/a&gt; beneath the caverns of &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. As the champions raided Ragefire Chasm, the champions saw that most of the &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;warlocks&lt;/a&gt; in Orgrimmar have been burned and hanged as traitors, further indicating Garrosh's brutality. The last barrier between the united front and Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; was his strongest general: &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;. Nazgrim regretted that it has come to this, yet was also content that he would be fighting honorably against foes he respected: his fellow Horde \u2014 whom he fought alongside with during most of his career as a soldier \u2014 and his rivals in the Alliance. Nazgrim threw himself at them, using every skill and tactic he had as a &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt; in the name of his Warchief. He died alongside his own reinforcements; satisfied with the knowledge that the Horde would be led to a brighter future after Garrosh's downfall.\nHellscream's downfall.\nAfter Azeroth's greatest champions killed the Warchief's &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;right-hand man,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thok%20the%20Bloodthirsty\"&gt;strongest beast,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Spoils%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;greatest treasures&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siegecrafter%20Blackfuse\"&gt;goblin mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20the%20Klaxxi\"&gt;Mantid allies&lt;/a&gt;; they found Garrosh in his &lt;a href=\"Inner%20Sanctum%20%28Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%29\"&gt;Inner Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. There, Garrosh stood face to face with his predecessor, Thrall. While Thrall attempted to use his &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;shamanistic&lt;/a&gt; power of the elements against Garrosh, the World Shaman found his powers useless because of the Dark Shaman's corruption of the land around them. After Garrosh quickly defeated Thrall, the heroes of the Horde and Alliance began their own attack on the mad warchief. Wielding his new weapon &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atoh%2C%20Desecrated%20Image%20of%20Gorehowl\"&gt;Xal'atoh, Desecrated Image of Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; and augmented by the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh proved to be a powerful opponent but nevertheless was defeated in battle. In the end, Garrosh collapsed from his injuries but was still alive.\nAftermath.\nAs the leaders of both the Horde and Alliance (except &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;) enter the throne room, Thrall attempts to execute Garrosh on the spot, but is stopped by Varian, who claims the punishment is not for him alone to make. Taran Zhu agrees, claiming the need for Garrosh to stand trial in Pandaria. The leaders agree as Garrosh is taken away in chains. However, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; sees this as an opportunity: attack the remaining Horde leaders while they are all in one place and press on their advantage to dismantle the Horde. Varian, on the other hand, only wishes to speak with the new warchief and is surprised to learn that it is not Thrall, but Vol'jin who now leads the Horde. Varian claims that, while the Horde has committed heinous crimes, he is willing to give peace another chance so long as the Horde retains its honor from now on.\nMeanwhile, in Pandaria, &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Shaohao\"&gt;Emperor Shaohao&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; use their power to grow a large, magical tree in the middle of the Vale of Eternal Sorrows, providing hope that one day, the Vale will heal. Shaohao declares the threat of the Sha and Y'Shaarj to be over.\nGarrosh had deployed his &lt;a href=\"arcweaver\"&gt;arcweaver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s during the battle.

The first stage focuses on dealing with the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; contamination of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s revival of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, and a confrontation with the last Sha prime that has manifested inside the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Vault of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt;. The second stage focuses on the fight in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army make a final push to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; capital city, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, in order to take down the Horde Warchief Garrosh Hellscream and put an end to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Hellscream's intent to take over the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; by force.\nThis is the first raid to implement the &lt;a href=\"Flexible%20Raid\"&gt;Flexible Raid&lt;/a&gt; system, which allow groups of anywhere between 10 and 30 players to raid the instance. Flexible raid was originally its own difficulty between &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt; and normal (now called heroic). With the release of patch 6.0, the difficulties were renamed and scaled to match the new standard.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt; version (and the original flexible version) of the Siege of Orgrimmar is divided into 4 different wings, with each wing originally opening a week (or two) after the previous. See the list of &lt;a href=\"%23Opening%20dates\"&gt;opening dates&lt;/a&gt; for details.\nAs of March 18 2014 (or later in the week for non-US regions), Siege of Orgrimmar is now able to be raided cross-realm with &lt;a href=\"BattleTag\"&gt;BattleTag&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Real%20ID\"&gt;Real ID&lt;/a&gt; friends.\nOpening dates.\nDifficulties are listed as they were called prior to the launch of patch 6.0.\nDescription from site.\n\"Heroes of the Alliance and the Horde have tested their mettle against the might of the sha, the Thunder King, and each other, but neither side could have predicted the boundless atrocities the Horde's warchief would commit.\"\n\"Garrosh Hellscream's reckless thirst for power has led him to do the unthinkable: from beneath the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, he has seized the desiccated heart of an Old God to use as a tool of war, unleashing horrors upon the sacred valley. The brazen warchief has also turned against other members of the Horde to create a purely orcish force of his own. Now this \"true Horde\" is amassing strength within Orgrimmar's iron ramparts. With Garrosh bent on total victory, he plans to demonstrate the potency of the true Horde by conquering not just the Alliance but the whole of Azeroth.\"\n\"It is up to you to purify the vale and bring Garrosh to justice. Should you fail, the frenzied legions of his true Horde will raze all you have ever known and mutate Azeroth into a hellish new Outland.\"\nDungeon Journal.\n\"The tensions stoked by Garrosh Hellscream's arrogance have reached a boiling point with the destruction unleashed upon the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Leaders of the Alliance and Horde lay siege to Hellscream's capital in order to topple the ruthless Warchief once and for all!\"\nEncounters.\n\"Venture through the scarred Vale of Eternal Blossoms, exploring unearthed mogu ruins to discover the source of the destruction.\"\n\"War has come to the gates of Orgrimmar, as Alliance forces and the Darkspear Rebellion seek revenge against Garrosh Hellscream.\"\n\"Within a secret Kor'kron base carved into the sweltering caverns beneath Orgrimmar, Garrosh is assembling his ultimate army.\"\n\"Wielding the dark power that lay dormant beneath Pandaria, Garrosh seeks to bring a new order to Azeroth. He must be stopped!\"\nGetting there.\nThe actual instance entrance is located at the bottom of what was the central lake at in the &lt;a href=\"Summer%20Fields\"&gt;Summer Fields&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.
