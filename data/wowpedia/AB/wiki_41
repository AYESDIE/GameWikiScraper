Its effects are devastating when attuned. This one is attuned to my blood. The same blood flowing through the veins of Reth'hedron - my brother. Aye, his misplaced allegiance will be the end of him.\nTake the cannon and fly to the Twilight Ridge in western Nagrand. Locate Reth'hedron and fire! You must stay on your mount and within range for the effects to take hold. Stand your ground against him and he will have no choice but to flee!\nRewards.\nYou will also receive: \nProgress.\nIs it done?\nCompletion.\nHe will be back, but for now the Legion's war against Lord Illidan is weakened. He shall know of your deeds, captain.\nNotes.\nGrouped players can complete this quest if they remove at least some of Reth'hedron's HP, alive or not as long as they are close to the portal when Reth'hedron passes through it.\nMethod 1&lt;br&gt;\nA relatively easy way to accomplish this quest is to stay mounted and strafe around Reth'hedron in circles while channeling the Soul Cannon to avoid the fireballs. Getting dismounted will in many cases get players killed. Be certain to maintain distance from Reth'hedron laterally, as Reth'hedron will melee lightly-armored players for ~3000 and disrupt the channel. Remember that mobs ignore the z-axis, so if players are immediately above Reth'hedron, he will swing his fists.\nOnce Reth'hedron's HP has reached 10%, he will path towards the Twilight Portal. Keep channeling the Soul Cannon as he walks away, but stay out of melee range.\nMethod 2&lt;br&gt;\nThere is a second and even easier way to accomplish this quest. Fly around the top of the portal and activate the Soul Cannon when Reth'hedron is close to the portal. Then fly to the top of the portal and land on the back of it. You have to make sure you aren't too far away from Reth'hedron or he will continue on his normal path. When you stand here, the fireballs and shadowbolts can't hit you. Occasionally he will try to cast Cripple, but you won't receive this &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Reth'hedron reaches 10% he will start to walk away towards the Portal. Now you just have to follow him until he is totally drained. During these last seconds he won't attack you, so just fly behind him. At 1% he will go through the portal and you will have completed the quest."}

Please note this just frees it: it does not 'de-summon' it like your regular minions.

This will prevent it from freeing itself during the next fight and becoming an add.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt;, subjugating generates a large amount of aggro towards the caster. It's a good idea to set your new minion to Passive and put some distance between you and it if you're going to manually release it.\nA good way to get rid of an subjugated demon is to order it to stay and run away. The demon will be dismissed but you will be far enough from it for it to simply despawn without attacking you. Another way is to dismiss it, banish it, and then run away."}

With no masks left to wear, the Banshee Queen unleashes her full power to protect the Banished One while his ultimate plan unfolds.\"\nOverview.\nAzeroth's champions battle Sylvanas at the pinnacle of the Sanctum of Domination, across the vastness between the Maw and the Eternal City, and within the Arbiter's chamber.\nPlayers first encounter Sylvanas atop Torghast. Upon reaching 85% health, she rips apart chunks of the tower itself.\nAs the Jailer envelops Oribos in the Maw, players pursue him with the aid of Thrall, Jaina Proudmoore, and Bolvar Fordragon, forging new paths and defeating Mawforged commanders while Sylvanas harrows from all sides in Banshee Form.\nWithin the Crucible, the Banished One executes his grand plan. Our allies confront the dominated Anduin Wrynn while Sylvanas engages players directly.\nAbilities.\nStage One: A Cycle of Hatred.\n\"We have forgotten what makes us strong.\"\nPlayers battle against Sylvanas atop Torghast while the Jailer remains elusive.\nIntermission: A Monument to our Suffering.\n\"You are unfit to wear this crown.\"\nUpon reaching 85% health, Sylvanas chains all players with Domination Chains, then casts Rive, destroying the tower itself.\nStage Two: The Banshee Queen.\n\"What are we if not slaves to this torment?\"\nSylvanas enters Banshee Form, taking to the skies to waylay players' pursuit of the Jailer as he ascends. Thrall and Jaina lend their aid, and cast Call Earth and Channel Ice, respectively, after defeating the Mawforged commanders.\nStage Three: The Freedom of Choice.\n\"Nothing can stop what is to come.\"\nSylvanas follows the players' traversal, greeting them for the final showdown between Death and inevitability in the Jailer's master plan.\nLoot.\nThe loot from the encounter is obtained from the &lt;a href=\"Domination-etched%20Treasure%20Cache\"&gt;Domination-etched Treasure Cache&lt;/a&gt;, which spawns after the ending cinematic.\nQuotes.\nStage three ending.\nAt the end of the encounter, a short cutscene plays of the Jailer blasting the Arbiter with a bolt of power, destroying her shield as Sylvanas watches in triumph.\nCinematic.\nImmediately after the cutscene, a &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20in-game%20cinematics\"&gt;pre-rendered cinematic&lt;/a&gt; plays:\n\"The scene begins with the central orb of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; flying out of her body, as what's left of it gets pulled into the orb. While &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; extends his hand out to it, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; skids to his feet, with &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; looking on. She focuses on the Jailer, trying to decipher what he's going to do.\"\n\"The orb, showing a stylized infinity symbol, slots into the hole in the Jailer's chest as the area is blinded by a flash.\"\n\"Wincing from the flash, Sylvanas looks up to see the Jailer, who is now fully armored with a &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;-style helm on his head. After saying \"mine\" in a different tone, a gigantic portal with a &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt; yellow geometric pattern opens out of the structure behind him.\"\n\"The Jailer channels an orb of power in his right hand and chains &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, sending them to their kees as they drop their weapons. Their eyes turn the characteristic blue of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas, upset by this, calls out:\"\n\"Not deigning to notice, he focuses on the orb. Sylvanas turns to glance at Anduin, who is completely under the Jailer's thrall, still focused on Bolvar and party.\"\n\"As \"serve\" echoes, Sylvanas closes her eyes, thinking back to when the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; both used that word.\"\n\"Sylvanas opens her eyes at this, instantly draws her bow and fires a bolt at the Jailer's face. Not bothering to take his eyes off the orb in his right hand, the Jailer's left hand plucks the arrow out of the air. As the arrow dissipates, he turns to focus on Sylvanas.\"\n\"The jailer lets the moment stand for a beat.\"\n\"Out of nowhere, in a reversal of situations from &lt;a href=\"The%20Highlord%27s%20Vision\"&gt;The Highlord's Vision&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin draws &lt;a href=\"Kingsmourne\"&gt;Kingsmourne&lt;/a&gt; and holds it at Sylvanas's neck. She barely reacts, just shifting her eyes to Anduin.\"\n\"Sylvanas turns back to look at the Jailer.\"\n\"The Jailer opens a small blue portal and pulls another soul fragment crystal out of it.\"\n\"He smashes the crystal in his hand...\"\n\"...and blasts the soul fragment into Sylvanas! Shocked by the blow, she drops her bow. An outline of Sylvanas wearing her ranger outfit mirrors her movements before fading out with an echo of her death scream. Sylvanas drops to one knee and catches herself with her hands.\"\n\"The chains around Thrall, Bolvar, and Jaina fade away, as does their blue eye glow.\"\n\"The Jailer turns and exits through the portal, with Anduin just behind. &lt;a href=\"Varian%27s%20compass\"&gt;Varian's compass&lt;/a&gt;, still containing the portrait of Anduin, falls to the ground unnoticed. As the portal closes, Thrall, Bolvar, and Jaina close in on Sylvanas. On her hands and knees, Sylvanas weakly gives a warning, her eyes blue for the first time in many years.\"\n\"Out of strength, Sylvanas's eyes roll back as she grunts and falls to her side. As she hits the ground, the scene cuts to black.\"\nPost-cinematic dialogue.\nAfter the cinematic, Bolvar, Jaina, and Thrall remain with the unconscious Sylvanas at the center of the Crucible. Jaina also opens a portal to the normal Oribos."}

It was based in &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; and operated primarily in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, although a few small encampments were scattered in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. These humans are enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, especially for humans in the areas the Syndicate threatens, like the &lt;a href=\"Trollbane%20family\"&gt;Trollbane family&lt;/a&gt;. The Syndicate is the rival of another rogue faction, the guild of &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;. All who encounter these rogue vagabonds should be prepared for battle.\nFollowing the demise of &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, who directed the Syndicate's actions in the Alterac Mountains, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Falconcrest\"&gt;Lord Falconcrest&lt;/a&gt; became one of the few Syndicate leaders, commanding their forces in Arathi from the semi-abandoned fortress of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. With the retaking of Stromgarde by the returning &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the Syndicate stands leaderless.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Syndicate has lost almost all of its territories to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, although their remaining forces continue to operate in the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Mask\"&gt;masks&lt;/a&gt; worn by the Syndicate members are orange, just like the color of the fallen kingdom of Alterac. Nobles can be found among their ranks hiding as normal agents, but their signet rings still make them recognizable.\nHistory.\nThird War.\n&lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; began his operations in the Alterac Mountains an unknown amount of time before &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; escaped from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; began, a group of Syndicate goons known as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodhill%20Bandits\"&gt;Bloodhill Bandits&lt;/a&gt; were operating in the woodlands outside &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, before being defeated by the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and prince of Lordaeron, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; accepted 's aid in routing out the Syndicate affliction, housing the base of operations out of &lt;a href=\"Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;manor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are enemies of both the Alliance, whom they consider their mortal enemies, and the Horde, whom they consider mere brutes good for nothing but slave labor. As a result, the Syndicate was hunted by both factions, with the Banshee Queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, placing a bounty on their heads - guaranteeing that all captured Syndicate members will be summarily executed. In addition, Horde Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; ordered a number of his agents, including &lt;a href=\"Krusk\"&gt;Krusk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drull\"&gt;Drull&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tog%27Thar\"&gt;Tog'Thar&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Dir\"&gt;Gol'Dir&lt;/a&gt; to launch an investigation into the nature of the Syndicate and its activities, but they were captured in &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gol%27dir\"&gt;Gol'dir&lt;/a&gt; was brought to &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, only &lt;a href=\"Krusk\"&gt;Krusk&lt;/a&gt; managed to flee and tried to free them. Thrall as well ordered to recover a necklace that belonged to a dear friend of his, &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha Foxton&lt;/a&gt; - a necklace now worn by Elysa, the mistress of Lord Aliden.\n&lt;a href=\"Andron%20Gant\"&gt;Andron Gant&lt;/a&gt; secretly kept sending them some information.\nAlterac Mountains.\nOnce the domain of &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, the Alterac Mountains houses &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; - an abandoned town that had been taken over by the Syndicate and transformed into a military installation where Syndicate agents practiced their skills as well as kept some of their enslaved orcs. The mountains are also the home of &lt;a href=\"Dandred%27s%20Fold\"&gt;Dandred's Fold&lt;/a&gt; - the area where the late Syndicate leader, Lord &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, was located. The Syndicate has several camps in the &lt;a href=\"Uplands\"&gt;Uplands&lt;/a&gt;, where they are strongest.\nThe forces of the Syndicate in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Master%20Ryson\"&gt;Syndicate Master Ryson&lt;/a&gt;, intended to do as the Alteraci people had always done: wait until a clear victor rose from the ashes, and then strike.\nHillsbrad Foothills.\nThe presence of the Syndicate in the Hillsbrad Foothills was fairly low. Although a number of skirmishes with its agents had been reported, credible sources attest that the Syndicate forces there were poorly trained and equipped, and were no match for an experienced adventurer. In spite of this, the Syndicate had successfully held control over &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and was using it as its base of operations in the area for some time.\nArathi Highlands.\nThe Syndicate ruled over small pockets everywhere in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, like &lt;a href=\"Northfold%20Manor\"&gt;Northfold Manor&lt;/a&gt;. But most importantly, the Syndicate had domination over a big part of the land's ruined capital, &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, despite the best efforts by the Alliance to remove the Syndicate from the area. This city was held by one of the highest-ranking leaders of the Syndicate, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Falconcrest\"&gt;Lord Falconcrest&lt;/a&gt;, and his elite brigade.\nCataclysm.\nThe Syndicate had been almost completely pushed out of the Hillsbrad Foothills. They have lost Durnholde Keep to the Forsaken, and the hills overlooking Hillsbrad to &lt;a href=\"Stormpike\"&gt;Stormpike&lt;/a&gt; troops. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; happens, the Syndicate's presence in the Alterac Mountains is much reduced. Dandred's Fold is completely deserted, with the last troops of the Syndicate located in &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Uplands\"&gt;Uplands&lt;/a&gt;. Gol'dir had been liberated and Taretha's necklace recovered from the Syndicate's hands. The Alteraci's organization power in Arathi Highlands remained unbroken at the time, but the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were trying to break their control over Stromgarde and, with it, Arathi.\nLegion.\nBy the time of the Legion's invasion, an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; had retaken most of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; including the Syndicate-occupied portion. With this, the Syndicate presence there and their leader was no longer, implying they were killed.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has them fighting over territories and settlements in the continent of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, some of which were previously held by either the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; or the Syndicate. The Syndicate's holdings in Northfold were taken over by the Horde while Stromgarde was mostly restored by the Alliance. However, the Syndicate takes over the &lt;a href=\"Dabyrie%27s%20Farmstead\"&gt;Dabyrie's Farmstead&lt;/a&gt; when the Alliance controls Stromgarde, and &lt;a href=\"Go%27Shek%20Farm\"&gt;Go'Shek Farm&lt;/a&gt; when the Horde controls Stromgarde. Despite their heavy losses, they still manage to harass the opposing factions. The factions drove them back to Alterac.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde took control of the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;ruins of Alterac City&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; in order to use them as garrisons against the Alliance, dislodging the Syndicate from its positions.\nObjectives and philosophy.\nThe Argus Wake.\nThere is considerable evidence that the Syndicate is being manipulated by a higher group called the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn serve the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Jaedenar\"&gt;Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt;. This would put the Argus Wake on a level with groups such as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Blade\"&gt;Searing Blade&lt;/a&gt;. Precious little information exists about either the Argus Wake or their exact connection to the Syndicate, however. The Argus Wake does not appear to be present anywhere outside the Alterac Mountains, and their only minions there are the human Argus Shadow Mages in Strahnbrad. In &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall warns that the Argus Wake is a group that serves the Shadow Council, just like the Burning Blade and Searing Blade; beyond this, the group receives little mention.\nThe Argus Wake would appear to have literally nothing to do with the lost &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;Eredar&lt;/a&gt; homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, except the fact that the Shadow Council is a group of &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; and demon worshipers, the Eredar themselves being demons hailing from Argus. Could be the Argus Wake named themselves that in honor of the great Eredar.\nAssassination policy.\nThe Syndicate has worked hard to destabilize the regions it operates in and does not hesitate to resort to subterfuge and covert operations. &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Vardus\"&gt;Baron Vardus&lt;/a&gt;, a high-ranking member of the Syndicate, was involved in the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt;'s forerunner in &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. Baron Vardus has since been assassinated, though it is still unclear whether this was done by an agent of the Alliance seeking to retaliate for the attempt on the Magistrate's life or by a representative of the Horde seeking to further check the expansion of the Shadow Council's agents, perhaps both.\nSlavery.\nThe Syndicate strongly believes in slave labor and is determined to return to the days of the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s for &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Aliden Perenolde in particular was determined to enslave the orcs again, thus following in the footsteps of his mentor &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nHow to gain reputation.\nCurrently, there is only one known option to increase a player's reputation with the Syndicate, and that is by killing members of the &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; faction. All Ravenholdt-affiliated NPCs give 5 Syndicate reputation points, with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Myrokos%20Silentform\"&gt;Myrokos Silentform&lt;/a&gt;, who gives 25. 0/3000 Neutral status is the highest you can reach with the Syndicate. With all players starting at 32000/36000 Hated with the faction, this would require 10,000 reputation, or 2,000 dead Ravenholdt NPCs.\nUnfortunately, at the moment there are no rewards from increasing Syndicate reputation, and none of the Ravenholdt NPCs drop loot. \nMost classes cannot raise Syndicate reputation without lowering Ravenholdt reputation. Rogues can achieve 0/3000 Neutral with the Syndicate while being friendly with Ravenholdt thanks to &lt;a href=\"Syndicate%20Emblems\"&gt;Syndicate Emblems&lt;/a&gt;, which is only available while Neutral with Ravenholdt. Turn in a Syndicate Emblem to gain 250 Ravenholdt reputation. Ten Ravenholdt NPCs may now be killed for a net gain of 50 Syndicate reputation. Therefore, at least 200 emblems must be pickpocketed to gain the 10,000 rep with the Syndicate. Note, however, that if you intend to become exalted with Ravenholdt, this would be a complete waste of time.\nA Player should not try to gain reputation with the Syndicate until level 70/80, where the player can kill the Ravenholdt guards quickly and easily. You will not receive any rewards for being with the Syndicate or Ravenholdt (Depending on class). However, being neutral with the Syndicate will make it very easy for you to run into their territory without having to kill low-level mobs and waste time.\nIn the RPG.\nThey hate the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; with a passion, as these &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s severed ties right when the Syndicate needed them.\nHistory.\nThe Syndicate's roots lie in the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, one of the human nations that was part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. \nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde attempted to conscript some Alliance nobles to help them. Lord &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Alterac, and other nobles from the kingdom thought the Alliance would lose the war, and collaborated with the Horde. Yet the Alliance won, and Alterac's treachery was uncovered. Alterac was crushed by the other nations and Perenolde, along with other nobles and many of their allies, were sentenced to exile by &lt;a href=\"Uther%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe ousted nobles discovered, to their dismay, that the few bands of free orcs in Lordaeron wanted nothing to do with them and refused them sanctuary, so they began stealing to stay alive. Soon they banded together to become more powerful and called themselves the Syndicate. A haughty, fractious group led loosely by Lord &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, this collection of fledgling rogues had many troubles working together, but managed to stay alive by stealing from towns and villages and never staying in one area for long. During their travels, other outlaws joined their ranks. These professional thieves found they preferred a larger community of rogues to working alone, although some detested the Syndicate's haughty noble leaders. Lord Aiden Perenolde, the self-proclaimed leader, realized he had to do something drastic to reclaim his lands. When the Burning Legion and the Scourge began their assault on Lordaeron, he did not make the same mistake twice by allying himself with the enemy; he simply took advantage of the Alliance's distraction to begin reclaiming his lands. The harried and panicked citizens, the people they used to lord over, were frightened and confused and put up little fight, more concerned with the hellish creatures that were rampaging over the land. The Syndicate thus retook the Alterac Mountains and currently battles with ogres and the undead to keep their lands. After regaining much of their lost territory, they sought to expand their sphere of influence, looking to punish the already hurting Alliance. They set their sights on the Arathi Highlands to the South. Later when Aiden Perenolde was captured and ousted, Lord &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, Aiden's son, took over the Syndicate. Perhaps Lady &lt;a href=\"Beve%20Perenolde\"&gt;Beve Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of Aiden Perenolde, plays an important role too. Their father later died in prison.\nAt first, the Syndicate's goal was just to spread chaos and disorder, striking from hidden bases in the Alterac Mountains. With the end of the Third War and the resultant chaos, however, the leaders of the Syndicate saw their chance to return Alterac to its former power. They have now gained control of several outposts in the surrounding area including the sacked fortress of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and a portion of the city of Stromgarde.\nOrganization.\nThe trouble with the Syndicate is that it is primarily made up of egotistical, high-born nobles, with lands, farms, and citizens who once owed fealty to them. When time came for them to band together and work as one, there was difficulty in finding a leader, as they all wanted the job. Once the Alterac Mountains were retaken and nearly every noble was back in his former home with a citizenry of bandits serving him, many of the old habits returned. Each noble claimed autonomy from the others and considered himself answerable to no one. When Lord Aiden Perenolde came up with the idea to take advantage of the Alliance's crippled state and attack neighboring lands, the Syndicate once again came under his rule, grudgingly. There was little structure beyond his rule, although Lord Falconcrest had taken over command in the Arathi Highlands.\nEach noble has a household and family that serve him or her, including whatever rogues or &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s they've picked up along the way. These nobles in turn answered to Lord Perenolde, but there was little\norganization beyond that. The Syndicate suffers from pride and jealousy, each leader wished to be in Perenolde's position. There are no titles and little management. Infighting, usually over newly acquired holdings, is a frequent problem. The dirty work, of course, is done by the people lower in the household. The nobles did the stealing and the fighting when they were exiles, but they consider themselves too good for that now, desiring to merely train their underlings and plan grand conquests over ravaged Lordaeron. Yet don't mistake, these nobles are fierce in battle and will pick up weapons if pushed.\nMilitary.\nThe Syndicate has no standing army. All adult members are expected to be able to pull their weight in a fight, although since returning to a landed state, the higher echelons participate less and less. With several thousand potential soldiers one might think that the Syndicate would be able to raise a sizeable army. However, the lack of strong leadership makes assembling a force of significant size nearly impossible. The noble households (gangs of criminals, really) hold only nominal loyalty to Perenolde or each other, and thus forces of greater than 50 individuals are rare.\nSince returning to Alterac the Syndicate has become less cohesive. Each noble claims a territory (usually, but not always, their original lands), and his or her household \"works\" that land, stealing from the communities within it and the travelers who pass through. If a village proves stubborn or a common threat enters the area (such as Scourge forces), multiple households may band together to deal with the threat to their collective sovereignty. However, the households just as often work at cross-purposes, squabbling over territory.\nMost members of the Syndicate lack training in any productive occupation and receive no encouragement to learn. Instead, the households survive by \"appropriation of resources,\" which is just a fancy way of saying \"stealing.\" In most cases, a noble sends his goons to a village and tells the inhabitants that they are now under the \"protection\" of his household. They then tax the village \u2014 taking food, supplies, and whatever else catches their fancy. A village that refuses meets with violent retribution, until it either submits or is destroyed. These \"taxes\" are often more than the noble's household needs or the village can afford. Woe betides the village that finds itself between two competing households. The Syndicate is also infamous for \"taxing\" travelers through their lands.\nMembers of the Syndicate are almost exclusively warriors or rogues (or both). Other classes are rare: The Syndicate has only a handful of magi and warlocks, and no healers. Many of the founding members also have levels in aristocrat. Because of the prevalence of rogues and the lack of healers, the Syndicate favors ambush tactics. The ideal combat is one in which they can surprise their opponents, get what they want quickly, and leave without being followed. They know they can't win a battle of attrition, and avoid extended combat.\nGiven that the Syndicate's primary targets are travelers and small villages, most raids go according to plan. If a target turns out to be more powerful than expected \u2014 if, for example, the travelers are in fact adventurers \u2014 the gang retreats. Often it returns at a more advantageous time with reinforcements, but sometimes it doesn't return at all. Some of the nobles would rather let spoils go than be forced to share them with another household.\nMembership.\nMost Syndicate members had no choice in the matter: they were part of the traitorous nobles' households, either staff or family, and they were exiled with their lords. They learned the lifestyle of the thief the hard way, leaving their pampered lives behind to steal from others. They still managed to justify it with no problem, saying that their victims should be supporting them anyway, as they once did. Many of these valets, stablehands, and pampered noble children found themselves developing a clever hand and a scrappy demeanor when it came to living hand-to-mouth on the road. After some weeks of whining, most everyone began pulling their weight when their bellies became empty enough. With enough stolen items, they began to build a semblance of a community in the foothills.\nLeaving the Syndicate is very difficult. Each noble knows who belongs in his own little \"gang\" and notices when someone goes missing. The penalty for attempting to leave is whipping and branding the lower back with an \"S.\" Bandits found the Syndicate a powerful organization that, while fraught with infighting, is still better to belong to than the smaller gangs they were leading. The Syndicate had greater plans than simply robbing the refugees fleeing Lordaeron. Land conquest was more than the bandits had ever dreamed, and they were eager to join. The Syndicate accepted their pledges of fealty, and thus stronger warriors and rogues brought their skills to the group. One of the smarter decisions Aiden Perenolde made for the Syndicate was to break up these bandit gangs among the noble families, giving the bandits new allegiances so the gangs couldn't stay together to work against the nobles. This trick worked perfectly, and most bandits went along with it for the greater reward. Any member of the Horde wishing to join the Syndicate is slaughtered on sight.\nCommand structure.\nThe leadership of the Syndicate is fractured, and much of a noble household's energy goes towards jockeying for position within the unspoken hierarchy. The corrupt nobles send their best rogues and assassins not against their enemies but against their peers."}

As a child, T'paartos lived near a marsh on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; where he was bullied for being fat and simple-minded. He would befriend animals such as &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"elekk\"&gt;elekk&lt;/a&gt;, and bugs, but never &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt;s. When he was scared he would hide in a cave, but on one situation ended up facing an angered &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;. He felt no one could hurt him if he remained alone.\nT'paartos raised an elekk named &lt;a href=\"Ika\"&gt;Ika&lt;/a&gt; when its mother was killed. As an adult, he became stronger but grew boastful of his strength (something he later found embarrassing). He never got over his fear of snakes, and still felt inadequate inside. He, however, faced many demons as a member of the Army of the Light.\nAs part of his trial to become Lightforged, T'paartos faced his memories and fears, striking down physical manifestations of them. His Lightforged trial with him confronting &lt;a href=\"T%27paartos%20the%20Fallen\"&gt;T'paartos the Fallen&lt;/a&gt;, an image of his darkness who tempted him to leave the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; behind and embrace the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;. T'paartos, declaring that the Light had always been with him, conquered his darkness, slaying his fallen counterpart, and in the process successfully became Lightforged.\nAfterwards, &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that T'paartos would serve their people's cause well, and the enthusiastic draenei can occasionally be seen departing the \"Vindicaar\" through the portal to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, shouting his own name as he seemingly becomes an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;."}

Lady Jaina has the power of frost at her fingertips, with abilities like Frost Nova, Glacial Tomb, and Ice Lance. Her abilities are not enough to decimate her opponents, though, so she is assisted by the best that the Alliance has to offer. Roke the Ice Baron brings an army of frost allies to assist Lady Jaina. If this group of Alliance had their way, nothing they came up against would ever thaw out.\nDark Lady Sylvanas Windrunner (Hunter).\n\"\"The Banshee Queen has plans for you!\"\u201d The Dark Lady has a plethora of Hunter abilities at her disposal. From Arcane Shot to Turn the Blade and Steady Shot, she has the firepower to take out anything in the way of her army of Horde allies. In addition to those versatile Hunter abilities, she also has Multi-Shot to deal with multiple opposing allies at once. From afar, she can pepper the opposition with arrows from her bow, Windrunner\u2019s Heartseeker. The more Undead that come along, the bigger her bow gets. \nHogger (Warrior).\n\u201c\"Forest just setback!\"\u201d If it's brute force you're looking for, Hogger is the hero for you! The powerful Gnoll Warrior has what it takes to decimate the opposing forces with abilities like Execute and Monstrous Cleave. No Warrior would be complete without an arsenal of weapons, such as the mighty Sulfuras, The Extinguished Hand. Hogger isn't alone in this battle, though. Powerful Ogres, such as Grag\u2019tok and Throk the Conqueror, are also ready to charge onto the battlefield. \nMurkdeep (Shaman).\n\u201c\"Rr mgg Gggmlmmm Lgmlmgl m Mrrrlrml.\"\u201d Murlocs show their strength in numbers, and Murkdeep and his Monster allies are no different. From Element\u2019s Fury to the decimating Greater Chain Lightning, this Shaman has what it takes to dispense with opposing allies. Murkdeep is not alone in his fight\u2014he brings a lot of Murlocs with him. Chumly and Gobbler lead the charge with an army of Murloc Coastrunners behind them. If your forces are dwindling, you can call in reinforcements with Unleash the Swarm!\nElderlimb (Druid).\n\u201c\"Prudence should not mean granting our enemy unnecessary advantages.\"\u201d Do not be fooled by the healing power of the Ancients\u2014they also bring with them an entire army of Treants. Elderlimb calls on the power of Nature's Reach and Verdant Boon to fill his side of the battlefield. These powerful allies are not alone; more Ancients also join the fight against the opposing forces. Elderlimb harnesses the power of the Branch of Nordrassil to further command his army. With the power of Nature at his side, Elderlimb is a force to be reckoned with."}

{"id": "75737", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=75737", "title": "TCG UDE points", "text": "General Information.\nBack when Upper Deck had the license to the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Trading%20Card%20Game\"&gt;World of Warcraft Trading Card Game&lt;/a&gt;, in each booster pack was an extra card that featured what was known as UDE points. Originally, these cards had a minigame printed on them, but since set 3, &lt;a href=\"Fires%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Fires of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, each point card became a material card, which could be used to create powerful crafted cards by mailing them to the company itself. On some backs, these would also feature rules and tokens for TCG-based &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. When Cryptozoic Entertainment took control of the TCG, the UDE points program did not transfer with it. Sets released after set 11, &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate%20%28TCG%29\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, no longer featured UDE points on the material cards. Shortly before Wrathgate was released, the Upper Deck store removed its World of Warcraft-related items. As of right now, most, if not all the websites featured on point, material, and loot (Pre-Wrathgate) cards either no longer work, or redirect people to the Cryptozoic website.\nItems able to be obtained with UDE points included wallpapers, screensavers, tokens (Now on the backs of material cards), in-game items and tabards, alternate printable art sleeves for UDEck cases, playmats, non-foil treasure packs, action figures, and &lt;a href=\"Landro%27s%20Pet%20Box\"&gt;Landro's Pet Box&lt;/a&gt;. They originally planned to add many more items, including EAs, unique card sleeves, signed original art, hero card packs, and foil versions of existing cards, but the transfer from UDE to Cryptozoic was sudden and unexpected. Not all of these items are lost, however. The common loot of Wrathgate, Landro's Gift, can give a player one of the tabards that was up for sale, in addition to what &lt;a href=\"Landro%27s%20Pet%20Box\"&gt;Landro's Pet Box&lt;/a&gt; originally contained. It is unknown what the fate is for the other in-game items, the &lt;a href=\"Carved%20Ogre%20Idol\"&gt;Carved Ogre Idol&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Perpetual%20Purple%20Firework\"&gt;Perpetual Purple Firework&lt;/a&gt;, or the fate of the items that were planned to go on the store.\nUDE Points Cards Games.\nOn the original UDE points cards, there were pictures of ninjas, pirates, monsters and monkeys, as well as statistics for a separate game.\nThese were used for \"Ninjas Vs. Pirates\", a game that required a hefty amount of points cards.\nThe rules card, which is also a points card, gives a run-down of the game, which is quite similar to the card game \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whist\"&gt;Whist&lt;/a&gt;\"\n\"Begin with 10-15 cards for each player. Use the same deck for each hand. Dealer is chosen at random each hand. Deal out all the cards evenly to the players. Set aside any extra cards. Dealer plays his or her highest-rank card of any suit to start. Each player then plays one card. The card must match the led suit if possible. Lowest-rank card of the led suit takes the trick. Lowest-rank Monster, if any, beats all other cards. If identical winning cards are played, the last copy played takes the trick. Winner of the trick scored the gains and losses for the trick. Start at 100*. Win the game at 200* Lose at 0*\"\nCards after the &lt;a href=\"Fires%20of%20Outland\"&gt;Fires of Outland&lt;/a&gt; set do not have any of these game statistics, since they have material cards instead."}

The file must be present, and have the same name (plus extension) as its parent folder for the addon to be recognized by the client.\nBasic rules.\nThe .toc file and addon folder name need to match, e.g. codice_1 and codice_2 \nThe file may contain the following elements:\nWhitespace before codice_5 will be interpreted as the start of a filename. However, the client trims whitespace around metadata values (after the colon).\nBackslashes (codice_6) are recommended for subdirectories to prevent issues with codice_7 tags.\nMultiple client flavors.\nClassic and retail versions of the game can be properly supported by including multiple TOC files in the same addon. The client first searches for the respective suffix and otherwise falls back to codice_8\nFile load order.\nThe .toc file provides an ordered list of files to be loaded by the client. In the earlier example:\nNot every file must appear in a .toc list:\nInterface version.\nThe interface field declares the version of the game client for which the addon has been made. This field guarantees that users of an addon will have a game API that is compatible with the one the author used during development.\nConversely, if addons declare an older interface than the user's current one, instability and breakages may occur because the game API changes over time. However, users may opt into this risk by ticking the \"Load out of date addons\" checkbox. Additionally, the omission of this field causes the game to treat the addon as always out of date.\nHere is an example of how this field is declared in TOC files:\nInterface sources.\nThere are a number of ways to get the current interface version.\nWowpedia.\nThis wiki maintains . They are displayed in the table below. Note that these values are updated by contributors, so they may occasionally be out of date.\ncodice_16.\nThe API function will return data about the currently released game client that is available to players.

It is the spark in their hearts that connects the mortals even to the elements. Spirit brings balance to fire, earth, air, and water, and the reason that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s are so chaotic is because, as it developed, Azeroth's unusually vast &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt; consumed much of planet's Spirit. On worlds more plentiful in spirit like &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the elementals are calmer and work in harmony. In fact, Draenor had so much Spirit that it caused accelerated plant growth, giving rise to the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;s. Spirit has also shown the ability to turn stone into flesh over time. The &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; were infused with spirit energy by the spores released upon the Sporemound &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;'s death, turning them into flesh in the form of &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s over thousands of years.\nThe Shaman said that all things had a life, a power, a spirit. They are deeply involved with the spirits of the elements \u2014 earth, air, fire, water, and the Spirit of the Wilds \u2014 and claimed they could sense the &lt;a href=\"Life\"&gt;life force&lt;/a&gt; in earth and even seemingly dead stone. This Spirit was what gave the shaman their connection to the elements, to others, and to himself. The Spirit of Life is what granted Thrall the strength to hold &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Earth\"&gt;something&lt;/a&gt; so strong, so profound, that it had once been granted by the titans themselves.\nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; save this Spirit for apprentice's studies till they are ready. &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt; was not sure if he contacted the spirit as it is said to be a ghostly, elusive feeling.\n&lt;a href=\"Decay\"&gt;Decay&lt;/a&gt;, the opposite of Spirit, can be used to bind an elemental to one's will and force the elements to obey. Those who use Decay are known as &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;. It is believed that both Spirit and Decay influence the soul's creation of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearances.\nThrall once called upon the Spirit of the Wilds to have a great white stag lay down its life when food was becoming scarce for the Frostwolf Clan and was able to summon incorporeal spirit wolves by asking for the favor of the Spirit of Life. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was firstly unable to reach it, though as his journey continued, he embraced it, thus was easily able to communicate with other elements.\nWhen the other four elements of nature showed &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; this spirit for the first time, he felt that the Wilds was immense and cold, but not hostile, its presence making him feel very small. This spirit spoke with a multitude of voices, both feminine and masculine, in a harmonic symphony from within and all around him. At the time he realized that he was not yet experienced enough to actually understand them.\n&lt;a href=\"Kador%20Cloudsong\"&gt;Kador Cloudsong&lt;/a&gt; once summoned the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the Spirit of Life."}

It was one of the most important stats for &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to continue healing for prolonged periods, with lack of sufficient spirit often causing under-geared healers to run out of mana prematurely. Spirit was of no practical use to non-healing specs, since they regenerated mana by other means.\nTemporary buffs to spirit.\nThere were several consumable buffs to spirit. Not all stacked with each other, and some have limited availability.\nBuffs:\nElixir (you can have 1 &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Elixir\"&gt;Battle Elixir&lt;/a&gt; and 1 &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20Elixir\"&gt;Guardian Elixir&lt;/a&gt;):\nFlask:\nFood (food or drink):\nSeasonal:\nOther effects.\nSome talents and abilities allow you to use your spirit in other ways.\nLore.\nSpirit is one of the elemental forces.\n&lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; use the word &lt;a href=\"chi\"&gt;chi&lt;/a&gt; for the same energy used by shamans to heal. It is the primal life force the shaman tap into. Monks harness their inner chi (i.e. inner spirit) to power their abilities, while using their bodies as their main weapon: Chi energy is directed to control the battlefield by enhancing own's movement and restricting foe\u2019s, healing allies while simultaneously damaging enemies, or invoking celestial spirits to aid in battle.\nIn the RPG.\nSpirit in the RPG has an entirely different meaning and function than in \"World of Warcraft\".\nIn the RPG, Spirit relates to common sense and the ability to perceive the environment. It gives a character the ability to look at a forest and find the tracks of a creature; at the simplest level it allows a character to know not to put his hands in the fire, else they will get burned. Any creature that can perceive its environment in any fashion has at least some Spirit. Those who survive by wit and intuition, such as healers and scouts, have high Spirit."}

In addition, they resurrect &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minions&lt;/a&gt; of the fallen player (if they had one when they died). Resurrected players are also granted the 'Preparation' buff, reducing the power cost of spells and abilities to zero for a few seconds.\nIn battlegrounds where graveyards can be captured, capturing a graveyard will cause that graveyard's Spirit Guide to despawn, and a Spirit Guide appropriate to the new controlling faction to appear. Any ghosts waiting at the graveyard to be resurrected when it is captured will be teleported to the nearest Spirit Guide for their faction. However, this process takes a moment and can occasionally cause players to miss the resurrection wave.\nSpirit Guides resurrect all nearby players of the appropriate faction on a regular cycle. Players are automatically included in the resurrection wave upon appearing at the graveyard, and the time until resurrection is displayed in a dialog box that appears upon joining the wave. Players can cancel their inclusion in the resurrection wave by clicking 'Cancel' in the dialog box, or simply moving out of range of the Spirit Guide. Players can re-join the resurrection wave by speaking to the Spirit Guide, using the 'Return to Graveyard' UI element that appears while dead, or waiting near the Spirit Guide for the start of the next wave, at which point all nearby players are automatically re-included. Players who do not release from their corpses will not be resurrected.\n&lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Spirit%20Guide\"&gt;Alliance Spirit Guide&lt;/a&gt;s appear in the form of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, while &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Spirit%20Guide\"&gt;Horde Spirit Guide&lt;/a&gt;s appear in the form of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.

Believed to be the ill omen of a coming age, white Tauren are held in near reverence by their people, often becoming reclusive priests who wander the land in search of kindred spirits. Attacks land and air units.\nInformation.\nThe Spirit Walker is a powerful Orcish support unit. They initially come with Spirit Link, which allows the affected units to share the incoming damage between them. While it means these units will take damage together, it allows units to hold longer against attacks that would be normally fatal to them and greatly diminishes enemy focus fire, making key targets like the &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Blademaster&lt;/a&gt; and other spellcasters harder to pick off. This ability has very good synergy with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shadow Hunter's&lt;/a&gt; Healing Wave and the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Witch%20Doctor%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Witch Doctor's&lt;/a&gt; Healing Ward, which are great at healing multiple units but are lackluster at healing single targets. A strategy some players use is to bring Peons along with their army for the sole purpose of soaking up Spirit Link damage and increasing the army's staying power.\nThey are also capable of area-wide dispelling once they have Adept training, allowing them to quickly dispel buffs/debuffs and enemy summoned units whereas Shamans can only Purge one unit at a time.\nOnce Master training is unlocked, the Spirit Walker can revive fallen &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; with all of their health using Ancestral Spirit. Any Orc player running Tauren should run several Spirit Walkers. Spirit Walkers can also revive each other, although freshly-revived Spirit Walkers will not have enough mana to cast Ancestral Spirit.\nIn addition to these spells, Spirit Walkers can change to and from their corporeal and ethereal forms. In their corporeal form, they can attack enemy units but can be physically harmed. In their ethereal forms, the Spirit Walker cannot be physically damaged, and thus can only be damaged via magic damage and spells, though as a result of this, they take more damage from such sources. Since many players tend to use aerial units, it's recommended to keep the walkers in ethereal form to prevent them from being quickly targeted and killed. Spirit Walkers always arrive in ethereal form. However, the Spirit Walker has high damage and health for a spellcaster, making them serviceable ranged attackers in corporeal form. While Wind Riders and Berserkers make better dedicated ranged units, Spirit Walkers offer role compression by combining utility and damage output. They are also the Orcs' only real source of Magic attacks as Shamans and Witch Doctors are comparatively weak in combat.\nCounters.\nUsing magic units like Gryphon Riders, Chimaeras and Frost Wyrms can easily dispose of the Spirit Walkers in their ethereal form. Spells may also be used but those are more effective against enemy Heroes.\nSpells and abilities.\nSpiit Link.\nUse this to even out the damage among troops.\nDamage sustained over Spirit link is never fatal. Fatal damage sustained via Spirit Link reduces a unit to 1 hit point, and dispels Spirit Link.\nKill the Spirit Walkers.\nUse dispel spells. \nisenchant.\nThis ability removes both positive and negative buffs from units. \nAnestral Spirit.\nNotes: Tauren-caster, like a Spirit Walker, is revived with additional 25% of its mana restored. \nThis is an incredibly powerful ability which allows you to return dead Tauren to life! If you use Tauren, this is a must have ability.\nKill the Spirit Walker or remove their mana.\nRemove the corpses using a corpse destroying ability. \nEthereal orm.\nUse this ability if you want to make it more difficult for the enemy to kill the Spirit Walker. The enemy can't hurt them unless they have units with magic attacks or with magic spells. Sometimes the enemy doesn't have these types of attacks so your Spirit Walkers will be invincible. The Spirit Walker can't attack while in this form.\nSpirit Walkers start in Ethereal form. When Spirit Walkers leave Ethereal Mode, they cannot become Ethereal again for 30 seconds.\nSpirit Walkers in Ethereal Form take 66% bonus damage from magic and spell damage.\nUse units with magic attacks or use a spell to kill the Spirit Walker."}

His spiritual nature strengthens his mind in ways that most warriors ignore. Insight grants him speed and accuracy, and he can call upon native spirits to lend him aid. He is a contemplative warrior, likely to meditate through the dawn before silently lifting his sword or totem and walking calmly into battle.\nSpirit champions rely on the spirits to protect them, through insight and wisdom as well as direct intervention. To wear heavy armor is to insult them. They focus on the mind, and with their focus they can transcend physical limitations. The spirits protect the spirit champion, providing him with instinctual insights to avoid blows. He swings his weapon up and steps to the side, not really knowing why, and an instant later he parries a blow from an unseen source. Ancestral spirits whisper in the spirit champion\u2019s mind. Since the spirit champion is a being of combat, many of these ancestors are mighty warriors, perhaps spirit champions in their day. They speak of maneuvers and tactics, of feints and cleaving blows, and their whispers bypass the normal means of understanding and bleed into the spirit champion\u2019s subconscious mind.\nSpirit champions meditate, especially before battle. They prefer quiet places of natural beauty, such as mountaintops and forest glades, but they can meditate anywhere as long as they are undisturbed. They use this time to renew their bonds with the spirits and focus themselves on the tasks that lie ahead. The spirit champion\u2019s mind is at peace and is difficult to disturb. A skilled spirit champion can request certain spirits to enter his weapon and lend their fury to his strikes. The experienced spirit champions can contact the spirits and ask a question of them. The spirits usually answer, but often do so in cryptic ways meant to improve the spirit champion or reveal to him something about himself.\nA highly skilled spirit champion has such an understanding of the spirits, and has established such a strong relationship with them, that he has both the ability and the permission to join them to a small degree. The spirit champion can turn himself and everything he carries incorporeal. He remains incorporeal until he chooses to end this effect or an amount of time that depends on the spirit champion's skill.\nSpirit champions in the world.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' rediscovery of their spiritual heritage, their mindsets have changed. Shaman appear and commune with spirits and with their ancestors. The orcs' relationship with the tauren further broadens and strengthens their new faith, and with it comes new psychology. No longer are orcs bloodthirsty crazies; they are an ancient and noble people, bound by honor and ties to their allies. This societal revolution sweeps up all orcs in its flow. Some orcs combine this new understanding with their warlike natures and become spirit champions.\nMany &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; also take up the mantle of the spirit champion. Indeed, the tauren legacy of spirit champions extends back millennia. It was they who helped the orcs discover this path. Most tauren spirit champions call themselves followers of the totem. Orcs and tauren sometimes teach the secrets of the spirit champions to their allies, but the &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; is rare among other races. A few &lt;a href=\"half-orc\"&gt;half-orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"half-ogre\"&gt;half-ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s become spirit champions. &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s favor their own dark faiths and care not for the spirits. Spirit champions in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; are unknown. Most spirit champions are orcs or tauren. All current spirit champions are members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance has different values, and even spirit champions who might break with the Horde do not defect to the Alliance.\nSpeculation.\nSpirit champions bear a great deal of similarity with the &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s of Thrall's &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; - both are warriors who tap into the shamanistic powers of the elements. As such it is highly likely that these blademasters are a peculiarly &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish form of spirit champion."}

The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; in particular utilize spirit guidance, both in their everyday lives and in times of upheaval. Members of a shamanistic tribe can learn to call on the power of their ancestors and nature to grant them strength and knowledge. Several abilities known as Speaker of the Fang, Speaker of the Hoof, Speaker of the Seed, Speaker of the Sky and Speaker of the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt; reflect this ability. Some powerful &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; learn to communicate directly with ancestral spirits, but most are born with the touch. These individuals channel tribal spirits frequently and sometimes unwillingly. They struggle to interpret the words of the ancients and serve as a bridge between the dead and the living. Shaman who communicate with ancestral spirits often become &lt;a href=\"spirit%20walker\"&gt;spirit walker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nVision quests.\nThe vision quest represents a tribe member\u2019s passage from one stage to another, such as from youth to maturity or from maiden to mother. Shaman typically undergo several vision quests throughout their careers, each one unlocking hidden knowledge within their souls. To venture on a vision quest, the seeker leaves her tribe behind and finds a natural area that feels quiet and sacred to her. The seeker leaves all trappings of civilization behind, including weapons and clothes, taking only a waterskin with her. The tribe\u2019s shaman provides the vision speaker with a bundle of herbs to eat in the sacred area. These herbs facilitate the vision quest. Only a trained shaman may set a seeker on her vision quest. A vision quest lasts two to four days. Traditionally, the quest begins with a powerful urge to leave the sacred area. The seeker must resist this temptation and remain in the place she chose. Most seekers remind themselves of the sacred task they perform and soothe themselves with knowledge that they can survive a few days alone. Once the urge to leave passes, the seeker feels a sense of buoyancy. She seems to float out of her body and see the land spread out beneath her. She examines her body and, in doing so, comes to understand her soul. Each physical feature reminds the vision seeker of past experiences, her ancestors or her race. She meditates on these things until she feels at peace with herself.\nAt the apex of the vision quest, a spirit animal comes to the seeker. The animal represents the seeker\u2019s spirit; fierce warriors may see a bear, while timid herbalists may see a rabbit. The seeker feels an instant bond with the animal. In rare cases, the spirit animal may lead the seeker away from the sacred area to a place of great power. This sometimes happens to seekers who later become shaman. In the place of power, the seeker undergoes an additional test, such as a test of combat against a wild animal or a test of skill where she must heal a wounded creature or retrieve an object from a dangerous natural location. Upon completing her vision quest, a seeker usually takes some small item from the sacred area, such as a rock or a bit of animal fur, and keeps it as a reminder of her quest. A seeker who fails to complete her test may try again when she and her shaman feel ready."}

Avatars of Vengeance can also summon Spirits of Vengeance from corpses. In some ways, Spirits of Vengeance are like lesser versions of Avatars of Vengeance \u2014 they are composed utterly of revenge. Unlike avatars, a Spirit of Vengeance contains bits of humanoid soul mingled with the vengeance energy. The Avatar of Vengeance that created the spirit has full control over it. Spirits of Vengeance do not speak, but they do utter animalistic growls.\nSpirits of Vengeance possess little of the cunning of the avatar that created them. When uncontrolled, they move toward living creatures and hack them apart. Some spirits target specific creatures particularly deserving of vengeful judgment, ignoring innocents. A Spirit of Vengeance's weapon is a shadowy extension of itself. Their weapons can take many forms; most resemble either the weapon of the avatar that created them or the weapons of the living creatures from which they were summoned.\nGreater spirit of vengeance.\nA greater spirit of vengeance is the embodiment of revenge. The creature has a vaguely humanoid form composed mostly of black wispy smoke. Its eyes glow bright red. In one hand, it carries a spectral whip that glows red with the same energy that burns in its eyes. When a powerful creature takes to the grave with intense feelings of hatred and business unfinished, she will occasionally rise again as a greater spirit of vengeance. A greater spirit of vengeance seeks to slay all living creatures in an effort somehow to bring peace to itself. It bears no feelings of guilt or remorse or pity. It takes its task seriously, treating all beings with equal disregard and sparing none that get in its way. A greater spirit of vengeance attacks with a long barbed incorporeal whip that drains the life from its victims. It makes full use of its incorporeal nature, moving through walls, ceilings, and floors as it attacks. It takes every opportunity to use its create spawn ability. \"This may be a full avatar of vengeance.\"\nLesser spirit of vengeance.\nA lesser spirit of vengeance is the embodiment of the minor feelings of regret and unfinished tasks that so often plague humanoid creatures upon death. The creature appears to be a translucent female night elf dressed in plain clothes and wielding a glowing red shortbow. It does not have the single-minded sense of purpose of a greater spirit of vengeance, however. Unless controlled by a greater spirit of vengeance, a lesser spirit of vengeance wanders aimlessly. It is as likely to attack a creature as it is to pass it by without looking back. A lesser spirit of vengeance will, of course, defend itself when attacked. A lesser spirit of vengeance attacks using a spectral shortbow that fires chilling incorporeal arrows. The arrows are formed from its own essence, and it can make an endless number of such ranged attacks. The arrows dissipate on impact whether they hit or not. A lesser spirit of vengeance does not engage in melee. It attempts to flee when threatened to find a better position from which to fire.

The heroes fought the intelligence of the object and returned it to Azore. He then asked them to accompany him to Dire Maul to show the object the truth about its former master.

It is a beautiful coastal area cloaked in eternal autumn. The trees and other flora are tinged in brilliant oranges and reds, and nearer the coast, great cliffs and sandy beaches line the ocean. The region's hostile inhabitants, which include enraged ghosts, vicious satyr, stalking naga and ferocious wildlife, have been mostly quelled by the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblins&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20storyline\"&gt;Azshara storyline&lt;/a&gt;, the goblins defeat the &lt;a href=\"Spitelash\"&gt;Spitelash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and the encroaching &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; forces seeking to stop the goblins exploitation of nature.

This transformed Huln and his people's horns into the Horns of Eche'ro: their moose-like antlers. Huln went on to battle &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, who was leading the Legion's forces in Azshara.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mennar%20Academy\"&gt;Mennar Academy&lt;/a&gt; used a &lt;a href=\"Sarcen%20Stone\"&gt;Sarcen Stone&lt;/a&gt; to draw arcane energy away from the Legion's portal at the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, buying time for the rest of the world to fight back. This act cost them their lives when the demons came down on them, and history would not record these unsung heroes.\nThird War.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; launched their invasion on Kalimdor during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the demons arrived to Azshara and continued to Ashenvale.\nRight after the Third War, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; passed through the area, assaulting the local night elven villages and wreaking havoc among the forest creatures, including the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt;. Local &lt;a href=\"mur%27gul\"&gt;mur'gul&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s also assisted Illidan. &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; followed Illidan's trail through the area, putting the creatures out of their misery. Illidan's goal was to wreck the night elven harbors on the coast so no one could follow him to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, neither the Horde or Alliance sought to use Azshara for much despite it's proximity to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde scout, &lt;a href=\"Ag%27tor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Ag'tor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt;, helped Horde adventurers down the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Magus%20Rimtori\"&gt;Magus Rimtori&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Betrayed\"&gt;Betrayed&lt;/a&gt; quest line.

Lastly, the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loramus%20Thalipedes\"&gt;Loramus Thalipedes&lt;/a&gt; aided adventurers in battling the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Razelikh%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Razelikh the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; by forging &lt;a href=\"Azsharite\"&gt;Azsharite&lt;/a&gt; weapons.\nThe area was home to rare &lt;a href=\"Enchanted%20Coral%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Enchanted Coral (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, which the &lt;a href=\"Spitelash\"&gt;Spitelash&lt;/a&gt; were drawn to.\n&lt;a href=\"Elemental\"&gt;Elemental&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Invasions%20%28Classic%29%E2%80%8E\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; the area only to be fought by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Azshara was invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe area was also &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; twice by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the years leading to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nPearl of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; and her uncle &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; fought against &lt;a href=\"Zhahara%20Darksquall\"&gt;Zhahara Darksquall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt; on an isle in Azshara.\nCataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; radically changed the balance of power in Azshara. The &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblins, the Horde's newest ally, have made their home here, building a city into the cliff side, and destroying the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20Crater\"&gt;Azshara Crater&lt;/a&gt; to make way for a large &lt;a href=\"Mountainfoot%20Strip%20Mine\"&gt;quarry&lt;/a&gt;. To show their loyalty to the Horde, the goblins have reshaped Azshara into a giant Horde symbol.\nHaving recently gained the mantle of warchief, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; is preparing for war to claim all of Kalimdor for the Horde. The goblins of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, headquartered in &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, are playing their part by building war machines, constructing weapons, and establishing a massive naval harbor within sight of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the night elves aren't content to sit idly by; they fully intend to challenge this unwelcome occupation in Azshara and hopefully stymie a conflict that would otherwise be carried deep into their forests. Amid all this tension, the Bilgewater Cartel is also out to make a name for itself in true goblin fashion. What is the best way to show solidarity? Reshape the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Bay of Storms&lt;/a&gt; into a giant Horde symbol! From there, a secret lab, an extensive rocketway, and a \"pleasure palace\" with its own golf course are just natural leaps in goblin logic. Azshara is now the largest terraforming project on Azeroth - whether it's sculpting the terrain to promote Horde propaganda, moving an entire mountain to pillage the minerals underneath, or slapping the face of the trade prince on a nearby crag, there's no question who wears the pants in Azshara these days.\n&lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; is rounding up all of the blue dragonflight, as he fears the death of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; will be a sign of weakness and Deathwing will send out agents to assassinate the remaining dragons within the flight. This holds true as the black dragonflight has invaded Azshara to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;. Kalec and Azuregos help low level Horde players to repel the invasion.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; targeted Azshara as one of their &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;invasion points&lt;/a&gt;, especially targeting the rear gates of Orgrimmar. It was successfully defended by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nAzshara is located in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. It contains the &lt;a href=\"rocketway\"&gt;rocketway&lt;/a&gt;, a free five station elevated transport which runs round the bay. Rocketway stations are:\nThere are no instances or battlegrounds in this zone.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D10\"&gt;Topographic map of Azshara&lt;/a&gt;\nTravel hubs.\nIn addition to the below flight paths, there is a &lt;a href=\"Rocketway\"&gt;Rocketway&lt;/a&gt; present in the zone that will transport you to another station for free.\nNotable characters.\nAzshara is home to several characters of note. &lt;a href=\"Kalec\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt; relocated to Azshara, fearing that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; would send agents to assassinate the rest of the flight. This held true, as the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; invaded Azshara to hunt down &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;. Kalec can be found in &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, where he and Azuregos &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20storyline%23Azuregos%20quest%20chain\"&gt;help low-level Horde players to repel the invasion&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Arcane Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, 's apprentices try to pass his trials. assists experienced hunters and priests.\nQuests.\nWhen first arriving in Azshara, you may want to take the &lt;a href=\"Rocketway\"&gt;Rocketway&lt;/a&gt; and tour the zone first. In addition to earning the &lt;a href=\"Joy%20Ride\"&gt;Joy Ride&lt;/a&gt; achievement along the way, you will gain a good chunk of free discovery experience, be able to pick up the &lt;a href=\"flight%20path\"&gt;flight path&lt;/a&gt;s and get to see some magnificent scenery. Of course, goblin technology has been known to break down from time to time...\nDig sites.\nAzshara has two &lt;a href=\"dig%20site\"&gt;dig site&lt;/a&gt;s:\nIn the RPG.\nHistory.\nA shattered stretch of coastline on Kalimdor's northeast, Azshara was once the greatest night elf &lt;a href=\"City\"&gt;metropolis&lt;/a&gt;. The city fell millennia ago in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, but a few ragged buildings perch on the cliffs overlooking similar ruins among the coral. Much of the city of Azshara fell into the ocean.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, this shattered stretch of coast along &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s northern border was once a part of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;; then came the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' expulsion from the world. The land was rent asunder and the sea thundered in, making the region a watery grave and leaving nothing but ruins of the once great city. The night elves who survived named this region \u2014 once glorious, now nothing but a shattered relic \u2014 Azshara, after their queen who was driven mad by demonic influence. Since that time, this place of rocky islands, jagged cliffs, and coral-choked seas has given birth to many tales.\nSome night elves suggest that not all of the demons were banished, still lurking beneath the glittering waters of the Coral Sea and waiting to strike back. Others claim that Queen Azshara was not drowned, but transformed into a hideous aquatic thing who will someday lead her accursed followers to retake the surface world. A few whisper that the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; that first brought the demons to Azeroth remains and rests under the sea waiting for someone to reopen it. Still others assert that the ancient Sundering awakened something that dwelled in the deepest part of the ocean, something that will eventually burst forth in a tidal wave of destruction. Whatever the truth, night elves agree that the region is cursed.\nGeography.\nA river separates the primordial wood from what land there is. The terrain beyond the river is little more than a strip of green above fragmented cliffs that rise high over a stretch of ivory beach. The waves of the shallow Coral Sea sweep against this beach, and islands \u2014 little more than spires of jagged rock \u2014 jut from the water. A twisted expanse of reef creates a labyrinth of coral beneath the ocean surface, making sea travel here virtually impossible.\nThe night elves consider the place cursed, and most other races find the constant storms unpleasant. There is but a single habitation in Azshara, the orc trading village of Grim Ulang, its residents telling of creatures flitting about the ruins of Zin-Azshari further along the cliffs, and murlocs and naga swimming in the Coral Sea. Bands of undead have appeared along the beach and at the fringes of the Ashenvale Forest. As well, the dark chants of demon cultists have echoed along the cliffs in counterpoint to the thunder of storms. Steady rumors and sightings have led to frequent night elf patrols and an increased martial presence in Grim Ulang.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Azshara, the night elves' beautiful and gifted queen, built an immense, wondrous palace on the Well of Eternity's shore that housed her favored servitors within its bejeweled halls.\nThe palace was located in the capital of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, and was built on the very shore of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; itself, the source of power and efficacy for the Kaldorei race. The palace served as the residence for both the queen and her closest followers - the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; - who collectively presided over and ruled the empire. During the later years of the empire, just before and during the infamous &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the palace became home to a large host of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;demonic invaders&lt;/a&gt; as powerful spell-work was conducted within its walls to summon the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and his legion to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. At the war's violent conclusion, the palace, the city, and the entire continent, were torn apart by the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, with the palace itself sinking beneath the waves. \nDescription.\nThe palace rested on a cliff overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. When first the vast, walled edifice had been constructed, using magic that melded both stone and forest into a single, cohesive form, it had been a wonder to touch the heart of any who saw it. Its towers were trees strengthened by rock, with jutting spires and high, open windows. The walls were volcanic stone raised up, then bound tightly by draping vines and giant roots. The main palace at the center had originally by the mystical binding of more than a hundred giant, ancient trees. Bent in together, they had formed the skeleton of the rounded center, over which the stone and vines had been set.\nIn the highest tower, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and the other Highborne studied the powers of the Well of Eternity. That tower was destroyed by Malfurion, temporarily closing the Burning Legion's portal.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAzshara's Palace features prominently in the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; instance. The &lt;a href=\"Courtyard%20of%20Lights\"&gt;Courtyard of Lights&lt;/a&gt; surrounds it. Its design somewhat resembles the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. A glass walkway goes around it towards a platform where &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and the highborne who are casting the spell to summon Sargeras, can be fought.

It is a beautiful coastal area cloaked in eternal autumn. The trees and other flora are tinged in brilliant oranges and reds, and nearer the coast, great cliffs and sandy beaches line the ocean. The region's inhabitants can make life hard for the nature lover, however. Enraged ghosts, vicious satyr, stalking naga and ferocious wildlife can quickly put an end to those who venture too far from the road.\nA shattered stretch of coastline on Kalimdor's northeast, Azshara was once the greatest night elf &lt;a href=\"City\"&gt;metropolis&lt;/a&gt;. The city fell millennia ago in the War of the Ancients, but a few ragged buildings perch on the cliffs overlooking similar ruins among the coral. Much of the city of Azshara fell into the ocean. The Horde has established a small outpost, &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Ulang\"&gt;Grim Ulang&lt;/a&gt;, in the area, but naga are a constant danger.\nHistory.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, this shattered stretch of coast along &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s northern border was once a part of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elven\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;; then came the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' expulsion from the world. The land was rent asunder and the sea thundered in, making the region into a watery grave and leaving nought but ruins of the once great city. The night elves who survived named this region \u2014 once glorious, now nothing but a shattered relic \u2014 Azshara, after their queen who was driven mad by demonic influence. Since that time, this place of rocky islands, jagged cliffs, and coral-choked seas has given birth to many tales.\nSome night elves suggest that not all of the demons were banished, lurking even now beneath the glittering waters of the Coral Sea and awaiting the time to strike back. Others claim that Queen Azshara was not drowned, but transformed into a hideous aquatic thing who will someday lead her accursed followers to retake the surface world. A few whisper that the Dark Portal that first brought the demons to Azeroth yet remains and rests under the sea waiting for someone to reopen it. Still others assert that the ancient Sundering awakened something that dwelled in the deepest part of the ocean, something that will eventually burst forth in a tidal wave of destruction. Whatever the truth, night elves agree that the region is cursed.\nGeography.\nA river separates the primordial wood from what land there is. The terrain beyond the river is little more than a strip of green above fragmented cliffs that rise high over a stretch of ivory beach. The waves of the shallow Coral Sea sweep against this beach, and islands \u2014 little more than spires of jagged rock \u2014 jut from the water. A twisted expanse of reef creates a labyrinth of coral beneath the ocean surface, making sea travel here virtually impossible.\nThe night elves consider the place cursed, and most other races find the constant storms unpleasant. There is but a single known habitation in Azshara, the orc trading village of Grim Ulang, its residents telling of creatures flitting about the ruins of Zin-Azshari further along the cliffs and murlocs and naga swimming in the Coral Sea. Bands of undead have appeared along the beach and at the fringes of the Ashenvale Forest. As well, the dark chants of demon cultists have echoed along the cliffs in counterpoint to the thunder of storms. Steady rumors and sightings have led to frequent night elf patrols and an increased martial presence in Grim Ulang.\nThere are no instances in this zone, though the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Mennar\"&gt;Lake Mennar&lt;/a&gt; can be found here. In addition, the battleground &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20Crater\"&gt;Azshara Crater&lt;/a&gt; will be located in this zone if/when it is implemented.\nNotable characters.\nAzshara is home to several characters of note. At the Azshara Tower, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Xylem\"&gt;Archmage Xylem&lt;/a&gt; aids mages and rogues in achieving their full potential. &lt;a href=\"Magus%20Rimtori\"&gt;Magus Rimtori&lt;/a&gt;'s Thalassian expedition ravishes the region in search of Highborne relics. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arkkoroc\"&gt;Lord Arkkoroc&lt;/a&gt; reigns from his watery temple. &lt;a href=\"Loramus%20Thalipedes\"&gt;Loramus Thalipedes&lt;/a&gt;, the demon hunter, watches the horizon from his island refuge. &lt;a href=\"Ogtinc\"&gt;Ogtinc&lt;/a&gt; assists experienced hunters and priests, and on another small island far to the east, &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt; pits heroes of all calibers against their elemental foes, sending them deep into the very core of the earth in search of retribution. Lastly, the &lt;a href=\"Jubie%20Gadgetspring\"&gt;Gadgetsprings&lt;/a&gt; provide their services to &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineers&lt;/a&gt; by selling the very rare &lt;a href=\"Deepdive%20Helmet\"&gt;Deepdive Helmet&lt;/a&gt; , among other things."}

These caves (along with the entire ridge) were removed in \"\", though the terrain for the battleground itself still exists in the game files.\nDevelopment.\nMention of Azshara Crater happened as early as &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.3.0%23World%20Environment\"&gt;patch 1.3.0&lt;/a&gt; (released March 7, 2005), but it never appeared in a playable state. A few official mentions occurred in early and late 2007, but there were no updates after this.\nAt &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202007\"&gt;BlizzCon 2007&lt;/a&gt;, it was stated during a Q&amp;A session that they had not decided if the Azshara Crater battlefield would be added; the developers felt that balancing Alterac Valley was a higher priority. In later interviews, &lt;a href=\"Jeff%20Kaplan\"&gt;Jeff Kaplan&lt;/a&gt; confirmed that Azshara Crater would not be included in the \"\" expansion, although Blizzard acknowledged that they might return to work on further developing the battleground. The future of Azshara Crater looked even grimmer at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202009\"&gt;BlizzCon 2009&lt;/a&gt;, when it was revealed that in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s had &lt;a href=\"Mountainfoot%20Strip%20Mine\"&gt;strip mined&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Ridge\"&gt;Forlorn Ridge&lt;/a&gt; into oblivion.\nAt &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202011\"&gt;BlizzCon 2011&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard stated that Azshara Crater was one of three battlegrounds under consideration for the \"\" expansion pack, with a DOTA-style gameplay. In the press tour the following March, they said out of the three potential battlegrounds they ended up picking two, with Azshara Crater being the one left out."}

In &lt;a href=\"Defend%20the%20Gates%21\"&gt;Defend the Gates!&lt;/a&gt; the Night Elves launch a full-out attack against the gate and are thwarted by players with Goblin &lt;a href=\"Shredder\"&gt;Shredder&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Arborcide\"&gt;Arborcide&lt;/a&gt;, to the Rocketway Exchange in &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20Horzak\"&gt;Report to Horzak&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrgrimmar Rocketway Exchange.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Rocketway%20Exchange\"&gt;Orgrimmar Rocketway Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, players continue their work collecting resources for the Horde as they are sent into the &lt;a href=\"Mountainfoot%20Strip%20Mine\"&gt;Mountainfoot Strip Mine&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Horzak%20Zignibble\"&gt;Horzak Zignibble&lt;/a&gt; to deal with &lt;a href=\"Basilisk\"&gt;Basilisk&lt;/a&gt;s released into the mine by the Night Elves. After clearing out the basilisks, players are faced with another threat as they are recruited into the Bilgewater Battalion under &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Molotov\"&gt;Commander Molotov&lt;/a&gt; in the quest &lt;a href=\"Another%20Warm%20Body\"&gt;Another Warm Body&lt;/a&gt;. Molotov is defending against &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; incursions from the sea and together with players the Naga are repelled. There is one final quest chain starting with &lt;a href=\"Survey%20the%20Lakeshore\"&gt;Survey the Lakeshore&lt;/a&gt; which has players visiting Lake Mennar and finding out about its history as Custer Clubnick and Malynea Skyreaver fight over what to do with it - Clubnick wants to pave it over while Malynea wants to study it. This quest line culminates in Custer's bulldozer becoming haunted in &lt;a href=\"Dozercism\"&gt;Dozercism&lt;/a&gt; and players being sent to the Southern Rocketway Terminus for help.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Dozercism\"&gt;Dozercism&lt;/a&gt;, to the Southern Rocketway Terminus in &lt;a href=\"Need%20More%20Science\"&gt;Need More Science&lt;/a&gt;.\nSouthern Rocketway Terminus.\n&lt;a href=\"Assistant%20Greely\"&gt;Assistant Greely&lt;/a&gt;, who Goblin players met in the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;, is having a minor crisis at the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Rocketway%20Terminus\"&gt;Southern Rocketway Terminus&lt;/a&gt; and cannot spare any time for Custer's dozer. The &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Lab\"&gt;Secret Lab&lt;/a&gt; where she and &lt;a href=\"Hobart%20Grapplehammer\"&gt;Hobart Grapplehammer&lt;/a&gt; were working has had an accident and fires are breaking out everywhere. She sends players to the lab to fix some of the problems before getting them to bring back the extremely valuable Azsharite core. Once players return, Greely explains that Azsharite is a very valuable substance that comes in limited quantities. It is later revealed by the Stone Giant &lt;a href=\"Gormungan\"&gt;Gormungan&lt;/a&gt; that Azsharite is in fact Giant droppings and Greely attempts several methods of \"acquiring\" these droppings. Finally in &lt;a href=\"A%20Hello%20to%20Arms\"&gt;A Hello to Arms&lt;/a&gt;, Greely sends the player into &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the Azsharite core for further study. Also at the Southern Rocketway Terminus is a quest chain starting with &lt;a href=\"Mortar%20the%20Point\"&gt;Mortar the Point&lt;/a&gt; where players help &lt;a href=\"Torg%20Twocrush\"&gt;Torg Twocrush&lt;/a&gt; route the Naga attacking the area.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Azsharite%20Experiment%20Number%20Two\"&gt;Azsharite Experiment Number Two&lt;/a&gt;, to the Bilgewater Harbor in &lt;a href=\"A%20Hello%20to%20Arms\"&gt;A Hello to Arms&lt;/a&gt;.\nBilgewater Harbor.\nAt this point, the questing experience branches:\nAzuregos quest chain.\nThe Azuregos quest chain is a long chain started by the Blue &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; who is searching for another Blue Dragon &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt; in the area. He sends players out to search for him which leads to the &lt;a href=\"Murloc\"&gt;Murloc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ergll\"&gt;Ergll&lt;/a&gt;, then to the Northern Rocketway Exchange and then further. Eventually players are mixed up with the apprentices of &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Xylem\"&gt;Archmage Xylem&lt;/a&gt;, becoming apprentices themselves and passing the three trials before finding Azuregos in Archmage Xylem's tower in &lt;a href=\"Wasn%27t%20It%20Obvious%3F\"&gt;Wasn't It Obvious?&lt;/a&gt;. After this, Azuregos, Kalecgos and players work together to take down some &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragon\"&gt;Black Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Malicion\"&gt;Malicion&lt;/a&gt; before the quest chain ends.\nNorthern Rocketway Exchange.\nAfter arriving to the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Rocketway%20Exchange\"&gt;Northern Rocketway Exchange&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Wash%20Out\"&gt;Wash Out&lt;/a&gt;, two side chains are available. The first is started by &lt;a href=\"Andorel%20Sunsworn\"&gt;Andorel Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; and it features players clearing out a nearby Night Elven encampment. The second is started by &lt;a href=\"Haggrum%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Haggrum Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt;, who has players sabotage negotiations between the Alliance and the &lt;a href=\"Blackmaw%20tribe\"&gt;Blackmaw furbolgs&lt;/a&gt;.\nAndorel Sunsworn quest chain:\nHaggrum Bloodfist quest chain:\nThe Shattered Strand.\nThe Shattered Strand quest chain has players returning to the Shattered Strand where they first battled the Naga to resume the fight with vigor. Players battle the Naga before uniting with the &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; for an assault on the Naga base in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;. After dealing some damage, players are sent back in to steal the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Arkkoroc\"&gt;Heart of Arkkoroc&lt;/a&gt;, an item which the Naga are using to brainwash the local sea giants.\nValormok.\nAfter reaching level 20, players are flown to &lt;a href=\"Valormok\"&gt;Valormok&lt;/a&gt; where the Horde is preparing a final assault against the Night Elven forces in Azshara. Players slay the Night Elven defenders, assassinate the commander in charge of the Alliance forces and then bomb the command center, destroying the Night Elven foothold in the region. With the conquest of Azshara complete and the Horde victorious, players are sent to continue the offensive on the front lines in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;."}

The &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; maintain a presence here. Azsuna was not destroyed in the Great Sundering, but was actually devastated several years before that by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself.\nThis is where one of the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;, was contested by the &lt;a href=\"hero\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;es of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the minions of Azshara.\nHistory.\nAzsuna was originally populated by more than ten thousand elves.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s pact with the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; went mostly uncontested by her subjects. One of the few that dared to defy her was &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Farondis\"&gt;Prince Farondis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs one of the queen's trusted advisors, Farondis was in regular contact with the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, but his palace in Azsuna was several leagues away from the elven capital. As such, he was able to witness Sargeras' influence on the Highborne court without falling sway to the Legion lord's temptation.\nFarondis' plan was bold, but simple: destroy the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in Zin-Azshari. Doing so would close the portal to Sargeras' realm and stem the tide of evil before it even started. In order to accomplish this task, he would use the power of an artifact stored deep within &lt;a href=\"Nar%27thalas%20Academy\"&gt;Nar'thalas Academy&lt;/a&gt;: the &lt;a href=\"Tidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt;. \nUnfortunately, the queen's influence in Farondis' palace was already deep-seated. &lt;a href=\"Vandros\"&gt;Vandros&lt;/a&gt;, a young noble in Farondis' court, caught word of Farondis' plans to defy the Queen, and reported the insurrection to Queen Azshara herself.\nAzshara wasted no time in punishing Farondis and his people. In a frightening display of arcane power, she destroyed the Tidestone of Golganneth, and in doing so, released a wave of dark energy over all of Azsuna and its inhabitants.\nSince that day, the elves of Azsuna have been unable to experience the release of death, and their spirits wander the land indefinitely.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; sent their troops in the region after discovering a small &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; force in the east, and hearing rumors that they report directly to &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were lead by &lt;a href=\"Pitlord%20Argamemm\"&gt;Pitlord Argamemm&lt;/a&gt; who was killed by the paladins.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

After the adventurer and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt; recover the heart, their garrison is invaded by Burning Blade forces, and Bladefury soon enters the fray.

It represents the promise that &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and his flight made to the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; to shepherd the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Like the other oathstones, it is believed to have gone dormant when &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed their powers to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; awakened, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; attempted to reclaim both the Azure Archives and the oathstone. He found the arcane in the area was rampant, forced to first subdue the magic in the area before he could address the stone. After this was done, Kalecgos attempted to reactivate the stone, though it failed, only summoning the simulacrum of &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; to aid him. Realizing that his flight needed to be reunited, Kalecgos sent out a call to all blue dragons through the oathstone.. He found that the leylines needed to be repaired, Kalecgos and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; tried to stop the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; from destroying the tower of &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt;, which is where the leylines converged. After defending the tower, &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; herself descended to defeat the duo; though she was forced to retreat due to the timely arrival of &lt;a href=\"Senegos\"&gt;Senegos&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Azurewing\"&gt;Azurewing&lt;/a&gt; brood. With at least part of the dragonflight restored and the blues upholding their charge as a family once more, the oathstone was restored.\nKalecgos continued to use the oathstone to call for more dragons, eventually summoning a number of dragons, among them &lt;a href=\"Awbee\"&gt;Awbee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Narygos\"&gt;Narygos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andorgos\"&gt;Andorgos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Intinosa\"&gt;Professor Intinosa&lt;/a&gt;. Noting several prominent missing dragons, Kalecgos teamed up with an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to reunite the last elements of his flight. Using the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Locator\"&gt;Dragon Locator&lt;/a&gt;, he tracked down &lt;a href=\"Haleh\"&gt;Haleh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zeros\"&gt;Zeros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Surigosa\"&gt;Surigosa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azuregos\"&gt;Azuregos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lanigosa\"&gt;Lanigosa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kirygosa\"&gt;Kirygosa&lt;/a&gt;; sending an adventurer to aid him and Sindragosa's simulacrum in getting them to return home."}

It may also reduce casting time for the player's &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s (such as for the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Imp%20%28warlock%20minion%29\"&gt;Imp&lt;/a&gt;). \nSpell haste can be found on the &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt; under the Spell heading. It is separate to melee and ranged haste. Spell haste can be acquired from a number of sources; gear, passive bonuses, talent procs, active abilities, buffs and items.\nFor a more detailed exploration of haste, its sources and effects, see &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nSpell haste directly reduces the time it take to cast spells. The &lt;a href=\"cast%20time\"&gt;cast time&lt;/a&gt; of all eligible abilities is reduced by the player's spell haste percentage, and this change is reflected in abilities' tooltips. 50% haste therefore allows a player to deal 50% more damage or healing in the same time, by casting spells at 150% of the speed (base 100% speed plus 50% haste). See section below for calculations.\nHaste works just as well for cast-time and channeled spells. In both cases players will see a reduction in their time spent casting/channeling the spell, resulting in a DPS/HPS boost. Haste scales at the same rate for channeled spells and spells with a standard cast time.\nBy reducing the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; (as well its effects on DoT and HoT effects, see section below) spell haste can be valuable for players who use instant abilities.\nSpell haste will only reduce the &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; down to a minimum of 1 second. This minimum can reduce the benefit of additional spell haste for casters, by partially preventing them from benefiting from the reduced cast times of their spells. However additional spell haste still has its advantages, reducing likelihood of &lt;a href=\"interrupt\"&gt;interrupt&lt;/a&gt;ion and benefiting the use of slower (and often more efficient) spells. It also reduces the amount of time before the first cast takes effect, which is advantageous in the opening of duels, split-second make-or-break casts, and in situations calling for sporadic, but quick, healing.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20speed\"&gt;Attack speed&lt;/a&gt; is the melee and ranged equivalent of casting speed, but works very differently. Attack speed measures the time between attacks, while casting speed measure's spell &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;, with additional haste lowering attack speed but increasing casting speed. A high attack speed therefore means the player will attack very slowly, while a high casting speed means the player will cast very quickly.\nCasting speed calculation.\n Cast Time = Base Cast Time / ((Spell Haste Percentage / 100) + 1)\nNote that \"base cast time\" is after talents. For example, a warlock's &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;Shadow Bolt&lt;/a&gt; has a base cast time of 3.0 seconds. However, if the warlock has spent 3 points in &lt;a href=\"Bane\"&gt;Bane&lt;/a&gt;, Shadow Bolt's base cast time will be 2.5 seconds, and this is the number that should be used in any calculations.\nEssentially, 1% haste allows a player to cast 1 additional spell in the time it would normally take to cast 100 spells. If the spell is a 3 second cast, that means one can theoretically cast 101 spells in 300 seconds, or 2.97 seconds per spell.\nTo determine the amount of time taken to cast a given sequence of spells, the reverse formula can be used, where Base Casting Time is the sum of all the spells in the given sequence:\n Haste required = ((Base Cast Time / Desired Cast Time) - 1) * 100\nExample: I am a mage, and I want my &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; (2.5s), &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; (2.5s), &lt;a href=\"Scorch\"&gt;Scorch&lt;/a&gt; (1.5s) cast chain to take 5.5 seconds:\n 2.5 + 2.5 + 1.5 = 6.5\n ((6.5 / 5.5) - 1) * 100 = 18.18% haste required\nNote: &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard rounds to 4 significant digits.\nGlobal cooldown calculation.\nHaste reduces the global cooldown according to the general formula for spell haste. The base &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; for casters is 1.5 seconds.\n Global Cooldown = Base Global Cooldown / ((Spell Haste Percentage / 100) + 1)\nHowever, the minimum possible global cooldown is 1 second and haste will not reduce it below this. \nThe amount of haste required to reduce the global cooldown to a desired value can also be calculated exactly as for spells:\n Haste required = ((Base Global Cooldown / Desired Global Cooldown) - 1) * 100\nFor example: \n (( 1.5 / 1 ) - 1) * 100 = 50 = 50% haste\n50% is the amount of haste required to reduce the global cooldown to its 1-second minimum. \nSources.\nSpell haste can be obtained from a number of sources. Some haste comes from &lt;a href=\"haste%23Haste%20rating\"&gt;Haste rating&lt;/a&gt;, which increases all types of haste, while other sources specifically benefit spell haste without increasing other forms.\nHaste stacks in a multiplicative manner. Haste rating is considered a single source, and all haste rating is combined additively with itself before being multiplied with other sources. For example:\n &lt;a href=\"Borrowed%20Time\"&gt;Borrowed Time&lt;/a&gt; = 14% spell haste = 1.14\n &lt;a href=\"Power%20Infusion\"&gt;Power Infusion&lt;/a&gt; = 20% spell haste = 1.2\n 7% spell haste from haste rating = 1.07\n 1.07 * 1.14 * 1.2 = 1.46 = 46% spell haste\nHaste rating.\nHaste rating can be converted to haste using the appropriate conversion factor:\nFor example, for a level 85 priest, with 500 haste rating:\n 500 / 128.125 = 3.9% haste\nThe amount of haste rating required to attain a percentage of haste can therefore be calculated:\n Haste rating required = (Haste Percentage Required * Conversion Factor)\nWithout any other sources of spell haste, the following amounts of haste rating are therefore required to reduce the global cooldown to its 1-second minimum:\nHowever, in practice almost all casters will benefit from other sources of spell haste. These may be from passive bonuses (&lt;a href=\"Netherwind%20Presence\"&gt;Netherwind Presence&lt;/a&gt;), talent procs (&lt;a href=\"Borrowed%20Time\"&gt;Borrowed Time&lt;/a&gt;) or outside sources, such as party and raid members' buffs (&lt;a href=\"Shadowform\"&gt;Shadowform&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20Air%20Totem\"&gt;Wrath of Air Totem&lt;/a&gt;).\nDoTs / HoTs.\nSince Patch 4.0 all DoTs and HoTs can benefit from haste. The period of time the DoT / HoT is running remains relatively similar, but additional ticks are added if the haste is high enough. Because only whole ticks can be added, rounding is used to determine the number of ticks. This means that when haste has reduced a spell's duration to a 1/2 tick shorter than its original duration, an extra tick will be added. So it is sufficient to have haste for a half additional tick to get the whole tick.\nThe haste required to obtain a given number of additional ticks can be calculated as follows:\n Haste required = ( ( Base Number of Ticks + Number of Desired Additional Ticks - 0.5 ) / Base Number of Ticks ) - 1 ) * 100\nFor example: &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; ticks 4 times within the 12 seconds. One additional tick requires:\n ((4 + 1 - 0.5) / 4) - 1) * 100 = 12.5 = 12.5% Haste required\nBecause this is the necessary haste for 4.5 ticks (rounded up to 5 - so one tick additional to the 4 base ticks), two additional ticks will not require 25% haste but\n ((4 + 2 - 0.5) / 4) - 1) * 100 = 37.5 %\nEssentially, each additional tick after the first can be seen to require ((1 / Base Number of Ticks) * 100) % haste. The first additional tick always requires half this amount. For Rejuvenation:\n (1 / 4) = 25%\n First additional tick = 25 / 2 = 12.5%\n Second additional tick = 25% additional haste = 37.5% total\n Third additional tick = 25% additional haste = 62.5% total\n Fourth additional tick = 25% additional haste = 87.5% total\nMany periodic effects have a maximum tick rate of 1 tick per second. This limits spell haste's benefit to DoT and HoT effects at just under 200% haste. The exact cap can be found with (200 - ((1 / Base Number of Ticks) * 50)). For &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; (with a base number of 4 ticks):\n 200 - ((1 / 4) * 50) = 187.5% spell haste\nHistory.\nHaste Rating used to be split into \"Haste Rating\" (which only affected attack speed) and \"Spell Haste Rating\" (which only affected spell casting speed). The two were unified in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; into one universal Haste Rating stat. All gear which used to have Spell Haste Rating now has an equal amount of Haste Rating."}

These bastions against invasion were guarded by fortified battlements, making them virtually indestructible. The castle represented the strength of the peoples of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and their unyielding resolution to defend the whole of humanity against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Hordes&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; itself was represented in-game by a generic &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; building that was eventually upgraded into a castle by the human AI. Several unnamed castles also appeared during the campaigns of the game, for example in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20City\"&gt;Alterac City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nHuman castle.\nCastles represent the pinnacle of advanced &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; civilization.

This progression also allows the building of &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Aviary%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;gryphon aviaries&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; had a unique Castle built in &lt;a href=\"Tidefury%20Cove%23In%20Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Tidefury Cove&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by five &lt;a href=\"Castle%20Guard%20Tower\"&gt;Castle Guard Tower&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHigh elven and blood elven castle.\nThe Castle helped the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; to fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to attack their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in ' by serving as a returning point for gold and training units. However, the Castle couldn't be built by the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28high%20elf%29\"&gt;High elf worker&lt;/a&gt; unit likely due to the limited ability of the map editor prior to the ' expansion. With the addition of The Frozen Throne expansion's map editor, it is possible to make additional groups with building orders.\nThe castle also helped the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign in \"The Frozen Throne\". This castle produced unique blood elven-only units. Kael himself once used a &lt;a href=\"Tiny%20Castle\"&gt;Tiny Castle&lt;/a&gt; during his campaign.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDue to the fall of many kingdoms in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, not many castles are still left standing in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; was rebuilt after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; was built beneath the throne room and the royal crypts of the former &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%27s%20palace\"&gt;palace of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20palace\"&gt;palace in Alterac&lt;/a&gt; is still relatively intact, albeit occupied by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; palace of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; was also rebuilt. As seats of ruling, the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Palace\"&gt;Mogu'shan Palace&lt;/a&gt; could also probably be considered as mogu castles.\nA fully-upgraded &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; garrison is considered to be a castle.\nIn the RPG.\nA castle is a &lt;a href=\"keep\"&gt;keep&lt;/a&gt; usually surrounded by a 15-foot stone wall with four &lt;a href=\"tower\"&gt;tower&lt;/a&gt;s. Huge castles have a particularly large keep with numerous associated buildings (&lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;, and the like) and an elaborate 20-foot high wall creating a bailey and courtyard areas. The wall has six towers. Castle walls are usually ten feet thick.\n&lt;a href=\"Gaval%20Moch\"&gt;Gaval Moch&lt;/a&gt; is an example of an old and abandoned castle in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;."}

The damage caused to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; caused the Elemental Plane to collide with the physical realm, resulting in drastic geographical upheaval, causing chaotic &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to pour out into the world of Azeroth. Earthquakes, volcano eruptions and floods followed in his wake, killing thousands and reshaping the face of the world.\nIt is also the era in which the stories of \"\" took place and ended with the demise of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrecursor.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; and the uprising of the shamanistic &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, the world of Azeroth was threatened by the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe unrest also caused a ship carrying some &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; to take shelter near a patch of tiny islands as the seas heaved to and fro. After the initial elemental unrest passed, their leader, &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Admiral%20Eliza\"&gt;Admiral Eliza Goreblade&lt;/a&gt;, found a hidden pirate treasure of the \"&lt;a href=\"Bellwether\"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;\" ship containing two &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; cutlasses, &lt;a href=\"%3AFate\"&gt;:Fate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AFortune\"&gt;:Fortune&lt;/a&gt;.\nConsequences.\nThe coastlines of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; shifted, flooding some old lands and exposing new ones. Whole parts of the world, like &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; and a large chunk of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, ended up underwater. In some cases, tidal waves caused by the Cataclysm flooded or destroyed coastal settlements like &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, forcing their residents to relocate \u2014 usually inland. Even far from the coast, fires, avalanches and lava eruptions changed some areas beyond recognition. The &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; was split into two.\nThe tectonic shifts blocked some old routes, like the one between &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and opened some new ones through previously impassable mountains. The Cataclysm also damaged an ancient &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; device previously hiding the &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; complex, exposing access to it from &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; was thought to have been severely crippled. Though this later proved to be an incorrect claim based on an inaccurate vision by Zul. It did, however, cause the region of Nazmir to lose elevation and become a swamp, and also destroyed the second seal holding the prison of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;.\nFar out in the ocean, the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; experienced what &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; described as horrible waves.\nThe Cataclysm brought the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt; closer to Azeroth, bringing the world in direct conflict with the elemental lords \u2014 including &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, who, upon his return, assaulted &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, prompting &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to organize a defense of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; again.\nThe &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; island of &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt; and the self-isolated nation of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;peninsula of the same name&lt;/a&gt; suffered greatly from natural disasters, leading directly to events that affected the existing balance between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; respectively, redrawing the political map of the world. &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Kajaro\"&gt;Mount Kajaro&lt;/a&gt; on Kezan erupted, forcing an evacuation by the goblins. Earthquakes damaged the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; that had protected Gilneas by land and a coral reef that protected them by sea, opening them up to invasion by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Large chunks of of the lands near the sea also ended up underwater in a manner of seconds.\nDuring his last battle, Deathwing tried to summon the final Cataclysm. After the Aspect's death, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; concluded that the Cataclysm is over.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria%20%28lore%29\"&gt;mists&lt;/a&gt; around &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; parted because of the Cataclysm.\nThe Cataclysm didn't only change the land, it also changed the sea, rendering old weather, tides, and navigation notes useless."}

For ages since, the elementals of air, water, earth, and fire have engaged in endless strife with each other, waging titanic battles in the confines of their realm. One of the Elemental Plane's domains, a vast ocean known as the Abyssal Maw, is home to the water elementals. Legend says that Neptulon the Tidehunter, the powerful being who rules over the aquatic realm, possesses a potent weapon that allows its owner to control the very seas of Azeroth. Thus far, the artifact has remained secure inside the water elementals' domain... but that will soon change.\nWithin Deepholm, the domain of the earth elementals, the malefic Dragon Aspect Deathwing is on the verge of executing a catastrophic act: to burst forth from the Elemental Plane into Azeroth. Doing so will ravage the surface of the world and breach the barrier that separates Azeroth from the elementals' realm. Whether Neptulon and his subjects have entered into an alliance with Deathwing remains unknown. Regardless, if Deathwing's actions create an opening into the Abyssal Maw, nefarious and honorable factions alike will seek out the fabled weapon carried by Neptulon. Whoever secures the artifact will have control over the world's seas, a power that perhaps no one, not even members of the Horde or the Alliance, should possess."}

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; added in .\nArticle.\nHunting the unknown, discovering the lost, knowing the forgotten. The Explorers' League of Ironforge is redoubling its efforts to learn the secrets of the past. The league has begun teaching the discipline of archaeology to all members of the Alliance in a bold attempt to procure as many ancient relics as possible. This initiative is being matched by the campaign of the Reliquary -- a Horde faction formed from an unknown council based in Silvermoon. The Reliquary is training members of the Horde in the art of the dig and challenging them to find any and all artifacts of historical significance before the Explorers' League does. Each side now jockeys for position, relishing in the chase, vying for control of time-lost relics, and jealously guarding any valuable information the objects may impart.\nArchaeology is a new secondary profession introduced in Cataclysm that can be trained along with Cooking, First Aid, and Fishing. After learning Archaeology from the appropriate trainer in a major city, the newly educated treasure hunter will be presented with an Archaeology Journal to track his or her progress, as well as a surveying tool to facilitate discoveries.\nThe main purpose of Archaeology, of course, is to find artifacts! Artifacts are items lost to history that carry with them a story of the past. While their worth is mainly obtained from the information they impart and the simple joy of discovering them, rarer artifacts represent treasures of sizeable value. Every artifact has an origin, and these origins can be traced back to the races that now inhabit Azeroth and Outland. Research projects are presented in the Archaeology Journal, categorized by the races they're associated with. The fragments needed to complete each research project can be discovered by visiting dig sites.\nAt any time, players can open their maps and see these dig sites outlined for them across Azeroth and Outland. Upon reaching a dig site, a player can then search for artifact fragments with the survey tool. The survey tool arms the Archaeologist with two unique devices: a telescope and a distance indicator. The distance indicator will change from red to yellow to green as the treasure hunter gets closer, while the telescope will keep pointing the player in the right direction. When the player locates and digs up the treasure, it will provide the Archaeologist with fragments that are collected in the journal. This process will eventually result in a complete artifact.\nCompleting the rarer artifacts can reward the Archaeologist with unique items, including epic-quality weapons, mounts, and non-combat pets. In addition to the normal artifact fragments used to finish all research projects, special fragments called keystones can also be found by higher-level players. These fragments are valuable to all Archaeologists because they count as five normal fragments for most research projects, and they can be freely sold and traded. Archaeologists of exceptional skill can also use keystones to grant benefits to their friends in high-end raid instances.\nWhether you're an avid treasure hunter with a drive to discover all the world has to offer, someone interested in uncovering the mysteries of the past, or an explorer looking to obtain items of power, Archaeology is your ticket to a glorious adventure."}

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; changes in . \nArticle.\nToday we're covering the changes being made to Ashenvale in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm as the Warsong Outriders and the Silverwing Sentinels continue to vie for domination of the region. Quest designers Eric Maloof and Steve Burke sat down with us to discuss what it's been like iterating on a familiar yet evolving Kalimdor territory.\nQ. What was the original concept for the zone?\nA. The concept for Ashenvale was to show the effects of the Cataclysm while taking the opportunity to streamline the zone's level design. There were areas of Ashenvale that were pretty unfriendly in terms of accessibility and quest flow. The level designers and quest designers worked together to alleviate the problem areas and highlight the big changes. \nQ. Who will be using this zone (what levels/factions)?\nA. Both Horde and Alliance players, roughly from levels 20\u201325. We anticipate that this will be a well-traveled zone in terms of general player flow.\nQ. Without giving up any spoilers, what's the general storyline for this zone? How has it changed from the original design?\nA. Among other catastrophes, an enormous volcano has erupted in central Ashenvale. As the night elves struggle to deal with the chaos caused by the Cataclysm, the Horde is seizing what it perceives to be a golden opportunity. Garrosh Hellscream's forces are now bearing down upon the night elves and have overtaken several key positions that once served as Alliance strongholds. There is a definite feeling that the balance of power in this region now teeters on a goblin tripwire\u2026.\nThese changes also mean that Horde players will have much more to do in Ashenvale.\nQ. What do you think is the most exciting new feature of the zone?\nA. Visually, it has to be the volcano. It's stunning, and it provides a great landmark in a place otherwise known for its dense forest. Thematically, the tension present in the zone gives it a whole new feel. The Horde is barricaded inside the walls of Splintertree Post under a massive assault by the night elves and their allies. Meanwhile, Astranaar is desperately fighting off waves of Hellscream's forces. Practically everywhere you go in Ashenvale, it's impossible to escape the fact that it has become a warzone.\nQ.What goes into redesigning a zone like this?\nA. A bit more than meets the eye, we think. Ashenvale is deceptively large, and previously there were many issues in terms of quest flow and Horde/Alliance content balance. Soon after we rolled up our sleeves and broke ground, we realized that our work was cut out for us. There were numerous quests we wanted to keep, but there were also a great many that no longer fit or didn't play out efficiently. We also needed to create a variety of new quests, especially ones \"For the Horde\"\u2122.\nQ. What was the most challenging aspect about implementing these changes?\nA. It can actually be a bit tougher to come in and \"do surgery\" to an existing zone than it is to completely gut it and start from scratch. Given our ambitious time constraints, trying to determine what stays, what goes, and what other changes to make is certainly a challenge.\nQ. What should players do or go see first?\nA. Horde players should visit the Mor'shan Rampart first. There's a new Horde contingent there who is fighting hard to make sure that no night elves escape Hellscream's onslaught -- not that they'd make it far into the Northern Barrens! Alliance players who come down from Darkshore will want to help defend Maestra's Post and Astranaar as both settlements struggle to keep from falling under Hellscream's control.\nQ. Who seems to have the upper hand in the zone: the Horde, the Alliance, or the elementals?\nA. The Horde and the Alliance are throwing themselves at each other on many fronts; neither has a clear upper hand here. The elementals in Ashenvale are a minor nuisance in comparison to the faction struggle.\nQ. Should we expect any changes within Blackfathom Deeps?\nA. There are no significant changes planned for Blackfathom Deeps at this time.\nQ.What has happened to Silverwind Refuge?\nA. The Horde has happened!\nQ. What has changed the most: the storyline or the terrain?\nA. The amount of change has been pretty equal between storyline and terrain. The terrain is much less frustrating than before, and the visual results of the Cataclysm tell the story as much as the quests do. Story-wise, the theme hasn't changed so much as its intensity has.\nThanks, Eric and Steve, for taking the time to tell us about the work you've done to evolve a classic zone in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm!"}

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; changes in . \nArticle.\nDelve into the mysteries of Azshara with game designers Craig Amai and Dave Kosak, who talked with us about the Horde's northward expansion and the rise of the Bilgewater Cartel as part of our ongoing coverage of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Adventure, conflict, and, of course, profit await those who enter the newly re-imagined Azshara!\nQ. What was the original concept for the zone?\nA. Azshara has always been somewhat barren in terms of content, so our original plan was simply to fill in most of the unused space and then take some of the quests that spanned multiple zones and move them completely over to Azshara. The zone itself was a bit of a blank slate, so this approach seemed obvious from the very beginning.\nWhile discussing our goals for the overall flow for Kalimdor, we started to heavily consider when, where, and how goblins would be introduced to questing on the continent. We realized that we were in sort of a dilemma because, at that point, four out of six Horde races were being routed through the same 10\u201320 leveling experience in the Northern Barrens. It was only then that we decided to retrofit Azshara as an alternative zone for level 10 through 20 Horde characters and make it a goblin hub.\nNaturally, once goblins got involved, things sort of exploded.\nQ. Who will be using this zone (what levels/factions)?\nA. Azshara is designed for level 10 through 20 Horde characters. Goblins will be encouraged to level in this particular zone because it expands on their story and sheds some additional light on already established characters. Orcs, trolls, and tauren will be able to choose between Azshara and the Northern Barrens, based on their personal preference. (Hint: Pick Azshara!)\nQ. Without giving up any spoilers, what's the general storyline for this zone? How has it changed from the original design?\nA. Having recently gained the mantle of warchief, Garrosh Hellscream is preparing for war to claim all of Kalimdor for the Horde. The goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel, headquartered in Bilgewater Harbor, are playing their part by building war machines, constructing weapons, and establishing a massive naval harbor within sight of Orgrimmar. Meanwhile, the night elves aren't content to sit idly by; they fully intend to challenge this unwelcome occupation in Azshara and hopefully stymie a conflict that would otherwise be carried deep into their forests.\nAmid all this tension, the Bilgewater Cartel is also out to make a name for itself in true goblin fashion. What is the best way to show solidarity? Reshape the Bay of Storms into a giant Horde symbol! From there, a secret lab, an extensive rocketway, and a \"pleasure palace\" with its own golf course are just natural leaps in goblin logic.\nOverall, players will find that very little remains of the Azshara of old. The Hydraxian Warlords have departed. Azuregos is missing. Xylem's tower still stands, but Xylem himself seems to have stumbled upon something that has quickly driven him insane. And while clumsy explorers continue to be eaten by the local giant-life, the goblins have developed a method to make such an unfortunate circumstance practical and, yes, profitable.\nQ. How has Orgrimmar's relentless expansion altered the lands of Azshara?\nA. Orgrimmar now has a massive gate leading north into Azshara, and the canyon that winds into this gate will give players a brief look at the war machines being wrought from goblin ingenuity and technology. The rest of the zone expands further on this promise of destruction. The middle of Azshara includes the new Bilgewater Harbor, which acts as a naval port for the entire Orgrimmar fleet, launching boats and zeppelins to carry out Garrosh's vision for the future of Kalimdor and beyond. \nQ. What have the goblins of the Bilgewater Cartel, now aligned with the Horde, done to reshape Azshara in their (or Trade Prince Gallywix's) image?\nA. A quick glance at recent cartographical surveys of the region will show that the goblin commitment to the Horde cause is strong. Azshara is now the largest terraforming project on Azeroth! Whether it's sculpting the terrain to promote Horde propaganda, moving an entire mountain to pillage the minerals underneath, or slapping the face of the trade prince on a nearby crag, there's no question who wears the pants in Azshara these days.\nQ. What do you think is the most exciting new addition to the zone?\nA. Well, there are super-intelligent raptors, a haunted bulldozer, a crack squad of goblin commandos, a hunt for Azuregos, an insane mage with countless apprentices, rat riding, parachuting from an exploding tower...\nWhat if we just say that the most exciting new addition to Azshara is the entire zone?\nQ. You mentioned earlier that Azuregos is missing, but now he's being hunted. What's going on there?\nA. Strangely, Azuregos has disappeared, and no one seems to know where he flew off to. After that last group of bloodthirsty adventurers came through on some sort of quest to make a now-useless quiver, he's just been... well, he's gone, and there have been whisperings of someone in Bilgewater Harbor who will pay handsomely for information on his whereabouts. \nQ. What goes into redesigning a zone like this?\nA. We wanted to maintain the original color palette and fall-foliage theme for Azshara, but beyond that, it was a complete rework from the ground up. Artists began the process by creating some incredible landmarks, including a giant cannon centerpiece for the new city and an entire \"pleasure palace\" complete with the goblin equivalent of Mount Rushmore, which just oozed goblin flavor. Level designers then reshaped the environment, literally moving mountains, parting waters, and erecting a colossal, zone-encompassing rocket freeway. We then worked to complement the new scenery by adding a bizarre array of quests befitting the unique and crazy capitalistic culture of the Bilgewater Cartel.\nQ. What was the most challenging aspect about implementing all of these changes?\nA. Not using our new terrain phasing technology to blow up everything. Self-restraint doesn't come easy.\nQ. What should players do or go see first?\nA. Players should ideally start at the beginning, near the rear gate of Orgrimmar, and then follow the quest series from there; it'll lead you on a nice, smooth ride of awesome. Or, if you're the impatient type, head straight to Bilgewater Harbor, take a stroll through town, and grab some lunch at the local crustacean shack. \nQ. So, last question. Bilgewater Harbor: great port town or the greatest port town?\nA. From its roots as a humble \"city-in-a-box\" to the bustling metropolis it is today, Bilgewater Harbor straddles the line between myth and legend. At least, that's what the brochure says.\nThe orc commanders might argue differently, though. It isn't exactly easy to maintain discipline in an otherwise lawless city where every vice you can imagine is available for just a handful of silver and debauchery is half off.\nThank you, Craig and Dave, for taking the time to sit down and speak with us about the work you've done to revitalize Azshara as an epic leveling zone in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm!"}

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; changes in . \nArticle.\nGame designers Luis Barriga and Craig Amai sat down with us to discuss upcoming changes to Darkshore's landscape, the fate of Auberdine, and the challenges of redesigning an old-world zone from the ground up in this World of Warcraft: Cataclysm content preview.\nQ. What was the original concept for the zone?\nA. Darkshore was one of the areas hit hardest by the Cataclysm, so the main idea was to present a zone that had literally been shattered by those events. That was the approach we took for the revamp in terms of lore and aesthetics.\nIn terms of gameplay, our goal was to take advantage of the changes to the environment and use them to help address previous issues with quest flow. It was an opportunity to streamline progression within Darkshore so that the overall experience for players would be much smoother and require less running back and forth. \nQ. Who will be using this zone (what levels/factions)?\nA. Darkshore is designed for Alliance players, primarily night elves and worgen, from level 11 through 20.\nQ. What is changing about the zone?\nA. Auberdine has been destroyed; entire species of creatures have been wiped out, and the land has been torn wide open in multiple places.\nThe Cataclysm has also given the upper hand to a number of nearby foes, including coastal naga, Twilight's Hammer cultists, and opportunistic trolls of the Shatterspear tribe who seek to exploit weakened night elven settlements. \nQ. What's happened to Auberdine?\nA. Auberdine has been nearly razed to the ground, and what wasn't destroyed by the Cataclysm is now under assault by air elementals led by Twilight's Hammer cultists. The city is pretty much in ruins, but some survivors did make it out alive.\nQ. With Auberdine in ruins, where do night elves go now?\nA. Lor'danel. It's a small night elven town just to the north of the ruins of Auberdine.\nQ. Without giving up any spoilers, what's the general storyline for this zone?\nA. Darkshore has suffered immensely from the massive seismic ripples of the Cataclysm. The night elves are in survival mode, helping refugees and, wherever they can, fending off the advances of the Twilight's Hammer cult, the naga, and the Shatterspear trolls. Meanwhile, Malfurion Stormrage, recently returned from the Emerald Dream, has traveled to the epicenter of the destruction and called upon the ancient powers of Cenarius to contain it.\nQ. What do you think is the most exciting new addition to the zone?\nA. Without a doubt, the most exciting addition to Darkshore is the gigantic vortex in the center of the zone, where the devastating forces of the Cataclysm are being pit against the primal power of Malfurion Stormrage. Our amazing artists and level designers made us an epic energy vortex to serve as a visual centerpiece for the destruction, and it looks phenomenal.\nQ. What goes into redesigning a zone like this?\nA. Redesigning Darkshore required much more work than we originally anticipated. This was one of the first zones we tackled that centered on the effects of the Cataclysm, so we started out with the modest goal of adding a few themed quests and improving the general flow of the zone. As we piled on the visual changes, though, we soon discovered that a lot more manpower was needed to generate content that correctly reflected Darkshore's new landscape and lore.\nQ. What was the most challenging aspect about implementing these changes?\nA. At first we thought that we would be able to work with the majority of the original quests in Darkshore, but most of them just didn't make sense when viewed in the context of the zone's new storyline and direction. For example, chasing after corrupted wildlife and investigating washed-up threshers would seem out of place when everything around you is being ravaged by natural disasters, elementals, naga... and worse. Reaching the realization that we would basically have to scrap all of the old content and start from scratch -- and then actually bringing that plan to fruition -- was probably the hardest part of the process.\nQ. What's happening at the Master's Glaive? The last time we saw it, it was mostly buried underground..\nA. Twilight's Hammer cultists have recently begun to unearth the remains of Soggoth, one of the more powerful servants of the Old Gods, from beneath the Master's Glaive with the intent of bringing him back to life. Players will have to foil the cultists' plans before the new incarnation of Soggoth reaches full strength.\nQ. Is there anything new at the Grove of the Ancients?\nA. The Grove of the Ancients was shielded from most of the devastation caused by the Cataclysm, due in large part to the power of the ancient guardians residing therein. Protecting the grove required an enormous amount of energy, though, and as a result, most of the guardians have gone into a sort of slumber. Players will have to figure out a way to wake them and bring them into the fight to ensure the survival of Darkshore.\nThank you, Luis and Craig, for taking the time to talk about your involvement in reshaping Darkshore for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm!"}

It presented the characters in the third expansion, \"\".\nArticle.\nCataclysm will be a major step forward in the ongoing story of the Warcraft universe. The return of Deathwing has changed the world forever, and the major movers and shakers are forced to make decisions that will profoundly affect the future of their peoples. Below is a list of some of the most important non-player characters in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm.\nWarchief Thrall.\nThrall, the Horde's warchief, is a living symbol of nobility, strength, and unwavering courage. He led the orcs from the internment camps of Lordaeron into a new era of freedom and prosperity, and under his leadership the Horde has established itself as a major force on Azeroth. As a shaman, Thrall has a deep connection with the elements, and their wisdom has proven to be a great boon to the warchief. But although the Horde's faith in its warchief remains strong, some orcs who relish the tales of orcish ferocity and martial prowess are frustrated with Thrall's decisions. It remains to be seen whether his recent differences with Garrosh Hellscream are a one-time event or a hint at the shape of things to come.\nGarrosh Hellscream.\nGrowing up, Garrosh only knew his father, Grom Hellscream, by the stories that cast him as the one who had doomed his people. But after learning of Grom's redemption and heroic sacrifice to free the orcs from demonic corruption once and for all, Garrosh embraced his father's legacy as a fearless warrior and natural leader. At times, Garrosh's renewed zeal has put him at odds with the Horde's warchief. Frustrated by Thrall's decision to scout Northrend instead of mobilizing the Horde right away, Garrosh challenged the warchief to a duel in the Ring of Valor, but an assault by the Lich King's minions cut their bout short. Garrosh and the warchief still have some unfinished business... and Garrosh's hot-headed recklessness is fast becoming a concern to those who know the inherent danger in a Hellscream's fury.\nKing Varian Wrynn.\nThe king of Stormwind, recently returned to claim his rightful place, has little love for the Horde. His reasons are many: when Varian was a young boy, he saw his father murdered by the half-orc Garona; the orcs' warchief, Orgrim Doomhammer, slew the valorous Anduin Lothar, who had delivered Varian safely to Lordaeron after the fall of Stormwind; Varian was later enslaved by the orcish gladiator trainer Rehgar Earthfury; and at the Wrath Gate, many brave Alliance soldiers died at the hands of the Forsaken's Royal Apothecary Society. Varian, who had always been wary of the orcs, discovered that the Royal Apothecary Society had been developing the new plague for years. The events that transpired during the battle for the Undercity convinced the human king that the Horde has been left unchecked for too long: the time has come to make things right.\nKing Genn Greymane.\nThe people of the Alliance remember the king of Gilneas as a proud, strong-willed, cunning, and arrogant man. He and his armies stood by the Alliance during the Second War, but in the aftermath it became clear to Genn Greymane that the Alliance needed Gilneas more than Gilneas needed the Alliance. He ordered that the Greymane Wall be closed to all outsiders, effectively sealing off his kingdom from the outside world and its conflicts. But fate, it seems, was intent on teaching the king a lesson in humility: although the wall succeeded in isolating Gilneas from the rest of the world, it also served to damn the kingdom's people forever. As the worgen curse swept the nation and early attempts at containment failed, Greymane found himself fighting a battle for his people's very humanity.\nQueen Azshara.\nStrong-willed, manipulative, and incomparably beautiful, Azshara possessed far more magical talent than almost any other night elf in her time. Ten thousand years ago, she and the other Highborne brought Azeroth dangerously close to complete destruction when their meddling with arcane magic caught the attention of the Great Enemy, Sargeras. Corrupted by the influence of the fallen titan, Azshara set in motion a plan to bring the Burning Legion to Azeroth, a plan that caused the War of the Ancients and the Great Sundering of Azeroth. Beautiful, cruel Azshara was swallowed by the seas, never to be seen again\u2026 or so it was believed. The naga revere Azshara as a demigod, one who is still very much alive. How she could have survived the Sundering, and at what cost, remain mysteries that not many would dare to probe.\nDeathwing.\nFew have fallen as far from grace as ancient Neltharion has. As one of the five Dragon Aspects chosen by the titans, he was given dominion over the earth and the deep places of the world. He embodied the strength of Azeroth and served as the greatest supporter of the Dragonqueen, Alexstrasza. But mighty, kind-hearted, and wise as he was, even Neltharion was not beyond the reach of dark forces sleeping beneath the surface of Azeroth. Over time, sinister whispers sank their claws into the dragon's thoughts, seeding Neltharion's mind with madness. He betrayed the other Aspects, and when he turned against his brethren and let corruption take complete control, he ceased being Neltharion the Earth-Warder and became Deathwing the Destroyer. Eventually, he was defeated by the combined might of the other Aspects\u2014defeated, but not destroyed. Hidden from the world, he has been licking his wounds and nourishing his burning hatred. His return will change the face of Azeroth\u2026 forever.\nCho'gall.\nCho'gall's sordid history is a testament to his unflinching desire to sow chaos wherever his dark influence extends. The first of the ogre magi, Cho'gall rose to prominence in the old Horde as chieftain of the orcish Twilight's Hammer clan. His dubious loyalties became apparent when he abandoned the Horde during a pivotal moment in the Second War. In retaliation, forces dispatched by Orgrim Doomhammer slaughtered most of Cho'gall's traitorous clan, forcing him and his surviving cohorts into hiding. Over the following years, the ogre mage molded the Twilight's Hammer into a fanatical cult devoted to worshipping the Old Gods -- ancient harbingers of the apocalypse. Cho'gall's obsession with these malefic deities led him to the ruined city of Ahn'Qiraj, where he began efforts to awaken an Old God by harnessing the immense powers of Med'an, the new Guardian of Tirisfal. Ultimately, Med'an thwarted Cho'gall's plans, and the scheming ogre mage was thought slain. The Twilight's Hammer, however, has remained organized, leading to fears that Cho'gall is still alive... and merely biding his time, waiting for the right moment to make his presence known once again."}

Unbeknownst to the rest of the world, darkness fell on Gilneas after the Greymane Wall's gates had been closed, and the worgen curse ravaged the nation. Before long, Gilneans were fighting against Gilneans in a bloody civil war that left the kingdom in tatters. Remarkably, the people of Gilneas have somehow managed to hold on to the last vestiges of their humanity... for now."}
{"id": "741324", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=741324", "title": "Cataclysm Expansion Features/Gilneas Battleground", "text": "This article is a copy of \"The Battle for Gilneas Battleground\" an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;.

Although the massive Greymane Wall protected Gilneas from outside threats, a virulent worgen curse and civil war crippled the kingdom from within. As the Cataclysm strikes and the Greymane Wall's gates are destroyed, the people of Gilneas must come to terms with their dark curse and learn to persevere through catastrophic earthquakes and an unrelenting Forsaken invasion. The Horde recognizes this land as a strategic location with key resources to fuel the faction's war effort against the Alliance, and Horde forces will not stop their siege until the city and its surrounding territories are under their control. To protect its lands from the Horde, the once-isolated nation of Gilneas must now work with the Alliance.\nControlling Resources.\nThe Battle for Gilneas is a new 10 vs. 10 Battleground for level-85 players. Much like they do in Arathi Basin, teams must control strategic capture points on the map to accumulate resources. The first team to gather 2000 resources wins.\nThe Battle.\nTeams will start at opposite ends of the map with default graveyards nearby. Once the match begins, teams will race toward each other to vie for control of three strategic points; each point will allow your team to gain resources and additional graveyards. Adding to the intensity of the battle are many obstacles that block line of sight, as well as chokepoints for fending off enemy advances.\nThe Overlook.\nIn the center of the map is an area known as the Overlook. Hills on either side of the map create chokepoints, while narrow paths through the hills provide teams with alternate routes. A river dividing the map will also lead opponents toward a single bridge. In some cases, dominating the Overlook might be the key to controlling the capture points.\nCapture Points.\nIn The Battle for Gilneas, three distinct resource points are available for the taking by either the Horde or the Alliance: the Mines, the Lighthouse, and the Waterworks. Once any of these points is held by a team, access to nearby graveyards will be granted. In addition, workers from the controlling faction will show up to collect the resources necessary to win the battle.\nChaos will be unleashed upon Azeroth when Deathwing returns, but many steadfast leaders will see the Cataclysm as an opportunity to further the cause of their people... or simply attain more power. The situation in Gilneas is no different. Will the embattled Gilneans be able to defend their land after realigning with the Alliance? Or will the Forsaken, reinforced by Garrosh's Horde, seize this near-forgotten territory as a new stronghold in the Eastern Kingdoms?"}

Crafting their own powerful artifacts of engineering and alchemy in secret, the goblins soon overthrew their oppressors and claimed Kezan for their homeland. The mines that had been their prison, their slave camp, and the base of their rebellion now became the city of Undermine. Weaving through the heart of the island in a dizzying network of tunnels, vaults, and lava tubes, Undermine epitomizes the goblins' complex, unpredictable mindset.\nThe goblins' natural greed soon lifted them to prominence as masters of mercantilism. Trade princes arose during the First War as the cleverest goblins learned to take advantage of the strife. Great fortunes were amassed, and the Isle of Kezan became a hub for fleets of goblin trading ships. One of the trade princes agreed to lend his faction\u2019s services to the Horde in the Second War. Following the Horde's defeat, the goblins learned from their colleague's failed example, and soon they realized that their profits could double if they weren't stuck in such a restrictive relationship. By the end of the Third War, goblins were providing weaponry, vehicles, and devious services to both the Horde and the Alliance. This wouldn't last forever...\nRecently, the goblins of Kezan have found a new enemy in the Alliance \u2013 unexpected and unprofitable encounters with this faction have driven certain trade princes from their comfortable neutrality.

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in .\nArticle.\nDuring a bloody civil war among the three dwarven factions of Ironforge, the Bronzebeards ousted the Wildhammer and the Dark Iron clans from the ancient corridors of the mountain city. In the wake of the defeat, the Wildhammers ventured north and forged a new home, Grim Batol, in the mountains of what is now the Twilight Highlands. However, although they worked tirelessly to create a better future for themselves, the Dark Irons, who established the city of Thaurissan in the Redridge Mountains, could not move beyond the memory of their defeat. Consumed by the desire for revenge and desperate to control the entire dwarven region of Khaz Modan, the Dark Irons led a two-pronged assault on the Bronzebeards in Ironforge and the Wildhammers in Grim Batol. Despite their past differences, these two embattled rivals joined forces and drove the Dark Irons out of Khaz Modan, decimating the armies of the treacherous clan's sorcerer-thane, Thaurissan. Yet victory carried grave consequences. Although Thaurissan's wife and queen, Modgud, was slain during the attack on Grim Batol, her death tainted the mountain fortress. While the Bronzebeards rebuilt their glorious city of Ironforge, the Wildhammers felt forever changed by the horrors they witnessed at Grim Batol. They fled their cursed home and never returned.\n\"The abandoned city's defiled corridors later became home to a number of nefarious plots. When the Demon Soul was discovered by the Dragonmaw clan and used to force Alexstrasza's drakes to serve the Horde, Grim Batol acted as the red Dragon Aspect's torturous prison. The Dragonmaw held Grim Batol through the Second War, before they were driven out by Deathwing, who planned to steal Alexstrasza's eggs. Yet as Deathwing carried out his plan, the Demon Soul was destroyed, and the powers locked within were returned to Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, and Malygos. Deathwing narrowly escaped an assault by the four re-empowered Dragon Aspects, although he did not leave empty-handed; in his grasp were the eggs of Alexstrasza. For their vile transgressions, the fleeing Dragonmaw were shown no mercy, and the struggle came to a quick end. Members of the red dragonflight were left behind to keep watch over Grim Batol, and for years they successfully guarded its desolate halls from further intrusion... until the arrival of the Twilight's Hammer, a sinister cult who worshipped Azeroth's malefic Old Gods.\"\n\"The cult, seduced by Deathwing's thirst for absolute domination over Azeroth, has claimed the Twilight Highlands as its base of operations. The black dragonflight has driven off the agents of the red dragonflight who guarded Grim Batol so that it may be used as a fortress for training Deathwing's minions. The halls of Grim Batol run so deep into the highlands that it is unknown to what twisted end the Twilight's Hammer is using this doomed dwarven marvel.\"\n\"Called to action by the red dragonflight in the Twilight Highlands, players will be charged with putting a decisive end to the foul machinations developing within the level-85, 5-player dungeon of Grim Batol. The ferocity of the enemies within should not be underestimated, and with the assistance of brave Red Drakes and a handful of explosives, players can thin the ranks of Grim Batol's occupiers through bombing flights into the ruined city's corridors. Regardless of how successful these attacks might be, General Umbris will not allow his army to fall so quickly. In the end, adventurers will be left to their own devices, venturing into the darkest recesses of the dwarven fortress, where a nightmarish enemy is taking shape. Will you be able to uncover Grim Batol's secrets and emerge unscathed, or will your destiny be sealed within this tortured city, like so many brave heroes before you?\""}

For years historians have explored southern Kalimdor for a means of entry into this ancient titan land, searching for more evidence of Azeroth's origins. But the Cataclysm will change everything, for the fa\u00e7ade behind which Uldum has been tucked for millennia will be ruptured, leaving powerful mysteries vulnerable to discovery by the bravest, smartest, or perhaps even most brutal explorers.\nThe Halls of Origination in Uldum is a level-85 five-player dungeon available in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, featuring an unparalleled journey through the timeless titan construction and seven unique boss fights. Hidden deep within its halls lies an ancient treasure that, if placed in the wrong hands, could endanger all life on Azeroth. Should players survive the perils of Uldum, they will be called to help Brann Bronzebeard unlock the mysteries within these treacherous titan halls and protect the titans' ancient secrets.\nEntering the Halls.\nYou will immediately learn the gravity of your situation in the Maker's Overlook when stumbling over the bodies of those who have entered the Halls of Origination before you, seeking power... and failing. Those who survive beyond the entrance of these ancient corridors will be greeted by Brann Bronzebeard just outside the dungeon's transport system to the upper reaches. It will require more than the guidance of Brann to advance upward, however, as the secrets of these halls must first be unlocked.\nChamber of Prophecy.\nThe column-strewn Chamber of Prophecy is truly a testament of time. In a room adorned with the relics of an ancient culture, two arks await investigation, protected by ever-faithful servants. Those who meddle with the titan relics must answer to Temple Guardian Anhuur, the overseer of this chamber and a master of holy magic and devastating hymns.\nTomb of the Earthrager.\nAcross from the Chamber of Prophecy and just outside the dungeon's walls lies the Tomb of the Earthrager, entrenched within a pyramid sun-scorched and bombarded with sandstorms. Littered with the bones of the long deceased, the tomb waits to collect more unprepared victims. It is, after all, the resting place of Earthrager Ptah. Those who disturb his tomb disrupt an eerily quiet place before Ptah shakes the ground beneath you in a Tumultuous Earthstorm, bringing to life the weathered bones of the deceased and unearthing vile Scarabs. \nThe Vault of Lights.\nWith walls weighted by priceless titan artifacts, the Vault of Lights will serve as a chamber of punishment for your intrusion. Anraphet, a haunting statue of titan composition, awakens to serve his fellow keepers and eradicate all mortals who enter. Make no mistake: his long slumber will not prevent him from showing absolute wrath.\nSeats of the Keepers.\nSurvivors of the halls' depths will gain access to the upper reaches. With help from Brann Bronzebeard, you must uncover the mysteries of Uldum. Your journey will lead you to areas of ultimate consequence: the Seats of Magic, Life, Chaos, and Radiance. Here you will be confronted by the construct of magic Isiset, construct of life Ammunae, construct of chaos Setesh, and construct of radiance Rajh. You will be tested by these constructs of Uldum, who will not easily give up their thrones or the secrets of the titans.\nOnly by exploring Uldum's Halls of Origination in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm will you have a chance to uncover their dangerous powers, and perhaps even the mysteries behind the origins of life on Azeroth.

Sealed away within a protective field of dense foliage by Malfurion Stormrage, Nordrassil has been slowly recovering from the devastation of the Third War, when Malfurion called upon the tree's power to destroy the archdemon Archimonde and repel the forces of the Burning Legion and Scourge. Now, with the impending cataclysm, the World Tree's well-being is threatened once more. From the Firelands within the Elemental Plane, Ragnaros and his minions prepare to burst into Hyjal and set Nordrassil ablaze -- and the conflagration would endanger all life on Azeroth.\nIn World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, players will have the opportunity to explore the newly reopened Mount Hyjal as Azeroth's heroes, with the help of Ysera, Malfurion Stormrage and Hamuul Runetotem, are called upon to push back the armies of the Firelord, banish Ragnaros to the Elemental Plane and lay waste to the twilight dragon stronghold in nearby Darkwhisper Gorge. This all-new level 78-82 zone will feature multiple quest hubs, phased terrain and quest lines, portals to micro-zones within the Firelands, an all-new raid dungeon, and much more.\nThe World Tree.\nPlayers will be able to enter Hyjal by way of Moonglade, to take on a series of high-stakes quests in a historic location alongside some of Azeroth's most renowned heroes. With a longstanding rivalry among the night elf leadership threatening to undermine the campaign against Deathwing, players will quickly discover the task of defending Nordrassil is more daunting than they had anticipated. In order to succeed, they must seek out the help of extremely powerful allies: the Ancients.\nThe Ancients.\nTo protect Nordrassil and heal the devastation the invading fire elementals are causing across Mount Hyjal, players must first recapture the shrine of the wolf god Goldrinn. The ogres surrounding the shrine will not leave peacefully, but seizing the shrine will allow players their first opportunity to infiltrate the Firelands and shut down a key Twilight portal, slowing the advance of the nearby Twilight's Hammer in Hyjal.\nWith the first portal dismantled, players will soon be sought by the wilderness spirit Aessina to assist in cleansing and healing the nearby forest, ultimately returning the land to its former splendor. This small victory, however, isn't enough to deter the Twilight Remnants from attempting to scorch the forest once more. As you struggle to keep these foes at bay, you'll also need to help the Guardians of Hyjal -- a new neutral faction of druids and worshippers of the Ancients -- repopulate the forest with animal life. It's even rumored that Malorne has been spotted in the wilderness. Perhaps further investigation is necessary...\nAmid the chaos, the Druids of the Talon will need players' assistance to resurrect the goddess of winged creatures. Players begin the process by helping to slay a group of black dragons and closing a second Firelands portal from within. Just when you think things might be heating up, you'll need to fight through a burning night elf town to shut down the third and final portal with the assistance of the turtle god Tortollus.\nDarkwhisper Gorge.\nYour successes in Hyjal will ultimately lead you to the assembly of the Ancients, who have set a plan in motion to bring a powerful ally and demigod back into this realm. Before that can happen, however, you will need to infiltrate Darkwhisper Gorge disguised as a follower of the Twilight's Hammer, acting quickly to sow discord within the entrenched faction, weakening it for the coming struggle. Only time will tell if the Ancients' plan is a success -- but you'll need to do your part if there's any hope of saving Mount Hyjal from the twilight dragons, Ragnaros, and his minions of the Elemental Plane.\nFirelands.\nMore information on this all-new level-85 raid dungeon is coming soon.

For example, after the cataclysm reawakened a volcano on their home island one of the goblins' trade princes realized that there was good money to be made in offering panicked goblins a ticket to safety on his ship, taking their life savings - and then selling them into slavery. A clever plan, until it (and the ship) fell apart in a naval crossfire between an Alliance fleet and a lone Horde ship.

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Reforging\"&gt;Reforging&lt;/a&gt; mechanic added in .\nArticle.\nOriginally a magic brought to the citizens of Azeroth by the Highborne, reforging will provide a new means for players to customize their gear in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. NPCs offering reforging services will be located in all major cities, ready to assist in customizing items by altering the stats they provide. Players can use reforging to modify an item's stat values, or to undo any previous changes and allow different customization choices.\nWhat Makes a Stat.\nAll performance-boosting stats present on items fall into two categories: primary and secondary. In Cataclysm, the primary stats are Stamina, Intellect, Strength, and Agility. These stats are considered set in stone and cannot be altered via reforging. However, most secondary stats can be altered. Secondary stats that can be altered through reforging are Spirit, Hit Rating, Expertise Rating, Critical Strike Rating, Haste Rating, Mastery Rating, Parry Rating, and Dodge Rating. Any of these secondary stats can be adjusted and added via reforging NPCs. \nReforging Items.\nThe act of reforging is quite simple and will allow players to customize gear to their liking. In order to take advantage of this feature, a player needs to speak to a reforging NPC in any major city and provide them with an item to be reforged. Items to be reforged must be level 200 or higher; you can find an item's level by turning on the feature under the Display section of the Interface Options. After choosing an item to be reforged, the player can choose any secondary stat already present on the piece and allocate roughly 40% of it toward another secondary stat of their choice. The cost for reforging is the vendor price of the item. Some restrictions apply -- you can only reforge one secondary stat on an item at a time, and you can't bolster a secondary stat that's already present on an item. You can, however, undo the allocation and pay to reforge the item again. This is especially helpful in keeping stats relevant to your character as you acquire new items and skills, and change talent builds.\nPutting It Into Practice.\nLet's say you want to reforge Apocalypse's Advance (ilevel 271). You like the Critical Strike Rating on the item, but you don't need the extra 70 Hit Rating it provides. You can visit a reforging NPC in any major city, place the item in the reforging window, and choose to reduce the Hit Rating in order to add another secondary stat for a little under 14 gold (the vendor price of the item). You can choose from any stat except Critical Strike Rating, since that's already present on the boots. So, maybe you want to increase your Mastery Rating. When you choose that stat from the dropdown and confirm your purchase, the item's Hit Rating will be reduced to 42, and 28 Mastery Rating will be added. If at any time you change your mind or want to alter the reforged stat, you can undo this decision at the reforging NPC, restoring the item to its original stat values. An item's primary stats will always dictate what classes and builds an item is meant for, but with reforging you can nudge the secondary stats to help make them a better fit for your character's needs. Reforging is yet another option for customizing your gear. The choice is yours! "}
{"id": "741242", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=741242", "title": "Cataclysm Expansion Features/Southern Barrens Q&amp;A", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Cataclysm Preview: Southern Barrens\" an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; changes in . \nArticle.\nFor our ongoing coverage of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we recently sat down with game designers Dave Kosak and Roman Marotte to ask them about the work they've done on the Southern Barrens, a once-familiar place drastically altered by Deathwing's return and the continuing struggle between the Horde and the Alliance.\nQ. What was the original concept for the zone?\nA. The Barrens is one of the areas of Kalimdor hardest-hit by the Cataclysm. It has literally been ripped in two! The Northern Barrens retains much of the feel of the original zone and fulfills a similar gameplay purpose: it's primarily a training ground for low-level Horde characters. That gave us enormous freedom to create a whole new gameplay experience for the Southern Barrens. In the wake of the Cataclysm, the Alliance has been aggressively expanding into the heart of the continent from the east coast. As players enter the zone, they'll find that the Horde is really up against the ropes. The escalating conflict between the two rival factions is front and center here, providing a backdrop for much of the area's quests.\nQ. Who will be using this zone (what levels/factions)?\nA. The Southern Barrens is geared toward Alliance and Horde characters from levels 30-35.\nQ. Without giving up any spoilers, what's the general storyline for this zone? How has it changed from the original design?\nA. \"An eye for an eye\" is the theme, with each side taking and losing ground, descending deeper and deeper into violent conflict. From the Horde perspective, players will learn the grim fate of Camp Taurajo and Honor's Stand. It's then up to the players to rally their faction's disorganized forces, initiate a change in local leadership, and avenge the sacking of Taurajo. The Alliance, meanwhile, struggles to hold on to recent gains, fending off attacks from all fronts. Players will also fight to save Northwatch Hold from the brink of capture and keep the roadways from Theramore open. Additionally, both factions have to deal with the explosive growth of a strange new jungle spreading across the Barrens. This is all entirely new content for the expansion.\nQ. What do you think is the most exciting new addition to or feature of the zone?\nA. Definitely the Alliance/Horde conflict, which really comes alive in the Southern Barrens. We tried to give players the feeling of participating in large PvP-style conflicts, even if they're playing solo. Alliance and Horde members will struggle to capture and defend key points of the battlefield against waves of enemy troops. New technology will allow players to experience the story in ways they never could have prior to Cataclysm. For example, the Horde assault on the fortress at Bael Modan, and its aftermath, should really pull players into the action by showing dramatic changes in the world.\nAlso, one word: Mankrik.\nQ. What goes into redesigning a zone like this?\nA. The Southern Barrens was a complete rework, so we really started from scratch, identifying the key areas of contention and then building a short storyline around each one. To accentuate the conflict, battles continually rage in hot spots around the zone. Finally, we put together a quest structure that throws players into the thick of those engagements. We invested a lot of effort into infusing the right emotions into the zone. If you're a Horde player, for instance, we want you to be completely outraged by what happened at Taurajo!\nQ. So what has happened at Camp Taurajo? It appears to be in ruins..\nA. That depends on whom you ask! Alliance players can speak to General Hawthorne at Forward Command and discover his reasoning for removing Taurajo from the Horde arsenal. On the other hand, if you speak to the various Horde leaders at Hunter's Hill, Camp Una'fe, or Vendetta Point, you'll hear a very different version of events. We suspect that debate over the ethics of this one will rage for some time.\nQ. What was the most challenging aspect about implementing so many changes to an existing zone?\nA. It was a real challenge getting the story to flow organically from the start of the zone to the climax. Key NPCs move around and are killed during the fighting; that's always tricky to pull off.\nQ. What should players do or go see first?\nA. Alliance players will definitely want to get to Northwatch Hold as soon as possible: it's about to fall to the Horde! Likewise, Horde players should check out the utter devastation at Taurajo. Someone... has got... to pay.\nQ. Why is the Great Gate barring entry to and from the Barrens and Mulgore?\nA. The Horde built the Great Gate in reaction to Alliance aggression from Dustwallow Marsh, including the construction of a highway running from Theramore straight to the Barrens. The gate was finished just in time: Alliance forces had penetrated all the way to the entrance of Mulgore, and the gate slowed them down long enough for the Horde to rally and launch a counterattack (with the player's help, of course!).\nQ. Will you explain a bit about the emergence of the Overgrowth and the new Horde Camp Una'fe?\nA. Players may be familiar with the story of Naralex, the ambitious druid who tried to reinvigorate the springs of the Wailing Caverns to return the Barrens to the lush expanse that it once was. His story continues in the Southern Barrens as he tries to contain and cope with the unintended consequences of his near-fatal exposure to the Emerald Nightmare. The uncontrolled growth in this part of the Barrens threatens the Alliance and the Horde alike. Teegan's Expedition in the east is stymied in its attempts to get Alliance supplies to the front, while at Camp Una'fe to the west, Taurajo's survivors find themselves overwhelmed as well.\nQ. What are the Alliance forces at Forward Command and Fort Triumph and the Horde forces at Desolation Hold hoping to accomplish in the Southern Barrens by vying for control of the Battlescar?\nA. Geography defines the conflict here. The Battlescar sits in the middle of a narrow pass, a natural bottleneck. The Alliance needs to blast its way through here in order to maintain an overland link between Theramore and Northwatch Hold, not to mention a route into the Stonetalon Mountains, where the Alliance can lend aid to its allies. If the Horde can seal off this pass, then Theramore will essentially be isolated. The conflict comes to a head in the Battlescar... and the future of Kalimdor may hinge on the outcome.\nThank you, gentlemen, for taking the time to discuss the work you've done to breathe new life and adventure into the Southern Barrens for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm!"}

The few explorers who have braved the Temple of Earth's inner sanctum tell of jagged, erratic passageways--the work of some yet-unseen elemental beasts--twisting throughout the area and, more times than not, leading to dead ends. Most troubling of all are reports of a monstrous stone wyrm lurking in the shadows of the subterranean region. Beyond that, whatever guards the site of Deathwing's ascendance in the deepest caverns of the Stonecore is a mystery.\nWhether or not the Stonecore's native elemental creatures are under the sway of the Twilight's Hammer is unknown. There is no doubt, however, that they will view intruders with hostility. Unless the subterranean lair is cleansed, the efforts of the Earthen Ring and other benevolent forces in Deepholm will be meaningless. As long as the Twilight's Hammer retains its hold over the Temple of Earth, the entire region will remain covered in Deathwing's lingering shadow. "}

{"id": "741330", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=741330", "title": "Cataclysm Expansion Features/Tol Barad", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Cataclysm Preview: Tol Barad\" an official article by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; in .\nArticle.\nAn island off the coast of the Eastern Kingdoms, Tol Barad is a historic land now sought-after by the leaders of the Horde and the Alliance. Its strategic, isolated location makes it an ideal stronghold from which to conduct military strikes. In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, a battle will be waged to seize control of this prized territory. Should you triumph, unique rewards await you. Read more about this all-new world PvP and questing zone here.\nDuring the Second War between orcs and humans, Tol Barad served as an island citadel of Stromgarde. Tol Barad was of great use to the Alliance as an isolated port for preparing military strikes... until it was invaded by the Horde and decimated. Years later the nation of Kul Tiras reclaimed Tol Barad, establishing a magical prison over the ruins of the old fortifications to contain enemy magi, demons, and a host of other deadly criminals. The existence of such a prison remains unknown to most citizens of Azeroth. In the wake of the Cataclysm and with tension building between the Horde and the Alliance, this will all change. Tol Barad will once more serve as a strategic location for amassing a deadly armada of vessels to lay siege upon enemy strongholds within the Eastern Kingdoms. Because both the Horde and the Alliance are prepared to pay in blood for control of Tol Barad, it is yet unknown which of the two factions will emerge victorious from the war-torn island.\nThe Fight for Tol Barad.\nSimilar to Wintergrasp, Tol Barad will serve as an open world PvP zone, although there is also a hub on Tol Barad Peninsula for both factions to complete daily quests. Reachable by portals in Stormwind and Orgrimmar, or via a level-85 mage teleport or portal, Tol Barad will accept up to 80 players per faction to engage in brutal combat across the island's surface. Unlike Wintergrasp, Tol Barad will not have Tenacity buffs. Instead, the queue system will attempt to match each side at a 1-to-1 ratio. Battles will take place every two hours and thirty minutes, giving the offensive faction a chance to claim territory.\nTol Barad will feature capture-point gameplay. There are three keeps and three towers for the defending side to hold. When destroyed by the attackers, each tower will add five minutes to the standard fifteen-minute battle timer. In order to win, though, all three keeps must be captured and controlled by the attackers. If these keeps cannot be taken by the attacking forces, the defending faction will claim victory in Tol Barad. Similar to Eye of the Storm, Tol Barad determines whether a keep has been captured by the number of players from each side in the immediate area. There is, however, a new twist: each time a member of your faction is killed in the immediate vicinity of a keep, a slider bar will move slightly in favor of the opposing faction. So not only does the size of each force in the area determine who controls each keep, but losing allies during the contesting process determines control as well.\nIn order to destroy the defenders' towers, attackers will have access to an all-new type of war machine: Abandoned Siege Engines. Six of these Siege Engines will be placed around the map, and these vehicles can be used to bombard the towers. In contrast to the Siege Engines of Wintergrasp, these machines cannot attack players or buildings while the vehicles are being driven. Instead, players must drive them within range of a tower and jump out, allowing the vehicle to transform into an automated cannon that can lay siege to the tower. The Abandoned Siege Engine will continue to damage the closest tower in range until the machine is destroyed by opposing forces.\nTo the Victor Go the Spoils.\nPlayers who win the battle for Tol Barad will be awarded honor points in addition to Tol Barad commendations. These commendations can be used along with new reputations as currency with special vendors who sell rare and epic items, mounts, and more. In addition, the controlling faction will have unique access to extra daily quests. Similar to the Vault of Archavon, Tol Barad gives those who control it the chance to form a raid and best foul beasts locked within Baradin Hold for precious rewards.\nQuesting for a Living.\nAside from the battle to control Tol Barad, there are many quests available to both factions just off of the main island on Tol Barad Peninsula. Members of the Horde will assist Hellscream's Reach, an all-new faction vying for control of Tol Barad. At odds with the Horde are Baradin's Wardens, an Alliance faction also seeking to command the territory. Six unique quests, randomly determined from a larger pool of missions, will be offered daily. This will allow for diversity in completing quest objectives as you explore Tol Barad Peninsula over time. The faction that controls Tol Barad will also have sole access to six additional daily quests. Completing each of these exclusive quests will award experience, gold, and Tol Barad commendations. By accomplishing these tasks, players will learn of the perilous inmates held within the prison on Tol Barad, as well as why this isolated land is of great importance to Hellscream's Reach and Baradin's Wardens. In addition, increasing reputation with these new factions will grant access to incredible rewards.\nWith so much at stake in the wake of the Cataclysm, Tol Barad will be fiercely sought-after by the Horde and the Alliance, but it's up to you to help determine which side makes this island the next great military port of the Eastern Kingdoms."}

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; in .\nArticle.\nAzeroth's inhabitants endure a lifetime of struggle and conflict. They're subject to violence from neighboring enemies and rampaging beasts at an early age, and must learn to take up arms to defend themselves against predators. Regularly forced to cope with the deaths of friends, family, and members of their tribes, clans, cities, and guilds, these scarred survivors become stronger by reinforcing their walls, banding together with new allies, and raising sharp, careful, resilient children. They adapt. They change.\nFew places on Azeroth exemplify this ever-changing dynamic more than the Twilight Highlands of the Eastern Kingdoms.\nThe highlands have undergone constant upheaval throughout their history, with races and factions thriving, collapsing, and changing seemingly without pause. The fortress-city of Grim Batol has played host to no fewer than three potent factions: the Wildhammer dwarves, who abandoned their home after a Dark Iron curse left it uninhabitable; the red dragonflight, which was forced to fight for the Horde in the captivity of the Dragonmaw orcs during the Second War; and, of course, the Dragonmaw themselves, who were driven from Grim Batol when the red dragonflight was finally freed from their grasp.\nThe Dragonmaw now cling to the edges of the highlands. They're no less wild and difficult to deal with than when they ruled Grim Batol, but their knowledge of dragons and warfare is of unquestionable importance, especially amidst the chaos of the Cataclysm. The Wildhammer dwarves dwell in forested outposts among the highlands' mountains; though long friendly with the Alliance, they have only now begun to consider casting their lot in with Stormwind and Ironforge thanks to the entreaties of their cousins, the Bronzebeard clan. Even the mighty red dragonflight has suffered greatly in recent months: its members have been decimated by a frenzied, newly aggressive black dragonflight attacking relentlessly from the petrified Obsidian Forest. \nAmidst this upheaval, a new power has come to possess the highlands.\nThough the environment has been given many names throughout its history, it's only been dubbed \"Twilight\" thanks to the dominance of its current masters. The fanatical Twilight's Hammer cultists appreciate the name, but there are more functional features to the swath of land they've chosen as their headquarters. It's rimmed by massive mountain peaks that scrape at the sky like fingernails, making invasion by land nearly impossible, and the highlands' black-glass beaches ensure that marine assaults are fraught with terror; ships docking on the peninsula risk running aground.\nMore important to the cult, however, is the promise of worldly extinction and change that permeates the land. In the dimness of the highlands, shadows are deeper. The sun and the rest of Azeroth seem distant. The elements themselves are more pronounced: fires burn hotter; rain forces its way into the ground; and the heaves and shudders of the land call to mind some colossal being stirring beneath the earth. This doesn't frighten the members of the Twilight's Hammer; it lulls them to sleep.\nTheir dark work is done here in a manner that could never have been realized in Silithus. The devoted of the Twilight's Hammer train in the halls of mighty fortresses, not tiny compounds and outposts. They summon dangerous, mercurial elementals who loathe each other to the point of outright war but still pause their feuds momentarily to work towards the destruction of the other races. Outside the highlands, the cult is fractious and divided. Here, it is guided on its mission of destruction by some of the cruelest and bloodiest names in history, yet the names associated with this cabal belie the true extent of its leadership.\nThese dark whisperers chose the highlands as their base of operations for a reason. They can feel the presence of the Old Gods in the air and see their victory in the darkness. The shifting landscape, battling factions, and wicked elements embody the cult's vision of what its world will become as it is finally purged of life and order. The rest of Azeroth will follow the Twilight Highlands into oblivion, one way or another."}

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Peaks\"&gt;Twin Peaks&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; in .\nArticle.\nLocated within the Twilight Highlands, the Twin Peaks remains a crucial point of high ground for staging effective and debilitating attacks against the black dragonflight and the Twilight's Hammer, who dominate this foreboding environment. And now, two previous occupants of the nearby city of Grim Batol vie once again for control of the peaks' defenses. The Wildhammer clan, architects and original owners of the once-great fortress city, maintains some operations in forested outposts of the highlands. The Wildhammers now call upon heroes of the Alliance to help claim the peaks and fend off the Dragonmaw orcs. The Dragonmaw clan, having spent years working to enslave red dragons, once again provides strategic importance to the Horde. As the Dragonmaw and Wildhammers fight for territory they once called home, the Alliance and Horde carry out the struggle to control the Twin Peaks.\nCapture the Flag.\nTwin Peaks is a new 10 vs. 10, capture-the-flag-style battleground. Much like in Warsong Gulch, players must work to dominate variable terrain, infiltrate the enemy base, and steal the enemy flag, returning it to their fortress while remaining in control of their own flag. The first faction to capture three enemy flags before time expires will win the battle.\nDominating the Terrain.\nAlthough the Wildhammer and Dragonmaw bases are virtually identical, the terrain surrounding each base is not. Players will need to work to control an asymmetrical field where the mountain peaks are divided by a valley river. A single bridge over the river serves as a choke point in the center of the map; although deep, the river can be crossed. On either side of the river sits an outpost where temporary character enhancements can be claimed. In addition, tree stumps and rocks throughout the valley create strategic points for you to use line of sight to your advantage. To prevent absolute domination by one faction through its control of the enemy graveyard, the Horde and Alliance players resurrected in Twin Peaks will spawn from one of two graveyards per faction.\nWildhammer Longhouse.\nServing as the Alliance stronghold in the north, the Wildhammer Longhouse hovers above the valley, atop a series of plateaus. With three entrances to the complex, players have two primary means of reaching the longhouse: scaling the plateaus to the northwest, or using the stairwell up the middle in order to access any of the three openings. Be careful, though! Falling or being knocked off the cliff can not only cause damage, but it can also hinder a successful offensive against or defense of the base.\nDragonmaw Clan Compound.\nActing as the Horde base in the south, the Dragonmaw Clan Compound sits over a body of water into which the valley's river feeds. With three entrances to the compound, players have a few means of getting inside. One entrance on the southeast side requires riding up an incline and crossing a knee-deep river. A second entrance is through a water pipeline leading from the surrounding lake, while the main entrance can be accessed via a bridge over the waterfront. You'll want to be aware of your surroundings when you use the main entrance, though, because players can be knocked down into the water, slowing their advance or crippling their defense.\nThose who seek to control Twin Peaks will face an intense battle. The lands surrounding this ever-troubled location are key strategic strongholds of Deathwing and all of his followers. The Twilight Highlands are as rich with history as they are fraught with disaster and tragedy. Will the Dragonmaw clan, reinforced by Garrosh's Horde, take control? Or will it be the Wildhammer dwarves, reunited with their Ironforge brethren and accepted into the Alliance, who seize the peaks? "}

Queen Azshara, formerly a beloved leader of the night elves, escaped death in the depths of the sea when the Well of Eternity imploded. Such salvation came at a great cost, as the queen and many of her fellow Highborne were forever transformed into the monstrous naga, doomed to wander the seas for thousands of years. Their existence mostly remains a mystery to the peoples of modern Azeroth, though the Earthen Ring has learned of Azshara's naga seizing Vashj'ir for an unknown purpose as the cries of the elements echo across Azeroth from the abyss.\nThe Sunken City.\nVashj'ir is a level 78\u201382 zone in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm where players will be called to explore the depths of the Great Sea and stop the naga from seizing immeasurable power from the realm of Neptulon the Tidehunter. This expansive underwater zone will feature an unprecedented fight for survival against the naga overwhelming the area, several new quest hubs -- including Alliance and Horde naval ships and submarines -- all-new underwater travel and combat mechanics, several pocketed undersea caves free from water's grip, two new five-player dungeons (Throne of the Tides and Abyssal Maw), and the first-ever opportunity to explore the remains of the once-majestic city of Vashj'ir! \nBottled Distress Message Found Adrift at Sea.\n\"Need your help.

Looking back now, though, that wasn't real fear.\"\n\"We weren't alone in those waters. Our naval warfare attracted attention and rendered us prey. With our vessel already torn apart and taking on water, we saw a tremendous creature rise from the depths and shatter the hull, sucking us down to the sea floor. It all happened so fast. I was quick to tread the waters, hoping to regroup with any survivors I could find through a dense garden of kelp, constantly gasping for a chance breath. That's when the onslaught began. From all directions swarms of brutal naga swept through and captured a great many of us. Beaten near to death, I awoke in agony, bound in chains.\"\n\"And here I still sit. I can only describe our prison as very big and somehow very much alive. We're in the hands of the naga now.

Before being forced into labor, he spoke in a panic about some large shell protecting this living prison, expansive night elven ruins in the distance, strange naga rituals underway, and sea vrykul battling our captors. He made little sense. Could be mad. Or I could be mad to hope vrykul are fighting to free us.\"\n\"Prison patrols out again. Send word to Stormwind. Sunken City far from extinct.

It overviewed the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; race in . \nArticle.\nThe worgen are a race of feral wolf-beasts whose very name inspires fear. Theories regarding their history abound, yet the worgen's origins remain steeped in mystery.\nRecords indicate that the worgen existed for a time in Kalimdor. In fact, more recent evidence suggests that their true origin might have a connection to the night elves and a secretive druidic order from Kalimdor's distant past. Yet until new evidence comes to light, this information remains speculative.\nThe worgen's first verified appearance in the Eastern Kingdoms has been traced back to the Third War, when the archmage Arugal utilized the wolf-beasts as a weapon against the Scourge. Arugal's weapons soon turned against him, however, as the curse of the worgen rapidly spread among the human population, transforming ordinary men and women into ravenous, feral creatures.\nArugal adopted many of the worgen as his own and retreated to the former mansion of Baron Silverlaine, the estate now known as Shadowfang Keep. The curse, however, was not contained. It persisted in the lands of Silverpine and extended even into the fabled walled nation of &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20Expansion%20Features/Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, where the curse rapidly reached pandemic levels.\nThe citizens of Gilneas found themselves trapped, with no hope of escape. They retreated deeper within the isolated domain, and there they survived, fearful of the savage presence that lurked just outside the barricades.\nTensions among the displaced citizens escalated over time, resulting in a civil war that now threatens to destabilize the embattled nation even more.\nThere are those among the Gilneans, however, who cling to hope. Many believe that a treatment for the worgen curse may exist, although others have nearly given up, fearful that if the barricades should fall, their humanity will be lost forever."}

The portal hubs in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; are gone, great fissures in the earth now impede overland travel between certain zones, many zone levels have changed, and players are now required to discover the new high-level instances before they are allowed to queue for them in the dungeon finder. A firm grasp of the geography of the world and an understanding of the available means for moving from one place to another will help you meet these challenges.\nThis guide presents the fundamentals of post-Cataclysm travel between the three continents of Azeroth (&lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;) and provides details regarding the many methods of travel available. Also included is information about travel between these continents and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", most of this guide has become obsolete, as the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; once again provides portal hubs for each faction (the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; contain portals to all faction capitals, as well as Dalaran and Shattrath). It is kept for historical purposes.\nHow travel has changed.\nThe Cataclysm brought a new concept for world travel. In the Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King expansions, a portal hub in a single remote city provided access to the major cities in the Old World.\nBy contrast, in the post-Cataclysm world, new and improved travel facilities have turned the two faction capitals, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, into worldwide travel centers. Located in the heartlands of Azeroth's two original continents, these cities have also become centers for all types of &lt;a href=\"trainers\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"daily%20quests\"&gt;daily quests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;auctioning&lt;/a&gt;, and other activities.\nAlthough the old portal hubs are gone, improved &lt;a href=\"%23Mass%20transit\"&gt;mass transit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxi&lt;/a&gt; services, greatly expanded &lt;a href=\"%23solo\"&gt;solo flight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%23portals\"&gt;new portal hubs&lt;/a&gt; allow players to move freely and reasonably quickly throughout the world. &lt;a href=\"%23Shorter%20waits%20at%20the%20dock\"&gt;Shorter cycle times&lt;/a&gt; for ships and zeppelins and the addition of many new &lt;a href=\"%23flight%20paths\"&gt;flight paths&lt;/a&gt; have made travel over land and sea much easier and faster than before, even for low level characters. \n Things get even better as you level up. Characters who have reached level 60 can now fly freely around almost all of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. Characters level 80 and above can make use of &lt;a href=\"%23portals\"&gt;new portal hubs&lt;/a&gt; in the capital cities. Located in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, these hubs provide rapid access to the new level 81-85 zones. \nAlso, judicious use of new and existing &lt;a href=\"%23Quest%20Portals\"&gt;Quest Portals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Item%20Portals\"&gt;Item Portals&lt;/a&gt; can help speed your travel times.\nPatch 4.1.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%204.1\"&gt;Patch 4.1&lt;/a&gt; has reinstated the portals in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; which give access to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, portals which were removed in the Shattering prior to the Cataclysm. The return of these portals results in a substantial expansion of your travel and hearthstone options. \nFor example, even lower-level characters who do not have access to portal items and quest portals can set their hearthstone to Dalaran, giving them access to the facilities in Dalaran as well as its portal to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, while also still having rapid access to their faction capital via the portal in Dalaran. Players who choose to set their hearthstone to Shattrath may also make use of the portal from Shattrath to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. This is particularly useful for Horde characters, since it provides rapid access to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso, note that some of the &lt;a href=\"%23Quest%20Portals\"&gt;quest portals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Item%20Portals\"&gt;portal items&lt;/a&gt; outlined on this page can require expenditure of considerable time and/or gold to acquire. With the new rapid access to both Dalaran (or Shattrath) and your faction capital, you may find that your reasons for acquiring some of these quest and item portals are much less compelling than before.\nSetting your hearthstone.\nThe variety of travel methods now available have an impact on where you choose to set your hearthstone. As you level up, you need to travel more, but fortunately more means of travel open up as well. Here are some suggestions about where to set your hearthstone to make best use of the methods available at your current level.\nLevel 10.\nAt about level 7 to 10, when you have emerged from your race's starting zone, setting your hearthstone to a city near where you are questing provides convenient access to trainers and auction houses. New &lt;a href=\"%23Flight%20Paths\"&gt;flight paths&lt;/a&gt; get you quickly to your questing area.\nLevel 20.\nSometime after you get your first mount at level 20, you will begin to roam the wider world. You'll be spending time on ships and maybe zeppelins, meeting new &lt;a href=\"%23Flight%20paths\"&gt;flight masters&lt;/a&gt; and buying &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;taxi flights&lt;/a&gt;, and riding the roads to new zones.\nYou may find it advantageous to set your hearthstone to an inn in your faction's capital city. The Alliance and Horde faction capitals, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, now have class, profession, riding, and flight trainers, as well as &lt;a href=\"Daily%20quest%23Cooking%20dailies\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Daily%20quest%23Fishing%20dailies\"&gt;fishing daily quests&lt;/a&gt; that all characters level 10 and up can complete.\n&lt;a href=\"%23Mass%20transit\"&gt;Mass transit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Taxi\"&gt;taxis&lt;/a&gt; provide ready access for all levels from these cities to most parts of the Old World.\nLevel 56.\nStarting at level 56, you can use any of your faction's major cities as your home base. A &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Portal%20sequence\"&gt;quick sequence of portals&lt;/a&gt; will get you rapidly to your faction's capital. Other portals or a short flight connect you to your faction's other cities. A hearthstone in the right city will give you access to any of your faction's cities in one to three minutes. \nFor example, if you are Horde, you can set your hearthstone in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and have quick access to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Translocation\"&gt;Orb of Translocation&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; via the &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Portal%20sequence\"&gt;Dark Portal sequence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; is a short flight from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlliance toons in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; have similar portal access to the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; is a short flight from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel 63.\n Since there are now class and profession trainers and auction houses in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, when you are questing in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; you may find you have little need to travel back to the Old World. \nAt about level 63, when you've moved on from &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; to zones such as &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, which are more distant from the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and its portal to your faction capital, you may want to set your hearthstone in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nLevel 68.\n At level 68 or so, when you start questing in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, you'll probably want to move your hearthstone to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and keep it there while you quest. Just as in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, you'll find there are now class and profession trainers and auction houses in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, which minimizes the need to return to your faction capital.\nLevel 74.\nAt level 74 you can pick up the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Magical%20Kingdom%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;The Magical Kingdom of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. This provides you with a portal to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; from your faction's ports in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;. \"Don't turn the quest in!\" As long as you don't complete this quest you can use these portals.\nThis makes it practical to set your hearthstone to your faction capital or some other useful place, since you can quickly reach &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; via a quick ship or zeppelin ride and the quest portal. If you want to do dailies in both &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and your faction capital, these portals will shave roughly four minutes off your commuting time each day.\nLevel 80+.\nOnce you have more or less finished questing in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and have begun spending most of your time in the Old World again, it makes sense to set your hearthstone to your faction capital.\nAt this point the &lt;a href=\"%23Dark%20Portal%20sequence\"&gt;Dark Portal sequence&lt;/a&gt; becomes quite useful, giving you rapid access to your faction capital from all of your faction's major cities. (See &lt;a href=\"%23Level%2056\"&gt;Level 56&lt;/a&gt;, above, for suggestions about where to set your hearthstone to make maximum use of this access.)\n In addition, you can make use of the new &lt;a href=\"%23Portals\"&gt;portal hubs&lt;/a&gt; in the capital cities to access the new level 81-85 zones. This gives you fast access to (and in some cases return from) more parts of the major continents. For example, Horde can quickly get to central &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; (and back) via the portal to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance can reach northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; via the portal to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, while both factions can get to southern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in seconds via the portal to &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\nShattrath Alternative.\nAs an unorthodox alternative, &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; should be seriously considered as a hearthstone location even after reaching level 85, as it offers numerous advantages.\nHowever, despite all of the above advantages, raiders will often prefer setting their hearth to Stormwind/Orgrimmar.\nFlight enhancements.\nFlight paths.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; added many &lt;a href=\"Patch_4.0.3a_%28world_changes%29%23Flight_Paths\"&gt;new flight paths&lt;/a&gt; (also known as \"&lt;a href=\"taxi\"&gt;taxis&lt;/a&gt;\") to both &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, especially in the lower level zones. \n&lt;a href=\"Flight%20paths\"&gt;Flight paths&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; are now shown on the in-game map. After you have discovered an area, any &lt;a href=\"flight%20masters\"&gt;flight masters&lt;/a&gt; in that area will show up on your map as a winged foot: blue for Alliance, red for Horde, and green for neutral. \nYou'll need to talk to the &lt;a href=\"flight%20masters\"&gt;flight masters&lt;/a&gt; to pick up the flight paths, but once you do they will make travel for low level characters much easier than it was prior to patch &lt;a href=\"4.0.3a\"&gt;4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlying solo.\n Characters level 60 or above can learn Expert &lt;a href=\"riding\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; and purchase a &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;Flight Master's License&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"riding%20trainer\"&gt;flying trainer&lt;/a&gt; near the &lt;a href=\"flight%20masters\"&gt;flight masters&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. This license allows the character to fly almost anywhere in the Old World.\nAll characters level 68 or above can now purchase &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Weather%20Flying\"&gt;Cold Weather Flying&lt;/a&gt; from a &lt;a href=\"riding%20trainer\"&gt;flying trainer&lt;/a&gt;. This permits flying in all of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Expert &lt;a href=\"riding\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; skill, a &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;Flight Master's License&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Weather%20Flying\"&gt;Cold Weather Flying&lt;/a&gt; combine to allow a player to fly almost anywhere in the world, except within certain &lt;a href=\"instances\"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt; and a few zones not yet revised for flight.\nMass transit.\nShips, zeppelins, and trams.\nA network of &lt;a href=\"Travel_guide_to_Deeprun_Tram_and_boats\"&gt;ships&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Travel_guide_to_zeppelins_and_boats\"&gt;zeppelins&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Deeprun_Tram\"&gt;tram&lt;/a&gt; connects the major cities and ports on all three continents of Azeroth. These methods of transport are known as \"mass transit.\" Running on a regular schedule, mass transit is free, and it's fast, safe, and easy for all levels of characters.\nMass transit is the most practical way to get between continents, particularly for lower level characters. Mass transit can also be used to travel between certain major cities on the same continent, or between the northern region of a continent and the southern region. Even the highest level characters (other than mages) are likely to find this method of transport useful.\nThis section contains, for each faction, a table of ports by continent and region, and each port's connections. A quick glance at your faction's table should give you a good idea of how to get where you want to go.\nAlso included are tables of the mass transit routes available to each faction, accompanied by maps providing graphical representation of these routes and ports. \nThese maps and tables are intended to help you form a mental picture of the world, and the regions accessible by mass transit. They are also a quick reference for those times when you can't quite remember how to get where you want to go.\nPorts.\nShips and zeppelins connect the continents of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Below are tables of the ports where they dock, and the ports to which they are connected via mass transit. (See the next section for tables and maps of &lt;a href=\"%23routes\"&gt;mass transit routes&lt;/a&gt;.)\nYou can sort these tables by clicking on a column heading.\nNote that the intracontinental neutral &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; ports of &lt;a href=\"Unu%27pe\"&gt;Unu'pe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moa%27ki%20Harbor\"&gt;Moa'ki Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt; have been omitted from these tables. See &lt;a href=\"Boats\"&gt;Boats&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the routes between these ports.\nRoutes.\nIf you already know where the ports are located on each continent, the following tables may provide a more convenient reference.\nNote that the Nauticus add-on learns the schedule for ship and zeppelin arrivals and departures on your realm and displays the next scheduled times for any route you choose. Nauticus allows you to set an alarm to let you know when the next voyage is due.\nThe mass transit routes below are all bidirectional.\nThe ships between &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; dock at Rut'theran Village, at the base of the enormous tree known as &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. You can get between &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; via portals located next to their respective flight masters.\nNote that once you pick up the flight path in the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, you can now take the taxi between there and &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran\"&gt;Rut'theran&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. You can also fly from the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to locations in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; where you have flight paths.\nThere is also a portal in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in Darnassus which goes to the Exodar. This portal is on the first floor, next to the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, and has no level requirement.\nNote that the zeppelin routes between &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and between the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grom%27Gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'Gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; are to points on the same continent, rather than intercontinental as with other zeppelin (and ship) voyages. The zeppelin between the Undercity and Grom'Gol makes travel between the northern and southern parts of Eastern Kingdoms easy even if you have not yet picked up the key Horde flight path at &lt;a href=\"New%20Kargath\"&gt;New Kargath&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nShorter waits at the dock.\nThe time it takes to travel using mass transit has been significantly reduced. Before &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;Patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt;, players often had to wait four or five minutes for a ship or zeppelin to arrive at their point of departure. Now the time between departures is typically closer to two minutes. \nAlso, characters with the ability to fly in the departure zone can land on a ship or zeppelin which has already departed, provided it has not gained too much speed. This allows you to catch a voyage you might otherwise have missed. Characters with flight ability in the destination zone can fly off the ship or zeppelin before it has reached the dock, saving a little more time.\nThe newly reduced departure cycle time is key to efficient travel in the post-Cataclysm world. Although the ports look far away on the map, in practical terms they are actually only two or three minutes apart - much less time than it takes to fly across a continent. \nThus, the actual travel time between, for example, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, is less than a minute longer than the travel time between &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The same is true for travel between &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou can use the Nauticus add-on to see the departure and arrival times for upcoming voyages. Nauticus also allows you to set an alarm to let you know when the next voyage is due.\nCross-faction mass transit.\nWarning! There are exceptions to Blizzard's \"passive crew\" policy.\"\nBlizzard's blog post, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/1829961%23blog%7C\"&gt;One if by Zeppelin: Two if by Boat&lt;/a&gt;, states that the crew on the opposing faction's mass transit will never attack a player. So if you're an Alliance player, and you can avoid the guards on the zeppelin docks, you can use zeppelins for travel. Likewise, if you're Horde, you can use Alliance ships.\nIf you can fly, avoiding the guards will be much easier. Fly onto the rear platform of a zeppelin, or the stern of a ship, and fly off before it reaches its destination port.\nKeep in mind, however, that airborne guards patrol the major cities. If you take a zeppelin to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, for example, it's likely that the guards will start shooting at you before you are able to depart the city limits.\nAlso, watch for players of the opposing faction, who may not share the crew's scruples about attacking you. Ships and zeppelins which do not enter a city (which automatically flags you for PvP) are likely to be safer.\nNote that the dockmasters and zeppelin masters (on the zeppelin docks) have the vessel's destination in their title, so you can mouse over them to make sure the transport is headed where you want to go.\nMass transit vs mage portals.\nTo put travel times into perspective, remember that the loading screen part of a mass transit trip takes the same amount of time as that of a hearthstone - or a portal. The only time penalty for taking a ship or zeppelin is the wait time at the dock, and that is now almost always less than two minutes. \nKeep this in mind the next time you are tempted to advertise in the trade chat for a mage to sell you a &lt;a href=\"teleport\"&gt;portal to another city&lt;/a&gt;. By the time you find a mage and he or she gets to you, takes your gold, and pops you a portal, you could have already been aboard mass transit and on your way. \nAlso, many ships and zeppelins land near a flight master, whereas a mage portal will often deposit you somewhere deep in the bowels of your destination city.\nFor most city to city trips, when you consider the total time of the trip, typically mass transit will get you to your destination as fast as or faster than a mage portal. \nAnd mass transit is free.\nExceptions.\nThe main exception is &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, because the taxi flight between &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and the ports in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; is almost five minutes. Master flying (310%) knocks this down to just over four minutes, but added to the ship or zeppelin ride, the total travel time between a port in the Old World and &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; could be six to eight minutes. If you can find a mage quickly a portal might be a little faster. \nHowever, if you can fly in Azeroth and Northrend there are at least three ways to travel between &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and your faction capital in about five to seven minutes (depending on your riding skill level) using NPC portals. See &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Dalaran%20Commute\"&gt;The Dalaran Commute&lt;/a&gt;. \nCertain items or questgivers also can teleport you to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or other convenient locations. See &lt;a href=\"%23Item%20Portals\"&gt;Item Portals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Quest%20Portals\"&gt;Quest Portals&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut unless you are questing in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, why do you need to go to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; at all? The faction capital cities, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, are now the travel hubs, and have trainers and daily quests as well. And while you are questing in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the class trainers and auctioneers who arrived in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"4.0.3a\"&gt;4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; pretty much eliminate the need to go to any other cities.\nAnother exception might be &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;; Alliance characters below level 60 wanting to get from their travel hub to central &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; will need to fly (or take the tram) to &lt;a href=\"Menethil\"&gt;Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to catch a ship to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, or fly to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; and take a ship to &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;. The necessary taxi flights are close to four minutes, so a mage portal to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; may save lower level characters a little time.\nAlso, travel from the faction capitals to the cities of &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; involve runs between ports and portals, and some trips, such as &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, require multiple voyages if your hearthstone is not set to your faction capital. In cases like these, a mage might save you a few minutes.\nPortals.\nSeveral portals allow rapid travel between continents, or to distant areas of the same continent. Some of these portals can be used by either faction.\nIn some cases, portals can be used as stages in a trip designed for rapid travel from one part of the Old World to another. For example, a level 56+ character in &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; can quickly reach &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; by taking the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, running through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and then taking the small portal beside the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=\"%23The%20Dalaran%20Commute\"&gt;The Dalaran Commute&lt;/a&gt; for more multi-portal routes.\nPortals in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; are also included here. For portals between &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and the Old World, see the &lt;a href=\"%23Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; section below. \nAlso, see &lt;a href=\"Teleport\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; for a list of non-mage teleportation spells that require a certain class, profession, and/or item to use. \nWorld Travel Portals &amp; Portal Hubs.\nSome portals listed below can be used by characters of any level, while others require a minimum level or completion of certain quests before they can be used.\nThe Alliance portal hub, &lt;a href=\"The%20Eastern%20Earthshrine\"&gt;The Eastern Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;, is located on a small island in a lake northwest of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. It is accessible on foot through the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20District\"&gt;Dwarven District&lt;/a&gt; gate.\nThe Horde portal hub, &lt;a href=\"Western%20Earthshrine\"&gt;The Western Earthshrine&lt;/a&gt;, is on a cliff on the north side of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Valley of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and can be reached via a footbridge from the zeppelin port plateau.\nQuest Portals.\nSome questgivers offer portals which make it easier to complete their quests, usually because the completion requires travel to a remote or inaccessible location. However, if you don't turn in these quests, you can continue to use the portals for travel. Note that all these portals are one way.\nMake sure you pick up these quests as soon as possible, because completing certain other quests may make these unavailable. To keep the portals available, do not complete the portal quests.\nThe portals to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; are useful because it is a short flight from the portal destinations there to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and its portals to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe portal to &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; is particularly useful to Alliance because it is a short flight from there to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; is a little farther.\nThe portal to from &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; is particularly useful to Horde because it provides rapid transit from the Isle as well as &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and northern &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; without triggering any cooldowns.\nNote that there are a number of other quest portals, but they may not be as useful as the above for general travel. See &lt;a href=\"Teleport\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests you should never turn in.\nIf you turn in any of the quests in this table, you will lose access to a portal that is useful for traveling around the world. So, resist the temptation to turn them in!\nItem Portals.\nCertain items have the ability to teleport you to a key location at or near either &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or your faction capital. \nSee the &lt;a href=\"Teleport\"&gt;Teleport&lt;/a&gt; page for more teleport items, some of which are only available to certain races or classes.\nThe Dalaran Commute.\nCharacters levels 59 and below will generally find that &lt;a href=\"%23Mass%20transit\"&gt;ships and zeppelins&lt;/a&gt; are the most expedient means for getting back and forth between &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and the Old World continents of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, if you are level 60 or above and need to commute between &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and your faction capital (&lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;) for daily quests, there are several routes which use a combination of portals and flight to get you to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or back home to your capital in roughly five minutes.\nNote that once you have acquired one of the &lt;a href=\"%23Portal%20Items\"&gt;Item Portals&lt;/a&gt; above, you can use the item to get to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or your faction capital city very quickly. However, the routes below may still be useful if your hearthstone or other portal item is on cooldown when you need to travel.\nFive Minutes to Dalaran.\nIf you like to have your hearthstone in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and you are level 83 or above, you can use two portals to get to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;:\nThis trip is slightly over five minutes if you have a &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;Flight Master's License&lt;/a&gt; and Master &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Riding&lt;/a&gt;. Note that you must complete a quest to activate the &lt;a href=\"Waygate%20%28location%29\"&gt;Waygate&lt;/a&gt; before you can use this method. See the quest line beginning with &lt;a href=\"An%20Issue%20of%20Trust\"&gt;An Issue of Trust&lt;/a&gt;.\nHome in Five.\nIf you prefer to have your hearthstone set to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; or have not yet gained access to the portal to &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;, you can get home from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; by following this sequence:\nWith a &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;Flight Master's License&lt;/a&gt; and Master &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Riding&lt;/a&gt; this trip is under five minutes.\nHome in Four.\nIf you've reached level 80 there's an even quicker way home from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. However, you'll need to do a series of &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; quests.\nHere's the sequence:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, Horde:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, Alliance:\nWith a &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;Flight Master's License&lt;/a&gt; and Master &lt;a href=\"Riding\"&gt;Riding&lt;/a&gt; this route can get you from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in less than three and a half minutes. From &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; takes about a minute longer.\nRockets and boats.\nHorde characters may now use the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rocketway\"&gt;Rocketway&lt;/a&gt; to travel quickly around &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacters who complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Circle%20the%20Wagons...%20er%2C%20Boats\"&gt;Circle the Wagons... er, Boats&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) or the quest line beginning with &lt;a href=\"To_the_Summit\"&gt;To_the_Summit&lt;/a&gt; (Horde) get the &lt;a href=\"River%20Boat\"&gt;River Boat&lt;/a&gt; for travel in the flood waters of &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;.\nTurtle boats ply the waters between the neutral &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; ports of &lt;a href=\"Unu%27pe\"&gt;Unu'pe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moa%27ki%20Harbor\"&gt;Moa'ki Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=\"Boats\"&gt;Boats&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nOutland.\n&lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; is floating in outer space, physically unconnected to Azeroth. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and the continents in the Old World, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; has no mass transit ports. \nHowever, each faction can quickly travel to and from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; via portals located in their major cities and in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Also, characters level 70 and above can take a portal from &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'danas&lt;/a&gt;, from which flight paths to locations in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; are available.\nAt level 56, portals in the major cities take you to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, which provides access to the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; zone of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Portals at the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; return you to your faction's capital city. \nOutland Portals.\nNote that the portals from the major cities which provide access to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; take the player to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; in the vicinity of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. The player must then run or fly to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and go through it to enter the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; zone of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe portals in the major cities to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; can only be used by level 56 characters and above. The return portals, from the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; (on the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; side of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;) to the faction capitals of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; itself from the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; side, can be used by any level.\nThe Dark Portal sequence.\nYou don't need to be going to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to find the &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; portals useful. From any major city, follow this sequence to get to your faction capital:\nThis takes less time than you might expect, especially once you can fly in the Old World.\nAt level 56 this sequence opens up new possibilities for choosing where to set your hearthstone, and becomes key to rapid travel among your faction's major cities and throughout the Old World. See the &lt;a href=\"%23Level%2056\"&gt;hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; section for more information and examples.\nLow level access.\nAlthough the portals in the cities to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; can only be used by characters level 56 and above, there is no level restriction on the use of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible - though challenging - to ride lower level toons through &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in order to enter &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce you get to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; go through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Horde characters turn right (north) and jump off the landing. You'll find a flight master who will fly you to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; even if you've never been there before.\nAlliance characters turn left (south) and jump off the landing to find your flight master and fly to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo return to the Old World from &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;, see the flight master outside the &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Light\"&gt;Terrace of Light&lt;/a&gt; and take the taxi back to the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;. Each faction has a small portal beside the steps. The Alliance portal goes to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;; the Horde's to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;."}

Each year at BlizzCon, Blizzard holds numerous panels revealing their upcoming titles and newest game content, displaying art, hosting live tournaments, putting out playable demos, and much more.\nThe first BlizzCon was held in October 2005, and was not an overly successful event. After a year off, BlizzCon returned in 2007, with the popularity of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" pushing attendance far higher, and has been a success ever since.

Blizzard generally saves major announcements about upcoming games for BlizzCon. All of the \"World of Warcraft\" expansions have been announced at BlizzCon, except for \"\" which was announced at &lt;a href=\"gamescom\"&gt;gamescom&lt;/a&gt; 2015 and which was announced via a stream on YouTube and Twitch in 2022.\nThe cost of the ticket (which varies each year) grants attendees entry to the convention hall for the duration of the event and an exclusive Goodie Bag, which often contains things such as in-game rewards for their games, &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; keys for upcoming Blizzard titles, and other exclusive Blizzard paraphernalia. Since the amount of tickets is finite, dates for the ticket sales are announced months in advance. On sale day, the tickets are often sold out within the first few hours.\nVirtual Ticket.\nThe Virtual Ticket gives a front row seat at BlizzCon from the comfort of ones own couch, live and in high definition. They'll get comprehensive coverage of both days of the show, including panels, contests, interviews, the closing ceremony, and more, along with some cool commemorative in-game goodies. They can even stream the convention using the free &lt;a href=\"%23Mobile\"&gt;BlizzCon Mobile app&lt;/a&gt;.\nApplications.\nMobile.\nBlizzCon Mobile is a fast and easy way to help make the most of the BlizzCon experience with streaming panels and videos, a complete interactive events schedule, hall maps, plus footage and results from all of BlizzCon's breathtaking esports matches. The mobile app was originally released as BlizzCon Guide on 5 October 2011 for BlizzCon 2011 but was renamed to BlizzCon Mobile on 24 October 2017 for BlizzCon 2017.\nSupport for using the mobile app to stream to a was added on October 25, 2018, with patch 4.1.0.\nTV.\nThe BlizzCon TV app was released for and on 25 October 2018 along with the Chromecast streaming support for the mobile app."}

It was first implemented with the &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". It was used to download the full game installer package, and periodic updates for the game. It was also used to download the trailers for \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20II\"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo%20III\"&gt;Diablo III&lt;/a&gt;\". Early versions were based on the source code of the original BitTorrent client, though it is unclear what the source model later was. When a large update was issued, Blizzard Downloader was downloaded to the WoW directory and fetched the update file, using TCP ports 3724 and 6881. Blizzard offered an individual client for each download they offer, instead of just a torrent file. Blizzard Downloader also ran in the background under the name of Background Downloader. While the downloader was running, the program also uploaded parts of files over the internet to other users who needed the same data.\nIt was originally called the WoW Sneak Peek Downloader as a test program to download the &lt;a href=\"2001%20ECTS%20Cinematic%20Trailer\"&gt;2001 ECTS Cinematic Trailer&lt;/a&gt;.

Previously, the window was much simpler with considerably less artistry (default UI for Windows/Mac). There were no obvious functional improvements, but the splash art could've possibly change with each patch or for different product downloads.\nThe downloader changed further with &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;. Following \"\", &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; introduced a brand new look for the downloader.\nStructure.\nThe Blizzard Downloader bundle was actually a plain BitTorrent client that has at least one .torrent file inside. The .torrent could be opened by other BitTorrent clients giving the user greater control over how the download is handled."}

The company originally concentrated primarily on the creation of game ports for other studios before beginning development of their own program with the development of games like \"Rock n' Roll Racing\" &amp; \"The Lost Vikings\".\nIn July 2008, Blizzard's parent company, Vivendi, merged their Vivendi Games subsidiary with Activision to create a new holding company called &lt;a href=\"Activision%20Blizzard\"&gt;Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;. Five years later, in July 2013, Vivendi sold off most of its shares in Activision Blizzard, which now exists as an independent company. As of October 2014, the company employs over 3,900 individuals.\nCore values.\nBlizzard Entertainment lists its eight core values on their mission statement page:\nHistory.\nOriginally under the name \"Silicon &amp; Synapse\", the company was founded on 8 February 1991 by three graduates of the : &lt;a href=\"Allen%20Adham\"&gt;Allen Adham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Michael%20Morhaime\"&gt;Michael Morhaime&lt;/a&gt;. , the CEO and founder of \"Interplay Entertainment\", was granted a share in the company to improve the prospects of working jointly for the young studio. &lt;a href=\"Frank%20Pearce\"&gt;Frank Pearce&lt;/a&gt; also joined the studio upon inception as the first employee.\nThe small company initially did many \"ports\", converting games from one platform operating system to another, including board games (Battle Chess, Lexicross), strategy games (Castles), sports games (Amiga Baseball), and others (Dvorak Teaches Typing), though the company did become the first American developer to release a Super Nintendo title with RPM Racing, which became one of the first ten launch titles for the platform in North America. It was not until \"Interplay Entertainment\" and \"Silicon &amp; Synapse\" collaborated on the SNES side-scroller \"The Lost Vikings\" that its critical \u2014 though not commercial \u2014 breakthrough came. With some acclaim, the game hit the shelves in 1993. The game's release, along with Rock &amp; Roll Racking (also 1993) led Nintendo to name the studio its \"Developer of the Year\". Tragically, the release of the two games coincided with the death of the 16-bit console market, and neither title sold well.\nSometime in 1993, co-founder Adham told the other executives that he did not like the name \"Silicon &amp; Synapse\" anymore as the name was getting confused with the meaning of silicon the chemical element used in microchips. Late 1993, Adham changed the name to \"Chaos Studios\", reflecting on the haphazardness of their development processes. However, they would later be contacted by a Flordia company by the name of \"Chaos Technologies\" and would happily let them use \"chaos\" for $100,000. Instead of paying for the license, they decided on a rebrand again which lead to \"Ogre Studios\" but Jan Davidson, President of Davidson &amp; Associates, stated that it may be too scary for the kids (as stated by Adham). The choice for \"Blizzard\" came down to Adham looking through the dictionary with a close contender being \"Midnight Studios\". The company would be renamed to Blizzard Entertainment on 24 May 1994.\nIn August 1995, the company moved from a 3,600 sq. ft. office in Costa Mesa to a 14,000 sq. ft. office in Irvine, CA.\nFacing a lack of success in the console market, and not willing to bet solely on one market, the company continued developing several 16-bit console titles while branching out by starting development on two new games: Games People Play, a crossword/word-game that was never completed, and \"\", whose development was led by its second employee and VP of \"Research &amp; Development\", \"Patrick Wyatt\".\nBlizzard turned 20 years old in 2012. The history is recorded on a timeline on its own site &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/b20/timeline.html\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 2013, Blizzard announced an official partnership with to provide licensed \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\" in-game rewards to college gaming clubs. In early 2014, TeSPA and Blizzard Entertainment hosted the $5,000 \"North American Collegiate Hearthstone Open\" series, culminating in a live grand finals event at the stage at PAX East and PAX Prime.\nOn February 8, 2016, Blizzard celebrated their 25th year anniversary with a video and continued to celebrate it along with the \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" 20th anniversary at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202016\"&gt;BlizzCon 2016&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn October 3, 2018, &lt;a href=\"Activision%20Blizzard\"&gt;Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; announced &lt;a href=\"J.%20Allen%20Brack\"&gt;J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt; as the new president of Blizzard Entertainment succeeding &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt;. In February 2019, Blizzard underwent a round of layoffs, though announced that it would be expanding its development staff. Teams for some of its IPs, including \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", will be expanded. \nOn March 7, 2019, Blizzard and partnered to release the classic \"&lt;a href=\"Diablo\"&gt;Diablo&lt;/a&gt;\" on GOG.com's platform as well as ' and ' by March 28. On June 5, 2019, Blizzard gave the OK to GOG.com to add the authorized non-canoncial expansion which was developed by to \"Diablo\" as a free add-on, due to popular demand.\nOn January 22, 2021, is now a subsidiary of Blizzard Entertainment, from . Vicarious Visions was merged with Blizzard on 12 April 2022 and renamed to &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Albany\"&gt;Blizzard Albany&lt;/a&gt; and would be fully dedicated to Blizzard games.\nBlizzard turned 30 years old in 2021 and celebrated it at &lt;a href=\"BlizzConline\"&gt;BlizzConline&lt;/a&gt; with the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Arcade%20Collection\"&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFrom the late 2010s to 2022, Blizzard experienced a round of departures, with many employees going on to form their own development studios.\nBlizzard Entertainment and NetEase who had licensing agreements since 2008 to bring Blizzard games to China were unable to come to an agreement on the renewal terms for the license. The license expired on 24 January 2023, with games and software such as \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20Battle%20Platform\"&gt;Warcraft III Battle Platform&lt;/a&gt; shutting down until a new licensing agreement can be made with an another company.\nTeams.\nAfter the release of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", the company divided its development staff into numerically designated teams (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Team%202\"&gt;Team 2&lt;/a&gt; is the dev team for \"World of Warcraft\"), each team focusing on a specific project. While relatively small, each team is supported by a much larger cast of employees, as well as being overseen by other groups within the company.\nIn addition to the numerically designated teams, \"strike teams\" were formed, as a result of &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;'s desire to keep the company's original culture intact. These teams are not assigned to any one project, but give feedback on separate projects. A \"design council\" also exists, a gathering of all of the game directors and lead designers throughout the company. As of August 2017, most of Blizzard's development focus is on supporting its existing IPs, but is working on new IPs as well. As of November 2018, Blizzard's current development model is to effectively have one team per IP and support indefinitely. As a team grows and reaches a certain size, elements of the team will be spun off to work on a new IP. Each team consists of around 100\u2013300 people.\nThe list of teams of current and past include:\nRelationship with Activision Blizzard.\nOn December 2, 2007, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.vivendi.com\"&gt;Vivendi&lt;/a&gt; (Blizzard Entertainment's parent company) announced that their subsidiary Vivendi Games (of which Blizzard Entertainment was a part) would be merging with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.activision.com\"&gt;Activision&lt;/a&gt; to form &lt;a href=\"Activision%20Blizzard\"&gt;Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;. The deal was finalized on July 8, 2008. Vivendi later divested themselves of Activision Blizzard in July 2013, and it now exists as an independent holding company.\nBlizzard Entertainment, Inc. remains Blizzard's brand, as it and Activision continue to exist as separate entities within the Activision Blizzard umbrella.\nConferences.\nBlizzard Entertainment has conferences for Blizzard announcements and demonstrations, known as the Blizzard Entertainment World Wide Invitational and &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;. The first WWI was held in Seoul, South Korea on May 19 and 20, 2007 when Blizzard officially announced \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20II\"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt;\". Paris, France hosted the second Invitational on June 28 and 29, 2008.\nPublished games and applications.\nRumored games.\nNote: Blizzard has confirmed that they are NOT working on a \"StarCraft\" or \"Diablo\" &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnreleased/Cancelled games.\nAbout 50% of all Blizzard games have been canceled during development.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Behind the scenes it would also theoretically provide some measure of scanning and protection from trojan viruses and third party cheat programs.\nThe Blizzard Launcher has been superseded with the release of the &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Battle.net%20desktop%20app\"&gt;Battle.net desktop app&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesign change.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.8\"&gt;patch 3.0.8&lt;/a&gt;, the launcher was redesigned with a new look. Also added to the \"Options\" menu was a bare-essentials \"Game Preferences\" panel, \"Downloader Preferences\" panel, and a \"Parental Controls\" link to the \"WoW Account Management\" website.\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the launcher was redesigned and themed for the expansion \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\". With &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, it was redesigned and themed for the expansion \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\".\nControversy.\nThere was a bit of controversy regarding the Launcher as it was scanning the computer for malicious software, which some people believed to be an invasion of privacy.\nPatch 4.0.1.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the launcher was updated to \"stream\" installation and patch data. The new launcher is broken up into three stages of download progress:\nThe Updater and Downloader have been integrated closely into the Launcher, resulting in less application switching when patching and installing.\nThe reasoning and utility of the launcher is based on the fact that, for instance, if a large raid instance is being added to the game there's no reason why the players shouldn't be allowed to access the game world and play as it downloads.\nPatch 4.3.2.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%204.3.2\"&gt;Patch 4.3.2&lt;/a&gt; brought 2 major changes to the Launcher functions.\nThe first being \"Repackaging Game Client Data\". Pre 4.3.2, Blizzard would only repackage Data folder .MPQ files into fewer (but larger) data .MPQ files when an expansion released. With 4.3.2, Blizzard made a commitment to repackaging the Data folder more often.\nThe second change was the additional of \"Verify/Repair Game Data\". Pre 4.0.1, this feature was available via the Repair.exe file located in the main WoW folder. When Blizzard switched to the Streaming client in 4.0.1, the function of the Repair.exe file switched to repairing only the .exe, .dll and other minor files located in the main WoW folder - the only way to repair game data was to log into the game, and have the client stream non-corrupted data. This however caused lag-related complaints, and even caused issues where users would disconnect from the game due to the sheer volume of uncorrupted data needing to be streamed. With the addition of this option to the Launcher, users can once again repair their game files while not in the game.\nPatch 5.0.4.\nIn the launcher introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, the last phase in patching has been renamed from \"Playable\" to \"Optimal\", and the PTR options are now under the \"Options\" button."}

{"id": "19680", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19680", "title": "Block", "text": "Block is the ability of a &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; to absorb &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; damage in addition to its armor value. When a shield is equipped, you have a certain chance to perform a block, which reduces the damage you take by 30%. The chance to block an attack from an attacker of the same level is indicated on your character sheet under the Defense category. Fighting a mob of higher level than yourself decreases your chance to block, and vice versa.\nMob rules.\nWhile it is clear that a Blocked attack made against a \"player\" cannot be a crit, it is possible that mobs have different rules for determining whether an incoming attack is blocked or not, which includes the possibility of a \"blocked crit\". (c.f. &lt;a href=\"Attack%20table\"&gt;Attack table&lt;/a&gt;)\nIt should be noted, however, that only special attacks\u2014i.e. yellow-damage instant attacks such as Claw, Overpower, and Sinister Strike, and yellow-damage on-next-swing attacks such as Heroic Strike and Raptor Strike\u2014have been observed as inflicting blocked crits. Normal white-damage auto-attacks have never been seen inflicting a blocked crit, and are probably subject to the same mutually-exclusive-attack-result rules that attacks made against players are.\nNote too, that unlike player characters, mobs sometimes block attacks even though they have no shield equipped.\nWithout talents or talent-tree specialization abilities, your base chance to block an attack is 5%. This is modified by a factor based on the difference between the attacker's level and the defender's level. For each point of difference between the attacker's level and the defender's level, the block chance is modified by 0.5% if the target is a mob and 0.2% if the target is a player. Mobs level 9 and lower do not block as frequently, just as they are not &lt;a href=\"miss\"&gt;miss&lt;/a&gt;ed as frequently as they should be. Also, mobs cannot block more than 5% of attacks regardless of level difference. Additionally, if the character is a protection-specced warrior or paladin, then block rating is increased by &lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe formula:\nBlock% = 5% base chance + contribution from talents + contribution from Mastery (if so specced) + ((Defender's level - attacker's level) * 0.2)\nUnlike &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parry\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt;, your chance to block is not subject to diminishing returns.\nIn combat, you will notice that the percentage of incoming attacks that are Blocked matches the Block percentage shown in your tooltips. Miss chance and Critical chance are unmodified by your Block chance, so you're not \"wasting\" Blocks on misses nor are you able to Block a Critical. This may seem odd to some folks if they are expecting a \"if hit, then check if Parry, then check if Block, then check...\" type system. WoW, like many other games, uses a &lt;a href=\"Attack%20table\"&gt;combat results table&lt;/a&gt;-based combat scheme (where one roll determines outcome of an attack), so percentages are absolute.\nYour parsed Block percentage won't necessarily match your tooltip if you're fighting creatures higher or lower in level to you. See the Defense formula above to understand.\nDamage reduction.\nWhen a block occurs, the target takes the same amount of damage (s)he would have taken from an ordinary hit (\"not\" a &lt;a href=\"critical%20hit\"&gt;critical hit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"crushing%20blow\"&gt;crushing blow&lt;/a&gt;), reduced by 30%. For example, if a mob would normally hit you for 500 damage, you will see in your combat log:\n\"... hits you for 350 (150 blocked).\"\nBlock reduction is calculated prior to any absorbs. For example, if a mob would normally hit you for 30k, and you have a 10k damage absorption shield and a standard 30% block reduction you will see in your combat log:\n\"... hits you for 10000 (10000 absorbed, 10000 blocked).\"\nCritical Block.\nThe Protection Warrior's &lt;a href=\"Mastery\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, , gives the warrior a chance to block twice as much incoming damage. If a critical block occurs, the damage reduction is increased from 30% to 60%."}

The goblin sent his companion to seek out Zhahara and tell her that he had found two &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; and was planning on following them.\nBlokk found Zhahara overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, preparing for the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; emerged through the portal, Blokk asked if he should help. Zhahara explained that Rahjak didn't need any assistance, which was quickly proven when the blademaster slaughtered the portal's defenders.\nAfter visiting &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;, Li Li and Strongbo journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; aboard a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; while Blokk, Rumblefitz, and Rahjak pursued them on a ship. Rahjak admonished Rumblefitz for possibly ruining his chance to face Bo in combat and warned the goblin that if an incident like the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;\u2014when Rumblefitz had been discovered and ended up in a fight with the pandaren\u2014happened again, he would skin the alchemist alive. When Rumblefitz started to reply in a mocking manner, Rahjak punched Blokk in the chest, causing the ogre to vomit, and then amended his statement: he would skin Rumblefitz alive, then feed what was left of him to the ogre. He finally stated, however, that he would let Rumblefitz live for now since Zhahara apparently saw something in him.\nRahjak eventually managed to capture Li Li in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; after she got separated from Strongbo. Zhahara's cohorts brought the pandaren to an island and chained her up, with Rahjak leaving her a spyglass so she could watch Bo die once he arrived to save her. Li Li made a bet with Blokk, challenging him that the ogre couldn't drink her entire bottle of brew. Unbeknownst to Blokk, the bottle was, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"Jug%20of%20a%20Thousand%20Cups\"&gt;Jug of a Thousand Cups&lt;/a&gt;, a magical vessel capable of holding an endless amount of beer. Blokk took up the challenge, as he began deciding it was the best drink he ever had.\nBo arrived at sunrise, fighting Rahjak to free Li Li. After they had fought for some time, Blokk managed to finish the entire jug of brew and immediately passed out from the alcohol, allowing Li Li to steal his keys and escape her bonds.\nBlokk was last seen lying unconscious on the island, and he was the only one of the villainous group to survive the ordeal."}

As the blood elves began to regroup and rebuild, a battle-hardened Lana'thel stumbled upon &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, the sword once wielded by her friend Thalorien.\nAfter Kael'thas promoted &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas and ordered him to safeguard their people, he took a force of blood elves with him to aid the Alliance against the Scourge forces in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Lana'thel would be one of the countless blood elves under his command as a &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;series of events&lt;/a&gt; led them to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, making &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; its new ruler, and then being sent to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Lana'thel readily followed her prince throughout all these dangerous adventures and was eager for revenge against the Scourge.\nHowever, in the icy hills of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; ultimately defeated Illidan and Kael'thas, and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;expedition's&lt;/a&gt; few survivors were scattered across the frozen wastes. One by one the Lich King sought out those who had challenged him, and Lana'thel found herself cornered. Using Quel'Delar, she struck at him with all her might, but &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;'s evil powers overwhelmed her. Through his blade, the Lich King chose Lana'thel to serve him in undeath as blood-queen of the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt;, a group responsible for overseeing the Scourge's operations across Azeroth.\nBlood-Queen Lana'thel eagerly carried out her new duties, but every time she looked at her blade, maddening anger would swell within her as she remembered her former mortal life. She could not afford such distractions, and with a scream that echoed throughout Icecrown, she shattered Quel'Delar and flung the fractured pieces as far as she could.\nIcecrown Citadel.\nLana'thel now makes her home in the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Hall\"&gt;Crimson Hall&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. She is protected by &lt;a href=\"Keleseth\"&gt;Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taldaram\"&gt;Taldaram&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valanar\"&gt;Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, who were revived by the Lich King after they were defeated in &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27kahet\"&gt;Ahn'kahet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Naxxanar\"&gt;Naxxanar&lt;/a&gt; (respectively).\nLana'thel makes an appearance at &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Quel'Delar's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, just south of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, giving background information on the epic sword.\nLana'thel personally interrogated &lt;a href=\"Infiltrator%20Minchar\"&gt;Infiltrator Minchar&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn these halls, she met her ultimate demise.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Lana'thel was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill her once again.\nAs a victim of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Lana'thel's soul was sundered upon her death as a mortal, and much like &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; she was resurrected with this piece not in its place. The missing fragment of her soul, crystallized as \"The Blood Queen\", came into the &lt;a href=\"Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;'s possession after Frostmourne's shattering. "}

{"id": "247347", "revid": "474131", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=247347", "title": "Blood-Queen Lana'thel (tactics)", "text": "Blood-Queen Lana'thel is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; and a boss of the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; raid. The fight is a cross between a very intense &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt; and a hellish &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20survival\"&gt;battle for survival&lt;/a&gt;. High raid awareness and understanding of the fight are critical, even a single player death can mean a wipe.\nThis boss is available since January 19, 2010 on US servers and January 20 on EU servers.\nPreparation.\nShe should be tanked right at her starting position. She requires two tanks, because she links her primary tank to the player standing closest to the tank (Blood Mirror), which means the linked target takes the same amount of damage as the tank. Shamans should use &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt;, and it's a good idea to have all healers in a group with a shaman. If no shamans are available, Priests should &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Ward\"&gt;Fear Ward&lt;/a&gt; healers.\nThe raid needs to stay distributed throughout the encounter (6 yards away from everyone else). It's a good idea to keep a circle of about 10 yards free of players right in the center of the room, and also to have everyone stay away from the walls. Ranged DPS make a semicircle at maximum range.\nStrategy.\nThe fight has only one phase. Although every two minutes she performs a very short air phase, the mechanics of the fight remain basically the same at all times.\nEvery player constantly takes damage from her aura (initially 4.5k per &lt;a href=\"tick\"&gt;tick&lt;/a&gt;, increasing with each vampire in the room).\nAt random intervals, a random raid member gets Swarming Shadows, which makes them drop Shadow Fire on the ground until the debuff expires. Affected players can avoid taking any damage by running. It's a good idea to keep the walls free of other players, so that players with Swarming Shadows can simply run along the walls.\nAnother ability which she randomly uses is Pact of the Darkfallen. This links 2/3 (10/25 man) players to each other, they take increasing amounts of damage until they stand on top of each other. Linked players should meet in the center of the room.\nEvery two minutes she takes off, fears the whole raid and launches three extra Blood Bolts at every player. When she takes off, ranged DPS should run to the walls of the room while melee spread out in the middle. Healers should be in a circle between melee and ranged. After the fear is over, players must spread out again very quickly, else the Blood Bolts can be lethal. Healers should move only minimally after the fear and instead start a massive spam of AoE heals right away.\nVampire debuff.\nThe Blood Queen has an extreme amount of hitpoints and a 5:30 minute enrage timer. An average of 9.8k/7.8k (25/10 player) DPS is required to beat it (assuming 2 tanks and 5/3 healers). Virtually all raids use the Vampire debuff to boost their DPS (although it's theoretically possible to beat her without using it).\n15 seconds after the start of the encounter Blood-Queen Lana'thel bites the highest threat player which is not tanking, dealing the Vampire debuff. Becoming a Vampire has the following effects:\nThe Blood Queen bites only one player throughout the whole fight. After 60 seconds, this person must bite another raid member. After 60 more seconds, both need to bite two more players, next four, and so on. It's extremely important that damage dealers get bitten first (starting with the highest DPS first), and healers last. &lt;a href=\"DPS%20cooldowns\"&gt;DPS cooldowns&lt;/a&gt; should only be used after all damage dealers are bitten.\nSome raids establish a fixed bite order. One damage dealer can use all cooldowns while the others hold back a little, making sure who gets bitten first. Assuming 8 melee and 8 ranged DPS, everyone biting within 3 seconds after the Vampire debuff expires, an example bite order can go as follows:\n16 vampires are out, Bloodlust or Heroism now. It may be advisable to delay the first two rounds of biting a little, in order to avoid conflicts during the air phase - else it's possible that some players must bite during or shortly after the fear, which may mess up the bite order.\nAfter the 5th round of bites, there's no need to bite anyone anymore, because she enrages at 5:30. With this organization no one should ever get mind controlled as long as they memorize their targets before the encounter begins. Healers should keep in mind that when a bite round is occuring, especially the final bite round people absolutely have to bite their targets even if they have Pact of the Darkfallen or Swarming Shadows. &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Divine Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Aura%20Mastery\"&gt;Aura Mastery&lt;/a&gt; Shadow can mitigate this if used at the right time, assuming they're available since they're also highly useful in the air phase.\nHeroic Mode.\nIn heroic mode, Blood Queen Lana'thel gains a stack of Presence of the Darkfallen for each vampire present. Each stack of this buff increases the power of her Shroud of Sorrow for 5%.\nQuotes.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Icecrown%20Citadel%23.C2.A0Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Sound Files of Icecrown Citadel: Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Dark iron is so strong and heat resistant that tinkers have been able to employ liquid phlogiston instead of gunpowder to fire bullets. Such projectiles travel at phenomenal speed, and can travel much farther than those spat by an ordinary long rifle. A dark iron rifle requires a vial of liquid phlogiston for up to 10 shots. The dark iron rifle is so stable that its worst malfunction is an internal explosion that does nothing more than spew the phlogiston inside out in a brief gout of flame. This burst is flashy but not dangerous, though it does consume all the phlogiston within the weapon."}
