It's about the &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; serves as the starting zone for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players once they've endured the initial rigors of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; and survived their first encounter with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. To take you on a journey through Frostfire's snow-covered wastes and towering volcanoes, we cornered* Associate Game Designer/self-appointed Grand Cheese Taster &lt;a href=\"Zachariah%20Owens\"&gt;Zachariah Owens&lt;/a&gt; and Game Designer/ Champion of Sarcasm &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Shwayder\"&gt;Ryan Shwayder&lt;/a&gt; and \u201cconvinced\u201d them to divulge some of the zone's secrets.\n\"Zone Music Piece: Magnificent Desolation\"\nWhat's the story in Frostfire Ridge?\nZachariah Owens: In a nutshell? Survive.\nAfter a daring escape from the clutches of the Iron Horde in Tanaan Jungle, you, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and a handful of survivors run ashore on the southern banks of Frostfire Ridge.\nThis landing is well-timed. Soon after the crash, you are met by , youngest son of and acting &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Orcs\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the other &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, the Frostwolves chose to defy the Iron Horde and refused to join their ranks. This has put them in a dangerous position, with the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"slaver\"&gt;slaver&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Bladespire%20Fortress\"&gt;Bladespire Fortress&lt;/a&gt; on one side and the &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;s of the on the other. The Thunderlord are eager to prove themselves to the Iron Horde and will stop at nothing to eradicate the Frostwolf clan from existence.\nOutnumbered and surrounded by enemies, Durotan and his Frostwolves will need all the help they can get to survive. It falls to you to quickly establish a &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; and raise an army using whatever means necessary to aid the Frostwolves and secure a foothold in Draenor.\nOh, and of course, what Durotan doesn't know is that Thrall is his son, not yet born in this timeline. Thrall also has a personal stake in the plight of the Frostwolves. This is a chance to meet his parents and his clan when they were in their prime: Powerful heroes bound by honor and loyalty. For Horde players, this is a chance to ride alongside some of the greatest and most iconic heroes of the Horde.\nRyan Shwayder: Beneath all of the strife and survival is an undertone of family. Thrall meeting his parents, the interaction between Durotan and , and brothers who have fallen out of touch. There's a certain humanity\u2014&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;-manity?\u2014about the Frostwolves and others within Frostfire Ridge that really resonates throughout the story.\nWhat is the zone like?\nZachariah Owens: Cold, merciless, and beautiful. The snow-covered landscape is broken by violent volcanoes and lakes of ice\u2014not to mention the mountains made of spires of volcanic rock warped by years of wind and cold. Looking closely, one can see echoes of what would eventually become the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; in Outland.\nHere we get to see what two orc clans were like before they joined the Horde. Both were shaped by this hard land, and you can see that reflected in their tactics, clothing, lifestyles, and demeanor. But you also get to see just how different two clans of orcs can be from each other despite having a shared background.\nIn the west stand the proud orcs of the Frostwolf clan. Led by their young chieftain, Durotan, these orcs have chosen to defy the Iron Horde and keep to their ancestral homeland. Threatened on all sides by enemies and the environment, they hold true to their bonds of clan and family.\nThis is also the home of the Thunderlord clan. Greatest of &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s and known for their mastery of beasts, this clan uses numbers and tactics to conquer animals of all types, from the flying &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s to the defiant &lt;a href=\"gronn\"&gt;gronn&lt;/a&gt;. Their homes are the bones of the great &lt;a href=\"Colossal\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt;, ancient giants lost to the ravages of time. It's even rumored that the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Wolf\"&gt;Iron Wolf&lt;/a&gt;, Warlord of the Thunderlord, seems to have a very personal vendetta against the Frostwolves. . . .\nWe also get a chance to meet the ogres when they were still organized and holding on to the last vestiges of &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;their once-great empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the west, the ogres of Bladespire Fortress have long sought to enslave and subjugate any orcs that dare defy them. Meanwhile, in the north, the ogres of have begun to enter into negotiations with the Iron Horde, exchanging slaves and services to some dark end.\nAnd of course, we can't have Draenor without the infamous gronn. They and their &lt;a href=\"magnaron\"&gt;magnaron&lt;/a&gt; masters control the eastern part of the zone. Part of an ancient breed, the magnaron practice dark, primal &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;s, and act according to an agenda they have never shared with anyone. Some claim that if the magnaron win, all of Draenor will be cast into a frozen wasteland like Frostfire Ridge.\nRyan Shwayder: The zone likes death, bloodshed, and long walks off short cliffs. It's interested in zones with a harsh climate\u2014a land that isn't afraid to be itself. Its brutally honesty, or perhaps just brutal. Actually, I might have misheard the question. . . .\nWhat are three of your favorite locations players should check out on their journey through the zone?\nZachariah Owens: &lt;a href=\"Thunder%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Thunder's Fall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Colossal%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Colossal's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. These two cities are home to the Thunderlord clan and are formed in the bones of dead colossi. We wanted to show the Thunderlord as legendary hunters, and these are the places we really got to go all out with depicting that fantasy. Here you get to see them raising rylaks for air support; wrangling &lt;a href=\"clefthoof\"&gt;clefthoof&lt;/a&gt; for pack animals; and taming &lt;a href=\"boar\"&gt;boar&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s, and even gronn\u2014all being hunted, shackled, subjugated under the will of the Thunderlord beastmasters.\nAs far as other favorite locations, I have to say Bladespire Citadel is a place not to miss. This citadel is a massive structure that dominates the landscape and is one of the last remnants of the sort of power the ogre empire once wielded. This was a chance for us to really show some of the cultural differences between the ogres of the past and the lumbering oafs we know today. Everything from their fighting style to their architecture is reminiscent of their dying culture. Early in the questing experience you will get to lay siege to this fortress with an army of elite Frostwolves at your back and Thrall at your side.\nBut hands down one of my favorite locations is the &lt;a href=\"Crackling%20Plains\"&gt;Crackling Plains&lt;/a&gt; in the east. This great frozen lake is bordered by giants and beasts of every sort, often venturing their way onto the ice in search of food or worse. Here, gronn can be seen marching across the ice, hunting clefthoof or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolves&lt;/a&gt;, in turn being hunted by Thunderlord giant stalkers. Great magnaron stride out into the open slaying anything in sight, their loyal &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; scavengers not far behind them to eat up what remains. Meanwhile, in many places cracks in the ice begin to form as things that were birthed in the dark deeps begin to scuttle to the surface on many, many legs. This is the place that is sure to remind you of the savagery of Draenor and the many types of giants that can be found there.\nRyan Shwayder: Let's be honest, my co-conspirator took at a minimum four favorite locations, which leaves me only capable of listing two locations to balance things out. I saw what you did there, Zachariah!\nFirst is &lt;a href=\"Icescar%20Boneyard\"&gt;Icescar Boneyard&lt;/a&gt; in the northwestern reaches of Frostfire Ridge. Demonic summoning circles, bones, and necromantic orcs really get the nostalgia going and highlight a cool multi-zone story arc in Warlords of Draenor.\nI also really like &lt;a href=\"Wor%27gol\"&gt;Wor'gol&lt;/a&gt; because I've always wanted to get to know where the Frostwolves came from better. It does a great job of showing their Spartan existence in a territory harsh even by Draenor standards. I like wandering the area through the eyes of Thrall, seeing the home of his ancestors as he would.\nI'm stealing back a third location. More than anything ever, I love the crap out of Ogre Hut 01 in &lt;a href=\"Grimfrost%20Hill\"&gt;Grimfrost Hill&lt;/a&gt; for its welcoming atmosphere\u2014not unlike that of a quaint bed-and-breakfast\u2014save for the lack of beds, breakfasts, and any real comforts of survivable living.\nTell us more about the Horde Garrison..\nZachariah Owens: In addition to providing a lot of resources for crafting or portals to capitals, the Garrison you establish at &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt; serves as a hangout for the many followers and visitors you find in your journey. There are many nooks and crannies to explore, some of which might have a treasure or two stashed away from some unscrupulous members of your Garrison.\nAs you level up you get a chance to choose different buildings that best suit your needs. Each choice has weight to it, as what you decide to build will augment your abilities within the Garrison and without, altering which quest lines might be available as well as what resources you have access to in certain zones. For Frostfire, you get a &lt;a href=\"Barracks%20%28garrison%29\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt; that will allow you to conduct patrol missions with your &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20followers\"&gt;Followers&lt;/a&gt;. On top of that, you also get the zone ability Call to Arms, which allows you to call in reinforcements from your Garrison every so often to help you take down a particularly rough group of enemies or an elite monster.\nAs you continue your journey through Draenor, more and more of your discoveries will find their way back to your Garrison. Rescue someone from a cage during your adventuring, and they may appear later in your Garrison expressing their gratitude in the form of unique &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s. In some cases, they'll offer to become a Follower. We want the Garrison to feel alive, and it's the staging point for many of your experiences throughout the expansion. Don't be surprised if special &lt;a href=\"Quest%20giver\"&gt;quest-givers&lt;/a&gt; or vendors appear based on activities you've done in the world.\nOf course, not everyone who comes to your Garrison is friendly. It's important to remember that you are building an army, one capable of rivaling the Iron Horde. As you continue to foil their plans or lead attacks against certain factions, expect &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Invasion\"&gt;retaliation&lt;/a&gt;. Be prepared to defend your Garrison against invasions from foes of all sorts, calling upon your Followers or reinforcements that you've summoned in from Azeroth. This is your Garrison, and you are the commander.\nNext, our perilous journey through Draenor will take us to the treacherous jungles and unforgiving canyons of &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, where opposing primeval forces are locked in an eternal battle. Stay tuned for more!\n\"*No designers were harmed during the making of this interview.\""}

It's about the model change and lore for &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nFortified citadels lie in ruins. Once-verdant forests burn brightly in the twilight of the setting sun. And arid stretches of desert, known to have claimed even the hardiest of travelers, now house fertile oases.\nThe breaking of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; changed a great many things. While the altered landscapes of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; may be the most noticeable evidence of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s violent return, many of Azeroth's heroes have also undergone drastic physical and mental transformations of their own.\nSome have questioned &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s decision to set Garrosh Hellscream into the fiery crucible of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leadership, but none can doubt that this &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; has charted a course for his people that will change the very face of Azeroth.\n\"As the son of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; credited with his people's redemption, Garrosh Hellscream has always carried a bitter mantle of duty to his kind. Before learning of his father's ultimate actions against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh had borne the shame of &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption and feared that such weakness might be found within himself. When Thrall arrived in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; and showed Garrosh the truth of his father's martyrdom, the Mag'har was transformed. Filled with a renewed sense of strength and confidence, he returned with the &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth to be his advisor. Soon named overlord of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong offensive&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh displayed a courage, tenacity, and hot-bloodedness that both impressed and worried other members of the Horde. These concerns were only heightened after his appointment as warchief, as Garrosh has paid little heed to opinions originating outside of his &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Hellscream's ascension has been applauded by most orcs, who feel that his brash &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; instincts and unwillingness to negotiate for needed resources are more in tune with the true orc way. While Garrosh appreciates public recognition, even relishes the acceptance amongst these green-skinned orcs, he has little time or patience for ostentatious displays of leadership. His attention is now focused on strengthening the walls of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and providing supplies vital to his people: food, &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;, and the other essentials for living, which are growing scarcer in the recent drought. If these can only be gained through the blood of selfish Alliance dogs, so be it.\"\n\"Already distrustful of the other branches of the Horde, Garrosh has learned that the various leaders of these factions are more powerful than he had originally estimated. The duel with (and eventual slaying of) &lt;a href=\"High%20Chieftain\"&gt;High Chieftain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; was costly, as it resulted in a civil war amongst the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. The exodus of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; from Orgrimmar, led by a dissatisfied &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, has spread the Horde's once-concentrated military mighty thin. And &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Lady of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, has not been reserved in sharing her low opinion of the new warchief. Garrosh is not one for diplomacy\u2014with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or even among the members of the Horde\u2014and he is only now realizing the price for this mindset. Whether he sets that at a higher value than his vision for an invigorated, purified Horde is yet to be seen. In the end, some feel that Garrosh Hellscream's ideals will bring about the salvation of the Horde, while others feel he will usher in its downfall.\"\n&lt;hr&gt;\nWe'll be examining other key characters' transformations\u2014including those of &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in the months ahead, so come back soon."}

It's about various modes of &lt;a href=\"Transportation\"&gt;Transportation&lt;/a&gt; in \"\".\nArticle.\nThere are various modes of mass transit available to those looking to get around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. While can gain access to a &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; at level 40, collecting enough &lt;a href=\"Money\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; to train the skill and purchase a mount can be an endeavor. Even if you are one of those fortunate to purchase personal transportation, there are many times you'll need to either board a &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;, take the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;, or hop on a &lt;a href=\"flight%20path\"&gt;flight path&lt;/a&gt;. In many cases, you may want to travel with your friends as you make your way to &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, or even out into the world to take part in some PvP. We've pulled together some information on each of these to help you make the most of your time in WoW\u00ae Classic.\nDeeprun Tram.\nLocated in the very heart of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; territory, the Deeprun Tram provides quick transportation between the capital cities of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;\u2014for free! To get to the tram, you'll need to pass through the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20District\"&gt;Dwarven District&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind and &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; in Ironforge.\nZeppelins.\nZeppelins provide free transportation for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. These airships can travel greater distances, including across The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;s.\n[\" List of Zepplin Routes \"]\nBoats.\nThere is one neutral boat that is available for both Horde and Alliance which travels between &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that neutral doesn't equate to \u201csafe\u201d if you're on a PvP realm.\nThere are two different boats serving the Alliance located in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. One of these travels to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran\"&gt;Rut'theran&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and is your way out of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; starting area and into Kalimodor. The other boat goes to &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Kingdoms.\nAn additional Alliance boat in Menethil Harbor travels to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; in Kalimdor. For those on a PvP realm, this boat might be your safest option to reach The &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nFlight Paths.\nUnlike boats, zeppelins, and the Deeprun Tram, you'll need to pay for travel when you use a flight path. This can be potentially costly when you're at lower levels and trying to pay for skills, buy new equipment, and more. You'll also need to discover and learn the flight path which means the long run to each location and clicking on the flight master friendly to your faction. \n[\" List of Alliance and Horde Flight Paths \"]"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nOur perilous journey through now takes us into the treacherous jungles and unforgiving canyons of Gorgrond, where opposing primeval forces are locked in an eternal battle. We sat down with Senior Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Burke\"&gt;Steve Burke&lt;/a&gt;, Associate Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Zachariah%20Owens\"&gt;Zachariah Owens&lt;/a&gt;, and Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Shwayder\"&gt;Ryan Shwayder&lt;/a&gt; to find out more of what this savage land has in store.\nLocated in northern Draenor, Gorgrond is where heroes either rise up and persevere or fall and become carrion for &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s. After your initial confrontation with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; (in for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;), this brutal, beautiful land divided by ancient hostilities is your next destination.\n\"Zone Music Piece: The Foundry by Eimear Noone\"\nAt this point in our journey, players have survived the rigors of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; and journeyed through either the majestic forests of Shadowmoon Valley or the icy expanse of Frostfire Ridge. What brings them to Gorgrond, and what's the story waiting for them to discover there? \nSteve Burke: After withstanding the Iron Horde's initial assault, you'll make your way into Gorgrond with a handful of allies to try to discover the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' intentions and find a way to thwart any plans the Iron Horde may have. It's a perilous recon mission. Gorgrond is a land of giants embroiled in an epic struggle between creation and destruction. It's the kind of place you avoid unless you have a death wish.\nIf you're an Alliance player, you'll enter the zone from the eastern coast, where you'll get your first taste of things to come. You'll immediately encounter an elite group of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; holed up in a hidden encampment, fighting for their lives against vicious plant-like creatures. When the dust settles, your group will join the Rangari survivors and make a retreat to a clearing deeper in the zone.\nHorde players will enter the zone from the west, where you'll encounter the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20Orcs\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt;. These maniacal orcs are volatile and bloodthirsty, capable of extreme brutality\u2014and as you experience Gorgrond for yourself, you'll begin to understand why. The Laughing Skull orcs are struggling to maintain their ancestral territory, but the brutality of being constantly assaulted by the warring factions of the zone has forged them into bloodthirsty savages.\nHow would you describe the zone's ambience? What's it like?\nSteve Burke: Gorgrond consists of two distinct regions, each reflecting the nature of its inhabitants. The eastern portion of the zone is filled with lush plant life and shimmering pools. It seems idyllic until you realize looks aren't everything. The northwest region couldn't be more different. It's a dry, barren wasteland, but with a beauty of its own. Fantastic rock formations mixed with geysers and sulphur pools create an unconventionally vibrant environment.\nZachariah Owens: The forested region definitely isn't what it seems. The creatures here are merciless in seeking out anyone who enters their territory. They will capture them, kill them, and then infest their corpses with plant life or mulch them into fertilizer. Basically, everything in this zone wants to kill or eat you\u2014in that order, if you're lucky. \nWhich locations would you say are some of your favorites?\nSteve Burke: Personally, I love the steam pools and geysers. They remind me of my visits to Yellowstone as a kid. I really like the level design of the whole zone. It does a great job at setting the scene for the events that take place.\nZachariah Owens: For me, it's &lt;a href=\"Evermorn%20Springs\"&gt;Evermorn Springs&lt;/a&gt;. The rainbow, the pristine lake, and the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; homes are a beautiful contrast to the decaying bones and &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s the grove rests upon. The majestic botani move here and there tending to the grove while their &lt;a href=\"infested\"&gt;infested&lt;/a&gt; denizens patrol like mindless guards ready to attack anyone who would threaten the bloom.\nRyan Shwayder: Most of the zone has a really expansive feel to it, but two places in particular always grab my attention. The first is &lt;a href=\"Gronn%20Canyon\"&gt;Gronn Canyon&lt;/a&gt;. It is filled with dangerous monsters and is a barren wasteland, but it's also somehow incredibly beautiful. And the name is a pun, which automatically makes me like a place more. The second is &lt;a href=\"Tangleheart\"&gt;Tangleheart&lt;/a&gt;, a lush jungle where botani are working to raise new &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20ancient\"&gt;ancients&lt;/a&gt; for their armies. The ancients here have fiercely embraced their susceptibility to fire . . . but you'll have to delve into the jungle to see how.\nWhat outposts will players be able to build in Gorgrond, and how do they impact the Garrison?\nSteve Burke: The outposts you build shortly after arriving in Gorgrond will provide a preview of a building you might want to include in your own &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. In this zone, you'll make a meaningful choice between building a Lumber Mill and a Sparring Arena. \nThe Lumber Mill will grant access to the &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"vehicle\"&gt;vehicle&lt;/a&gt; you can summon throughout the zone. The shredder will grant powerful abilities and allow you to cut your way to otherwise inaccessible treasures and areas. \nThe Sparring Arena will provide a &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt; who will fight alongside you and bestow a buff that will increase in power based on your prowess. If you do the entire quest line, you will free up to five gladiators, each with their own distinct buffs.\nYour choice of outpost will also determine which region of the zone you're directed to quest through and have an impact on how you'll assault the Iron Horde.\nThere's lots left to discover on our journey through Draenor\u2014be sure to check back for more zone previews soon."}

If you have a thirst for a good scare or curiosity, then you've come to the right place.\nTirisfal Glades.\nIt will come as a surprise to absolutely no one that the home territory of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; serves as host to a couple of Azeroth's most haunting and bizarre occurrences.\nMushroom Ring: A Haunting Melody.\nWest of &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt;, a ring of &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;ly white mushrooms sits awaiting \u2013\u2013something. If you're patient, you'll bear witness to a group of &lt;a href=\"Fey-Drunk%20Darter\"&gt;faerie dragons&lt;/a&gt; slowly appear around it and perform a ritual of song \u2013 a haunting melody that will linger with you long after you leave (especially if you loot the and add it to your &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Jukebox\"&gt;Garrison Jukebox&lt;/a&gt;.) \nThrone Room of Lordaeron: The Blood of a King.\nPerhaps one of the most well-known haunted locations is the &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;Throne Room&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Walking through the hallway that leads to the area, an indication of the festive reception that awaited the favored son, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; as he returned home is indelibly pressed into the flagstones at your feet. Crushed petal stains give testament to the pomp and circumstance.\nOnce you enter the throne room proper, you'll notice traces of the blood of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; staining the floor from when son, Arthas embraced father one last time \u2013 with steel. If you listen, you will hear the echoes of time whisper to you the occurrences of that fateful day.\n\"\u201cThis kingdom shall fall, and from the ashes shall arise a new order, that will shake the very foundations of the world!\u201d\"\nIf you value your sanity, we suggest you not linger in the voices too long. They have a way of seeping into your very soul.\nDeadwind Pass.\nThe Tell Tale Heart of Karazhan's Crypt.\nThe winds of &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; are ceaseless, carrying the sounds of creeks, howls, screeches and all manner of hair raising emanations. You may already know of the horrors that lay within &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;'s halls, but perhaps you have yet to venture into the mouth of its crypt.\nYou'll find the crypt within &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Plot\"&gt;Morgan's Plot&lt;/a&gt; behind Karazhan. On entry, you can hear the faint sound of a heartbeat. You won't be able to go far (and that may be a good thing), but your imagination and that relentless \"thump thump thump thump\" may just push you over the edge of sanity if you linger too long.\nElwynn Forest.\n&lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; has seen its share of historical events, but on its surface, it seems like a place you could raise a family, but even this place has its share of secrets.\nStormwind Barber Shop: A Closer Shave.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20District\"&gt;Trade District&lt;/a&gt; patrons to the &lt;a href=\"Northshear%20Abbey\"&gt;Barber Shop&lt;/a&gt; come and go without a second glance (save in the mirror) never taking a moment to think much more of the jovial &lt;a href=\"Jelinek%20Sharpshear\"&gt;Jelinek Sharpshear&lt;/a&gt;. But ask yourself, have you ever looked at what lies beyond the warm and friendly shop's fa\u00e7ade? Have you braved the stairs at the back of the room? A quick jaunt to the second floor will have you questioning\u2026 everything. A glance in the back bedroom will have you wondering if the straight razor on the table had anything to do with the remains beneath the floorboards.\nGoldshire Inn: Ring Around the Rosie.\nSeven a.m. seems a reasonable time for &lt;a href=\"child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;ren to be awake in &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;, but something strange with six of them is afoot. Each morning they move together in a bizarre and unexplainable pattern as if directed by an unseen force between &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and a building in Goldshire. All seems as it should be and Skinning Trainer &lt;a href=\"Helene%20Peltskinner\"&gt;Helene Peltskinner&lt;/a&gt; and Leatherworker &lt;a href=\"Adele%20Fielder\"&gt;Adele Fielder&lt;/a&gt; don't seem concerned in the least on the bottom floor. Once upstairs though, the feeling of the home becomes darker and things take on a more ominous tone. Spending more time with these children can be a test of nerves. Those who have observed their behavior at the home report strange noises, screams, and even the voice of the dark god &lt;a href=\"C%27thun\"&gt;C'thun&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nBlasted Lands.\nMysterious Ritual on the Mount.\nHigh above the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Landing\"&gt;Shattered landing&lt;/a&gt;, the strange and mysterious remnants of a what could possibly have been a ritual gone awry sit, untouched and unspoiled by the ongoing struggles below it. Four skeletal remains sit with jars at hand and a shackled pillar between them \u2013 the chains adorned with small metal-worked dragon heads. A basin filled with a golden glow beneath it swirls. No sign remains as to whether their ritual was successful or what was the means of their demise.\nThese are just a very small few of the places that you can find throughout Azeroth. Only the curious and brave will make the journey, but we are sure it will be worthwhile. If you have a favorite location that sets your hair on end, feel free to share it with your fellow thrill seekers below."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nIn this zone preview, we sat down with Game Designers &lt;a href=\"Zachariah%20Owens\"&gt;Zachariah Owens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Shwayder\"&gt;Ryan Shwayder&lt;/a&gt; and Senior Level Designer &lt;a href=\"Matt%20Sanders\"&gt;Matt Sanders&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Highmountain and what you'll experience there.\n\"The location of one of the largest mountains in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Highmountain is a rugged and beautiful place. Here, three &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; are locked in a bitter struggle against the savage &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; that threaten their lands.\"\n[ \"Embed of Soundcloud Soundtrack \"]\nHighmountain Journey Composed by Glenn Stafford.\nQ. How would you describe the zone's ambience? What's it like?\nMatt: The inspiration for Highmountain is a mix of Yosemite, the Swiss Alps, and Everest. We wanted to give players the sense that is the highest mountain, the tallest peak, in the game. We wanted to make parts of it seem almost uninhabitable, with glacial terrain and the kind of treacherous conditions you'd expect to find at such incredible heights.\nBecause it's the highest peak in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, so far at least, we wanted to give players a sense of progression within the harsh environment that the tauren and the drogbar have been living in. We wanted to acknowledge altitude, proximity to the ocean, exposure to the sun and shade, and what season it is. Currently it's spring, so the climate is mild to temperate. Crops are growing, and plenty of food and other resources are readily available. But imagine how cold it would be in the winter. It would be brutal, and most visitors probably wouldn't survive through the season. So there is always a huge effort to stock up on supplies and protect them from would-be invaders.\nRyan: If you're familiar with the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, you might recognize the namesake of the zone\u2014&lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, a renowned &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; who helped defeat &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt; many years ago. After receiving the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20Eche%27ro\"&gt;Blessing of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren here have changed\u2014they have moose horns instead of normal tauren horns, among other things\u2014and we think players will enjoy getting to see a unique take on one of the game's most familiar &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s.\nMatt: Long, long ago, Highmountain used to be the home of the Black Dragonflight. We didn't want to dig too deep into that for Legion, but there is definitely some interesting history in Highmountain that we can continue to expand on.\nBecause the waters of Highmountain flow into &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the area also serves as the lifeblood of virtually every region on the continent. There's a lot riding on the taurens' ability to maintain balance in the zone. As part of that, the &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; tauren established a fragile peace pact between the Highmountain tauren and the drogbar as a means to survive in relative peace. As part of this agreement, they mutually benefit from one another's resources through trade at designated areas outside drogbar caves.\nDrogbar dwell in the infinite caverns deep within Highmountain, serving as overlords of the zone's \u201cunderworld,\u201d if you will. They provide spell components from inedible plants, rare &lt;a href=\"mineral\"&gt;mineral&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s, and other rarities as a trade offering to the tauren. In return, the tauren bring the drogbar grain, &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;, leather goods, and &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt;. They make a mutual exchange at these ritual sites, then go back to their respective homelands. It's a symbiotic relationship\u2014they don't like each other, but they needed each other. We tried to subtly establish that throughout the zone.\nThen there are the &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s. The tauren used to keep the harpies at bay with the &lt;a href=\"%3AHammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;:Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt;\u2014until it was stolen by the drogbar. Now, the harpies have been emboldened. The kobolds offer stolen and scavenged trinkets, oftentimes items that would be broken and worthless to anyone else, and the harpies provide protection for their offerings of obedience. The kobold are very prolific and have now become a noticeable nuisance. It is said, \u201cFor every kobold you see, there are a hundred more.\u201d\nRyan: The Hammer of Khaz'goroth has always been the tie that binds in Highmountain [Editor's note: read the &lt;a href=\"comic\"&gt;comic&lt;/a&gt; \u201c&lt;a href=\"A%20Mountain%20Divided\"&gt;A Mountain Divided&lt;/a&gt;\u201d to learn more], and as soon as that was taken by the drogbar, each tauren tribe suddenly had their own priorities to deal with. The &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; have to deal with the harpies, while the &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014who've always been the jerks of the bunch\u2014no longer want anything to do with the rest of the tribes. Meanwhile, the fishermen and &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s of Rivermane have to deal most directly with the drogbar, which isn't really in their nature.\nMatt: Yeah, the Rivermane have always been the diplomatic, reassuring caretakers. The Rivermane just care about the agriculture and their &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic ways. They're very peaceful, and you'd never see them getting into boxing matches or big fights like the Bloodtotem.\nThe Skyhorn are essentially the wise masters of the skies. They can get to places no other tauren can because of their relationship with the &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s in the area, and help players navigate all the way to the peak.\nBecause of that, the Skyhorn are also the tribe that's sort of \u201crunning the show.\u201d But that's caused some tension with the Bloodtotem\u2014the first &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; of all the Highmountain tribes was a Bloodtotem, and they've long felt that they'd make the best leaders because they're the strongest. That's made them more reclusive, and unwelcoming to outsiders. They also have a predatory side\u2014you'll walk into their area and they'll be watching you, but you'll never know it.\nZachariah: That's where you get all of your Feral and Guardian Druids\u2014the savage bear forms. They were the warriors of the tribes, the enforcers.\nMatt: They're kind of a mix between the personalities of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. The trolls have a very rich and mysterious culture, but it's one that outsiders can never truly know. The orcs are very savage.\nIf you are not as strong as a Bloodtotem, they'll probably kill you because they can't stand you. And if you are stronger than they are, they'll try to kill you because they want to prove themselves. So the challenge comes in finding a way to make them think you're useful. For example, the Rivermane provide them with food, since there's no longer enough to hunt because they killed everything off. But you still know the Bloodtotem are looking down at them thinking, \u201cpathetic little Rivermane.\u201d\nZachariah: All of the tribes had a very strong dependent, symbiotic relationship with each other. They also had a symbiotic relationship with the drogbar that ran deeper than either side would wish to acknowledge. They all kind of required each other, so when a wedge gets driven between them all, it essentially becomes chaos.\nQ. Which locations would you say are some of your favorites, and why?\nZachariah: &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Peak\"&gt;Highmountain Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Just the hike up to the peak is such an amazing experience. You can just see the diversity of the ecosystems there. And there are just some places that are so harsh, places where nothing really lives, that make you feel like an explorer.\nMatt: You feel like you've climbed Everest. You're able to look down upon Suramar, which is beneath two completely separate layers of clouds\u2014sort of like what you see when you're climbing or descending in a plane. That helps further establish the feeling that this is a place where no one\u2014certainly no outsiders\u2014could naturally survive. So when you see those huge, isolated outposts up there in the freezing cold, you know how challenging that outpost must be to maintain.\nOne of my favorite aspects of Highmountain is its cavernous nature\u2014it's not just a solid piece of rock. It's riddled with networks of tunnels, with steam and warmth radiating from its caves, implying potential volcanic activity without showing lava.\nIf you go through &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt; and start navigating the passageways between the mountains along the main road, you realize how deep things go, giving you a sense that you could keep going down and down and down until you reach the coast\u2014or just get completely lost. But my favorite specific place is a cave where you emerge from a tunnel and see all these drogbar bridges that keep going into the depths. If you look down, you think, \u201cWow, there's a whole world within this mountain that is left up to the imagination.\u201d\nRyan: My favorite place is the beaver dam in &lt;a href=\"Pinerock%20Basin\"&gt;Pinerock Basin&lt;/a&gt; where the rapids give way to calmer waters. The river cascades its way down toward the &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; is behind you, and you're surrounded by beauty in all directions.\nZachariah: The zone is full of little surprises here and there. We try to reward exploration in all our zones. If something looks like it's a trail that might lead off somewhere interesting, chances are it does. You will keep finding new places, treasures, and events as you explore.\nQ. Why do you think a player would want to start in this zone first?\nMatt: Tauren are awesome. So are kobolds. Other than that, I'm torn. In one way, it's fun to do Highmountain last, and eventually be able to look down upon other zones you have explored. On the other hand, you could always take the Demon Hunter gliding into Suramar or fly into Stormheim, and have a cool sense of scale based on where you just came from. From the height of the mountain, the possibilities seem endless\u2014\u201cOK, I've conquered the mountain, now what am I going to do?\u201d\nEither way, we wanted the ground path between Highmountain and Val'sharah to be awesome. Same with going to and from Stormheim. We wanted players to feel just as rewarded by just traversing the land the \u201cclassic\u201d way, walking or running on their mount. There are a lot of World of Warcraft players out there who love to explore this way, and we tried to provide them with plenty of those opportunities.\nQ. What is it that will bring them back to this zone?\nMatt: Unlike some of the other mountains in World of Warcraft, if you go mountain climbing here, you'll find that it's filled with playable space and tons of stuff to discover. You'll stumble upon a vignette here or some kind of a camp there, or a story\u2014we really wanted to reward exploration.\nRyan: Sometimes it's just finding somewhere that you're going to decide is your favorite place\u2014maybe just an awesome view. There might not be anything there, but it could be like, \u201cThis is where we're going to hang out. Me and my wife really want to chill here all the time.\u201d\nQ. Is there anything else players should know about this zone?\nZachariah: I would say this is the \u201cexplorer's\u201d zone. This is the zone you go to when you just want to happen upon things, go on a spontaneous journey up a path, or wander down to the coast. Every nook and cranny has something.\nRyan: There's a lot of cultural exploration, too. The tauren here are familiar, but different. The drogbar are completely new.\nMatt: And everything is interrelated. The harpies are in some way related to the Skyhorn. The drogbar have a relationship with the Rivermane.\nRyan: It's like an ecosystem.\nMatt: Even the &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s on the coast\u2014the kobolds would bring these trinkets to the harpies in return for their protection. A lot of these trinkets would fall down the side of the mountain and land on the coastline where the murlocs would find them.\nRyan: \u201c&lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Mglrmglmglmgl&lt;/a&gt;!\u201d Translation: \u201cThe murloc gods have blessed us.\u201d\nZachariah: Just another note for when you're in Thunder Totem: leave the music and sound on, especially when playing through the first time. There are a lot of sound treats in general, and a lot of great voiceover in the right places to get the stories across.\nMatt: There are so many subtle details, and we really wanted to show a visual progression based on an awareness of the geography. We have different types of erosion because of the harsh climate. We considered details based on whether an area is shaded, whether snow would be melted in a particular location, or whether you'd encounter more plant life in an area. There are some cool and rewarding reveals, like a cave where you'll come upon a spot with a marine layer and full sun. Little spots where plants grow and proliferate.\nRyan: Highmountain is really about exploration and discovery. We never direct you to most of the stuff that's in the zone\u2014but if you keep your eyes open, there's plenty to see."}

Reaching their destination will be an arduous endeavor: the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; has amassed its forces near the temple, determined to intercept the Dragon Soul at any cost.\"\nThe final stage in this series of dungeons is set in the present-day &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, now under a full invasion by the Twilight's Hammer. Players must escort Thrall and the Dragon Soul safely to Wyrmrest Temple, where the assault on &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; is to commence. But the Twilight's Hammer forces are numerous, and their leadership remains strong. Those attacking the temple are commanded by a man known very well for the strength of will he's offered &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; citizens. Now with his own will broken, he preaches only Deathwing's cataclysmic vision for all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis world has already lost too many good people. While inhabitants of Azeroth have been betrayed by their most trusted leaders and advisors, others have betrayed their own ideals and morals in search of a higher, albeit calamitous, cause. The time has come. You must act on behalf of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; as a minister of war, battling the twisted future echoes of today's greatest leaders, subverting ancient armies of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and risking your very life to make certain the Twilight's Hammer doesn't intercept Thrall's most coveted possession. Your mission will take you beyond the bounds of time. You'll see Deathwing's preferred outcome for Azeroth -- an outcome through which even he won't survive. You'll witness the event that began the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;first Sundering of the world&lt;/a&gt;, 10,000 years prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll of this you'll do to bring back into existence what would appear to be a simple disk\u2026 an object all but forgotten over the ages. This is the beginning of the last stand against Deathwing.\nStay tuned for a preview of the &lt;a href=\"patch%204.3\"&gt;patch 4.3&lt;/a&gt; raid: Dragon Soul."}

It's about the \"\" Legendary Questline implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nWith the release of Mists of Pandaria, we introduced a new Legendary quest line, available to all &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s. Heroes looking to gain one of these newly introduced &lt;a href=\"Legendary\"&gt;Legendary&lt;/a&gt; items must meet the Black Prince, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and embark on a journey to prove their worth. For those familiar with the &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; Legendary quest line, &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;Fangs of the Father&lt;/a&gt;, you may remember working to rescue Wrathion from the clutches of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Red Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Once free of both the Red Dragonflight and the taint of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Black Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Wrathion set his sights on taking down the rest of his corrupted family.\nSince the death of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the killing off his siblings, Wrathion has set up shop in the &lt;a href=\"Tavern%20in%20the%20Mists\"&gt;Tavern in the Mists&lt;/a&gt; located between the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. He has a new mission now, involving both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nLet's get caught up with the quest line so far and take a peek at what's to come in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.2\"&gt;patch 5.2&lt;/a&gt;: Rise of the Thunder King.\nMists of Pandaria.\nStranger in a Strange Land.\nBeginning with the receipt of a &lt;a href=\"%3AMysterious%20Note\"&gt;:Mysterious Note&lt;/a&gt;, you'll be asked to seek out \u201cThe Black Prince\u201d in the Tavern in the Mists within the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Stair\"&gt;Veiled Stair&lt;/a&gt;. Rogues who have completed the Fangs of the Father quest line will receive a slightly different note and &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Legend in the Making.\nWrathion, being the cordial host that he is, will offer your level-90 hero a drink and a little conversation once you've accepted the quest, \u201c&lt;a href=\"%3AA%20Legend%20in%20the%20Making\"&gt;:A Legend in the Making&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d Once loosened up a bit the Prince will share a bit more about what's on his mind. Much like his father, he has &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and its fate in his sights. Don't worry though, Wrathion views his father as \u201cmisguided,\u201d though he does share a similar concern about the fragility of the world and how the war between the Horde and Alliance must be set aside when a darker and more sinister force must be contended with.\n\u201cA divided Azeroth cannot possibly stand against the darkness,\u201d he says. \u201cThis war has to end. Soon. Before it consumes our strength!\u201d\nWrathion will tell you he is in full support of your faction and believes that the answer lies with heroes such as yourself. To ensure that you're up to the task, you'll need to be equipped accordingly. You'll need to prove yourself before going on to the next step, &lt;a href=\"%3ATrial%20of%20the%20Black%20Prince\"&gt;:Trial of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrial of the Black Prince.\nIt's time to go out into the world, meet new creatures, and then kill them in the quest, Trial of the Black Prince. By killing level-90 &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; (you're most likely already doing this at level 90) you'll quickly gain the reputation with Wrathion and open up the next quest in the line.\nRogues who have done the Fangs of the Father Legendary quest line won't need to prove themselves to attain &lt;a href=\"Honored\"&gt;Honored&lt;/a&gt; reputation with him. Wrathion will consider your previous dealings proof enough that he can trust in you.\nThe Strength of One's Foes.\nOnce you've reached Honored, you'll return to the Black Prince for your next task. He'll want you to acquire 10 &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Power\"&gt;Sigils of Power&lt;/a&gt; and 10 &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Sigils of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; from fallen foes in &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27Shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'Shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt; in the quest, &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Strength%20of%20One%27s%20Foes\"&gt;:The Strength of One's Foes&lt;/a&gt;.\nFear Itself.\n\u201cThe timid feel fear before trouble starts; the cowards feel fear as trouble happens. The bravest among us feel fear only after the troubles have been taken care of.\u201d\nTurning in the sigils will result in a new quest, &lt;a href=\"%3AFear%20Itself\"&gt;:Fear Itself&lt;/a&gt;, in which you're asked to kill the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; in Terrace of Endless Spring and bring Wrathion back a &lt;a href=\"%3AChimera%20of%20Fear\"&gt;:Chimera of Fear&lt;/a&gt;.\nBreath of the Black Prince.\nOnce you've turned in the Chimera of Fear, Wrathion asks you to meet him at &lt;a href=\"Mason%27s%20Folly\"&gt;Mason's Folly&lt;/a&gt; to complete the quest, &lt;a href=\"%3ABreath%20of%20the%20Black%20Prince\"&gt;:Breath of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt;. There's a pathway just past the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Market%20Auction%20House\"&gt;Black Market Auction house&lt;/a&gt; or you can just hop on your flying mount and meet him there. Once there, you'll be able to choose one of the three proffered Legendary gems: &lt;a href=\"%3ACrystallized%20Dread\"&gt;:Crystallized Dread&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3ACrystallized%20Terror\"&gt;:Crystallized Terror&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%3ACrystallized%20Horror\"&gt;:Crystallized Horror&lt;/a&gt;. This gem can then be placed into a &lt;a href=\"Sha-Touched\"&gt;Sha-Touched&lt;/a&gt; weapon. You'll also earn the &lt;a href=\"Achievement\"&gt;Achievement&lt;/a&gt; for completing .\nChapter II: Wrathion's War.\nYour journey doesn't end there. With the release of patch 5.1, the quest to prove your worth to Wrathion and earn a Legendary item goes on. You'll be offered two quests: &lt;a href=\"%3AIncoming...\"&gt;:Incoming...&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Measure%20of%20a%20Leader\"&gt;:The Measure of a Leader&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Measure of a Leader.\nIn The Measure of a Leader you'll speak to Wrathion about either &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; (depending on your faction). Again, being such a generous host, he'll offer you some food. Eating it will provide a buff and reveal more about the leader in question.\nThe Prince's Pursuit \u2013 A Test of Valor.\nOnce more, Wrathion sends you out into &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; to prove your worth in the quest, \u201c&lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Prince%27s%20Pursuit\"&gt;:The Prince's Pursuit&lt;/a&gt;.\u201d This time, you'll spend time earning &lt;a href=\"Revered\"&gt;Revered&lt;/a&gt; reputation with him by slaying members of the opposite faction in Krasarang Wilds. He'll also want you to take on \u201c&lt;a href=\"%3AA%20Test%20of%20Valor\"&gt;:A Test of Valor&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d which will grant you an Achievement once you earn 6000 Valor.\nA Change of Command and Glory to the Horde/ The Lion Roars.\nDepending on your faction, the quest, &lt;a href=\"%3AA%20Change%20of%20Command\"&gt;:A Change of Command&lt;/a&gt; will task you with killing one of the opposite factions leaders: &lt;a href=\"Twinbraid\"&gt;High Marshall Twinbraid&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Bloodhilt\"&gt;Warlord Bloodhilt&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Domination Point&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou'll also be asked to go forth into an organized battlefront in the quests &lt;a href=\"%3AGlory%20to%20the%20Horde\"&gt;:Glory to the Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Lion%20Roars\"&gt;:The Lion Roars&lt;/a&gt; and win a battle in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Kotmogu\"&gt;Temple of Kotmogu&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Silvershard%20Mines\"&gt;Silvershard Mines&lt;/a&gt;. Simply queue up for one of these &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and show the opposite faction your might.\nThe Soul of the Horde / Call of the Packmaster.\nOnce you've turned in the previous quests, you'll be given a new one. Depending on your faction, you'll either get &lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Soul%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;:The Soul of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"%3ACall%20of%20the%20Packmaster\"&gt;:Call of the Packmaster&lt;/a&gt;. Wrathion will want to share with you what he's learned of either Garrosh Hellscream or Varian Wrynn. Once he's finished his observations, you'll earn the &lt;a href=\"%3AEye%20of%20the%20Black%20Prince\"&gt;:Eye of the Black Prince&lt;/a&gt; which will add a &lt;a href=\"prismatic%20socket\"&gt;prismatic socket&lt;/a&gt; to a Sha-Touched weapon and will earn you the Achievement.\nPatch 5.2: Rise of the Thunder King.\nThe Legendary Quest Continues:.\nThe story goes on in Patch 5.2: Rise of the Thunder King and so too does the journey with the Black Prince, Wrathion, guiding the way. With the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; and the mogu, Prince Wrathion seeks to delve even deeper into the source of mogu power. He'll enlist Azeroth's mightiest heroes once more to aid him in finding out what it is. The search for information will take these heroes into the depths of the Thunder King's Palace, and pit them against trials of perseverance and skill. Along the way, they'll unlock the secrets to a new Legendary &lt;a href=\"metagem\"&gt;metagem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3ACrown%20of%20Heaven\"&gt;:Crown of Heaven&lt;/a&gt;.\n5.2 Changes and Things to Look Forward to.\nAs with many patches, there will be new additions and changes to the Legendary quest line.

If you don't have a raid at your beck and call, there's always the Group Finder (I) where you're sure to be able to recruit some heroes to join you. Bosses will only award loot once per week.\nInvasion Points Bosses.\n\"From its stronghold on Argus, the Legion employs a vast array of portals to spread across the cosmos like a plague.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; implemented into the game.\nArticle.\nHighmaul is the seat of power for the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; civilization that ruled for generations until the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. A massive city that belies the ogre reputation for brutish stupidity, Highmaul is full of bustling markets, wealthy nobles, and the roar of the &lt;a href=\"Coliseum\"&gt;Coliseum&lt;/a&gt; crowd echoing through the streets of the slums. Visible from everywhere within the city's walls, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;'s citadel casts a long shadow, a reminder of his watchful eye and iron grip.\nHighmaul is an imposing stretch of ogre-controlled territory located within . The Highmaul Raid contains seven &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es, three of which are optional: The &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher\"&gt;Butcher&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tectus\"&gt;Tectus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brackenspore\"&gt;Brackenspore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Player\"&gt;Player&lt;/a&gt;s will need a minimum Item Level of 615 to enter the ogres' domain Raid Finder.\nHere's a brief breakdown of the bosses you'll find in Highmaul. Additional information on abilities and role-specific tips can be found within the in-game Dungeon Journal.\nGear Reward Item Level Range: 640-685\nKargath Bladefist.\nWarlord of the , honed his combat skills as a &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt; in the ogres' &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;ial games. He slaughtered countless opponents for the promise of freedom, only to be ultimately rewarded by being locked away with the other retired \u201cchampions.\u201d Fueled by rage, Kargath severed his own hand to escape and led a revolt that soaked Draenor in ogre blood. Now, he returns to the arena to teach you the true meaning of savagery. \nThe Butcher (Optional Boss).\nBorn in the fetid &lt;a href=\"Underbelly%20%28Highmaul%29\"&gt;Underbelly&lt;/a&gt; of Highmaul, this ogre may have once had a proper name, but it's since been long forgotten. Abused and beaten from his earliest days, the hardship only strengthened his body even as it broke his mind. Now there is not an ogre in Highmaul who will not give him a wide berth as he hacks away at slaughtered carcasses to pass his days.\nTectus (Optional Boss).\nAn ancient embodiment of the chaotic forces that shaped the terrain of Draenor, Tectus has been twisted and enslaved by the maddened &lt;a href=\"Pale%20orc\"&gt;Pale Orcs&lt;/a&gt;\u2014who themselves barely maintain control over this imposing force of nature.\nBrackenspore (Optional Boss).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dreadnaught\"&gt;juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; moored in the waters beside Highmaul drew the attention of Brackenspore, ancient walker of the deep. This &lt;a href=\"Fungal%20giant\"&gt;aquatic giant&lt;/a&gt; spreads fungal growth and moss in its wake, and is driven by primal instinct to eradicate any traces of civilization on Draenor.\n&lt;a href=\"Twin%20Ogron\"&gt;Twin Ogron&lt;/a&gt;.\nGuarding the entrance to the &lt;a href=\"Gorthenon\"&gt;Gorthenon&lt;/a&gt; atop Highmaul, &lt;a href=\"Pol\"&gt;Pol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Phemos\"&gt;Phemos&lt;/a&gt; are the personal guard of Imperator Mar'gok. Peerless in strength and determination, what these &lt;a href=\"ogron\"&gt;ogron&lt;/a&gt; brothers lack in intelligence, they make up for with sheer size and brute force.\nKo'ragh.\n&lt;a href=\"Ko%27ragh\"&gt;Ko'ragh&lt;/a&gt; was the only ogre to survive direct exposure to a mysterious relic unearthed by the Highmaul excavations of Nagrand, leaving him with a near-complete immunity to all magic. Rumors abound regarding his connection to the Imperator, with some wondering why Ko'ragh would remain subservient to a &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; despite his unique gifts.\n&lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Mar%27gok%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Imperator Mar'gok&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the grand Imperator of Highmaul, Mar'gok is descended from a long line of sorcerers who ruled the Gorian Empire. With cunning that matches his brutality, Mar'gok recognized the rising tide of the Iron Horde and what it would mean to oppose them. He has acquiesced to an alliance with , even as he continues to search for a way to tip the balance of power back into his favor.\nRaid Unlock Schedule.\nTo help you plan your escapades into the heart of this dangerous new place, we've broken down Highmaul's unlock schedule for you."}

Names have power \u2014 learn those of these mighty weapons well, for they will be your constant companions against the deadliest foe you've faced yet.\nBlood \u2013 Maw of the Damned.\nAn ancient Legion axe forged from a metal that drains its victims' vital energies. The soul of its original creator is trapped within and cursed with unending hunger. For more than a thousand years, an old and cunning mo'arg has used the axe to butcher uprisings and consume the life force of the Legion's foes. Over its long and infamous history, the weapon has made its demonic bearer extraordinarily powerful.\nFrost \u2013 Icebringer and frostreaper (Blades of the Fallen Prince).\nCrafted by the Burning Legion to corrupt the world of Azeroth, the soul-stealing runeblade Frostmourne was shattered by Ashbringer atop Icecrown Citadel. Countless souls were freed from the broken blade, but others were not so fortunate. Today the shards of Frostmourne can be recrafted and infused with even more power. However, the spirits still trapped within must first be subdued and bent to the wielder's will.\nUnholy \u2013 Apocalypse.\nVampiric demons known as nathrezim forged this ancient sword, which brings with it violence, plagues, and death. Apocalypse soon earned a horrific reputation in the hands of a Tirisgarde mage who couldn't control its destructive energies. In time the sword was seized by the malevolent Dark Riders: servants of Medivh, the corrupted Guardian of Tirisfal. They hid the blade in the catacombs under his home, the tower of Karazhan.\nDemon Hunter Artifact Reveal.\nOnly Azeroth's most seasoned veterans possess the fortitude to wield Artifacts of legend against the Burning Legion.

Once a member of the Illidari and a sworn enemy of the Burning Legion, he was slain at the Black Temple. After the Legion's leader, Kil'jaeden, revived him in the Twisting Nether, Varedis surrendered to the demon within him, forsaking his mortality. In the process, he and his glaives were infused with great power by Kil'jaeden's eredar allies.\nVengeance \u2013 Aldrachi Warblades.\nIn ages past, the dark titan, Sargeras, offered the mighty aldrachi people a place in his Burning Legion. But the aldrachi proved incorruptible: they slew innumerable demons before their race was wiped out. Sargeras personally killed their greatest champion and seized his weapons. Much later, a demon hunter willingly became the servant of Sargeras' lieutenant Kil'jaeden. Pleased, Kil'jaeden bestowed the warblades on her, that she might wield a portion of the aldrachi's bygone might, and devastate the mortals of Azeroth with it.\nDruid Artifact Reveal.\nOnly Azeroth's most seasoned veterans possess the fortitude to wield Artifacts of legend against the Burning Legion.

Names have power\u2014learn those of these mythic weapons well, for they will be your constant companions against the deadliest foe you've faced yet.\nBalance \u2013 Scythe of Elune.\nThis mystical artifact was created millennia ago from the Staff of Elune and a fang from the wolf demigod Goldrinn. The Scythe of Elune carries a long and unsettling history for druids: those who are not careful enough can easily be overwhelmed by Goldrinn's spirit, which infuses the scythe. Tied to the origin of the worgen on Azeroth, the scythe is said to possess untold lunar power for the druid with balance enough to keep control.\nFeral \u2013 Fangs of Ashamane.\nThe massive gray panther Ashamane, one of the first Wild Gods, was one of many to answer the call of the demigod Cenarius and defend the world of Azeroth during the War of the Ancients. She fell in battle against the Legion, but saved countless lives in the process. A great shrine was built in her honor in Val'sharah, and her fangs were adorned and put on display there. It is said they still carry much of her power.\nGuardian \u2013 Claws of Ursoc.\nForged from titansteel by the titanic watcher Keeper Freya, these claws were her gift to the great bear Ursoc, one of the Wild Gods. He wielded the claws in countless battles until his death during the War of the Ancients. Although his body faded away, the claws remained, and legends say a fragment of his spirit lingered within them. After wrestling the claws away from Ursoc's furbolg followers, a band of druids took the claws to the Emerald Dream, sought out Ursoc's spirit, and returned the claws to him for safekeeping.\nRestoration \u2013 G'Hanir, the Mother Tree.\nThis is a single branch taken from G'Hanir, the first tree, which was gifted to mortal druids by the demigod Aviana long ago. Its connection to the mystical Emerald Dream serves as a healing and stabilizing influence on the world of Azeroth. In recent times, druids have used this staff to hold back the corruption and madness of the Nightmare. As a result, satyrs within the Nightmare are desperate to see G'Hanir destroyed.\nHunter Artifact Reveal.\nOnly Azeroth's most seasoned veterans possess the fortitude to wield Artifacts of legend against the Burning Legion.

Names have power\u2014learn those of these mythic weapons well, for they will be your constant companions against the deadliest foe you've faced yet.\nBeastmaster \u2013 Titanstrike.\nA peerless example of techno-magical engineering, the Titanstrike was designed by Keeper Mimiron, a titanic watcher and brilliant inventor. Securely housed in the heart of the rifle, a relic known as the Thunderspark powers the Titanstrike, harnessing the essence of storms and focusing it into concentrated blasts of energy. The rifle's power source can also be credited to Mimiron, who devised it for his comrade, Keeper Thorim, in ages past.\nMarksman \u2013 Thas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners.\nA proud heirloom of the Windrunner family, Thas'dorah was carved from a bough of the mother tree of Eversong Woods shortly after the elven kingdom of Quel'Thalas was founded. Handed down to the eldest of each generation, the bow was last wielded by the high elf Ranger Captain Alleria Windrunner. It disappeared along with its owner following the destruction of the orcs' homeworld, Draenor, and the subsequent formation of Outland.\nSurvival \u2013 Talonclaw, Spear of the Wild Gods.\nThe Highmountain tauren crafted this spear, which predates the first demonic invasion of Azeroth more than ten thousand years ago. Talonclaw's wielders have fought alongside many guardian animal spirits, also known as Ancients, to defend the world of Azeroth and its wildlife in particular. Over the millennia, these Ancients have bestowed their blessings on the weapon, imbuing it with a portion of their power.\nMage Artifact Reveal.\nOnly Azeroth's most seasoned veterans possess the fortitude to wield Artifacts of legend against the Burning Legion.

Names have power\u2014learn those of these mythic weapons well, for they will be your constant companions against the deadliest foe you've faced yet.\nArcane \u2013 Aluneth, Greatstaff of the Magna.\nAluneth was most notably wielded for a time by Aegwynn, the only female Guardian of Tirisfal, although stories indicate that it is far older than she. She is said to have found the staff roughly a century after she took up the mantle of Guardian, and to have wielded Aluneth in many battles against the Burning Legion. Several years before relinquishing her title, she retired the staff, but none know where she might have stored it.\nFire \u2013 Felo'melorn.\n\"Flamestrike\" in its native tongue, Felo'melorn was borne into battle by members of the Sunstrider family as they proved their valor in the War of the Ancients, during the Troll Wars, and against the death knight Arthas Menethil. After it was destroyed, Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider reforged the sword to be even stronger and used it against the Lich King, trading several blows with the demonic runeblade Frostmourne. Ultimately Kael'thas was forced to retreat, and the sword was lost in the frigid wastes of Northrend.\nFrost \u2013 Ebonchill.\nThis greatstaff was wielded by Alodi, the first Guardian of Tirisfal. He bore the staff into many battles against Legion forces for the century in which he served as Guardian, then stepped down from the role of Guardian, but he retained the staff to his dying day. Upon his passing, the Kirin Tor stored the staff safely away for fear of what might happen if a lesser mage attempted to wield its power without the ability to control it fully.\nMonk Artifact Reveal.\nOnly Azeroth's most seasoned veterans possess the fortitude to wield artifacts of legend against the Burning Legion.

Learn those of these truly mighty weapons well, for they will be your constant companions against what could be the most deadly foe you've faced yet.\nBrewmaster \u2013 Fu Zan, the Wanderer's Companion.\nLong ago, as the titanic watcher Keeper Freya set out to populate the world with life, she placed one of the first seeds in Pandaria. From it grew Fu Zan, the first, and all of Pandaria's forests descended from it. Before populating the rest of Azeroth, Freya fashioned a walking stick for her travels from one of Fu Zan's branches. Eventually Freya passed her staff to the Jade Serpent, Yu'lon, who later gave it to a uniquely clever hozen. The Monkey King, as he was called, hung his most prized possessions from the staff, which he carries with him to this day.\nMistweaver \u2013 Sheilun, Staff of Mists.\nDuring last pandaren emperor's reign, a prophecy arose that a ruthless Legion would invade the world of Azeroth and leave it shattered. To save his people, Emperor Shaohao embarked on a series of trials, taking with him the ancient staff Sheilun. Afterwards, he used his newfound wisdom to become part of the land. He made Pandaria into a separate continent and enshrouded it in mist to protect it. His staff clattered to the ground, where it lay until the monks of Tian Monastery found it and took it to the Terrace of Endless Spring for safekeeping.\nWindwalker \u2013 Fists of the Heavens.\nThousands of years ago, the famed tol'vir smith Irmaat crafted a pair of magnificent handblades. Unsatisfied with his work, Irmaat tried to capture the essence of Al'Akir the Windlord to infuse into his blades. Al'Akir was not amused. To spite the smith, Al'Akir poured unspeakable amounts of raw elemental fury into the handblades. When Irmaat attempted to unleash their might, a great vortex sprang up, engulfed his city, and scattered the weapons to the winds.\nPaladin Artifact Review.\nOnly Azeroth's most seasoned veterans possess the fortitude to wield Artifacts of legend against the Burning Legion.

Names have power\u2014learn those of these mythic weapons well, for they will be your constant companions against the deadliest foe you've faced yet.\nHoly \u2013 The Silver Hand.\nAs one of the titanic watchers, Keeper Tyr bore this weapon in countless battles against the titans' enemies. When one of his fellow keepers, Loken, fell to corruption, Tyr and his allies stole the Discs of Norgannon to investigate the extent of Loken's betrayal. Discovering the theft, Loken sent horrific monsters after Tyr's group, but Tyr sacrificed his life to fight the creatures while his comrades escaped with the discs. His hammer was lost with him somewhere beneath the land now named in his honor: Tirisfal.\nProtection \u2013 Truthguard.\nThe titanic watchers Tyr and Archaedas created this shield when their comrade, Loken, fell to corruption. They gave Truthguard to a vrykul champion who used it to expose Loken's treachery. When Tyr and his allies later stole the Discs of Norgannon and fled, the champion stayed behind and held off many of Loken's servants. A desperate Loken sent horrific monsters after Tyr, who fell in combat. In time the vrykul champion migrated to Stormheim in the Broken Isles, where the shield was eventually entombed in the Path of Kings.\nRetribution \u2013 Ashbringer.\nKing Magni Bronzebeard forged the Ashbringer from a piece of crystal purified by wielders of the Holy Light. This gave the sword strange Light-bearing powers. It was named for its ability to slaughter undead, leaving nothing but ash in its wake.

However, a dreadlord who had infiltrated the order intervened, interrupting their efforts and triggering a violent magical explosion. The damaged staff's power proved nearly uncontrollable. After several wielders tried and failed to use the staff safely, the elite magi of the Kirin Tor hid it away lest it unleash further deadly calamities.\nHoly \u2013 Tuure, Beacon of the Naaru.\nAs beings of Holy Light, the benevolent naaru rescued the draenei from their homeworld after most of its people were transformed into demonic recruits for the Burning Legion. Demons nearly overwhelmed the fleeing draenei, but the naaru protected the refugees with this beacon crystal. Tuure channels the Light's essence into healing radiance, regenerating horrific wounds and bringing people back from the brink of death. Ultimately the crystal was lost to Legion forces on an invaded world. It hasn't been seen since.\nShadow \u2013 Xal'atath, Blade of the Black Empire.\nThis terrifying dagger was made from the claw of an Old God eons ago, and dark priests used it for ritual sacrifices during the height of the Black Empire. After the fall of the Old Gods, Xal'atath was hidden away by cults. It has surfaced from time to time over the course of history, inevitably associated with some horrific ritual or disaster. The blade has a will of its own: it uses powerful Void energies and mind magics to warp everything around it for some nefarious purpose.\nRogue Artifact Reveal.\nOnly Azeroth's most seasoned veterans possess the fortitude to wield Artifacts of legend against the Burning Legion.

The blades are said to drink blood and inflict traceless poison, leaving little sign of their grim work: the perfect tools for an assassin. She used them to carry out countless atrocities while under Gul'dan's control, including the murder of Stormwind's King Llane, whom she had befriended. Afterwards, in anguish, she asked a trusted ally, Meryl Winterstorm, to help her hide the blades away in the hope that they'd never have to be used again.\nOutlaw \u2013 The Dreadblades (Fate and Fortune).\nShortly after the Cataclysm, Admiral Eliza Goreblade discovered a pair of ornately crafted cutlasses inside a recently unearthed wreck not far from Booty Bay. Though the origins of the blades are unclear, their power was not, as Eliza quickly made her name known pillaging countless ships across the Great Sea, none able to best her in combat. Rumors spread among pirates and sailors about the Dreadblades, the most common ones all agreeing that they are cursed, and that if they should ever stop being fed new victims, they'll claim their owner instead.\nSubtlety \u2013 Fangs of the Devourer.\nGoremaw the Devourer, Sargeras' personal hound, claimed countless lives before it was eventually ambushed and killed on another world long ago. Following the hound's death, Mephistroph had its fangs crafted into two powerful daggers that still carried with them some of the potent withering essence that made Goremaw's bites so deadly. These daggers were passed to Akaari, one of Sargeras' most deadly assassins, who wields them to this day.\nShaman Artifact Reveal.\nOnly Azeroth's most seasoned veterans possess the fortitude to wield Artifacts of legend against the Burning Legion. Your myth-forged weapon grows in power as you do, and your choices will change its abilities and the way it looks, sounds, and feels in combat.

Names have power\u2014learn those of these mythic weapons well, for they will be your constant companions against the deadliest foe you've faced yet.\nElemental \u2013 The Fist of Ra-Den.\nAman'Thul the Highfather, leader of the titan Pantheon, entrusted his greatest servant, Highkeeper Ra, with this artifact, which could channel the fury of the storms. Ra used it to bestow life on the titan-forged mogu race, and he wielded it in battle against the Black Empire for years beyond counting. Later lost to Ra, the weapon was ultimately recovered by the August Celestial Xuen, who saw its immense and dangerous power, and chose to safeguard it until someone worthy could take up the weapon in a righteous cause once again.\nEnhancement \u2013 Doomhammer.\nForged in elemental lava on the orc homeworld of Draenor, this massive hammer is connected deeply with the elements, and its true power is only awakened in the hands of those who can speak to the elements in kind. The Doomhammer was long wielded by Orgrim Doomhammer, one of the greatest orc warriors of the Horde, and now rests with Thrall, one of the most powerful shaman Azeroth has ever known.\nRestoration \u2013 Scepter of Azshara.\nA powerful scepter created by Queen Azshara long ago, before her transformation into a naga. The scepter swirls with waters from the Well of Eternity prior to its corruption, granting the scepter great magical and restorative powers. The Scepter of Azshara was lost during the War of the Ancients, shortly before Azshara and many of her followers were swallowed by the sea. Taken up by surviving night elves who knew nothing of the power it truly held, it was buried with an unknown priestess in a family tomb in Azsuna, waiting to be discovered by someone that could unlock its true potential.\nWarlock Artifact Reveal.\nDark Practices.\nWarlocks have three distinct specializations: Affliction, Demonology, and Destruction. Each brings with it a unique identity that is reflected within the Artifact weapon choices.\nEach Artifact is a symbol of the might of the Warlock that wields it. Names have power\u2014learn those of these mythic weapons well, for they will be your constant companions against the deadliest foe you've faced yet.\nAffliction \u2013 Ulthalesh, The Deadwind Harvester.\nThe first necrolyte to walk the world of Azeroth, Satiel, was given this scythe by the titan Sargeras himself. It grows in power as it draws souls from its victims. The Harvester earned its name as Satiel methodically drained all life from the hapless inhabitants of Deadwind Pass, creating a potent magical nexus there in the process. Hunting down Satiel, the Guardian of Tirisfal turned the scythe on her, sending her soul to join those of her victims. Eventually the Dark Riders recovered the weapon and secreted it beneath the tower of Karazhan.\nDemonology \u2013 Skull of the Man'ari.\nBefore the eredar served the titan Sargeras, one of their greatest leaders, Thal'kiel, had unprecedented skill with summoning and binding magics. Driven by ambition, he reached into the Void and was answered with knowledge of dark creatures unlike any the eredar had seen before. Thal'kiel's apprentice, Archimonde, discovered his master's dark pact and revealed it to Thal'kiel's fellow rulers, who banded together to strike Thal'kiel down. After his defeat, they had his skull gilded and placed on display as a warning. Today the dreadlord Mephistroth uses it to enhance his ability to summon and command demon armies for the Legion.\nBefore the eredar served the titan Sargeras, one of their greatest leaders, Thal'kiel, had unprecedented skill with summoning and binding magics.

He forged this pair of swords for the mightiest of his storm-forged Valarjar, but Helya stole the swords and infused them with a portion of her rage. She then gave them to her own champion, who used them to hunt the greatest of heroes and drag their souls away to serve in Helheim.

In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Death Knight\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Death Knight. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Death Knight in World of Warcraft.\nThe first new class introduced to World of Warcraft after its launch, Death Knights came into the fray with an identity unmistakably tied to the Wrath of the Lich King story. The Death Knights of Acherus, their cold bodies lifted from the grave in the Scarlet Enclave, were commanded by the Lich King and Highlord Darion Mograine to slaughter every villager in Tyr\u2019s Hand, New Avalon, and Havenshire, and to sack Light\u2019s Hope Chapel, decimating both the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn.\nUltimately, as a result of such uncompromising ambition, the Lich King was betrayed by Highlord Mograine in an act that freed the Death Knights from their servitude. Under Mograine\u2019s leadership they formed the Knights of the Ebon Blade and began joining the ranks of the Horde and Alliance forces bound for Icecrown Citadel to end the reign of Arthas, the Lich King. Though now free from the Lich King\u2019s grasp, these once virtuous champions remain knights of darkness, wielding runeblades of death and destruction and mercilessly stealing the very life essence of their enemies.\nWe always want to reflect the Death Knight origin story and identity in how they play. The biggest area where we see room for improvement is in their resource system. Runes are a very iconic resource, but their functionality has always been convoluted. In Legion, we\u2019re making Runes more straightforward by removing their division into separate Blood, Frost, and Unholy types. Death Knights now have six unified Runes to spend, with a maximum of three recharging at any one time.\nWith this change, it\u2019s also important that we preserve the existing gameplay familiarity of Death Knights by making mostly minor changes to core ability functionality and cost\u2014we don\u2019t want the Rune change to create a situation where the best Frost rotation is just Obliterate, Obliterate, Obliterate. Finally, we\u2019re reducing ability overlap between specializations, giving each a single disease with a unique trait and creating a talent tree that\u2019s largely populated with spec-specific talents to better distinguish them.\nBlood.\n\"In undeath, some death knights find a special affinity for the blood and bone of the living. They carve into their enemies, sustaining themselves with deadly sanguine strikes, while using the bloody, shattered remains of the dead to fortify their own defenses. These crimson-soaked knights bend the very rules of mortality to control the frontlines of the battlefield.\"\nGameplay.\nThe core abilities for Blood should be familiar, though we\u2019ve touched them up to bring added clarity to the specialization. Each core ability now better leverages that sinister command of blood and bone to fuel your survivability. In particular, we\u2019ve changed Death Strike to cost Runic Power instead of Runes. This results in a more clear choice of resource expenditure; you can\u2019t lock yourself out of being able to heal if you spend a Rune at the wrong time, and also gives Runic Power generation a bigger impact.\nInstead of Rune Tap, we\u2019re positioning Bone Shield to be the primary complement to Death Strike for active defenses to better tie into the fantasy and provide more flexibility. Marrowrend is a new attack which allows you to rotationally generate Bone Shields. To provide gameplay contention between Runes of a single type, Blood Strike now generates additional Runic Power on top of the standard amount gained for spending a Rune.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core defensive and offensive combat abilities for Blood Death Knights:\nTo give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this core rotation, here\u2019s an example of a Blood-specific talent:\nFrost.\n\"Combining martial prowess with supernatural cold, frost death knights leave their enemies chilled to the bone\u2014and broken of the will to fight. Unlike mages who learn to harness frost magic to great effect, these death knights are born of it, rime gripping their decaying hearts. These frozen undead warriors wield dual blades to strike with ferocity and inflict deathly cold upon anyone who would stand against them.\"\nGameplay.\nThe mechanics of the Frost Death Knight are quite solid and we don\u2019t want to do too much to change that. You\u2019ll notice that the core combat abilities listed below are largely familiar. One small area where we found room for improvement, however, is in Killing Machine\u2019s passive interaction with the core rotation. While the automatic critical strikes it provides feel good, it\u2019s often better to ignore its proc in favor of spending resources as fast as you can, as your damage output suffers if you wait for the different resources required for using Obliterate and Frost Strike to become available. Killing Machine now only affects Obliterate, and making wise use of its effect should feel more meaningful.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Frost Death Knights:\nTo give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this core rotation, here\u2019s an example of a Frost-specific talent:\nUnholy.\n\"While free from the Lich King\u2019s grasp, some death knights still embody the ever-corrupting nature of the Scourge plague that once threatened to consume Azeroth. No matter their allegiance or cause, they remain defilers of life; and nowhere is their callousness more on display than when threatened. Inflictors of the most aggressive of diseases\u2014and masters of raising unhallowed minions from the ground\u2014these unholy death knights are vicious melee combatants, capable of striking with the force of an undead legion and unleashing pestilence that would bring their foes to ruin.\"\nGameplay.\nUnholy is receiving slightly more mechanical changes than Blood and Frost, to better realign with their unique identity. We want to ensure that Unholy continues to be the spec with the most active use of diseases. In this regard, we recognize that Festering Strike lost its luster over time and have developed a new mechanic to ensure the ability remains integral in the Unholy rotation.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Unholy Death Knights:\nTo give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this core rotation, here\u2019s an example of an Unholy-specific talent:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We\u2019ll continue our review later today with a look at Shaman.\nReturn to the overview for the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;full class preview series&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "721391", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=721391", "title": "WoW Blog/Legion Class Preview Druid", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Legion Class Preview Series: Druid\", an official blog by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It's about the class changes made in the \"\" &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\n\"Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;class preview&lt;/a&gt; series. In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Druid\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Druid. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Druid in World of Warcraft.\nGuardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life, Druids have unmatched versatility on the field of battle. This is in part because druidism is much more than a fighting discipline\u2014it\u2019s a way of life steeped in traditions so ancient that even the origin of their kind is preserved largely in mythology passed on through millennia.\nDruids harness nature\u2019s raw energy for an incredible breadth of offensive and defensive abilities, as well as to restore life to the wounded. Through communion with nature and the demigod Cenarius, Lord of the Forest, Druids are supernaturally endowed with the gift of shapeshifting, allowing them to take the form of all manner of nature\u2019s creature and access powers as distinct as they are diverse.\nKnown for hybrid utility and shapeshifting, Druids have four diverse and well-established specializations. In Legion, we\u2019re focusing on empowering Balance gameplay, strengthening the cohesion of Guardian abilities and their fantasy themes, and renewing Druids\u2019 overall trait of shapeshifting between forms to fulfill distinct functions.\nMaking use of multiple forms for different situations has been difficult for many years, either due to a lack of access to the \u201coff-spec\u201d talents that make your alternate forms feel strong or because the process itself has felt overwhelming and convoluted. To help solve this issue, we\u2019re taking a new route by replacing Heart of the Wild with a full row of Affinity talents, which essentially allow every Druid to choose an off-spec from the remaining three specializations.\nAffinities provide two benefits: first, a passive ability that is useful at all times, even to your main role; second, access to multiple key abilities to use in associated shapeshifting forms. To give you a sense for how choosing your Affinity will impact gameplay, regardless of what form you\u2019re in, here\u2019s a look at the passive abilities they grant:\nUnlike Heart of the Wild, Affinities are not temporary buffs. This enhanced access to an off-spec, delivered through a cleaner game mechanic, empowers Druids of any specialization to make interesting situational combat decisions.\nBalance.\n\"The elements that carve form into the universe are fluid forces of nature. Some beings seek to bend the power of these natural elements to their will. Druids, however, worship the protecting spirits of nature. Long ago, nature\u2019s equilibrium \u00a0was thrown out of balance, leaving the world vulnerable to catastrophic events, including the first invasion of the Burning Legion.\"\n\"By leveraging the sacred powers of the moon, the sun, and the stars, balance druids access arcane and nature magics\u2014made more potent still through shapeshifting, when the spellcaster takes the form of the moonkin\u2014to aid in the fight against imbalance that threatens the natural order of all things.\"\nGameplay.\nBalance Druids have had a variety of cyclical rotations over the years. The core design problem in all of these cycles is that they\u2019ve forced players into watching closely for UI cues and casting spells in largely predetermined orders. The Legion design is focused on providing a flexible combat experience, where you can use abilities as you\u2019d like, and each has a specific purpose. The Eclipse Bar has been completely replaced by an Astral Power resource, which is built and spent, and provides a platform for abilities to create interesting, engaging, and powerful effects. Balance gameplay will center on maintaining your DoTs, generating Astral Power with a mixture of Lunar Strike and Solar Wrath, and spending Astral Power on either Starsurge or Starfall.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Balance Druids:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Balance-specific talents:\nFeral.\n\"Feral druids also seek to curb imbalance in nature. They observe the fantastic intricacies of the physical world and the delicate fabric in which all living creatures are given purpose. Whether on land or in the sea, in a lush jungle or an uncultivated desert, death is part of the cycle which sustains life. Nature is an eternal dance between predator and prey.\"\n\"As a shapeshifter, the feral druid endlessly pursues a greater understanding of this truth. They seek a visceral connection to the wild, and in combat take the form of a deadly feline predator. Feral druids become ferocious, agile stalkers\u2014ripping, biting, and bleeding their enemies dry. The forces of chaos are tamed by the druid\u2019s primal fury.\"\nGameplay.\nFeral Druids have a solid gameplay foundation that complements their fiction. Design changes in Legion are tempered, and we\u2019re paying the most attention to talent options that provide a wider array of combat customization. Making Savage Roar optional in the talent tree in Warlords worked well to open up gameplay opportunities. We\u2019re taking this approach further by flipping it around\u2014Savage Roar is now a talent choice matched against two compelling alternatives that cater to different play styles.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Feral Druids:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Feral-specific talents:\nGuardian.\n\"Like their feral brothers and sisters, guardian druids attune themselves to nature through the animal kingdom. They commune with the wild to understand how life perseveres through adversity. They know that the creatures who survive are often those built to best protect themselves and their kin. In this, the guardian druid finds a deep and harmonious value in the steadfast\u2014all the while recognizing that sturdiness requires an aggressive stance when danger comes near.\"\n\"Taking the form of a great bear, the guardian druid becomes a massive wall of fur, claw, tooth, and rage, aided by the forces of nature, standing between allies and any opposing threats.\"\nGameplay.\nPowerful themes fuel the Guardian Druid, but the gameplay falls short of delivering on them. In particular, Guardian Druids have had a strong emphasis on avoidance, dodging attacks more than almost any other tank, with abilities accentuating that. However, this doesn\u2019t mesh well with the image of the tough and sturdy bear. We want Guardian Druids to survive through their sheer tenacity, thick hide, massive resilience, and strong regeneration. To this end, we\u2019ve redesigned several parts of the Druid combat ability toolkit to instead focus on those core defensive ideas\u2014health, armor, mitigation, and regeneration\u2014while deemphasizing dodge.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Guardian Druids:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Guardian-specific talents:\nRestoration.\n\"The many gifts provided by nature must sometimes be reciprocated. Restoration druids seek order in the world by tending directly to its many life forms. Friend to flora and fauna alike, restoration druids celebrate birth and growth. Where there is decay, they bring rejuvenation. Where there is abatement, they summon regrowth. Life not only needs protection\u2014it needs nourishment.\"\n\"To foster this harmony, the restoration druid builds a bond with the things that grow, gaining inspiration from the flower\u2019s bloom, the seed\u2019s sprout, the mushroom\u2019s spores, and the tree\u2019s growth. Like nature, the restoration druid perseveres through patience and persistence, the foundation upon which all life is built and sustained. They use this power to mend wounds and provide persistent remedies that keep their allies from falling.\"\nGameplay.\nRestoration Druid themes are clearly defined, and there\u2019s a lot of cohesive flavor to love in how the spec plays. As a result, we\u2019re making minimal changes. Their Mastery had the most room for improvement, having basically become a passive effect. We\u2019ve redesigned it to emphasize layering healing-over-time effects, favoring more engaging gameplay, while also catering to the Restoration themes.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Restoration Druids:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Restoration-specific talents:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Druid class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We\u2019ll wrap up our series tomorrow with a look at Rogues.\nReturn to the overview for the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;full class preview series&lt;/a&gt;."}

In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Hunter\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe begin our early look at class and specialization design with the Hunter. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out a foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Hunter in World of Warcraft.\nIn many ways, Hunter design in Legion embodies our key philosophies for class change. Hunters have a strong \u201ccore fantasy\u201d: they\u2019re masters of tracking prey, experts at sniping enemies with bows and guns from a distance, tamers of wild beasts, and trappers of unsuspecting foes. The challenge with the Hunter class in WoW is that, for the most part, while all three specs deliver that basic fantasy, the distinction between them is fairly minimal. In Legion, we\u2019re focused on better differentiating these specializations to deliver more dynamic and varied experiences.\nBeast Mastery.\n\"Among the most gifted hunters, there are those who have from birth felt a profound bond with the creatures of the wild. These beast masters are drawn to the perilous primal world, invigorated by its dangerous and untamed nature. Primitive landscape becomes home. Ferocious predator becomes kin. Whether in the thrill of the hunt or the heat of battle, beast masters call forth a litany of vicious animals to overwhelm prey and gnaw at their enemies\u2019 will.\"\nGameplay.\nBeast Masters were already in a good place overall, but we\u2019ve refined existing abilities and talents to better differentiate them from other Hunters. Previously, Cobra Shot filled all of your free moments in combat, leaving no time for managing your pet, which should be a defining characteristic of Beast Masters. To this end, and to aid in Focus accumulation, Dire Beast is now core to Beast Mastery, allowing you to repeatedly summon wild beasts that generate additional Focus for you through their every attack.\nTo give you an idea of the Beast Master Hunter in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of a Beast Mastery\u2013specific talent:\nSurvival.\n\"While all hunters feel a calling to the wild, some serve as a reflection of its brutality. To them, the hunt is defined by unrelenting ferocity, where survival means facing one\u2019s enemy eye-to-eye . . . and is always accompanied by merciless bloodshed. Weapons of great range are abandoned for instruments of close-quarters combat. Survival hunters are instinctive and crafty on the prowl, employing loyal beasts and laying deceptive traps to see their enemies undone. For these hunters know that to truly understand what it means to survive, one must first become familiar with the cruel face of death.\"\nGameplay.\nNot only do Survival Hunters use melee weapons instead of ranged weapons, they\u2019re also now the only Hunters that make use of traps\u2014other specs will receive forms of crowd control and AoE damage suited to their distinct characteristics. Survival Hunters will snare and bleed their enemies, fighting them in close quarters with their trustworthy companion to maximize the brutality of the hunt. They have no direct control over Focus regeneration, but instead pool it up during successive Mongoose Bites to further amplify the damage they inflict.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Survival Hunters:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Survival-specific talents:\nMarksmanship.\n\"Marksmen, too, shroud themselves in the perils of the untamed wilds, perfecting the use of weapons that are deadliest from great range. They\u2019ve maintained little interest, however, in gaining the loyalty of the many beasts inhabiting these crude landscapes. Instead, the marksman blends into the surrounding environment, surveying behavior of all manner of predator and gleaning deadly methods for stalking their own prey. A sniper in hiding, the marksman unleashes arrows and bullets with deadly precision, exposing the weakness in whoever\u2014or whatever\u2014passes through their crosshairs.\"\nGameplay.\nThe Lone Wolf gameplay introduced in Warlords of Draenor proved extremely popular with Hunters, and that play style fit perfectly with our vision of Marksmanship Hunters as master archers and snipers, relying on their skill and precision with weapons rather than animal companions. All Marksmanship Hunters now gain Lone Wolf by default, ranging through the wilds without a pet beside them. On the resource front, the Marksman now gains Focus from the use of Arcane Shot. And, as a note for those who enjoyed the previous version of Survival gameplay, we have moved certain abilities, such as Black Arrow and Lock and Load, to Marksmanship-specific talents.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Marksmanship:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Marksmanship-specific talents:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of the Hunter class in World of Warcraft: Legion. This first look should give you a good sense of what you can expect from this series, though not every class is undergoing this level of change; some are receiving updates that will be more subtle\u2014a sharpening of rough edges\u2014rather than the broad reimagining of the fantasy as we\u2019ve demonstrated with Hunters.\nTomorrow, the series continues with previews of Priests, Mages, and Paladins. Stay tuned!\nReturn to the overview for the full class preview series."}

It's about the class changes made in the \"\" &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\n\"Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;class preview&lt;/a&gt; series. In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Mage\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Mage. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Mage in World of Warcraft.\nIn terms of spec definition and overall design changes, Mages lay in contrast to the classes we\u2019ve talked about so far in this series. Mages are in a very strong place compared to most classes, both thematically and mechanically. There\u2019s a lot of distinction among Arcane, Fire, and Frost Mages, with each type of caster specializing heavily in a single school of magic, and each of the three schools having strong themes and consistent properties. Arcane magic warps time and space, and controls the flow of mana; Fire magic unleashes destructive force that spreads chaotically; and Frost slows and controls, setting foes up for devastating strikes.\nThe changes we\u2019re making are more to prop up existing gameplay for all skill levels and provide some quality-of-life improvements. As a simple example, Summon Refreshment now automatically provides you with a stack of food if you\u2019re adventuring out on your own, or a table of refreshments when in a party or raid.\nArcane.\n\"Mages of the arcane are diviners of secrets, balancing the ebb and flow of incredible mystic energies. Unparalleled skill is required to manipulate the volatile forces of the universe. These practitioners push their magical knowledge to its very limits\u2014often to the brink of their own exhaustion, and at great risk to the world around them. Those who master this craft are capable of releasing a barrage of unrelenting power upon their enemies, drawing upon replenishing energies to maintain their assault for as long as the battle demands.\"\nGameplay.\nArcane Mage abilities and gameplay already deliver on the spec\u2019s fantasy quite well, so most changes are in the vein of polishing what\u2019s already there. First, for added mechanical clarity, Arcane Charges are now an actual resource located underneath your Mana bar instead of a stacking debuff. The functionality is still very much the same, but this change should make their accumulation and use more distinct. The one significant gameplay change is that Arcane has a new Mastery, which increases your maximum Mana by a percentage, and increases the damage bonus from Arcane Charges. This should make the Mastery feel a bit more interesting by allowing more aggressive Mana usage as your Mastery improves, and feel more empowering, ultimately giving you much more control over your rotation.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Arcane Mages:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Arcane-specific talents:\nFire.\n\"While any worthy mage is an unparalleled expert in the use of magic and heavily dedicated to their craft, those who master the forces of fire tend to be a little more audacious than their peers. If a threat stands before them, the answer is always to neutralize it in a glorious blaze. A lifetime dedicated to the study of fiery forces only fuels their pyromania, and these mages take pride\u2014even pleasure\u2014in igniting their enemies in wild bursts of flame. Mistake their affinity for watching things burn as a lack of self-control at your own peril.\"\nGameplay.\nSimilar to Arcane, Fire already exudes its core identity, so our changes are focused on gameplay adjustments. Ultimately, you will have more freedom in what buttons you press and more control over the Heating Up mechanic, which is core to Fire Mages. In particular, the Inferno Blast ability was trying to fill two roles: spreading Ignite, and forcing a Hot Streak from a Heating Up. We\u2019ve opted to move the spreading to an innate property of Ignite and have taken Inferno Blast off the global cooldown so that you can more freely and intuitively use it to trigger a Hot Streak.\nAnother major change is the redesign of Combustion. It\u2019s an incredibly complex skill, hard to understand for most people, and has the potential for either ridiculous success or critical failure, with the odds being extremely random and very hard to gauge much of the time. We\u2019re redesigning it into something that fits into the Fire rotation in a clear and consistent way.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Fire Mages:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Fire-specific talents:\nFrost.\n\"Frost mages stand apart from their colleagues, in that their chosen school of magic focuses on maintaining supreme control over the capabilities of their enemies. Mages who command frost perform chilling displays on the battlefield, rendering foes immobile as they bombard them with ice. Often, the blade never reaches the caster before the bitter cold takes hold. The frost mage exudes frigid power as icicles form around them, foreshadowing the wintry demise of those who stand opposed on the field of battle.\"\nGameplay.\nFrost Mages are very effective casters, and there\u2019s already a lot to like about this spec. Frost\u2019s defining traits and abilities are cohesive, the mechanics are understandable, and there are plenty of opportunities for players to explore unique gameplay at a variety of skill levels. Rather than making any dramatic changes to how a Frost Mage plays, we\u2019ve focused more on fixing one particular outlier in their Spellbook: Frostfire Bolt. After removing the fire portion of the spell, it began to feel like just another Frostbolt, and we started to wonder how a spell supposedly combining frost and fire wasn\u2019t just producing a puddle of water at the feet of the enemy. We\u2019ve removed Frostfire Bolt and made Frozen Orb part of the core spell kit in its place, which better lends itself to the identity of the Frost Mage.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Frost Mages:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Frost-specific talents:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Mage class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We\u2019ll continue our series next with a look at Paladins.\nReturn to the overview for the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;full class preview series&lt;/a&gt;."}

In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Monk\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Monk. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Monk in World of Warcraft.\nMonks were introduced in Mists of Pandaria, and their story is woven directly into the expansion\u2019s rich and vibrant lore. Monks bring a unique martial arts style to any fight, and harness an exotic form of magical energy that\u2019s unfamiliar to those who practice other arcane arts. They seek spiritual balance in life and in combat, and as dangerous as Monks can be on the battlefield, they\u2019re rarely looking to pick a fight without just cause. They view the world through a different lens, finding power through serenity and inner peace\u2014then expressing it through artful combat techniques and powers that mend life. Perhaps most surprisingly, Monks are also adept at producing powerful brews they consume to aid them in battle.\nIn Legion, we\u2019re focusing on making sure Monk abilities and gameplay better match the class\u2019s vivid backstory. We\u2019re also looking at abilities that already lend themselves well to the Monk\u2019s character, but whose mechanics are in need of polish.\nBrewmaster.\n\"The brewmaster is a quirky character, though dangerous when underestimated. Brewmasters may seem to struggle with balance as they chug their concoctions in the middle of a fight, but this unpredictable behavior is far from foolhardiness. Most opponents barely have time to process the erratic nature of the brewmaster\u2019s fighting tactics before they find themselves laid low\u2014possibly the result of a keg smash to the head. When an opponent actually manages to land an attack, it\u2019s often unclear how much the brewmaster feels it . . . if at all.\"\nGameplay.\nThe gameplay for Brewmasters hasn\u2019t quite fit their archetypes to this point. Rather than being the tricky martial artists, staggering around with an evasiveness that frustrates their opponent while being a little squishy when taking an unmitigated blow, Brewmasters have been more focused around large absorption shields and clutch self-healing. Our new design approach is to get more gameplay depth out of their strong, thematic abilities. Instead of Chi as a resource, which had little depth for Brewmasters, we\u2019re switching to charges on Brew abilities that other abilities still interact with.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core defensive and offensive combat abilities for Brewmaster Monks:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Brewmaster-specific talents:\nMistweaver.\n\"Mistweavers are unique among those who heal. The energies they channel are mysterious, oftentimes misunderstood by commoners\u2014who rarely travel beyond the borders of their homelands\u2014as some form of folk medicine. But those who weave the mists wield the power of life\u2019s essence, using a mixture of preventative and restorative spells to mend their allies\u2019 wounds. The inner tranquility that guides mistweavers allows them to sustain their healing for long periods of time, and gives them the strength to care for multiple injured allies.\"\nGameplay.\nOur goal with Mistweaver Monks is to accentuate the existing characteristics that define them, and resolve some core gameplay issues. In simple terms, this means we\u2019ve redesigned their abilities so that you can directly use the spells you want rather than having to set up an excessive amount of other abilities first.\nThe most prominent example of this was Renewing Mist, which served primarily as a setup for Uplift; we\u2019ve reworked Renewing Mist to stand on its own, and replaced Uplift with a couple of new spells: Vivify and Essence Font. In addition, a new passive Soothing Mist mechanic gives Mistweavers a unique healing style with variable efficiency, over which you have more direct control.\nWe\u2019re also focusing Mistweavers solely on healing, rather than supporting a type of mixed attack-healing gameplay that felt awkward and ultimately didn\u2019t live up to our goals for the spec\u2014it was unintuitive, and chiefly useful as a mana management tool. Lastly, Mistweavers will now use Mana, not Chi, as a resource, since it reduced choices and restricted gameplay in many situations.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat healing abilities for Mistweaver Monks:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Mistweaver-specific talents:\nWindwalker.\n\"Among monks, none have mastered the martial arts as the windwalkers have, and few across Azeroth can fight with their grace. Windwalkers possess unparalleled physical finesse, and are capable of overwhelming their enemies with a dizzying flurry of punches and kicks. Their skill comes primarily from a lifetime of intense training and discipline, but the power they exhibit is shrouded in more mysticism than meets the untrained eye. The combination of their peak physical conditioning, state of inner calm, and leveraging of mystical chi makes windwalker monks a true force to be reckoned with.\"\nGameplay.\nSimilar to Brewmasters, here we focused on getting more depth out of less complexity. Windwalkers\u2019 new Mastery, Combo Strikes, encourages mixing a variety of abilities, which provides a constant gameplay hook that influences every ability they use and draws inspiration from classic fighting games. In addition, we\u2019ve polished Storm, Earth, and Fire to remove some cumbersome mechanics. Windwalkers still use a combination of Energy and Chi, along with a heavy dose of short cooldowns.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Windwalker Monks:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Windwalker-specific talents:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Monk class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion.

{"id": "721369", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=721369", "title": "WoW Blog/Legion Class Preview Paladin", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Legion Class Preview Series: Paladin\", an official blog by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It's about the class changes made in the \"\" &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\n\"Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;class preview&lt;/a&gt; series. In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Paladin\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Paladin. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Paladin in World of Warcraft.\nPaladins have deep roots in Warcraft lore as holy knights, protectors of the people, and dispensers of justice. Where a Holy Priest serves as voice of the Light, preaching to the downtrodden and disillusioned, the Paladin serves as hand of the Light, defending the faithful and enforcing divine law like a righteous hammer.\nThe niche of the plate-wearing holy crusader is well established in Paladin gameplay, with one key exception. Whether Paladins are mitigating enemy attacks, aiding their ailing allies, or delivering punitive justice, it\u2019s in their nature to serve in the thick of the battle. But while Holy Paladins possess the heavy armor and strong defensive ability themes, in practice they spend most of their time behind the frontlines with the more fragile healers. In addition to shoring up the identities of Protection and Retribution Paladins, we\u2019re adjusting Holy Paladin gameplay to bring them closer to the front, where they belong.\nHoly.\n\"Like priests who serve the Light, holy paladins are devout in their faith. After spending much of their lives in hallowed halls studying divine doctrine, those who pledge themselves to a holy order become beacons of the Light for their allies in conflict, taking up the heavy armor and weaponry of justice. Holding the unwavering belief that any battle waged to eradicate evil in the world is righteous, these paladins stands on the frontlines in service to all others dedicated to the cause. The truth and virtue of the Light imbues these sacred knights with the power to revitalize their comrades. If necessary, they even lay down their own lives to serve as martyr for the greater good.\"\nGameplay.\nWe love the unique identity of the Paladin healer and are modifying the gameplay to better support it. Single-target healing from Beacon of Light remains their marquee ability, but other abilities and talents have been adjusted to encourage Holy Paladins to be near the people they want to heal\u2014including melee characters, when necessary. This is incentivized by Lightbringer, a new Mastery, which increases healing on allies near you. This is further reinforced by the addition of a row of Aura talents that provide a variety of localized beneficial effects, and refinements to some spells, such as Light of Dawn returning to being a cone.\nTalents will also provide players with options to incorporate offensive capabilities while healing. When allies are in need, Light of the Martyr allows the Holy Paladin to rapidly heal them by sacrificing personal health. Finally, we\u2019re addressing gameplay restrictions caused by Holy Power\u2014in which players often feel forced to use abilities in specific orders or ratios\u2014by removing it in favor of making Mana the primary resource.\nTo give you an idea of the Holy Paladin in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of a Holy-specific talent:\nProtection.\n\"The paladin\u2019s tools of war lay bare their motivations. Clenched in one hand is the weapon, a deadly device for exacting righteous judgment. Locked in the other hand is the shield, a symbolic and literal barrier protecting good from evil. Stalwart and steadfast, these protectors are ardent defenders of the Light and all that it touches, and are rejuvenated by its radiance in return. So dedicated they are to their cause that they consecrate the very ground upon which they battle corruption.\"\nGameplay.\nThe Protection Paladin arsenal is already closely aligned with its theme. The primary change is the removal of Holy Power, which didn\u2019t have a lot of depth and mostly amounted to limiting use of only a couple of abilities. Instead, these abilities now have cooldowns to allow for better interaction with other abilities.\nWe\u2019re also addressing an awkward control issue with Crusader Strike and Hammer of the Righteous. To improve control and depth, instead of two functionally identical (apart from the AoE) abilities, we\u2019ve switched to one that conditionally triggers the AoE while standing in Consecration. Judgment is a good example of an ability that is staying simple\u2014baseline\u2014so as to provide a strong platform for talents and other effects to build upon. For defensive buttons, we\u2019ve replaced Word of Glory with a self-focused spell, Light of the Protector, allowing it to be much more interesting and impactful.\nTo give you an idea of the Protection Paladin in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of a Protection-specific talent:\nRetribution.\n\"To serve as instrument of the Light is to hold an unshakable faith. Oftentimes the most dedicated paladins become fanatical in their devotion, instruments of retribution against those who dare defy the laws of the divine.

In particular, we\u2019re refocusing most of their core abilities on short-range combat. So many of the Retribution Paladin\u2019s abilities were ranged spells that they started to feel more like a caster than a melee crusader. A new ability, Blade of Justice (along with several new talents) will impact gameplay significantly, bolstering the inherent Retribution themes.

In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Priest\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Priest. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Priest in World of Warcraft.\nPriests have a strong identity as spiritual practitioners who harness divine power to inspire and protect allies, heal the injured, and cure the ailed. But while this clearly holds true for Holy Priests, these ideas are less fundamental to Discipline Priests\u2014and the ideals and beliefs of Shadow Priests are antithetical to those of Holy Priests.\nDespite these differences, Priests of any spec share one key thing in common: unwavering faith in something from which they draw great power. What delineates specializations is the source of that power. In Legion, we\u2019re going to explore that dichotomy in greater depth than ever through the gameplay for each specialization.\nHoly.\n\"After spending much of their lives in temples studying ancient doctrine, preaching the tenets of their faith, and pledging their full devotion to the divine powers they follow, the most adept priests leave their houses of worship to serve on the battlefield, as shepherd to flock. There, they use their holy powers to bless allies and mend wounds. And while most stay behind the frontlines to aid their comrades, these holy champions are also capable of smiting foes and carrying out sacred justice. They\u2019re also morally opposed to the use of Shadow and Void magic\u2014rather, they are exemplars of the incredible grace and power of the divine and the Light, and even death cannot fully stop their healing capabilities.\"\nGameplay.\nGiven the innate purity of the spec, we want to ensure that Holy Priests continue to have a large repertoire of compelling healing spells. The Chakra system was cumbersome, requiring additional setup to optimally use most spells and restricting how much you could fluidly shift between healing methods. We have removed it in favor of a more dynamic play style focused around Holy Words. New Holy Word spells are designed to feel absolutely miraculous, having huge effects balanced with long base cooldowns. The new passive effect of Serendipity allows those long base cooldowns to be reduced, letting you use them more frequently. Finally, in keeping with the resolute beliefs of the Holy Priest, they can make no use of Shadow spells. Smite, Holy Fire, and Holy Word: Chastise are the instruments used by Holy Priests to inflict damage upon their enemies.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat healing abilities for Holy Priests:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Holy-specific talents:\nShadow.\n\"The Light in which many priests bathe is brilliant and effervescent, granting them immense divine power. But the brightest light casts the darkest shadow\u2014and from within this blackness, a rival power dwells. Shadow priests fully embrace this opposing polarity, their faith equally resolute as their holy counterparts\u2014but focused on shadowy magics and mental manipulation. Like all priests, they dedicate much of their lives to worship\u2014but they derive their power from the Void, straying dangerously close to the domain of the Old Gods. To truly understand such ancient, corruptive influence is to be driven mad. This is the state in which these dark priests thrive, embracing insanity and feeding off of the minds of their opponents to reach terrifying new limits.\"\nGameplay.\nWe\u2019ve long alluded to the Old God influences of Shadow Priests in their spells and abilities, and we\u2019re making that more distinct in Legion.\nA new resource, Insanity, provides a better fit for Shadow, having more granularity and gameplay that emphasizes the immense but fleeting power that the Void offers. Mind Blast, Shadow Word: Pain, and Vampiric Touch will build Insanity. Reaching maximum Insanity will transform Shadowform into Voidform, giving the Shadow Priest access to stronger Void magic, but it is unable to be maintained indefinitely. This should make for interesting gameplay as Shadow Priests try to maintain the height of their Insanity as long as possible to prey on the minds of their enemies.\nWhile not under the effects of Insanity, Shadow Priests continue to rely heavily on abilities that inflict sustained damage over time. Finally, having turned away from the Light, Shadow Priests eschew such spells as Heal, Flash Heal, and Prayer of Mending. Power Word: Shield and Shadow Mend are their primary healing tools.\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Shadow-specific talents:\nDiscipline.\n\"Some priests pride themselves on pragmatism. They understand that light casts a shadow, that darkness is defined by light, and that true discipline stems from one\u2019s ability to balance these opposing powers in services of a greater cause. While these priests possess many holy virtues to aid their allies, they also dabble in the dark arts to debilitate their enemies\u2014always exercising immense discipline to keep themselves away from the brink of insanity. Many would say the ends justify the means; scriptures both virtuous and vile should be studied and understood to protect the congregation.\"\nGameplay.\nThe power of absorption mechanics has created a gameplay issue for healers that we\u2019re looking to address in Legion. Discipline Priests have been so effective in their role of preventing damage that it has sometimes left other healers yearning for an opportune time to throw out a clutch heal. To alleviate that issue, we\u2019re tempering Discipline\u2019s emphasis on shields in lieu of a reimaged Atonement mechanic.\nDiscipline Priests are now more clearly defined by their use of both Holy and Shadow magic, and that extends to how they function in combat. Sacrificing a portion of healing ability and having a reduced focus on absorption spells, they gain a significant contribution in damage. Still filling a healer role in group content, they aim to strike a balance between healing allies and damaging enemies in a unique gameplay style. Discipline Priests have strong cooldowns with Power Word: Barrier and Pain Suppression, along with Rapture, a new cooldown that temporarily removes the cooldown of Power Word: Shield.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core defensive and offensive combat abilities for Discipline Priests:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Discipline-specific talents:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Priest class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We\u2019ll continue our review later today with a look at Mages.\nReturn to the overview for the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;full class preview series&lt;/a&gt;."}

In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Rogue\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe finish off our early look at class and specialization design with the Rogue. In these blogs, we\u2019ve been exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Rogue in World of Warcraft.\nRogues fend for themselves, looking for fights in which they dictate the terms. They\u2019re the shadows in the night that remain unseen until the right moment comes to strike\u2014then they dispatch an opponent with quick blade work or a deadly toxin snuck acutely into the bloodstream. Rogues are opportunistic thieves, bandits, and assassins, but there\u2019s an unparalleled art to what they do.\nAs with Hunters, the three Rogue specializations have long suffered from a lack of distinct identity. What truly sets an Assassination Rogue apart from Subtlety? And just what is a \u201cCombat\u201d Rogue anyway? Aren\u2019t all three pretty focused on the art of combat? With that in mind, we\u2019re making some bold changes that take each spec in a much more pronounced direction. We\u2019re finding what makes them each special and amplifying their fantasy by creating abilities and talents unique to each spec that better align with their core theme.\nAssassination.\n\"One of the favorite tools of the assassin is a pair of daggers coated with vicious poisons. The damage they inflict is deceiving at first\u2014the initial wounds often seem survivable, even superficial. Then the toxins set about their business. Wounds don\u2019t close, and blood loss continues unabated. Assassins begin their work stealthily, choosing their targets and methods of engagement carefully\u2014but once committed to a course of action, they stick to their target until the job is done rather than disappearing into the shadows to avoid their quarry\u2019s blows.\"\nGameplay.\nFor Rogues, no specialization describes itself better than Assassination, which also remains closely aligned with its existing fantasy. And we\u2019re further enhancing those themes through their gameplay. First, this is now the only Rogue spec with access to poisons and bleeds, making much of your damage a little more delayed, but nonetheless massive. In addition, Venomous Wounds triggers based on a combination of bleeds and poisons now to accentuate that gameplay. Assassination is home to the most volatile combo-building. Mutilate is already effective in this regard, but Seal Fate needed some improvement\u2014it now can trigger from both hands with Mutilate.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Assassination Rogues:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Assassination-specific talents:\nCombat.\n\"GONE!\"\nOK, not exactly. The lack of a clear theme for the Combat Rogue really gave us an opportunity to reimagine the spec in Legion, to ensure that they have their own depth of character and a unique fighting style that sets them apart from the other Rogue specs.\nOutlaw.\n\"Outlaw rogues are the unscrupulous scoundrels of Azeroth. Operating outside the law, they bend the rules and distort the truth to get what they need. While they share plenty in common with other rogues, these outlaws have little use for tact or discretion, happy to engage in a tavern brawl or spontaneous duel, rarely patient enough to wait in stealth for the opportune time to engage. To survive in such a world, outlaws must become master swordsmen in toe-to-toe combat\u2014and they can\u2019t shy away from fighting dirty. If blade fails to cut too deeply, the outlaw takes advantage of a concealed pistol, catching the enemy by surprise with a quick blast.\"\nGameplay.\nTo achieve the \u201cswordmaster\u201d fantasy we\u2019re going for with the Outlaw Rogue, we\u2019re giving them several new and upgraded abilities, such as Saber Slash and Pistol Shot. We\u2019re also deemphasizing Stealth, with Ambush being their only remaining opening move. Stealth will still provide its core Rogue utility, but Outlaws are more comfortable fighting toe-to-toe with a sword than skulking about. Finally, we\u2019re ensuring that Outlaws retain several signature abilities from Combat, such as Adrenaline Rush and Blade Flurry. These abilities provide a good basis on which to build new and distinct flavor. A wide variety of talents enhance the fantasy further with themes of the swordmaster, brawler, or even pirate.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Outlaws:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Outlaw-specific talents:\nSubtlety.\n\"Subtlety rogues are the masters of the shadows, and they strike unseen. They don\u2019t have the lethal poison-tipped daggers of the assassin or the brawling prowess of the outlaw, but their acumen on the battlefield and ability to hide in plain sight are unrivaled. Some claim the art of subtlety looks like malevolent shadow magic\u2014but no matter from where their power is derived, these rogues are capable of performing devastating assaults on their enemies, slipping away unharmed to strike again without detection. Most rogues train their entire lives to learn how to walk in the shadows\u2014subtlety rogues were born there.\"\nGameplay.\nAs the true masters of stealthy gameplay, we\u2019ve pushed Subtlety further toward making heavy use of Stealth as their primary combat mechanic. The new version of Shadow Dance allows Subtlety to weave in and out of Stealth rotationally. Meanwhile, Shadowstrike provides incredible mobility for attacking from Stealth. Finally, to further reinforce the matter of their relationship with sinister Shadow magic, Subtlety makes use of a new ability called Nightblade, which applies Shadow damage over time.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Subtlety Rogues:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Subtlety-specific talents:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Rogue class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We\u2019re looking forward to hearing more feedback and sharing in ongoing conversations with the community regarding these and all of the other changes we\u2019ve discussed in this series, and we\u2019re excited to get this information out before our broader beta phase to make sure we have as much time as possible to iterate and carry on the conversation.\nThanks for reading, and we\u2019ll see you in the Legion beta!\nReturn to the overview for the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;full class preview series&lt;/a&gt;."}

It's about the class changes made in the &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nWelcome to the first of several blogs focused on classes in the upcoming Legion expansion!\nOur first big step when we begin working on classes for any new expansion is to decide on our high-level goals. New expansions, which send players to whole new lands and often transform entire game systems, give us a chance to explore extensive changes that we think will have a significant positive, lasting impact on the game.\nIn Mists of Pandaria, for example, our primary aim was to revamp the talent system to give players more meaningful choices. For Warlords of Draenor, we turned our attention to the 100 levels worth of accumulated spells and abilities, full of redundancies and crowding out players\u2019 action bars, and focused our efforts on pruning and consolidating abilities to make each class\u2019s kit leaner and meaner\u2014while still leaving room for future additions.\nGoing into Legion, our guiding purpose is to strengthen the distinctive identity of each of our 12 classes and their specializations. The scope of these efforts includes making cosmetic improvements, enhancing existing abilities, adding new abilities, replacing too-generic abilities with more iconic ones, adjusting rotations to better reflect spec identity, and even completely redesigning some specs to carve out a strong identity where previously there was none.\nIn the coming days, we\u2019ll be sharing more details about the direction of each class in Legion, discussing their updated designs and sharing a look at their core combat abilities. It\u2019s important to note that the base spells of a specialization represent a foundation upon which talents and Artifact traits will be built. Talents in particular will add a tremendous amount of depth\u2014in Legion we\u2019re quadrupling the number of spec-specific talents, which reinforce the distinction between specializations giving players interesting ways to customize their characters to suit their play styles.\nWe\u2019re looking forward to hearing your feedback and discussing these changes with everyone in the weeks ahead, and we\u2019re excited to get this information out before our broader beta phase to make sure we have as much time as possible to iterate and carry on the conversation.\nClick below to head to each class preview:"}

In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Shaman\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Shaman. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Shaman in World of Warcraft.\nFor millennia, since the primitive tribal cultures of Azeroth and Draenor, the natural elements of the physical universe have been celebrated, feared, and even worshipped. Mystics sought communion with the earth, air, fire, and water, and learned to tap into their raw power. In time, these spiritual guides came to understand that nature\u2019s elemental forces aren\u2019t wholly benevolent, but have, in fact, been locked in an unending conflict of chaos and primal fury that once consumed the physical realm. So began the calling of the Shaman, to bring balance to these volatile energies, leveraging their intensity to mend wounds . . . or inflict them.\nThe use of totems is integral to the Shaman archetype, and we\u2019re addressing some persistent issues with their mechanics. For a long time there have been significant constraints associated with totems, like the fact that they can only be dropped at the Shaman\u2019s feet, or that they only have 5 health, or that no more than one of the same elemental type can be active at one time. While these constraints were intended to ensure that totems felt unique, they ultimately drove us to creating strange tools to allow the Shaman to bypass such constraints, such as Totemic Projection or Totemic Persistence. In Legion, we\u2019re eliminating this awkwardness and simply removing the constraints.\nTotems of the same nature type can now be summoned together, allowing you to have Healing Stream Totem and Healing Tide Totem up at the same time. Elementals are no longer tied to totems, but are guardians that follow and assist you. Totems\u2019 maximum health will always equal a percentage of your maximum health. In addition, totems that need to be placed at a specific location will be directly placed using a targeting reticle. If you want to place Earthgrab Totem in the middle of a big pack of nasty orcs, you can do that without having to run into that nastiness or use a separate spell to throw the totem there. In general, totem mechanics are concentrated around temporary effects (either beneficial or hostile) in a localized area, as opposed to \u201cmaintenance buff\u201d cooldowns you need to make sure are up at all times.\nFinally, we\u2019re bringing needed clarity to Shaman resources, particularly to move away from disguising a couple key resources as buffs. Lightning Shield charges for Elemental Shaman, Maelstrom Weapon charges for Enhancement Shaman, and Mana have all been replaced for Elemental and Enhancement with a new resource: Maelstrom. Mana is a fitting Restoration Shaman resource and will remain for that spec.\nElemental.\n\"Certain shaman have dedicated themselves above all else to forging a deep bond with the elements. They have peered beyond the Elemental Plane, gleaning visions of an ancient past where manifestations of volatile energies once raged unimpeded across primordial Azeroth. Through careful study and dedication, the elemental shaman is able to channel such power into destructive magical surges. Through the body of the shaman flows bolts of lightning, as if from storm, and bursts of fire, as if from molten earth. They manipulate the land itself and summon spirits of earth, fire, and storm to their aid. To battle an elemental shaman is to taunt the very forces of nature.\"\nGameplay.\nElemental Shaman already have a strong, thematic ability repertoire. We\u2019re retaining much of that existing gameplay in Legion, while smoothing the rough edges. The previously mentioned switch to Maelstrom as a resource is most significant. Elemental Shaman will build Maelstrom through their Lightning Bolt, Lava Burst, and Chain Lightning, and spend it on abilities like Shocks and Earthquake. This change also allows us to remove the cooldown on Shocks, since they instead compete for resources. Shock usage is now more flexible for Elemental Shaman, such as using more of their Maelstrom on Flame Shock to DoT multiple targets. Another notable change is the return of Elemental Overload as their Mastery; Molten Earth never lived up to our hopes, being too non-interactive and confusing.\nTo give you an idea of the Elemental Shaman in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of an Elemental-specific talent:\nEnhancement.\n\"Intense communion with fire, earth, air, and water isn\u2019t exclusive to the elemental shaman. In many ways, enhancement shaman similarly bond with nature and leverage its power on the battlefield. What distinguishes them in their training\u2014and in their connection with the elements\u2014is their combat methodology. These shaman favor empowering their physical attacks with elemental energies and facing their adversaries up close. They don\u2019t shy from the frontlines, wielding magically augmented weapons, potent elemental attacks, and totems that shape the tide of battle.\"\nGameplay.\nThe identity of the Enhancement Shaman is cool, but we don\u2019t feel that the mechanics do well to establish that. We want this spec to be more than a melee-range Elemental Shaman, while having a distinct \u201cBattle Mage\u201d feel. Enhancement\u2019s niche focuses on dishing out devastating spells and punishing strikes at melee range to destroy their enemy. Rather than leaving you with a multitude of buttons, many of which are inconsequential, we\u2019re emphasizing empowering your weapons and allies in the fray. Enhancement Shaman become increasingly deadly as they build their power through Maelstrom generation. They must be careful not to let it overflow, while maintaining enough to utilize their most dominant attacks at critical moments.\nTo give you an idea of the Enhancement Shaman in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of an Enhancement-specific talent:\nRestoration.\n\"Some shaman find a serene affinity for the restorative properties of water. These shaman do not necessarily seek the Light or turn to the divine, yet they feel a profound spiritual connection with the source from which all mortal life took root. So strong is their connection with water that the shaman is able to restore life and heal afflictions. They balance this with a command of the other elements, finding harmony in nature and purifying their allies as a tidal surge washes across a sandy shore.\"\nGameplay.\nRestoration mechanics are informed well by the themes of the spec, and we want to avoid disrupting what healers already like about it. What has changed has primarily been in terms of tweaking their gameplay in more fun directions. There\u2019s now slightly more emphasis on targeted healing, and slightly less on Chain Heal spam. We\u2019ve also significantly improved their talents, offering more impactful and varied options. Additionally, Restoration gains the most from the removal of totem restrictions.\nTo give you an idea of the Restoration Shaman in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of a Restoration-specific talent:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion.

In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Warlock\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Warlock. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Warlock in World of Warcraft.\nWarlocks are the most volatile and insatiable of spellcasters. Though they often pledge themselves to the service of noble causes and are not innately evil, their desire to understand darker magics and exercise unwavering command over demonic forces breeds mistrust among even their closest allies.\nWarlocks peer into the Void without hesitation, leveraging the chaos they glimpse within to devastating ends in battle\u2014their greatest abilities are fueled by the souls they\u2019ve harvested from their victims. They exploit powerful Shadow magic to manipulate and degrade the minds and bodies of their enemies. They employ Fire magic, dropping hellish rain from the sky, to immolate the opposition. They summon and command indomitable demons from the Twisting Nether to do their bidding, or even to be sacrificed as the Warlock sees fit, empowering and protecting the dark caster from harm.\nThe foundation of the Warlock class has been long and well established in Warcraft lore. However, while Affliction and Destruction Warlocks have maintained consistent, distinguished fantasies, the core identity of the Demonology Warlock has strayed too far from its roots in recent years. A primary goal for Warlocks in Legion is to accentuate the existing motifs for Affliction and Destruction, while returning Demonology back to its roots of summoning, utilizing, and empowering demons.\nWarlock resources have also become too cumbersome, causing confusion that outweighed their depth. To this end, we\u2019re going to once again standardize Warlocks on their most class-defining resources: Mana and Soul Shards. Finally, demons have always served various utility purposes, but most of them are very niche, while the same one or two demons see the vast majority of limelight. We want to re-incentivize demon variety, strengthening the various utilities that each demon supplies, and causing some demons to be favored based on the Warlock\u2019s spec.\nAffliction.\n\"Affliction warlocks are masters of shadow-touched powers, but unlike shadow priests\u2014deadliest when pushed to the brink of insanity\u2014these warlocks delight in using fel forces to cause intense pain and suffering in others. They revel in corrupting minds and agonizing souls, leaving enemies in a state of torment that would see them undone in due time. Even the most battle-hardened warriors can be deceived, landing blow after blow against the warlock, only to succumb to their suffering as their very vitality is siphoned away by the dark spellcaster.\"\nGameplay.\nAffliction Warlocks\u2019 gameplay has always aligned well with their character, but in terms of abilities, we want to avoid the feeling that DoTs are amplifiers for your channeled single-target damage. Applying spells that do damage over time is very core to Affliction, so we want to reinforce these spells as the primary source of damage, with other \u201cfiller\u201d spells feeling more secondary. We\u2019re adjusting the Affliction rotation so that DoTs are stronger, and your focus is more on figuring out how best to juggle those DoTs to maximize damage output.\nMechanically, we\u2019re altering how Soul Shards are generated and spent, in part to better deliver on the more DoT-driven damage. Soul Shards are now generated by each Agony you have up on your targets, instead of only by your most recent Corruption cast, to favor placing DoTs on several targets rapidly (multi-dotting). You\u2019ll then spend Soul Shards on an extremely strong DoT in Unstable Affliction, reinforcing the focus on DoTs.\nFinally, in keeping with the Affliction theme, Drain Life serves as the main filler spell, instead of Malefic Grasp or Drain Soul. This better matches the Affliction identity because its damage stays secondary to the DoTs, which should be the primary focus of damage, instead of dwarfing them. It also adds significant self-healing, further playing to the Affliction motif.\nTo give you an idea of the Affliction Warlock in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of an Affliction-specific talent:\nDemonology.\n\"By their very nature, demons are leeches on the living universe\u2014but the demonologist has mastered harnessing the power of these malefic beings on the field of battle. Warlocks harvest the souls of their defeated enemies; those specialized in the ways of demonology use this life essence to tap into the Void, pulling all manner of abomination from the chaos of the Twisting Nether. While such a practice is often considered by outsiders to be wicked and reckless, the demonologist maintains absolute control over the summoned creatures. These malignant entities are fully beholden to\u2014and empowered by\u2014the will of the warlock, until banished to the realm from whence they came.\"\nGameplay.\nWhile all Warlocks maintain the power to summon demons, Demonology is distinguished by the ability to call forth waves of demons to overwhelm the opposition, and also to further empower the demons they summon. Over the years we strayed too far from this design, to the extent that Demonology gameplay was defined more by the Warlock becoming a demon. Legion provides a fitting opportunity for us to realign the spec around its core function of mastering control of demons, not transforming into them.\nWe also recognize that Demonology had a large array of intertwined mechanics that weren\u2019t intuitive, and they\u2019ve undergone a greater degree of redesign as a result. For those who played Demonology during Warlords of Draenor, the gameplay will feel quite different in Legion. Beta test feedback will be essential in helping us to ensure that the new spec feels strong and enjoyable and that we\u2019ve accomplished our goal of returning Demonology to its foundations.\nTo give you an idea of the Demonology Warlock in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of a Demonology-specific talent:\nDestruction.\n\"Warlocks who command the power of destruction favor incantations of pure chaos and aggression in battle. In this regard, they\u2019d find a stronger kinship with fire mages than warlocks of other disciplines\u2014if not for their propensity to make use of magic deemed detestable by all mage orders. The destruction warlock is well-versed in discharging a dizzying array of shadow, fel, fire, and chaos magics upon opponents that rattle souls and conflagrate bodies. They require little motivation for the havoc they wreak, happy to revel in the destruction they cause\u2014thrilled at any opportunity to watch the world erupt in discord around them. \"\nGameplay.\nDestruction mechanics are in a solid place overall and are already a good match thematically, so we\u2019re taking the opportunity in Legion to provide additional polish on existing gameplay. While resource mechanic functionality isn\u2019t being drastically overhauled, we\u2019ve changed Burning Embers back to Soul Shards. Not only does this return consistency across all Warlock specs, it also reestablishes the Soul Shard as the iconic source of Warlock power.\nTo give you an idea of the Destruction Warlock in action, here\u2019s a basic look at their core combat abilities:\nAdditionally, to provide a glimpse at how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s one example of a Destruction-specific talent:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We\u2019ll continue our review later today with a look at Death Knights and Shaman.\nReturn to the overview for the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;full class preview series&lt;/a&gt;."}

It's about the class changes made in the \"\" &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\n\"Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;class preview&lt;/a&gt; series. In this entry, we\u2019re exploring the Warrior\u2014to find out what\u2019s in store for a different class, check out the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;overview&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nWe continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Warrior. In these blogs, we\u2019ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion\u2019s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization\u2014laying the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let\u2019s delve into what it means to be a Warrior in World of Warcraft.\nWarriors are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.\nWarriors are thematically informed by our own history, dating back to ancient clashes when close-quarters, shield-and-sword combat was the backbone of battlefield strategy. Warriors in WoW are steeped in this tradition, with each specialization filling distinct niches.\nOne notable goal we have for Warriors in Legion is to significantly expand their customizability through talents, especially for Arms and Fury. If the below core abilities seem sparse, it\u2019s to leave room for more from talents than ever before. Both specs now have five rows of core throughput talents (mostly different between Arms and Fury, too), with a strong mix of active rotational abilities, passives, procs, cooldowns, and other interesting effects. You\u2019ll find old favorites like Overpower, Heroic Strike, and Opportunity Strikes, returning classics like Avatar, Dragon Roar, and Storm Bolt, along with a host of brand new talents. We look forward to seeing the combinations that you put together.\nArms.\n\"Across culture and kingdom, men and women who demonstrate great physical aptitude are transformed into mighty warriors through tests of strength, endurance, and fighting capability. Their friendships are forged not in the classroom, tavern, or workshop, but in the dueling pits and on the arena floor. As a childhood of sparring defines a warrior\u2019s destiny, so too does one\u2019s choice of weapon determine their role on the battlefield. Arms warriors gravitate toward two-handed weapons instinctively. It\u2019s more than a matter of preference\u2014it speaks to the character of the wielder. Arms warriors are patient in a fight, waiting to capitalize on moments when an opponent is left exposed. Two-handed weapons allow them to deliver devastating, overpowering blows, fully exploiting their enemies\u2019 weaknesses.\"\nGameplay.\nThe defining character traits of Arms Warriors already mesh well with their gameplay, but there\u2019s room for more flavor. In Legion we\u2019ve opened up a wider variety of potential gameplay styles based on your talent choices, as discussed above. We also replaced their Mastery with Colossal Might, which increases the effectiveness of Colossus Smash, playing into their theme more directly. As before, Arms Warrior Rage generation comes from auto-attacks.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Arms Warriors:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Arms-specific talents:\nFury.\n\"On the battlefield and in the arena, the most feared combatants are often the furious berserkers who lust for battle and thirst for blood. Through a lifetime of training and sparring, these merciless warriors have become masters of carnage\u2014often wielding a weapon in each hand to maximize the destruction. Even without the protection of a shield, the fury warrior leaves little opportunity for an opponent to strike without suffering grievous wounds in return\u2014delivered in a whirlwind of blades that dooms anyone its wake. Brute force becomes a breathtaking display when fury warriors relentlessly dive into the fray.\"\nGameplay.\nFury is a thematically grandiose take on the classic warrior archetype, and in Legion we want the gameplay to convey this better. To help deliver on the fantasy of a relentless death-dealer, we\u2019ve bolstered their gameplay around quickly building Rage and then going wild with Rampage. In particular, Enrage is now considerably more powerful, doubling your attack speed (and thus Rage generation, since the majority of Rage is still generated by auto-attacks), along with increasing damage based on Mastery. Similar to Arms, a multitude of talent options will expand your combat abilities in a wide variety of ways.\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Fury Warriors:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Fury-specific talents:\nProtection.\n\"Like their counterparts, protection warriors are virtually bred for physical dominance, having been raised in the art of close-quarters combat\u2014but their measured approach to battle is what distinguishes them from their comrades-in-arms. They demonstrate an uncanny knack for blade and shield, nullifying an opponent\u2019s advances and creating opportunities for counterattacks. For the protection warrior, being the toughest soldier on the front means nothing if allies are left vulnerable to the enemy\u2019s attack. Stalwart defenders are integral to the success of any military campaign\u2014the protection warrior seeks to be an unbreakable wall.\"\nGameplay.\n\"Protection gameplay ties strongly to Warrior lore and exemplifies the very foundation of the tank role in the game, so we\u2019re primarily focused on fine-tuning their mechanics. Shield Block and Shield Barrier in particular often created a trap choice for players. We\u2019ve replaced Shield Barrier with a new ability, Ignore Pain, which massively reduces damage taken (up to a cap based on maximum health) and functions as your primary defensive Rage-spender. It doesn\u2019t compete as much with Shield Block, and thus provides you with distinct tools in your arsenal to apply to different situations. In terms of Rage, Protection Warriors now primarily generate Rage through taking damage, supplemented by a baseline Rage income from ability usage. This plays well with Ignore Pain as their primary Rage-spender; it\u2019s most useful when you\u2019re taking a lot of damage, which is also when you\u2019ll have a lot of Rage to use on it.\"\nHere\u2019s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Protection Warriors:\nAdditionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here\u2019s an example of one of their Protection-specific talents:\nWe hope you\u2019ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Warrior class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We\u2019ll continue our series later today with a look at Monks and Druids.\nReturn to the overview for the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Class%20Preview%20Series\"&gt;full class preview series&lt;/a&gt;."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt; found in .\nArticles.\nVault of the Wardens &amp; Assault on Violet Hold.\nMany challenges await the heroes of Azeroth in Legion, and among the most dangerous are the dungeons found in and around the Broken Isles. In this preview, we take a look at two of the expansion\u2019s new dungeons: Vault of the Wardens and Assault on Violet Hold.\nVault of the Wardens.\n\"This secret Warden facility was carved into the mountainside deep in Azsuna, and sealed with magical wards both to keep intruders out and to ensure that the terrors locked within could never escape. Many of the most dangerous foes the Wardens have encountered were locked away within the Vault, but in the aftermath of Cordana\u2019s betrayal and the Legion\u2019s attack, those creatures now roam the halls freely.\"\nThe Vault of the Wardens is broken up into three floors, where the dungeon\u2019s five bosses dwell:\nThe Warden\u2019s Court.\nTirathon Saltheril \u2013 Once ally to the Master, Tirathon made a bargain with the Legion in exchange for more power. Embittered after years of imprisonment, Tirathon is eager to dole out pain and suffering to whomever crosses his path. If that happens to be one of his former captors, then so much the better.\nVault of the Wardens.\nInquisitor Tormentorum \u2013 Of all the foul creatures that serve the Legion, the hooded inquisitors are perhaps the most mysterious, and the most menacing. Tormentorum arrived in the aftermath of the initial assault upon the Vault. As he drifts through its halls, his gaze piercing the shadows in search of some vital secret, and even other demons give him a wide berth.\nGlazer \u2013 Like many demons of this type, Glazer can focus his gaze into a potent weapon against his enemies. The Wardens discovered that the creature's magical emissions could be reflected back to their source to debilitating effect. They used this knowledge to ensnare the demon and crafted a special prison of mirrors to contain its power\u2014until now.\nAsh'golm \u2013 Ash'golm was one of Ragnaros' lieutenants who burned a violent scar across the forests of Kalimdor before the Wardens finally managed to bind him. Unable to fully destroy Ash'golm, the Wardens locked him in a prison of ice. Unfortunately, the recent incursion by the Legion has weakened the countermeasures that kept Ash'golm frozen all these years. . . .\nVault of the Betrayer.\nCordana Felsong \u2013 Traitor. Betrayer. Outcast. Cordana was among the vanguard that pursued Garrosh into the Dark Portal, fighting by Khadgar's side and working to thwart the influence of the Shadow Council. But Gul'dan's dark sorcery wormed its way into her heart, turning her into the warlock's ultimate pawn. Once a paragon of duty, she will now forever be known as the instrument of the Wardens' undoing.\nAssault on Violet Hold.\n\"In the aftermath of the Northrend campaign and the Blue Dragonflight\u2019s attack on this Dalaran prison, the Violet Hold was repaired and its cells were repurposed to house some of the most dangerous servants of the Lich King. Now, as Dalaran floats above the Broken Isles as the flagship of the war against the Legion, a shadowy threat once again seeks to strike at the Kirin Tor from within. \"\nLocated within the floating city of Dalaran\u2014recently relocated to the Broken Isles\u2014the Violet Hold now houses some new prisoners who are looking for a little payback on the Kirin Tor.\nWhile there are eight possible bosses to fight in the Violet Hold, you\u2019ll encounter a different set of three each time you venture into the dungeon. \nMillificent Manastorm \u2013 An engineering genius of undeniable prowess, Millifecent Manastorm seems to be the complete opposite of her husband Millhouse. Smart and resourceful, she is a force to be reckoned with.\nBlood-Princess Thal\u2019ena \u2013 Blood-Princess Thal\u2019ena is the daughter of the powerful San\u2019layn Queen Lana\u2019thel. She has been locked inside the Violet Hold since the Northrend campaign, suffering the gnawing pain of her eternal hunger. Now that her cell has been opened, she intends to feed on the world.\nFesterface \u2013 Professor Putricide had many experiments seized when Icecrown Citadel fell. At best guess, Festerface appears to be a failed prototype that predated the construction of the professor\u2019s two most notorious creations: Rotface and Festergut.\n\"Anub\u2019esset \u2013\"' Anub\u2019esset, one of the few remaining ancient Nerubian crypt lords, was captured by the Kirin Tor durning the invasion of Icecrown Citadel and imprisoned in the Violet Hold. Set free during the Legion\u2019s invasion, his thoughts turn only to revenge against the living.\nMindflayer Kaahrj \u2013 This eldritch creature was captured in the depths of Ulduar, ensnared as it lapsed into a catatonic state after the defeat of Yogg-Saron. Since Dalaran arrived at the Broken Isles, the monstrosity has mysteriously awakened, and only the powerful wards of the Violet Hold keep its powers in check.\nShivermaw \u2013 Rumored to be one of Sindragosa\u2019s own brood, this fearsome frost wyrm was captured from the Frostwing Halls of Icecrown Citadel, where the forces of the Lich King labored to create these winged abominations.\nSael\u2019orn \u2013 The origins of these arachnid demons are not fully understood. Scholars who have studied the Legion speculate that they are the remnants of a forgotten race on a world long ago conquered by the armies of Sargeras. Sael\u2019orn is a particularly vicious specimen, and has been tasked with leading the infiltration of Dalaran.\nFel Lord Betrug \u2013 This ruthless Legion commander stands ready to lead an invasion of Dalaran from within its walls.\nEye of Azshara and Neltharion\u2019s Lair.\nMany challenges await the heroes of Azeroth in Legion, and among the most dangerous are the dungeons found in and around the Broken Isles. In this preview, we take a look at two more of the expansion\u2019s new dungeons: Eye of Azshara and Neltharion\u2019s Lair. \nEye of Azshara.\n\"Amidst outlying shoals off the coast of Azsuna, an ancient source of power lies beneath the waves. Long ago, the power of Queen Azshara extended throughout these lands, and the naga seeking the Tidestone of Gloganneth still act at her behest. As clouds roll in and the air crackles with the energy of an approaching storm, Azshara\u2019s followers prepare to summon an incarnation of her wrath to lay waste to the land. \"'\nThe Eye of Azshara is an outdoor dungeon with five bosses located along its coastal area:\nSerpentrix: The naga camped at the Eye of Azshara keep a healthy distance from its northern reaches. An ancient scaled beast makes its home in the shallows there, occasionally bursting forth with one of its many snakelike necks to devour nearby prey.\nKing Deepbeard: Sailors tell of a behemoth that strides the ocean floor, surging from the deptsh to tear vessels apart with his bare hands. They say he wears the intact prow of a ship as a pauldron \u2014 as a trophy. Most listeners dismiss these reports as fools\u2019 tales, the product of too much grog.\nWarlord Parjesh: This fierce commander oversees the military might of the naga that have overrun Azsuna in search of the Tidestone of Golgonnath. He is second only to Athissa among the Hatecoil, and commands obedience with an equal measure of fear and respect.\nLady Hatecoil: This naga sea witch hails from a long line of Hatecoil nobility, favored by Queen Azshara herself. The waves and the skies heed her call, as she harnesses their power to crush any who would oppose the Hatecoils.\nWrath of Azshara: One of Azshara\u2019s most loyal handmaidens offered herself willingly to her Queen to serve as the instrument of her vengeance. Summoned by Hatecoil channelers as a last resort after Parjesh\u2019s failure, the terrifying Wrath of Azshara exists to wash away all landwalkers who would stand against her.\nNeltharion\u2019s Lair.\nLocated within Highmountain Neltharion\u2019s Lair takes you into the craggy depths of what was once Deathwing\u2019s lair.\nRokmora: Ularogg Cragshaper\u2019s unfinished masterpiece, Rokmora,is a massive crystal fury constructed to annihilate all who stand against the Underking. The wild magic used to create this behemoth has yet to take hold imbuing any piece of Rokmora, attached or not, with Ularogg\u2019s malevolent will to crush his enemies.\nUlarogg Cragshaper: Ularogg Cragshaper, is an ancient drogbar who has committed his life to the pursuit of power. Through violence and deception, Ularogg rose to become the Underking\u2019s trusted advisor. He detests Navarogg for bringing \u201cintruders\u201d into their home and will take pleasure in bringing about their violent end.\nNaraxas: Naraxas, mother of monsters, has been worshipped by the drogbar since the Age of Neltharion. Constant sacrifices are made to this creature so she can nurture the generations of horrors the drogbar use against their enemies. One way or another, you must make it past this beast and strike at the Underking before this terror is unleased on Highmountain.\nDargrul the Underking: Dargrul is the most powerful Underking since the age of Neltharion. Certain that only he has the right to wield the power of Khaz\u2019goroth, Dargul murdered High Chieftain Ulan and seized the artifact from the Highmountain tauren. Now, he uses the Hammer\u2019s power to devastate the region and any who oppose him.\nBlack Rook Hold and Darkheart Thicket.\nMany challenges await the heroes of Azeroth in Legion, and among the most dangerous are the dungeons found in and around the Broken Isles. In this preview, we take a look at two of the expansion\u2019s new dungeons: Black Rook Hold and Darkheart Thicket. \nBlack Rook Hold.\n\"Carved from the greatest mountain of Val\u2019sharah by ancient elven masons, Black Rook Hold stood as a bulwark against the Burning Legion during the War of the Ancients. The nigh-impregnable fortress is also the ancestral home of Lord Kur\u2019talos Ravencrest, one-time mentor of Illidan himself. But since the latest Legion attack, a strange dark energy emanates from the Hold, and restless dead plague the surrounding lands. \"\nBlack Rook Hold is a dark presence looming over the Howling Dale. It stands on an island on the west side of Val\u2019sharah, connected to the mainland by a wide, intimidating bridge over the Emerald Bay. Inside, four bosses are waiting to give you a warm welcome.\nThe Ravenscrypt.\nThe Amalgam of Souls: Immense soul energy was released when Gul\u2019dan conducted the ritual to sever Illidan\u2019s soul from his body at Black Rook Hold. This energy brought the souls of the Ravencrest clan back to their ancestral home\u2014and residual soul energy has merged them into a massive monstrosity.\nThe Grand Hall.\nIllysanna Ravencrest: The daughter of Lord Ravencrest, imprisoned for millennia in the Vault of the Wardens shortly after the War of the Ancients, found herself free after Maiev released the demon hunters from their prison. Returning to her ancestral home, she sacrificed everything\u2014including her very soul\u2014to defend what she could not during the War of the Ancients.\nThe Rooks\u2019 Roost.\nSmashspite the Hateful: A brutal, imposing Mo\u2019arg Lieutenant, Smashspite the Hateful led the Legion\u2019s invasion of Black Rook Hold and commanded defense of the keep from the air via his colony of felbats.\nThe Raven\u2019s Crown.\nLord Kur\u2019talos Ravencrest: Kur\u2019talos Ravencrest, Lord of Black Rook Hold, was the commander of the Kal\u2019dorei Resistance during the War of the Ancients until he was assassinated by Varo\u2019then under the order of Queen Azshara. Millennia later, Gul\u2019dan\u2019s foul soul magic has awoken Ravencrest\u2019s soul, and those of his ancestors, from their eternal repose. The Legion, seeking revenge gleefully forced his soul into his body and mesmerized him, forcing him to eternally relive the horrors of the War of the Ancients.\nDarkheart Thicket.\nMinimum Level: 98\nLocation: Val\u2019sharah\nBosses: 4\n\"In the shadow of Shaladrassil, the Nightmare permeates every inch of the once-lush forest. Where the eldest and greatest druids once tended to the woods, meditating beneath the great world tree, corruption and madness now reign. Deep within the tangled thicket, the Nightmare Lord Xavius works to break the will of his greatest prize. \"\nDarkheart Thicket is an outdoor dungeon in what once was an idyllic wood in the shadow of Shaladrassil. Now nightmares roam unfettered.\nArchdruid Glaidalis: Glaidalis was once known as among the most talented shapeshifters in all of Azeroth, and the elders of Moonglade would regularly send their most promising disciples to his care for instruction. But as has sadly too often been the case, those who are closest to nature are often the first to fall into the Nightmare\u2019s clutches.\nOakheart: An ancient who formed from an offshoot of Shaladrassil itself, Oakheart has survived the Sundering, the Cataclysm and the countless blights. The ancient was able to weather these storms by drawing strength from the essence of the Dream itself. But now, that wellspring has become his undoing.\nDresaron: Once a young green drake, tending to whelps in the shadow of the great world tree, Dresaron is now engulfed in nightmare, lost in a fog of hatred and fear. He lashes out with powerful wings and a withering breath, unleashing his rage on any who stumble into his clutches.\nShade of Xavius: Once a powerful mage and a councilor to Queen Azshara, Xavius forged a pact with Sargeras to enable the Legion\u2019s first invasion of Azeroth. Cursed and tormented in the wake of that defeat, Xavius now projects his true power from the Nightmare into our world, focusing his dark might to break the spirit of his old rival, Malfurion.\nHalls of Valor and Maw of Souls.\nMany challenges await the heroes of Azeroth in Legion, and among the most dangerous are the dungeons found in and around the Broken Isles. In this preview, we take a look at two of the expansion\u2019s new dungeons: Halls of Valor and Maw of Souls. \nHalls of Valor.\n\"In the clouds high above Stormheim, the titanic keeper Odyn has called the greatest vrykul warriors of Azeroth to be his Valarjar. Amidst feasting halls and hunting grounds, these ascended vrykul test themselves and prepare for the great war that is to come. Adventurers must pass through these halls and prove their worth if they hope to stand before Odyn and claim the Aegis of Aggramar. \"\nThe Halls of Valor can be found in the southeast of Stormheim. You\u2019ll need to fight your way to the Gates of Valor to gain access to what lies beyond. In this multi-level dungeon, you'll prove your worth against five mighty bosses.\nFields of the Eternal Hunt.\nFenryr: In the Fields of the Eternal Hunt, the greatest vrykul champions keep their skills sharp, competing to see who can fell the largest beast. But man and beast alike give a wide berth to the fearsome worg Fenryr, true master of the Fields, who stalks his prey and pounces with unnerving quickness.\nThe High Gate.\nHymdall: Clad in gleaming golden armor, with an imposing frame that looks to have been chiseled from granite, Hymdall remains ever vigilant at the gates of the Halls of Valor. Tasked by Odyn to keep the unworthy from entering the Halls with deadly storm drakes circling nearby ready to heed the call of his horn, he will never falter in his charge.\nHyrja: In life Hyrja was a warrior without equal, defending the Valkyra from all threats. Her valor and courage drew the attention of Eyir, a titan watcher. Upon her death and ascension to the Halls of Valor, Eyir has awarded Hyrja with her greatest honor, transformation into a Val\u2019kyr.\nHalls of Valor.\nGod-King Skovald: Gul\u2019dan approached the vrykul king Skovald with a simple proposition: he could join the Legion and receive ultimate power, or he could see his people destroyed. Dreaming of conquest and glory, Skovald has taken up the Legion\u2019s offer and been set to a single crucial task. He must claim the Aegis of Aggramar from Odyn in the Halls of Valor and deliver it to Gul\u2019dan. Only then can his endless conquest begin.\nOdyn: Odyn, a titan keeper, was empowered by the titan Pantheon to lead the titan-forged armies against the Old Gods. In the aftermath, he raised the Halls of Valor into the skies, assembling a force of the greatest vrykul champions to defend Azeroth. But when Ulduar fell into the clutches of Yogg-Saron, he was betrayed by Loken and cursed by Helya, now trapped within these halls for eternity.\nMaw of Souls.\nMinimum Level: 110\nLocation: Stormheim\nBosses: 3\n\"While the greatest vrykul warriors are spirited away to the Halls of Valor to glory eternal, shiny and gold, the cursed and damned find themselves on the shores of the Maw of Souls. Amidst fog and mist, they await the Naglfar, a fearsome ship formed from sinew and bone, which comes to deliver these poor souls to Helheim, and the clutches of Helya. \"\nBeginning in the Hellmouth Cliffs, players will make their way to the cursed ship Naglfar to experience a cruise of a more sinister kind.\nHellmouth Cliffs.\nYmiron, the Fallen King: Ymiron, one-time king of the vrykul of Northrend, was a mighty warrior held in awe by his people. The gates of the Halls of Valor awaited him in the afterlife. But, hungry for more power, he struck a dark bargain with the Lich King. When adventurers struck him down, he found the eternal Halls closed to him. And so, the damned king waits in purgatory on the shores of the Maw of Souls.\nThe Naglfar.\nHarbaron: The mysterious ferryman of souls stands at thehelm of the Naglfar, gathering the damned and bringing them to Helya\u2019s domain. His connection with the fallen queen of the val\u2019kyr is unclear but when the breeze catches Harbaron\u2019s cloak, an expanse of shimmering stars unfolds beneath. Strange.\nHelya: Helya, fallen queen of the Val\u2019kyr, was once at Odyn\u2019s right hand, raising the spirits of vrykul champions to the Halls of Valor to prepare for the final battle for the fate of Azeroth. But following Loken\u2019s betrayal, she was persuaded to join him and turn upon her master. She now lurks in the shadowy realm beneath the world, plotting her revenge.\nThe Arcway and Court of Stars.\nMany challenges await the heroes of Azeroth in Legion, and among the most dangerous are the dungeons found in and around the Broken Isles. In this preview, we take a look at the final two of the expansion\u2019s new release dungeons: The Arcway and Court of Stars. \nThe Arcway and Court of stars are accessible a little differently than a dungeon like Maw of Souls. To gain access to these two maximum-level dungeons, you\u2019ll need to work on your reputation with Suramar which you\u2019ll be able to do as a part of the zone questline. You\u2019ll also need a premade group to take them on as neither of these dungeons will be available in Normal or Heroic. Read on to learn more about them.\nThe Arcway.\n\"As vast as the city of Suramar is, the vast network of tunnels beneath the city spans an even greater reach. Nightborne society has grown to depend on the power of the Nightwell, and the Arcway delivers that lifeblood throughout the city. This labyrinthine complex was built thousands of years ago, running beneath the foundations of the city\u2019s largest buildings, and most modern citizens live their lives entirely unaware of what may lurk in the shadows beneath their feet\u2026.\"\nIvanyr: Cut off from the power of the Nightwell and cast into the dark expanse of the Arcway, Ivanyr wandered aimlessly, slowly withering away, until he came upon a trove in the foundations beneath the great library of Suramar. He spends his days feverishly working to decipher the tomes there, feeding off the power of relics in the archives in order to sustain himself. But, even as that magic sustains his body, his mind cracks and weakens.\nCorstilax: This massive construct patrols the tunnels beneath Suramar, searching for anomalies and correcting them. He has detected one such anomaly \u2014 a breach in one of the conduits that carries the power of the Nightwell \u2014 and works to repair it. But living outsiders wandering the tunnels are also an anomaly; one that Corstilax is empowered to remedy.\nGeneral Xakal: When Gul\u2019dan threatened Suramar with his demands, those were not idle words. A Legion invasion force burrowed into the tunnels beneath the city, and Xakal leads those forces. He awaits further command, ready at a moment\u2019s notice to surge forth and bring death and destruction to the streets of Suramar.\nNal'tira: This massive spider made its nest in the hollows beneath a great mana tree. Over the years, loose magical energies and runoff have warped the creature, imbuing Nal\u2019tira with arcane energy that makes her perhaps the deadliest predator in the Arcway.\nAdvisor Vandros: Vandros is one of Elisande\u2019s closest advisors and an adept at harnessing the arcane magic of the nightwell, second only to Elisande herself. He would not ordinarily venture in to the Arcway himself, but after monitoring the state of the nightfallen resistance and their allies, he now feels the need to take matters into his own hands.\nCourt of Stars.\n\"Even as Legion troops patrol the streets, casting a pall over the grand city of Suramar, the socialites of the Nightborne nobility continue to cling to custom and routine. On this clear night, the cry of revelers echoes through the chill air, as the largest mansion in the Noble District opens its doors for a grand gala. Rumor has it that Grand Magistrix Elisande herself may be making an appearance in an effort to reassure several of her closest allies despite recent turmoil. \"\nPatrol Captain Gerdo: Captain of the Duskwatch, Gerdo has devoted his life to keeping the peace within the walls of Suramar. Though he has a growing unease since the arrival of the Legion, he remains faithful and loyal to the leadership of Suramar. Elisande has safeguarded them for generations, and she knows what is best for the people of the city. Tonight, Gerdo\u2019s task is to ensure that only citizens with the proper credentials are able to enter a gathering of particular importance at the manor.\nTalixae Flamewreath: A sadistic eredar sorcerer, even as she understands the importance of the nightborne to her master\u2019s plans, Talixae chafes at the indignity of standing guard over a building full of elves. Nevertheless, she and her lieutenants remain vigilant, and while they live, no intruders will disrupt the gathering.\nAdvisor Melandrus: First Blade of the Grand Magistrix, Melandrus rarely leaves Elisande\u2019s side. He has eschewed the magical arts, instead harnessing the power of the Nightwell to heighten his reflexes and his movements to inhuman levels."}

It's about the release of &lt;a href=\"Timewalking\"&gt;Timewalking&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeons&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nPrime your minds for a fel tangled chrono-spatial conundrum: Legion Timewalking is here!\nPlayers will be able to adventure into six of Legion\u2019s dungeons to reap new rewards all week during this week\u2019s Bonus Event. Your character and items will be scaled down to a power level fitting for the challenge at hand, but bosses will yield loot appropriate for your regular level. Timewalking dungeons also have a chance to drop items that usually drop when you run them on Heroic difficulty, and you\u2019ll earn reputation with a faction that is interested in the dungeon.\nIn addition, you can also complete Timeworn Keystone dungeons to earn powerful loot, as well as take on the challenges of the Mage Tower, available only while the event is active.\nWhile the Event is Active.\nLook for the following all week long:\nSimply open the Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select Dungeon Finder and Timewalking in the Type dropdown menu. Selecting Find Group will match you with other players and send you to one of the following Heroic dungeons:\nTo learn more about each dungeon\u2019s bosses, tips, and view the available loot, check out the Adventure Guide (Shift-J), select the Dungeons tab, then choose Legion from the drop-down menu.\nTimeworn Keystones.\nIf you're looking for a more challenging experience, you'll be able to talk to Ta'hsup in Oribos and obtain a Timeworn Keystone. Timeworn Keystones can be then used in one of the six Legion dungeons during the event, like you would with any Mythic Keystone. Timeworn Keystones at level 10 and above have a unique affix tied to Legion: Infernal. When this affix is active, Infernal Beacons can be found near some bosses. Activating a Beacon or engaging a nearby boss will trigger a Legion invasion.\nTimeworn Keystone dungeons will be scaled up to your level, and the chest at the end of the run will drop gear from that dungeon at an item level appropriate to the Timeworn Keystone's difficulty. This gear can be upgraded with Valor Points and works just like any other max-level gear you can obtain from Mythic Keystone dungeons. Completing dungeons in this manner will contribute to your Great Vault progress, though Legion Timeworn Keystone items cannot appear as loot options when claiming weekly Great Vault rewards.\nMage Tower.\nThe unspeakable horrors that were unleashed when the Legion came to the Broken Isles have returned. Conquer the challenges of the tower, and obtain incredible rewards\u2014as well as achievements and of course, bragging rights. Read about the Mage Tower's return.\nLegion Timewalking Rewards.\nYou\u2019ll also be able to visit the Timewalking vendor Aridormi in Dalaran (above the Broken Isles). She\u2019ll be waiting to take your hard-earned Timewarped Badges in exchange for some tempting rewards:\nPlus more! Additional Legion equipment will also be available from the vendors during this event.\nAbout Bonus Events.\nBonus Events occur on a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a reward for accomplishing a related goal. Check the in-game calendar regularly to keep on top of the scheduled events. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any quests associated with the Bonus Event of the week."}

It's about various &lt;a href=\"Battle%20pet%20trainers\"&gt;Battle pet trainers&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticles.\nZunta.\nCongratulations, maggots\u2014err, tamers! You\u2019ve survived a year of basic training, amassed a veritable army of pets, and now it\u2019s time to move you into the advanced course and apply your tactical training against other tamers out in the wide, wide world. If you thought some of my challenges were easy before, you ain\u2019t seen nothin\u2019 yet! Nothin\u2019, I say!!\nYour target this week is Zunta, an aspiring pet tamer who neglected to train under my watch . . . so now you\u2019re going to teach him the lesson he deserves. He\u2019s a troll who hangs out in Durotar just south of Orgrimmar, and he\u2019s got two measly little pets that resemble the goo still stuck to the bottom of my boots. Crruunnncchh!!\nThe two meager minions in question are Mumtar and Spike. Mumtar is a Critter, and as you most certainly already know, Critters are generally strong against Undead and weak against Humanoid. They also have bonus defense when facing an Elemental and weak defense when facing a Beast. Spike is\u2014ironically enough\u2014a Beast, and he will generally be strong against Critters and weak against Flying. Spike\u2019s defense is strongest when facing a Humanoid, and weakest when facing a Mechanical foe. Well isn\u2019t that special?!\nWait, I don\u2019t need to waste my own breath on this stuff\u2014I\u2019ve got underlings to do that. Let\u2019s bring in Mr. Crithto to give you the details of your assignment.\nYou might be thinking this is a fairly easy exercise. For me it is, but for you it\u2019s your first step toward becoming a Master Tamer like me. Which you\u2019re not! And don\u2019t even think for one second you can cheese Crithto\u2019s orders, because they also happen to be my orders. And it\u2019s just a small taste of what\u2019s to come in Major Payne\u2019s Advanced Pet Battles Training.\nWELCOME TO THE DARK SIDE OF MY WORLD, KIDDOS! IT\u2019S GONNA BE A BUMPY RIDE!\n\"Come join the discussion about this pet in our Pet Battles forum. You can also learn more about Zunta by visiting Wowhead.com, and details about Pet Battles by visiting WarcraftPets.com.\"\nJulia Stevens.\nHow 'bout that! It seems your first Advanced Pet Battles Training assignment went well for some of you. For others, don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t see you cheat on your assignment by using high-level pets to take on Zunta. You will pay for your insolence! Just not right now. I\u2019m a bit too busy to melt your face, but you \"will\" pay\u2014that you can count on.\nYour next assignment is to find the oh-so-innocent-looking Julia Stevens in Elwynn Forest. She\u2019s another aspiring pet tamer who likes to introduce new recruits to Pet Battles by having her two cronies eat their pets while the poor tamer looks on in shock and disbelief. Don\u2019t let her angelic presence fool you\u2014she\u2019s no slouch when it comes to controlling her beasts. And why did it have to be snakes?!\nYou\u2019re well aware of how repulsed I am by sidewinding reptiles, so it\u2019s imperative you pay close attention to what I\u2019m about to tell you. Stevens has two Beast pets on her team: Fangs and Slither. Both are generally weak to Mechanical attacks and struggle to do reasonable damage against Flying. They are, however, especially strong against Critters. That\u2019s why Crithto is here\u2014he\u2019s going to explain the specifics of your assignment. Listen to the pug, and no cheating this time!!\nSimple enough, right? Keep in mind, while these first assignments may seem easy, they\u2019re still important. As you\u2019ll see in the coming weeks, some of these tamers are quite difficult. Heck, so many of you cried after facing me, I\u2019ve been able to fill a secret swimming pool under Icecrown with your tears! Here, have a tissue.\nNOW MAKE LIKE A TREE AND GET OUTTA HERE!\n\"Come join the discussion about this encounter in our Pet Battles forum. You can also learn more about Julia Stevens by visiting Wowhead.com, and details about Pet Battles by visiting WarcraftPets.com.\"\nOld MacDonald.\n\"Old MacDonald had a farm, Teensy, Clucks, and Foe.\"\n\"And on that farm he beat your team; aren\u2019t you thankful, no!\"\n\"With a Scratch, Scratch here, and a Peck, Squawk there,\"\n\"Here a tear, there a tear, everywhere a robot gear,\"\n\"Old MacDonald had a farm, Teensy, Clucks, and Foe!\"\nBet you can\u2019t guess where you\u2019re headed this week! And better yet, this Master Pet Tamer has a team of three who are sure to give your pets a serious challenge. I told you you\u2019d pay for your insolence!\nFirm, but fair; that\u2019s what my pop used to tell me. And in keeping with this philosophy, you don\u2019t have to start your crying in front of me just yet. But you should take a moment to narrow your focus. My training doesn\u2019t get any easier as we go along, so once again, pay close attention to my pugtastic partner!\nYes, okay, I let you have a Magic pet on your team, but you\u2019re still not off the hook for cheating! For those who didn\u2019t cheat, well, you\u2019re just gonna have to show your fellow tamers how we get things done.\nE-I-E-I-GO!!\n\"Come join the discussion about this encounter in our Pet Battles forum. You can also learn more about Old MacDonald by visiting Wowhead.com, and details about Pet Battles by visiting WarcraftPets.com.\"\nDagra the Fierce.\nHigh atop the mountain next to Thorn Hill is a vicious orc woman named Dagra . . . Dagra the Fierce. Frankly, her team didn\u2019t seem very fierce when it faced my crew of deadly mongrels, but I can confirm she\u2019s got a wicked right cross. I do not recommend flirting with her.\nThroughout her years in Northern Barrens, she\u2019s tamed a collection of creatures that might make you think you\u2019re at a petting zoo\u2014but these wildlings are nothing to be trifled with if you\u2019re not properly trained and prepared. There\u2019s Longneck, a Beast; Springtail, a Critter; and Ripper, another Beast. One time, I watched a young tamer get too close to Longneck and attempt to pet it. Let\u2019s just say I hope he didn\u2019t need the leg that went comically tumbling down the mountain. Yes, I pointed and laughed. What of it?!\nShe\u2019s your target, tamers! Let\u2019s bring in Captain Crithto to dish out the details of this exercise.\nI\u2019m beginning to see some promise in you people. Bear in mind, I didn\u2019t care much for the obscenity-laced parchments you mailed me about your training against Julia Stevens, but Crithto\u2019s been tenacious in buffering my wrath. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m letting up, though! We might be tip-toeing through some of these teams, but it\u2019s going to get a whole lot harder very, very soon.\nGET A MOVE ON BEFORE I RIGHT-CROSS YOU!!\n\"Come join the discussion about this encounter in our Pet Battles forum. You can also learn more about Dagra the Fierce by visiting Wowhead.com, and details about Pet Battles by visiting WarcraftPets.com.\"\nLindsay.\nMy scouts report that some of you were none too happy to be slapped around by Dagra. Bwahahaha!!\nWhat, was the big scary orc lady too mean to you? Did you too lose a limb and have it comically tumble down the mountain? Well suck it up, tamer! Your petty concerns mean nothing to me, and they certainly won\u2019t change my goal of making you a champion. I whip my arms back and forth!\nHowever, I\u2019m not without a smidgen of heart, so why don\u2019t you head to Redridge Mountains and find my little friend Lindsay? She\u2019s cute, she\u2019s got pigtails with pink bows, and she takes care of a little herd of bunnies that are sure to warm your heart. As they slay your team!\nBring it, pug.\nSimple enough, right? Or are you scared of a little girl, too?! Granted, killing her bunnies is a really mean thing to do, but Pet Battles aren\u2019t just about family, they\u2019re also about speed and team composition. One final caveat: winning is going to feel like losing.\nGET OVER IT!!\n\"Come join the discussion about this encounter in our Pet Battles forum. You can also learn more about Lindsay by visiting Wowhead.com, and details about Pet Battles by visiting WarcraftPets.com.\"\nAnalynn.\nThe question of what would happen if the Unstoppable Force collided with the Immovable Object has weighed on men\u2019s minds for eons. But I have the answer: It doesn\u2019t matter! These things just are because they are. It\u2019s like trying to ponder why gnomes are perfect for punting. Knock it off\u2014they just are!\nMuch the same, your training mission this week is what it is. Yes, I understand a few of you were saddened to take on a cute little girl whose dead bunnies now litter the hillside in Redridge, and you\u2019re now paying the consequences of your ruthless and heartless actions. Aren\u2019t you the sensitive type! This time, though, there is no story or reasoning\u2014Analynn is an acquaintance, and she\u2019s more than ready to help train you.\nOK, I\u2019m not being completely honest. I\u2019ve known Analynn for a fair amount of time, but her smile is really, really creepy. No, seriously, it\u2019s creepy like whoa! A few months ago, I was riding through the area when I heard, \u201cDark Lady watch over you.\u201d The craggy voice made me and my mighty steed stop dead in our tracks. I looked over and there was Analynn, smiling at me with her rotten mouth, worm-filled teeth, and all . . . barf!!\nThat\u2019s when I noticed she had a team of pets, and I thought, what sweeter revenge could there be for her stomach-churning grin than to send my able-bodied tamers to take her on? Crithto!\nSimple, right? And yes, it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to offer her a mint or two or five.\nBE QUICK ABOUT YOUR BUSINESS!\n\"Come join the discussion about this encounter in our Pet Battles forum. You can also learn more about Analynn by visiting Wowhead.com, and details about Pet Battles by visiting WarcraftPets.com.\"\nEric Davidson.\nHow cool would it be to delve into the history of the worgen\u2014to research the heroics of Lo\u2019Gosh, the influence of the Scythe of Elune, and the origins of the worgens\u2019 mysterious curse? Well, this ain\u2019t history class, so that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re \"not\" gonna do!\nAre you mad? Bark at the moon!\nMy fanged pal Eric Davidson hangs out in Duskwood, where he\u2019s tamed a vicious team of creepy spiders. Once a pupil of mine, he\u2019s come into his own and has acquired a newfound confidence in his quest to become a Master Pet Tamer. As fascinating as you think the history of his kin might be, Eric\u2019s not interested in having his ancestry researched. He\u2019s far more anxious to help you train while his team of eight-legged beasties injects their venom into your pets\u2019 faces. Dissolving your insides one organ at a time!\nNow that Crithto is back from the Stormwind vet (he doesn\u2019t want you to know he had worms), he\u2019s here to give you the lowdown on this week\u2019s training assignment. You\u2019re up, pugly!\nCrithto and his puns . . . fun stuff, right? OK, before you set off, one word of warning: do not make light of the fact that Eric has fleas. He hates fleas, and he hates being reminded he has fleas even more! If he starts to sniff and scratch, just make a comment about his crimson-stained teeth. He likes it when folks notice his smile.\nHAVE A DOGGONE GOOD TIME!\n\"Come join the discussion about this encounter in our Pet Battles forum. You can also learn more about Eric Davidson by visiting Wowhead.com and get more details about Pet Battles by visiting WarcraftPets.com.\"\nZonya the Sadist.\nThe sultry voice of Zonya can be mesmerizing, but her sadistic ways are the stuff of legend. It\u2019s rumored she used to pull the feelers off beetles in Orgrimmar when she was a kid so she could watch them wander in confusion while they screamed in pain. I\u2019ve also heard that the reason Swiftmane runs around Northern Barrens like a rabid chicken is because of something horrible the zhevra witnessed Zonya doing to the other animals in the area. Let\u2019s just say she\u2019s not very nice!\nWhen I\u2019ve challenged her in the past, she wasn\u2019t too gracious in defeat\u2014and I have the scars to prove it. Zonya\u2019s someone I wouldn\u2019t want to mess with unless I absolutely had to, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sending you to pay her a visit. Stop your pouting!\nCrithto is here to tell you more about this Master Pet Tamer who probably won\u2019t react well to losing.\nYears ago, I met a fortuneteller named Tia Dalma who asked for payment before she\u2019d tell my fortune. In response, I gave her an undead monkey. She liked it, but she also didn\u2019t care much for my incredible confidence. Ignoring that hex she put on me, my encounter with Tia reminds me of Zonya, except Zonya is a bit less charming . . . and a lot more dangerous.\nYou look worried.\nGOOD LUCK!!\n\"Come join the discussion about this encounter in our Pet Battles forum.

You\u2019ve been doing pretty well against Master Pet Tamers who are still a little wet behind the ears, but as you work your way up to more experienced individuals, things are gonna get tougher! Are you ready?!\nGranted, your next challenge isn\u2019t too much of a leap from previous challenges\u2014but that\u2019s because you\u2019re still wet behind the ears, too. Your look of disapproval means nothing to me!\nSteven Lisbane is a hulk of a man with a deceptively polite demeanor. He resides in Northern Stranglethorn along the road between the Kal\u2019ai Ruins and Lake Nazferiti, where weary travelers heading to the Cape or attempting to escape a Murkgill Warrior will often encounter him. Steven relishes a spirited duel; he also likes to eat live snakes using a knife and fork with his pinkie finger extended. Such exquisite manners! I think I just grossed myself out!\nYou\u2019re up, Mr. Pug!\nWhile you\u2019re down there, you might want to try hunting down a Razzashi Hatchling.

Every single training mission I send you on seems to end with me being inundated by cooing over how cute all the tamers\u2019 pets are. Knock it off!\nHow many times do I need to tell you their looks are purely meant to deceive you? OK, I\u2019ll give you some credit: Moonstalker is pretty awesome, and if I bothered to get myself a kitty, I\u2019d want that one. But this doesn\u2019t make it OK for you to lose your focus! The goal here is to mold you into Master Pet Tamers that are far more advanced, far more talented, and far more capable than the ones you encounter on Azeroth. Far more better!!\nNext up is Merda Stronghoof, and her team is \"ugly\". So ugly, in fact, that there isn\u2019t a snowball\u2019s chance in Molten Core that you\u2019ll be a bunch of deer in goblin headlights when you confront them. You like my analogy, don\u2019t ya?!\nBring on the info, Mr. Crithto.\nYes, your training is gonna get a lot harder\u2014I warned you people last week, so you can save your crying for Mankrik\u2019s wife.\nMOVE OUT!!\n\"Come join the discussion about this encounter in our Pet Battles forum.

First, you can\u2019t use a mount. Hoof it, tamer! Second, you must visit the grummles, find the ones with the giant rucksacks, and carry three of them on your back as you head up. That\u2019s right, channel your inner yak! Third, you have to get there by walking backwards. From Krasarang!\nMove out!\n\"Come join the discussion about this pet in our Pet Battles forum.

Let\u2019s not quibble about how legendary I am to behold! One day while I was out hunting grizzlies, armed with nothing more than a Whittling Knife, I was ambushed by a wily Mosshide chieftain by the name of Sagepaw! Several hours later, I was the proud owner of a fist-full of gnoll teeth, three new scars, and a very warm fur blanket. You know you\u2019re impressed!\nThe reason I\u2019m regaling you with this tale of just one of my many triumphs is that I know exactly how you tamers are gonna feel with this week\u2019s challenge: Collect enough Giant Dinosaur Bones to earn yourself a Spectral Porcupette! There\u2019s no hiking half-way across Pandaria carrying grummles on your back this time. No, your training will come at the hands\u2014err, claws and hooves\u2014of the primal monstrosities that run rampant on the Isle of Giants. There you will be reminded of just how fragile life can be! If you want one of these paranormal, prickly pets, you\u2019re gonna have to work for it!

Don\u2019t act like some of them aren\u2019t yours!\nAdmittedly, Ji-Kun does have a large, rather dangerous beak perfectly evolved for tearing off limbs, along with a pair of wings powerful enough to send a plate-clad tauren soaring off a platform like a piece of paper. Yet I can\u2019t help but find this winged beast quite charming. The last time we sat down and squawked together, she was kind enough to call over her clutch to keep me warm. And not coincidentally, I enjoyed a large tray of hot wings that night. Bet you didn\u2019t see that coming!\nI have determined, however, that Ji-Kun has flown the coop!

In those days, my mission was pretty straightforward: sharpen my blade on beasties, show no mercy, and don\u2019t come back unless I\u2019m bleeding. With that in mind, as a young lad I traveled to Zul\u2019Farrak to face what was then considered a \u201cfearsome\u201d demigod: Gahz\u2019rilla.

Ooga booga!\u201d\" they cried out. And as if that weren\u2019t enough to send chills up your spine, I immediately began to feel the wind of their poisonous darts whiz by my head. I quickened my pace. \u201cStart the engines!\u201d I yelled. \u201cStart the engines!!\u201d\nWhew! Once we got enough air, I could finally relish my discovery.

As I crested a dune that had a whale skeleton sitting on top, I felt the wind kick up more than it normally does. So much so that the hairs on the back of my neck (and my back, for that matter) all stood up! As a sandy whirlwind approached me, it began to take the form of a Sand Elemental. Apparently, one of them survived my onslaught and followed me out there to exact revenge. I won! Haha!\nWouldn\u2019t you know it? It left a Sand Trap behind after it died, which swallowed up one of my boots. Well, how am I supposed to kick your butt without it?!

Simple enough task, I thought. Getting around was fairly easy. Being unseen was a breeze. Smiting angry creatures who got in my way was a cake walk . . . and then I encountered the Fel Reaver. Rawrararar!!\nI\u2019ll never forget the sound it made and how it pierced my eardrums just before a giant metallic foot stomped on me. Fortunately, it takes a lot more than a jerking pile of space junk to squash ol\u2019 Payne, so with a few swings, it fel for good. See what I did thar?!\nSeveral weeks later, while learning the ropes of battle strategy, I and several others from my company were sent into The Eye to confront the mechanical beast that Kael\u2019thas summoned to guard his super-terrific palace of blood elfiness. It was no Fel Reaver, that\u2019s for sure, and despite putting up a decent fight, it too couldn\u2019t hold out against the mighty Payne and his comrades. My turn to rawrararar!!\nRumor now is that this beefed-up robot holds onto a miniaturized version of itself, and if you\u2019re savvy enough with your own battle strategies, you could potentially seize the lil\u2019 toy for yourself.

Of course, who else would a Master Tamer contact? Yours truly, that\u2019s who! Earlier that day, Historian Llore had tasked me with researching the temporal anomolies that are occuring on the Timeless Isle, so I happened to be in Stormwind at the time she contacted me. Given that The Bravery was docked right there, I decided I\u2019d leave a day early and set sail for Rut\u2019theran Village on Teldrassil so I could finally see the night elf city of Darnassus. I had never been there before, so I was pretty amped up to walk through and be gazed upon by its astonished denizens.\nI took the portal into the city and was immediately taken aback by its beauty. Not just because it was so lush and impressive in size, but because I\u2019d finally found a place worthy of my own illustrious presence. Where\u2019s my red carpet?! Immediately, I headed over to the Temple of the Moon, paid my respects to Tyrande Whisperwind, played Malfurion Stormrage in some new card game where he clearly cheated, and then walked over to the Cenarion Enclave. There I got to wrestle with a Stormsaber, climb a couple trees with one arm\u2014and then that\u2019s when it happened. As I was rounding the area, checking out the sights, I happened upon a giant tree the locals called an Ancient Protector. He and I sat amidst the leaves and chatted about life, philosophy, and his duties as a primeval guardian of the night elves.\nWhat an experience! Rarely does someone or something impress me more than my own reflection, but I gotta say, Ancients are wondrous creatures who deserve a sturdy salute.

For upon the ground as far as the eye can see lie the carcasses of every friggin\u2019 turkey known to have existed. You\u2019ve hacked, slashed, and stomped your way to destroying our ecosystem, but more importantly, you\u2019ve invited an onslaught of carnage I fear none of us will survive! Gathering in Western Plaguelands right this very moment are hundreds of Blighthawks that are filled with a bloodlust exacerbated by being undead. Not only will they converge upon our lands and begin to pick at the rotting flesh of every dead creature they find, they will also turn on us. Your fancy armor means nothing, either, because you don\u2019t wear armor over your eyes!\nSigh . . . Crithto? Would you, please?\nI\u2019m gettin\u2019 real sick and tired of having to discipline you people rather than see you excel in your training. But I admit that in my days as a young recruit, I too stepped out of line and onto a few turkeys here and there. Granted, I didn\u2019t jeopardize the existence of every single living being! Go kill or capture every single Blighthawk you can find and clean up this mess. Just do what needs to be done so I can come back and yell at you again next week!

Hrmph, that\u2019s fine. You can mock me behind my back. You can chuckle about the ease of certain challenges. You can even claim you\u2019ve previously succeeded and then think I won\u2019t notice you taking a week off putterin\u2019 around in your PJs\u2014I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. And the day before yesterday was when I was already prepared to handle situations like this. Aren\u2019t you thankful?!\nSo it\u2019s off to the bowels of the Temple of Ahn\u2019Qiraj with you! Deep inside the lair where C\u2019Thun dwells, you\u2019ll find a blob of ectoplasm named Viscidus. The only speculation about this gelatinous life form comes from a wacky chemist in Undercity named Fuely who suspects its existence may be connected to the Old Gods. You better pray you have Old God\u2013like skills, though, because that\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to take it down. Is \u201clawl\u201d a real word? \u2019Cause that\u2019s the noise I\u2019m making right now!\nMaster Crithto has more for you.\nNot so tough now, are ya?! And don\u2019t even think about appealing to me to come in and make Viscidus weaker just for the sake of your projected success. You\u2019re on your own with this task, and you had better start planning. Ahn\u2019Qiraj is a cavernous temple riddled with many secrets, and it\u2019s your job to figure out what it\u2019ll take to defeat this creature. Sure, maybe you\u2019re already strong enough to handle it, but are you patient enough?\nSTAY FROSTY!!\n\"Come join the discussion about this pet in our Pet Battles forum.

I\u2019m a bit concerned about Greatfather Winter\u2019s pal, Metzen the Reindeer. You\u2019d think after years of trouble he would have finally come to understand that his own pensive curiosity and need to wander around Azeroth when the big man\u2019s in town only leads to trouble, but oh no! Once again, he\u2019s gone and neglected the lessons of the past, fooled around with the wrong sort, and gotten himself captured. Again!\nHigh in the mountains of Alterac, there\u2019s a cave where a giant slobber-machine named the Abominable Greench has settled in. Inside the cavern he guards is an array of wonders that make this holiday special--brightly lit trees, toys, and hey, is that a wind-up corgi I see? But the most pathetic thing about this whole situation is right outside. You guessed it, it\u2019s the wooden corral that contains the most famous reindeer of all: Metzen! Gimme a second to wipe the tears of laughter away!\nSigh . . . poor Metzen. Now, you\u2019re probably wondering what this has to do with your Pet Battles training. Well, you see, me and Mister Winter have an accord of sorts. He knows who\u2019s been naughty or nice, and I know who\u2019s been naughty or nice. Mostly because he can\u2019t beat my team with his. Haha! This year, he\u2019s requested assistance in returning his beloved buck who tends to wander out to the same cave every single day. And in return for your nice expressions of niceness, he\u2019s promised to deliver some gifts on Winter Veil\u2019s Day in which you may find a tiny version of said cervidae. Facing the Greench should toughen you up, right?!\nBreak it down, bah hum-pug!\n\u266b Metzen the Red-Faced Reindeer \u266a\n\u266a Had a very shiny nose, \u266b\n\u266b And if you ever saw it, \u266a\n\u266a You would even say \u266b . . .

I see you\u2019ve been in the figgy pudding and wolfing down way too many holiday treats. Your apathetic attitudes toward getting in shape and becoming true champions of Pet Battles is quite concerning. And given that it\u2019s my job to whip you into said shape, I guess I need to step it up once again. Get ready for some Payne!\nPut down the bandages and biscuits and tuck your pets away nice and safe, because where you\u2019re headed there are rules: 1) No talking about where you\u2019re going. 2) No seriously, NO talking about where you\u2019re going! 3) If you scream \u201cStop!\u201d, chances are the fight\u2019s not over. Quit your crying and get back in there! 4) Only two beings are allowed in the ring at any given time\u2014which, by the way, is why the referee hovers over the arena floor. 5) You may think you\u2019re tough, but only one fight at a time is permitted. 6) No win, no glory! 7) Fights are likely to go on a lot longer than you think, and chances are you\u2019ll die if it takes a while. 8) If this is your first time inside the arena, you have to fight or the rest of us will mock you for the rest of your life. Who am I kidding? I\u2019ll be doing that anyway!\nGot all that? Good. Now head to the Brawler\u2019s Guild and get your fight on! For those of you who don\u2019t have a ticket to get in . . . slackers!

Given the medals I\u2019ve earned, armies I\u2019ve destroyed, and the huge pile of pets I\u2019ve got stashed behind a lookout tower in Icecrown, not much happens that makes my heart jump\u2014that is, until a couple weeks ago. Hooray, my ticker works!\nA squad of elite Argent Tournament trainees was on the field learning how to joust\u2014though \u201celite\u201d might not be the right word considering I was able to beat all of them just using my arm. Suddenly, one of them clutched his chest and wailed out in pain. As he fell to the ground with his lance by his side, I could see he was in need of medical assistance. After my giggling stopped, I jumped off my mount and kneeled next to him to see what I could do. That\u2019s when it happened. What the hell is that?!\nA hole in his stomach tore open, and I could see what appeared to be a mechanical tail sticking out. It wagged back and forth as I stared at the trainees who were now standing around us in a circle. All of them looked like deer in brazier light. I reached in to find out what it was when I felt something bite my finger. This, of course, didn\u2019t faze me much, but it did cause me to clamp down and yank it out. It was a Rabid Nut Varmint 5000! That doesn\u2019t belong there!\nOur own squirrel-chaser extraordinaire has more.\nThe horror in the eyes of that trainee will haunt me for another, oh, 10 or 15 minutes, and that\u2019s why your assignment this week is to rid the planet of these metallic sciuromorpha. Yes, yes, make sure you capture one for your team because . . . holy squirrel turds, was that whole event awesome!

After arm-wrestling Sargeras, doing 1,000 push-ups with Ragnaros standing on my back, and then hiking for 307 straight hours, I felt it was a good time to get a little rest. You look impressed!\nI set up camp, pulled up a boulder to prop my head upon, and fell asleep. But catching a few Zs wasn\u2019t to be, as I was rudely awakened by a strange-looking crustacean standing by the shoreline. It had tentacle-horn-like things on its head and spiky shells on its shoulders, and its blood-stained claws were clicking together like mad. I drew my sword. I wasn\u2019t going to go down without a fight. Like he would have had a chance!\nBut as I was about to turn him into a lovely supper, he just sort of waved at me. Then he spoke with a weird, clattering voice. \u201cSpeak with Mr. Pinchy and be granted a wish! Maybe something good . . . maybe something bad . . . Mr. Pinchy does not know!\u201d So I did. And it was bad. And here he comes now!\nAww, see? Told you he was bad!\nSo what does any of this have to do with your training? Azeroth is a big place filled with countless secrets to uncover and adventures to be had.

This week, Major Payne\u2019s decided to take a break and has ordered me to highlight one of our favorite fansites: WarcraftPets.com. While he\u2019s off adventuring somewhere top secret (at least he says he is), the major thought this would be a great time to talk about what this helpful website can offer new and veteran pet collectors and battlers.\nIt all began over 7 years ago when Brian \u201cBreanni\u201d Brolin was searching online for a vanity pet guide. Not having much luck, he put his knowledge of website design to use to create just such a resource. WarcraftPets.com was born, and pet collecting is all the better for it! On the site you can look up pets, read comments about where and how to capture and tame them, and even participate in the WarcraftPets community.\nWith the introduction of Pet Battles, WarcraftPets.com evolved to include as much information as possible while still maintaining its fun, easy-to-use style. As part of this evolution, visitors can now create a free account which can be synced with their World of Warcraft character, allowing them to track the pets they already have in their collection and track down the ones they hope to add.\nThe site also provides detailed individual pet pages, which include information such as type, battle abilities, location, and a whole lot more. You\u2019ll also find news, an exhaustive and comprehensive search-engine for pets and pet abilities, a Smart Pet Search feature for those difficult NPC encounters, and numerous guides. It\u2019s a great resource\u2014even Major Payne had a few nice things to say about it.\nIf you haven\u2019t checked out what WarcraftPets.com has to offer, be sure to give it a spin. It\u2019s just one of many fansites that exemplifies what passionate gamers can do for other passionate gamers when they put their minds to it.\nPerky Pug.\nSitrep: You\u2019ve had plenty of time to work off food comas from the recent holidays, exercise your minds and bodies, and get a taste of the Celestial Tournament. Now it\u2019s time to test your strength, cunning, and ability to not be eaten by a tiny little puppy! Oh, you might survive for a little while. Maybe you\u2019ll even get to the point where I finally get to see some of the results of your training in action\u2014but I\u2019m betting you still get eaten!!\nAnd there will be no moaning and complaining! I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Horde or Alliance\u2014this assignment is meant to challenge you and show how far you\u2019ve come since we began honing your skills as a Pet Battler. I guarantee you, if you pass (also known as \u201csurvive\u201d), the heavens will rain glory upon you, heralds in cities across Azeroth will shout your name out of sheer respect, and leaders of every faction will salute you with honor whenever you pass by.\nActually, none of that is going to happen. Haha, you should see your face right now!\nDeep in the heart of Stormwind castle resides a furry monster with awful breath, a spikey harness, and a curly tail. Your test is to go there, find this menace, and challenge him to a fight! You\u2019re not allowed to scream!\nHere\u2019s the miniature puff-ball now to give you some more details.\nNo friends, no trickery, no whining, no crying\u2014those are the rules! One of you goes in, one of you emerges triumphant. But if I see Crithto scampering around the canals seconds after you\u2019ve gone in, then I\u2019ll know you\u2019re not ready to take on the big challenges.

Oh sure, I\u2019m mighty, I\u2019m strong, I\u2019m even irresistible, but when you get into the dark arts of witchcraftery, even the great Payne shudders at the thought of being turned into a toad or a steaming pile of juju residue. Dis a nightmare ya don\u2019 wake up from!\nBy the way, thanks to the \"break\" Crithto told you I was on a couple weeks ago, becoming a victim of voodoo is now impossible for me. Ha!\nThis leads me into this week\u2019s training exercise. You might have learned a thing or two about trolls and juju and mojo on your recent artifact-excavating excursion, but now it\u2019s time to put that knowledge into practice in the very heart of the Amani capital of Zul\u2019Aman. There we\u2019ll see if you\u2019re able to avoid having your soul bled, or if you can keep the shadow from falling on you. In other words: can you stay away from the voodoo?!\nOnce inside, you\u2019re to make your way through the labyrinthine city as quickly as you can, saving each of the captives the various Amani animal avatars have imprisoned. If you\u2019re able to emerge from this musty city alive and with an Amani Battle Bear as your trophy, then I\u2019ll know you\u2019re capable of handling the pet Crithto is here to tell you about. Pay attention!\nDon\u2019t let charlatans like Griftah fool you, there\u2019s no room here for non-magical keepsakes and mementos to help you get through this challenge. You merely need skill, precision, tenacity, cunning, perseverance, foresight, strategy, endurance, determination, focus, speed, and a smidge of luck to be able to show me you\u2019re ready.\nYes, that\u2019s all you need.

At dawn tomorrow, you\u2019re to go into the Ruins of Ahn\u2019Qiraj and take out every living creature inside.

It's about various \"bad guys\" in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nArticle.\nWe've decided to have some fun now that the month of March is in full swing, and we'd like you to join us. March Badness is here!\nMarch Badness will see eight of the most interesting bad guys in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; history go head-to-head to find out who is truly the baddest of the bad. In polls we'll run all week on Twitter and Facebook, you'll get to decide who moves on, who is eliminated, and who is ultimately declared the champion of villains.\nBefore you fill out your bracket, take a look at the entities who have made it to the great eight.\nThe Lich King [Scourge].\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen prince of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, was summoned to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; to serve his duties as a loyal &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. Fighting off the forces of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas broke the ice surrounding his master, donning the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;helm&lt;/a&gt; and merging with him. Years later, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; would kill Arthas, but they discovered that his vast army of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, would always need to be controlled by a Lich King.\nIllidan Stormrage [Illidari].\nDriven by his thirst for power and his conviction that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; must be destroyed at any cost, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; temporarily sided with the Legion during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. He studied the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s' spellcasting for a time, then rejoined &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s defenders and used his new knowledge to defeat the invaders. During the Third War, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; released Illidan from millennia of imprisonment, hoping that the Betrayer would help drive back a new invasion by the Legion. Though Illidan fought the demons, he soon slipped into darkness: after absorbing the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energies of the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan became a demon, an act for which he was banished by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;.\nKil'jaeden [Burning Legion].\nSeduced long ago by promises of power from the dark titan Sargeras, the eredar demon lord Kil'jaeden leads the Burning Legion as demons scorch entire worlds with fel corruption. His agenda is evil: consume life and magic, assimilate every possible race into the Legion's ranks, slay any who dare resist, and ultimately destroy all of creation.\nDeathwing [Dragon Aspects].\nFormerly the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragon\"&gt;black dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and one of the five &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing was given dominion over the earth by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. In an unfortunate turn of fate, the titans had long ago imprisoned twisted beings of pure evil known as &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s deep beneath the surface of Azeroth. Despite their captivity, the Old Gods' power was so great that they drove Neltharion to madness, and he turned against the other Dragon Aspects. Deathwing spurred the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; by sabotaging the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the guise of Daval Prestor, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; lord, and helping the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; enslave the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;. By the time he was defeated and killed, Deathwing's goal had become nothing less than the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;: the end of all &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; on Azeroth.\nC'Thun [Old Gods].\nThe Old God &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; is an unfathomably evil entity whose pervasive power has suffused Azeroth since time immemorial. Imprisoned in the depths of Azeroth long ago by the titans, C'Thun freed itself in recent years. Champions of the Alliance and Horde chose not to wait for the Old God to build up its strength. They invaded the city-kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, fighting countless &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; before finally confronting and killing the malevolent god. Even so, it is unknown whether Azeroth has truly seen the last of C'Thun.\nRagnaros [Elemental Lords].\nUntil recent times, the &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt; was the incredibly powerful ruler of all &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and the destroyer of &lt;a href=\"Thunderaan\"&gt;Thunderaan&lt;/a&gt;, Prince of Air. Wielding &lt;a href=\"Sulfuras\"&gt;Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt;, an enormous mace of flaming red &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; tried to burn down the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; while Deathwing and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult fought to bring about the Hour of Twilight.\nAlgalon the Observer [Titans].\nWhen Alliance and Horde champions slew the corrupted &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, his death triggered an automatic failsafe, summoning the constellar &lt;a href=\"Algalon\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; the Observer to investigate. In the &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Planetarium\"&gt;Celestial Planetarium&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, he possesses the power to trigger the re-origination of the planet and bring about the end of all life on Azeroth.\nMurlocs [Murlocs].\n&lt;a href=\"Nerglish\"&gt;Yar grrrblll murrrblurrrgle! Mrghlllghh! Wharhoorlbrg hlrborl hworlgblolbr, grrbllrggll rrugglmuglog. Mrghlllghh!&lt;/a&gt;\nYour votes will determine the results of each round. Keep an eye on @Warcraft and our Facebook page all this week to cast your vote in each matchup. Your favorite might go all the way!\nStandard disclaimer: The above bad guys are not intended to be comparable in terms of power, ability, or villainy. A couple of them aren't really villains at all, and C'Thun isn't exactly a \u201cguy\u201d. Void where prohibited, which is pretty much everywhere. Let's face it: pitting an old god against a lich king in a one-on-one matchup wouldn't be good for the local environment. So have fun choosing favorites. Let's not overthink this."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nWith the nefarious traitor Sire Denathrius dealt with and his stolen anima returned to its rightful owners, the covenants and you are now ready to take on the Jailer himself in the upcoming content update, Chains of Domination.\nA Hidden Wonder.\nAs part of his ongoing schemes, the Jailer has located a long-lost domain of the Shadowlands\u2014Korthia, the City of Secrets\u2014and dragged it from the hidden byways of the In-Between into the Maw. In this new area, you\u2019ll team up with the covenants under a unified banner to fight against the endless forces of the Jailer, and work to uncover what obscurities he seeks in this forgotten realm.\nKorthia's Inhabitants.\nFearsome wildlife roams Korthia, hardened from eons of adaptation. Be on your guard as you explore this primordial land.\nCovenant Assaults.\nReturn to the Maw with the restored strength of the kyrian, necrolords, night fae, and venthyr and together strike back at the Jailer in Covenant Assaults. Twice a week, you can help the covenants\u2019 forces fight the Maw\u2019s monstrosities. Each Assault is led by one covenant and assisted in part by a second covenant, both of which need your help to complete four quests on the battlefront to take over key locations within the Maw. Successfully completing the onslaught will reward you with reputation for the leading covenant, the assisting faction, and the new covenant coalition, Death\u2019s Advance. You\u2019ll also receive a War Chest filled with Stygia and Soul Cinders, a currency used to further upgrade your legendary items. It may also contain mounts, legendary crafting materials, or equipment.\nDeath's Advance.\nAt the forefront of the fight for the Shadowlands are the covenants\u2019 champions you met along the way while leveling and questing. Visitors from the covenants change daily, and each will offer you repeatable quests. Turning in dailies will reward you with reputation for the new Death\u2019s Advance faction. You\u2019ll also earn reputation from the quest giver\u2019s associated covenant (e.g. venthyr visitors will grant Court of Harvesters rep).\nFor your contributions to the Death\u2019s Advance\u2019s cause, you\u2019ll gain their favor and will be able to purchase several cosmetic rewards, including covenant armor appearance sets.\nThe Archivist's Codex.\nKorthian attendants have committed their existence to researching relics from across the Shadowlands. Led by their Archivist, they are dedicated to recovering the relics scattered across Korthia in the wake of the mawsworn invasion. Aid their cause by returning any Relic Fragments you find to Archivist Roh-Suir in return for The Archivist\u2019s Codex faction reputation and a new currency, Catalogued Research. You can exchange Catalogued Research for a variety of rewards including Conduit and equipment upgrades, a flying mount, and a cosmetic appearance for your cloak.\nMount Up in the Maw.\nDisrupting the Jailer will weaken his hold in the Maw and bolster the confidence of your mounts to let you ride them into battle. To saddle up on your trusty steed in this ominous realm, you\u2019ll first need to complete the introductory storyline to Korthia. Once you complete the quest, you\u2019ll receive The True Maw Walker reward, which allows you to summon and ride all ground mounts in The Maw and Korthia on the character who earned it.\nBlind the Jailor's Eye.\nDuring your journey through the Chains of Domination storyline, you\u2019ll be able to diminish the dangers of this desolate realm during the \u201cFocusing the Eye\u201d quest, which permanently removes the Eye of the Jailer effect. With the eye no longer tracking your every move, you can freely roam the Maw without penalty and stay in this forbidden place for as long as you please.\nDelve Into Desmotearon.\nAlong with exploring Korthia, you can now traverse the previously inaccessible terrain in the Maw, Desmotaeron. This land withers under the shadowy palm of Helya herself, where she tortures souls as her contribution to the Jailer\u2019s schemes. It is here that you\u2019ll also find the entrance of the new 10-boss raid, Sanctum of Domination.\nNew Event: Tormentors of Torghast.\nWhile eradicating the Maw of the Jailer\u2019s forces, his conniving lieutenant Kel\u2019Thuzad will occasionally dispatch Tormentors to maintain their icy grip over the Maw. Slay Mawsworn minions to draw out these powerful adversaries that will stop at nothing to pulverize you into a pile stygia. Defeating a Tormentor will reward you with a Tormentor\u2019s Cache brimming with Soul Cinders and can also contain powerful equipment as well as a Bahmethra Chain Link. Binding enough of these chain links will allow you to summon an eerie mount, the Hand of Bahmethra.\nWe look forward to sharing more information as development continues, and we hope this preview prepares you for the Maw and all it has to offer.\n\"Rewards and mechanics are still in development and subject to change, so be sure to check back for periodic updates on worldofwarcraft.com as we approach the release of Chains of Domination.\""}

Centuries later, an astounding discovery sparks an expedition to find out what happened to the king and his subjects on the remote Mechagon Island.\nYour adventure to Mechagon begins after establishing your hub in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; and powering up your &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;:Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, you will receive a summons from one of the most renowned tinkerers of Azeroth\u2014&lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;\u2014directing you to a newly opened vault in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;. Inside, you will find technology that has never been seen on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and the location of the fabled island.\nUpon arriving in Mechagon, you'll meet the scrappy and resourceful mechagnomes, whose fleshy forms have been improved with cybernetic enhancements. But as you'll soon find out, this is not the technological paradise you may have been expecting. The mechagnomes on the island's surface are fighting against a foe with twisted designs for Azeroth: the legendary King Mechagon himself, who rules the subterranean metropolis of &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon City&lt;/a&gt; with an iron fist. Within the wondrous city's walls and workshops, the mad king has spent the past centuries consumed with an obsession to \u201ccure\u201d Azeroth of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;\u2014stripping away organic life and replacing it with purer, more efficient mechanical forms.\nWelcome to the Rustbolt Resistance.\nAt the forefront of the battle against the twisted tyrant is his son, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Rustbolt%20Resistance\"&gt;Rustbolt Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. As you learn more about what's happening on the island, you'll be recruited to join the fight to overthrow his tyrannical father and put an end to his mad designs. But you'll need more than resolve to stand against King Mechagon's might; if you have any hope of succeeding, you'll need to bolster the resistance forces by taking part in the myriad events and activities you'll discover around the island, including collecting scrap to build tools and weapons, assisting the island's daily visitors with their personal &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, constructing a &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt; to give you an edge in combat, and more.\nJunkyard Tinkering.\nOne of the many mechanical marvels you'll encounter on the island is &lt;a href=\"Pascal-K1N6\"&gt;Pascal-K1N6&lt;/a&gt;, a giant iron &lt;a href=\"robot\"&gt;robot&lt;/a&gt; who will help players craft an arsenal full of &lt;a href=\"equipment\"&gt;equipment&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"toy\"&gt;toy&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"consumable\"&gt;consumable&lt;/a&gt;s, and more in exchange for &lt;a href=\"%3ASpare%20Parts\"&gt;:Spare Parts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Cell\"&gt;Energy Cell&lt;/a&gt;s found across Mechagon.\nAs you explore the island, you'll discover blueprints that Pascal-K1N6 can use to craft these items. One particularly curious blueprint for can be found at the scrap heap known as &lt;a href=\"Bondo%27s%20Yard\"&gt;Bondo's Yard&lt;/a&gt;\u2014pick up the plans for a &lt;a href=\"%3AMechanocat%20Laser%20Pointer\"&gt;:Mechanocat Laser Pointer&lt;/a&gt;, and you'll soon be able to call in a &lt;a href=\"X-995%20Mechanocat\"&gt;X-995 Mechanocat&lt;/a&gt; to ride around the island. As you continue sifting through the island's scrap, be sure to keep an eye out for paint you can use to customize your new robo-kitty's color.\nConstruction Projects.\nAs you explore Mechagon, you'll be able to contribute resources to &lt;a href=\"Construction%20Projects\"&gt;Construction Projects&lt;/a&gt; that create a variety of powerful constructs. These projects provide a variety of bonuses to give you and your fellow adventurers an edge on the island, including experimental equipment &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s and equipement to wield while on the island, flame turrets that help clear an area of foes, a drill rig that can uncover a cave full of treasures (and maybe uncover something best left uncovered), and more.\nPocket-Sized Computation Device.\nOne of the most fascinating pieces of technology waiting to be discovered in Mechagon is the &lt;a href=\"%3APocket-Sized%20Computation%20Device\"&gt;:Pocket-Sized Computation Device&lt;/a&gt;, a trinket that players can customize to suit their adventuring needs. The device houses three &lt;a href=\"Punchcard\"&gt;Punchcard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Socket\"&gt;Socket&lt;/a&gt;s, into which players can insert one &lt;a href=\"Red%20Punch%20Card\"&gt;Red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Yellow%20Punch%20Card\"&gt;Yellow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%3ABlue%20Punch%20Card\"&gt;:Blue Punch Card&lt;/a&gt;.

Players will receive their Pocket-Sized Computation Device after completing the Upgraded quest, available shortly after landing in Mechagon.\nNew Dungeon: Operation Mechagon.\nOnce you're feeling properly upgraded, it's time to begin your bid to shut down King Mechagon once and for all and free the mechagnomes from his tyranny. Get ready for Operation Mechagon!\nThere's plenty to discover as you make your way through Mechagon Island. Get ready to rally the resistance, turn one gnome's junk into another gnome's treasure, and put an end to the mad king's mechanations once and for all when &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Rise of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; arrives on June 25!"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nWith the launch fast approaching, Blizzard Insider sat down with Lead Encounter Designers &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Mercer\"&gt;Scott Mercer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt; to get an inside look at the &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s newest raid instance -- Mogu\u2019shan Vaults -- and the ancient secrets and epic encounters that await &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s inside.\nBefore we dive into the details, can you give us a quick overview of the lore behind the Mogu\u2019shan Vaults? How does the raid fit into larger story of \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\"?\nScott Mercer:\nThe &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; are an ancient &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; of evil, &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s who once dominated &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. At some point in the distant past, all of the warring mogu factions were united by a single tyrannical warlord known as the &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20King\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;. The Thunder King rose to power the \u201cthe mogu way,\u201d namely by eliminating his rivals one by one. According to legend he was able to accomplish this with the help of a mysterious artifact that he found in the depths of a mountain. After his rise to power, he built the Mogu\u2019shan Vaults to contain and protect this secret, and converted the surrounding structure into a sort of shrine dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;. The complex houses many of the empire\u2019s lost artifacts and is the resting place of the spirits of old mogu kings. \nIon Hazzikostas:\nAt the time Mists of Pandaria begins, the Thunder King is long gone and the mogu empire has crumbled into isolated factions. As great and powerful secrets are wont to do, the Vaults have attracted a number of interested parties, including &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s who are trying to enter the Vaults to get at the ancient source of mogu power, which is the key to their tribe\u2019s survival. When the players arrive, they join forces with a &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; Loremaster who knows of a way into the Vaults. The &lt;a href=\"Lorewalkers\"&gt;Loremasters&lt;/a&gt; are a new faction dedicated to learning and retelling the oral history of Pandaria, so the Vaults are naturally a place of tremendous interest to them.\nWhat\u2019s in store inside the Vaults from the gameplay side?\nScott Mercer:\nWe\u2019re building an epic new raid that includes 10- and 25-player versions with both normal and Heroic modes, as well as another 25-player version available exclusively via the &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt;. The Vaults contain six encounters with a wide variety of mechanics.\nWhat kinds of encounters are planned for the Mogu\u2019shan Vaults?\nIon Hazzikostas:\nThe players\u2019 characters are the first living beings to set foot inside the Mogu\u2019shan Vaults in a few millennia,and the experience plays out as a classic \u201ctomb raid\u201d adventure, with mystical defenders and guardians emerging to protect the place\u2019s secrets. In fact, the first boss encounter involves a pack of giant &lt;a href=\"quilen\"&gt;quilin&lt;/a&gt; -- &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al, &lt;a href=\"lion\"&gt;lion&lt;/a&gt;-like stone constructs -- that have stood motionless since the Vaults were sealed but awaken as fierce defenders once the players intrude upon their lair. The four quilin statues have different abilities based on the type of stone from which they were carved, and players will have to experiment to uncover their weaknesses. As players venture deeper into the Vaults, they\u2019ll encounter other protectors, including a celestial dragon and the spirits of the mogu kings from ages past.\nScott Mercer:\nIt\u2019s important to note, too, that the Thunder King doesn\u2019t make a direct appearance in the Vaults, though his presence is certainly felt. His original source of power lies hidden deep within the Vaults, and the mogu have learned to use that power to create most of the guardians that the players fight in the Vaults. Observant players may even notice a certain \u201ctitanic\u201d influence in lair\u2019s defenses. \nWhat details can you share about the final boss encounter?\nIon Hazzikostas:\nThe core chamber of the Vaults contains an army of &lt;a href=\"terracotta%20warrior\"&gt;terracotta warrior&lt;/a&gt;s that are built into recesses within the walls. If players look up, they\u2019ll see these statue-filled niches stretching above them into the distance. When the players enter, the statues begin animating and attacking in huge waves, and the fight quickly turns into a free-for-all. There will be certain heavy-hitting statues that require tanking, and many of the other statues have special abilities to keep the non-tanks busy. It\u2019s going to be a crazy fight that requires lots of crowd control. \nScott Mercer:\nThe encounter as a whole is known as the \u201c&lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Emperor\"&gt;Will of the Emperor&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d and it represents the Vault\u2019s last line of defense between the players and whatever mysterious power source originally allowed the Thunder King to rise to power. By the time players complete the raid, they should have a clear understanding of how the mogu were able to dominate Pandaria for so long. \nWhat design challenges have you encountered during the development of the raid so far?\nIon Hazzikostas:\nIn past raids, we\u2019ve worked with a lot of the established races from &lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; lore. For example, when we sit down to design a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;, we have a pretty clear idea of what that\u2019s going to look like and what kinds of creatures the players are going to find there -- you know, besides just trolls. Pandaria offered us a blank slate of sorts, as the continent has been alluded to in Warcraft lore, but we\u2019ve never really fleshed out the details until now. \nScott Mercer:\nThis meant we\u2019ve spent a lot of time and energy on building out what we call the \u201ckit\u201d for each of the expansion\u2019s new races. A kit includes all kinds of things, from the armor and weapons used by the race to the architecture and environmental themes that go with the race. Part of the \u201ckit\u201d includes what kinds of monsters are found together; for example, the mogu are fond of using quilin statues as guardians, so those two monster types are often seen together. Our primary goal was to make sure the mogu felt visually and thematically distinct from the other Warcraft races, while still making sure they fit into the larger world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Establishing the kit for the mogu, and indeed all of Pandaria\u2019s races, has been a fun challenge. \nLet\u2019s talk loot! What rewards await players who are strong enough to take on the raid?\nIon Hazzikostas:\nThe raid rewards players with powerful epic items, depending on the difficulty setting: item level 476 for Raid Finder, 489 for normal mode, and 502 for Heroic. There\u2019s also a new mount that can be obtained by defeating &lt;a href=\"Elegon\"&gt;Elegon&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"celestial%20dragon\"&gt;celestial dragon&lt;/a&gt; found deep within the Vaults. The mount looks a bit like the &lt;a href=\"%3ACelestial%20Steed\"&gt;:Celestial Steed&lt;/a&gt;, but in the form of a serpentine dragon. \nHow does Mogu\u2019shan Vaults fit into the larger raiding plan for Mists of Pandaria?\nScott Mercer:\nThere will be two outdoor &lt;a href=\"world%20boss\"&gt;world boss&lt;/a&gt;es, along with the Mogu\u2019shan Vaults raid instance, available when Mists of Pandaria first launches. One idea we\u2019re considering is to delay opening Mogu\u2019shan Vaults until a week or so after the expansion\u2019s release, similar to how we\u2019ve always handled the start of the PvP season, just to give players a little time to reach level 90 along with their friends and get acclimated to Pandaria\u2019s new 5-player dungeons, &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt;s. In any case, Mogu\u2019shan Vaults is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the raid content we have lined up for Mists.\nIon Hazzikostas:\nMists of Pandaria will also include two other raid zones, which we plan to make available a few weeks after Mogu\u2019shan Vaults: the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of the Fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;. These two raids feature 10 bosses between the two of them and play out as a two-part story. In the first raid, the Heart of Fear, the players fight the mantid empress who has been possessed by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;, for those who don\u2019t know, plague Pandaria as physical manifestations of negative emotions, like fear, doubt, and anger, and they tend to have a corrupting influence wherever they take root. When the players defeat the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;possessed empress&lt;/a&gt;, the Sha flees her body and hides elsewhere. In the Terrace of Endless Spring, the next raid instance, the players track down the fleeing Sha and finish it off. Both of these instances are a higher tier than the Mogu\u2019shan Vaults and are designed to be tackled using gear obtained in the Vaults, which is why we plan to make them accessible a few weeks after the Vaults unlock.\nScott Mercer:\nYup, and all of this is just the raid content coming before our first major content update. We\u2019ll be announcing even more raiding details in future when we start discussing patch 5.1.\nThanks for your time.Is there anything else you\u2019d like to share before you go?\nIon Hazzikostas:\nI just wanted to say thanks to all of our beta testers. We\u2019re very proud of our dungeon and raid content so far, and we\u2019re looking forward to getting it all out there when Mists of Pandaria launches.\nScott Mercer:\nYeah, we have big plans for Pandaria\u2019s encounters, and it\u2019s great to see it all starting to come together. Keep the feedback coming!"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\n&lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s mightiest protectors have defeated a seemingly endless procession of memorable foes over the years, and while the legions of heroes have since moved on to more pressing threats, those old foes from the past still brood in their lairs. There they sit, lording over their loot, agonizing over their defeats, just waiting for a chance to unleash vengeance. And you can head back into their strongholds to put them back in their place.\nWe'd like to help those who have never given taking on an older raid a shot to feel more comfortable exploring the older content. Even if visiting and looting these locales is old hat, you might still find something of value within. If you've never given it a try at all, there are actually plenty of good reasons to visit older instances:\nGoing Solo.\nAs a level 90 character, you should be able to beat most Raid encounters from classic through &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; without breaking a sweat. If you're particularly well geared and have the right class tools at your disposal, even &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; encounters might be possible. Gear, class abilities, and individual skill all play a significant role in what you can actually handle. Please keep in mind that &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; isn't balanced with soloing past raid content in mind, so some &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es might be better suited to the task than others. You might want to bring a friend along if a particular encounter is proving too much for you to handle. That said, it can add to the fun and challenge to see what you can do on your own.\nFirst Steps: Molten Core.\nThe Molten Core lies at the very bottom of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. It is the heart of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; and the exact spot where, long ago in a desperate bid to turn the tide of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;dwarven civil war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; summoned the elemental &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, into the world. Though the Firelord is incapable of straying far from the blazing core, it is believed that his elemental minions command the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who are in the midst of creating armies out of living stone.\nMolten Core was the first 40-player Raid in classic World of Warcraft, and the place where a great many nascent raiders learned how very important it is not to stand in the fire.\nThere are a lot of good reasons to make Molten Core the first destination you venture to when you decide to explore older raids. Because it's a level 60 Raid, any level 90 character will be able to make short work of the enemies you'll find within (and some classes can attempt soloing the zone much sooner than that).\nSome cool, nostalgia packed stuff drops in there, including the original Tier 1 raid armor sets. It's no longer necessary to complete the attunement quest to get inside, and an earlier change eliminated the need to douse the runes near each boss to summon &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;.\nItems.\nHere are some of the more notable items you'll find inside the instance:\nTier 1 Raid Armor.\nTip: Keep in mind that the belt and wrist items for the Tier 1 sets only drop from the \u2018trash' monsters in the Instance.\nLegendary Weapons.\nTwo classic Legendary weapons can be obtained in Molten Core, though the process is far from straightforward.\nFaction.\nThe different &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; bureaucracies don't get along, and &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon&lt;/a&gt;'s servants, including &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Hydraxis\"&gt;Duke Hydraxis&lt;/a&gt;, hate Ragnaros and his armies. As they say, \u2018The enemy of my enemy is my friend' and sometimes the old adage proves true. Thus, slaying enemies within Molten Core increases your faction with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt;. While Duke Hydraxis and his elementals are no longer present on Azeroth, they still appreciate your efforts in taking down the Firelord and his minions.\nJourney to the Center of Azeroth.\nMolten Core is located inside Blackrock Mountain, which is found nestled between two zones in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The zone entrance can be a bit tricky to find if you've never been there, though. There are two entrances to Blackrock Mountain. One in the southwestern part of &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Summit\"&gt;Iron Summit&lt;/a&gt; and one in the north western part of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Flamestar%20Post\"&gt;Flamestar Post&lt;/a&gt;. If you open up the &lt;a href=\"map\"&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; while within Blackrock Mountain, you'll note that there's a center section of magma divided by chains and platforms, with an island in the middle that can be reached by the massive chains that are suspending it over the magma pit below.\nThe entrance to Molten Core is at the northwest \u2018spoke', very close to the door you need to walk through to reach &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, down close to the magma. Fly down, climb the chains down, (or jump down into the magma and walk up the stony ramp that's on the north side of the chain), and speak to &lt;a href=\"Lothos%20Riftwaker\"&gt;Lothos Riftwalker&lt;/a&gt;. He'll offer to transport you to the Molten Core.\nGetting in the Zone.\nThe cavernous lava tubes of Molten Core are not quite as linear as more recent Raid designs. As a result, you'll need to do a little backtracking here and there, but you shouldn't have too much trouble finding your way around. \nNone of the enemies you'll face here will pose much of a threat to a level 90 character. If you're an Achievement hunter that's after reputation, then you might consider gathering them into groups and taking them down en masse, since kills within Molten Core will grant you reputation with the Hydraxian Waterlords. Some creatures also drop materials that can be used to forge both Legendary weapons, as well. Finally, killing the various elementals that inhabit the Core offers you a chance to pick up Bind on Equip Tier 1 wrist and belt items for your own Transmogrification sets, or to sell on the auction house.\nMolten Mugshots.\nMolten Core is filled with the fiery minions of Ragnaros, including &lt;a href=\"Molten%20giant\"&gt;magma giant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker\"&gt;Flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, and an exceptionally large &lt;a href=\"Core%20hound\"&gt;Core Hound&lt;/a&gt;.\nHead inside, and dodge around the various fire and &lt;a href=\"Earth%20elemental\"&gt;stone elemental&lt;/a&gt;s you'll find waiting for you, then veer left over the small island and bridges. After passing through two small chambers, you'll find yourself in &lt;a href=\"Magmadar%20Cavern\"&gt;Magmadar's Cavern&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lucifron\"&gt;Lucifron&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Lucifron is a prominent member of the diabolical looking Flamewaker (not FlamewaLker) elemental &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;. You'll find him surrounded by packs of &lt;a href=\"Core%20Hound%20%28Molten%20Core%29\"&gt;Core Hounds&lt;/a&gt;, as he patrols with a pair of &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Protector\"&gt;Flamewaker Protector&lt;/a&gt;s within Magmadar's Cavern.\nLucifron's Curse lasts for 5 minutes and increases spell and ability costs by 100%. Potentially inconvenient if you don't have a means of dispelling it.\n&lt;a href=\"Magmadar\"&gt;Magmadar&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Who knew that Ragnaros was a dog person? Magmadar is a Core Hound of unusual size. His only ability of note to high level characters is Panic, which incites an 8 second fear.\nPet hunters, take note! Magmadar has a chance to drop the Blazing Rune, which will add a Corefire Imp to your pet roster.\nAfter you put down Magmadar, head out of his cavern, then veer down and to the left. You'll find &lt;a href=\"Gehennas\"&gt;Gehennas&lt;/a&gt; and his pals lurking in an alcove on the right.\nGehennas \u2013 Another of Ragnaros' Flamewaker servants. He's accompanied by a pair of &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Elite\"&gt;Flamewaker Elite&lt;/a&gt;s. While it probably won't represent much of an inconvenience, keep in mind that his curse reduces healing by 75%.\nNow that Gehennas has been laid low, proceed further into the Core past a number of &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Destroyer\"&gt;Molten Destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s to find &lt;a href=\"Garr\"&gt;Garr&lt;/a&gt; and a slew of small followers toward the south end of the cavern.\nGarr \u2013 One of Ragnaros' &lt;a href=\"lieutenant\"&gt;lieutenant&lt;/a&gt;s, Garr is a massive obsidian elemental, ringed by eight &lt;a href=\"Firesworn\"&gt;Firesworn&lt;/a&gt; servants. If you're after Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker, you'll want to keep in mind that he has a chance to drop the right half of the &lt;a href=\"%3ABindings%20of%20the%20Windseeker\"&gt;:Bindings of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis Firesworn will explode when slain, which causes a knockback. Put your back up against a wall to ensure that you aren't hurled into the midst of the other creatures in the chamber, if you left any of them alive.\nAny luck on those Bindings? No? Okay, well, head east into a smaller tunnel toward the chamber where &lt;a href=\"Shazzrah\"&gt;Shazzrah&lt;/a&gt; awaits you. You'll also find &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt; roaming through the area.\nBaron Geddon \u2013 Ragnaros' other lieutenant, and guardian of the left half of Bindings of the Windseeker. He's quite active, and patrols the area beyond Garr's chamber. Geddon is one of the few bosses that can present a danger to high level characters in Molten Core, because he can knock players up high enough to deal falling damage. This still shouldn't be too much of a problem, but if you're experiencing any issues, you can pull him back to the Hallway you emerged into his area from, so the ceiling reduces the height you can be knocked up, and thus the damage when you fall.\n&lt;a href=\"Shazzrah\"&gt;Shazzrah&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 Unlike the other Flamewakers in Molten Core, Shazzrah is blue. He's also a talented Arcane spell caster once feared for his Arcane Explosions.\nAfter making short work of Baron Geddon and Shazzrah, you can head up over a narrow path. If you peer down the drop off to the left, you'll see Golemagg the Incinerator along the way, but let's visit &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Harbinger\"&gt;Sulfuron Harbinger&lt;/a&gt; first.\nSulfuron Harbinger \u2013 A high ranking Flamewaker, and Ragnaros' &lt;a href=\"herald\"&gt;herald&lt;/a&gt;. He's accompanied by four &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Priest\"&gt;Flamewaker Priest&lt;/a&gt;s. Dropper of the much-reviled &lt;a href=\"Vendorstrike\"&gt;Vendorstrike&lt;/a&gt;.\nOf note, Sulfuron has a much more desirable drop: the &lt;a href=\"%3AMark%20of%20Flame\"&gt;:Mark of Flame&lt;/a&gt;, which will add the Harbinger of Flame to your pet roster when learned. Now then, remember that ledge you saw &lt;a href=\"Golemagg%20the%20Incinerator\"&gt;Golemagg&lt;/a&gt; from? Let's head back that direction.\nGolemagg the Incinerator \u2013 While there are many molten giants in Molten Core, Golemagg is the greatest of them. He's certainly the giantest. You'll find him accompanied by two pet &lt;a href=\"Core%20Rager\"&gt;Core Rager&lt;/a&gt;s. You should focus on Golemagg himself though, because until Golemagg is slain his loyal pets will refuse to die, healing back to full health once they are dropped to below 50%.\nBattle Pet hunters! When you cut Golemagg down to size, you could recruit an Ashstone Core from the &lt;a href=\"%3ACore%20of%20Hardened%20Ash\"&gt;:Core of Hardened Ash&lt;/a&gt; he drops.\nAfter taking out Sulfuron and Golemagg, head up the path to the northeast that leads to the raised area where Majordomo Executus and friends wait for you.\nMajordomo Executus \u2013 Majordomo Executus won't appear until after you've cleared out the other bosses inside Molten Core. He accompanied by four &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Healer\"&gt;Flamewaker Healer&lt;/a&gt;s and four &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20Elite\"&gt;Flamewaker Elite&lt;/a&gt;s, and you'll need to slay all eight to defeat the encounter. Executus himself is something of a coward, and will submit once you've defeated his companions. Don't forget to open the &lt;a href=\"Cache%20of%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Cache of the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, since you won't be looting Executus' corpse.\nTime to backtrack. After Executus comes to a gentleman's (gentlesalamander's?) agreement with you, it's time to head back to &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%27%20Lair\"&gt;Ragnaros' Lair&lt;/a&gt;. Once you arrive, you'll need to speak with Majordomo Executus again, and he'll obligingly wake up Ragnaros from his nap, like Azeroth's worst alarm clock: Too soon.\n&lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; - The big guy himself. Ragnaros the Firelord is an incredibly powerful fire elemental lord, but you'll be facing him in a vastly weakened state within Molten Core. You'll no doubt defeat him here, but he returns to threaten Azeroth again from within the &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that Ragnaros will knock you airborne, and thus can represent something of a threat even to high level players.\nIf you're in the market for Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros, then keep your eyes peeled for the &lt;a href=\"%3AEye%20of%20Sulfuras\"&gt;:Eye of Sulfuras&lt;/a&gt; among the items he drops. Combining the Eye with a &lt;a href=\"%3ASulfuron%20Hammer\"&gt;:Sulfuron Hammer&lt;/a&gt; will reward you with the Legendary hammer. Ragnaros doesn't drop any Tier 1 armor, but if you want to complete a set of Tier 2 raid gear for Transmogrification purposes, Ragnaros is where you get the Tier 2 leg items.\nUpon defeating Ragnaros and watching the great hammer Sulfuras dunk itself in his magma pool, your journey is over. That wraps up our walk-through of Molten Core, but that's not the end. We'll be pointing out the highlights of more older raids in the future.\nIn the meantime, have you visited Molten Core recently, and if so, what were you there to achieve? Do you have any tips or warnings for players who might be attempting Molten Core below level 90?"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nOur latest zone preview takes us into the expansive hills and rocky outcroppings of Nagrand, a verdant land located west of &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; and south of &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Here, great beasts cause the ground to quake beneath their feet, and the &lt;a href=\"Raider\"&gt;wolf riders&lt;/a&gt; of the \u2014the legendary &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt; led by himself\u2014are always on the prowl. But they're not the only ones who make this verdant land their home. We sat down with Senior Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Maloof\"&gt;Eric Maloof&lt;/a&gt; and Associate Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Kurt%20Sparkuhl\"&gt;Kurt Sparkuhl&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.\nZone Music Piece: Mountains of Nagrand \u2013 Night by Clint Bajakian\nQ. How is the Nagrand of Draenor different from the Nagrand people know from Outland? What's the story in this zone?\nEric Maloof: I think players will find that the Nagrand of isn't really all that different in spirit from the &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There are some obvious physical differences\u2014for example, the floating islands aren't there anymore\u2014but you'll easily be able to see where those floating islands came from. We very much wanted to respect what people really enjoyed about their experience in Nagrand in &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and capture that, while still providing a twist to what you'll experience there.\nYou'll be led to Nagrand by a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; you'll receive in your &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; that involves sending new supplies to the front. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u2014not working together, of course\u2014are trying to establish a toehold in the zone in order to take on the Warsong clan. The Warsong clan has had problems with the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s in the past, but they're really the top power here.\nThe Alliance will be working alongside characters such as &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Yrel\"&gt;Vindicator Yrel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20D%27kaan\"&gt;Rangari D'kaan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hansel%20Heavyhands\"&gt;Hansel&lt;/a&gt; as they progress through the storyline. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; will be working alongside &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, , , and \u2014even &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt; will show up and surprise Thrall.\nKurt Sparkuhl: Players will also have the opportunity to return to the . Without spoiling too much, the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; balance has been disrupted, and the elementals upon the plateau have become unstable. It will be up to players to unravel the mystery behind the disturbance before it's too late.\nOne of the things that sets Nagrand apart from any other zone is the amount of character-focused stories you'll encounter. The zone is just filled to the brim with story. There's the main story and what's going on in the Throne of Elements, but we've added in a lot of additional Easter eggs and tons of cameos and backstory on old favorites, so keep an eye out as you go through the zone. You'll also meet a new faction here.\nQ. How would you describe the zone's ambience? What's it like?\nKurt Sparkuhl: It feels like old Nagrand. Out of all the zones, it's the one that's supposed to feel the most familiar. When &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; became Outland, Nagrand was probably the area affected least by the world breaking apart. Now you'll see all these big canyons and rocky outcroppings all over the zone, implying that after the big explosion happened and Draenor turned into Outland, those floating islands were kind of what was left of those big ridges. There was a conscious effort to make it feel familiar to some extent, while still creating something new.\nEric Maloof: You'll encounter a lot of new points of interest in this version of Nagrand. There are some things that are no longer there, too\u2014&lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;, for example, don't exist. These were created after Outland became what it did. &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt; takes up a large portion of the zone, and it houses a Raid instance as well. It's massive.\nQ. Which locations would you say are some of your favorites, and why?\nEric Maloof: This one's tough. There are so many good places to choose from. I'm definitely partial to &lt;a href=\"Lok-rath\"&gt;Lok-Rath&lt;/a&gt;. It's located outside the main Warsong base and is the Warsong clan's main presence in the zone. I like the story of what's happening there and the dynamic change in the questing once you get there. Plus, it's a beautiful Warsong location.\nI also really like the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Woods\"&gt;Spirit Woods&lt;/a&gt;. In Outland, you had the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Fields\"&gt;Spirit Fields&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Spirit Woods are what surround . You get to learn more about the forces that dwell there and what they're doing\u2014we explain that a bit as you're taking care of business.\nKurt Sparkuhl: I think the two I like the most are &lt;a href=\"Hallvalor\"&gt;Hallvalor&lt;/a&gt; and the . Hallvalor\u2014which became the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;-inhabited &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Ruins\"&gt;Burning Blade Ruins&lt;/a&gt; in Outland\u2014is super cool; we get to see more of the backstory of the , which we haven't gotten to show before. We get to see how their clan operates and some of their traditions. There are some familiar faces\u2014at least &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; in particular\u2014 that you're going to get a lot of backstory on.\nThe great thing about the Ring of Trials is that players get to see it a bit earlier on in its existence and learn more about why it's there and what its purpose is. It's been built up as a sort of neutral hub, and players will be able to interact with all sorts of &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s from all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and Draenor\u2014it's pretty cool, but I don't want to spoil too much.\nQ. What outposts will players be able to build in Nagrand, and how do they impact the Garrison?\nEric Maloof: The Alliance and the Horde get the choice of two different buildings. You'll get access to this decision early on, though your blueprints are waylaid by the Warsong at the start, so you're going to need to recover those first. You'll be able to build either a Corral or a Tankworks for your &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the Corral, you'll get either a &lt;a href=\"Talbuk\"&gt;Talbuk&lt;/a&gt; on the Alliance or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20wolf\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; on the Horde, which you can ride all the time while you're in Nagrand\u2014this is where mounted combat comes into play. If you build the Tankworks, the Alliance gets a &lt;a href=\"Siege%20engine\"&gt;Siege Engine&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde gets a &lt;a href=\"Demolisher\"&gt;Demolisher&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere's plenty to see and explore in Nagrand\u2014though we wouldn't recommend idling too long on the road when the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outrider%20%28Nagrand%29\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; are making their rounds."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nAfter a high-stakes chase across the seas, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; find themselves facing an ancient enemy who has long been lurking in the depths: &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and her fearsome &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; army. With their ships decimated by Azshara's ambush, the Alliance and Horde must establish a new base of operations and join forces with new allies in the perilous realm of Nazjatar. \nBefore you can begin your journey to Nazjatar, you'll need to reach level 120 and complete the quest Unlocking the World, which grants access to World Quests in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20Azshara\"&gt;Rise of Azshara&lt;/a&gt; arrives, you'll receive a summons from either &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, setting in motion the events that will lead you to Nazjatar.\nAfter Azshara's catastrophic assault leaves your ship in ruins, you'll wake up among the wreckage to an unfathomable sight: a massive hole in the sea where previously there was only ocean. Your first order of business will be to search for survivors\u2014but Azshara's army is still on the hunt, and before long you'll need to traverse impossible cliffs and waterfalls in search of a safe haven. With the help of newfound allies known as the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde will find refuge in &lt;a href=\"Newhome\"&gt;Newhome&lt;/a&gt; in the southern portion of Nazjatar, while the Alliance will join forces with the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade Ankoan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mezzamere\"&gt;Mezzamere&lt;/a&gt; just to the northwest.\nOnce you've established your base of operations, you'll need to progress through the zone's story line before you can engage in the wider array events and activites across Nazjatar. Shortly after Horde players reach the quest &lt;a href=\"%3ADown%20Into%20Nazjatar\"&gt;:Down Into Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; and Alliance players reach the quest &lt;a href=\"%3AA%20Brief%20Respite\"&gt;:A Brief Respite&lt;/a&gt;, you'll unlock access to a vast amount of content throughout the zone\u2014and Nazjatar is yours to explore.\nNazjatar is a dangerous and beautiful place, filled with coral forests and unfathomable deep-sea creatures skittering through passageways and clinging to rockfaces. Secrets that have remained submerged for millennia are now exposed to the surface world, including the ancient ruins of &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, the once-glorious capital of the &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;. Further in the depths, the beautiful and terrible city of the naga\u2014and the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;palace&lt;/a&gt; of the Queen of Tides herself\u2014awaits.\nMeet Your New Friends.\nTo help navigate the perils of Nazjatar, Alliance heroes will join forces with the Waveblade Ankoan, a faction of deep-sea &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s skilled in surviving the dangers of the ocean. Meanwhile, Horde heroes will find worthy allies in the Unshackled, a disparate group of &lt;a href=\"makura\"&gt;makura&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sea%20giant\"&gt;sea giant&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"gilgoblin\"&gt;gilgoblin&lt;/a&gt;s who have banded together to seize their freedom from enslavement by the naga.\nAs you provide aid to your new allies and prove your worth, your new friends will return the favor by offering the services of their most seasoned warriors and &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. These special combat allies will journey alongside you as you face the hazards of Nazjatar, growing in power as you complete their special &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014and ultimately unlocking new abilities and rewards.\nEarning &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the Waveblade Ankoan or the Unshackled will provide access to new items that can be purchased from their quartermasters using gold or &lt;a href=\"Prismatic%20Manapearl\"&gt;Prismatic Manapearl&lt;/a&gt;s. For example, Alliance players will be able to tame and ride the mighty &lt;a href=\"%3AAnkoan%20Waveray\"&gt;:Ankoan Waveray&lt;/a&gt; when reaching &lt;a href=\"Exalted\"&gt;Exalted&lt;/a&gt; with their allies. You'll be able to earn reputation and additional rewards by completing World Quests, taking part in daily activities, hunting rare and powerful creatures, and more as you explore the expanse of Nazjatar.\nNew Benthic Gear.\nAs you explore Nazjatar, you'll collect Prismatic Manapearls, a new kind of soulbound currency you can spend to purchase &lt;a href=\"Benthic\"&gt;Benthic&lt;/a&gt; tokens and upgrades. These bind-to-account tokens grant a piece of upgradable Benthic gear specific to your armor type (&lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"plate\"&gt;plate&lt;/a&gt;), starting at item level 385. With enough time and effort, players can dedicate their hard-earned Manapearls to upgrade pieces to ilvl 425, just shy of Heroic-level raid gear (ilvl 430). Learn more about Benthic Gear in our earlier preview.\nNew PvE Events.\n&lt;a href=\"Summons%20from%20the%20Depths\"&gt;Summons from the Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile in Nazjatar, Queen Azshara will periodically rally her naga forces to summon forth a powerful creature from the depths for a zone-wide event. Each such event will occur in two phases: The first phase will require you to clear out some of Queen Azshara's elite naga forces within a limited amount of time, while the second phase will require players to work together to defeat the monstrosity the naga have called. Keep an eye out for a skull-shaped icon on your map indicating that one of these events is underway.\nAzshara's Elite Commanders.\nFrom time to time, players will be called upon to face five of Azshara's elite commanders, who will appear in various locations throughout Nazjatar (available only when &lt;a href=\"War%20Mode\"&gt;War Mode&lt;/a&gt; is off). Defeating any of these five formidable foes will provide you with Prismatic Manapearls\u2014and the more you take down, the more Manapearls you'll have to spend at your favorite &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew PvP Event: Battle for Nazjatar.\nPlayers who have War Mode enabled in Nazjatar will be able to take part in a new PvP event to earn rewards and achievements. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Nazjatar\"&gt;Battle for Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; event, the Horde and the Alliance will need to coordinate their forces to capture and hold five points across the zone: &lt;a href=\"Alathir%20Spire\"&gt;Ala'thir Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lemor%27athra%20Spire\"&gt;Lemor'athra Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoras%27tal%20Spire\"&gt;Thoras'tal Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tidal%20Conflux\"&gt;Tidal Conflux&lt;/a&gt;, and Zin-Azshari.\nOnce towers are captured, the Horde and Alliance will begin to accumulate points for each tower under their control. The first faction to reach 10,000 points, or whoever has the most points at the end of 45 minutes, will claim victory.\nIf you've defeated at least one enemy player during the event, the first win of the day will reward 200 &lt;a href=\"%3AConquest\"&gt;:Conquest&lt;/a&gt; and 10 &lt;a href=\"%3ANazjatar%20Battle%20Commendation\"&gt;:Nazjatar Battle Commendation&lt;/a&gt;s, while the losing faction will still receive a small amount of Conquest and Nazjatar Battle Commendations, which can be exchanged for rewards including the imposing &lt;a href=\"%3AInkscale%20Deepseeker\"&gt;:Inkscale Deepseeker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew World Bosses.\nWhile exploring this dangerous new territory, keep your eyes out for two new World Bosses: &lt;a href=\"Ulmath%2C%20the%20Soulbinder\"&gt;Ulmath, the Soulbinder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wekemara\"&gt;Wekemara&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew Raid Dungeon: The Eternal Palace.\nYour journeys in Nazjatar will ultimately lead to Queen Azshara's seat of power in The Eternal Palace, a new raid featuring 8 new bosses, including the Queen of Tides' most devoted champions. Learn more about this new raid and its release schedule in our &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/The%20Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;preview&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Nazjatar, you'll experience the next chapter in the ongoing story of Battle for Azeroth, come face-to-face with long-forgotten legends, and earn a trove of treasures, mounts, &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s, and more along the way. Prepare to brave the dangers of Nazjatar when Rise of Azshara arrives on June 25!"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nOnce the shining heart of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; civilization, Nazmir is now a bleak swamp riddled with ruined reminders of its former greatness. In the current troll capital of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, stories are passed down from generation to generation cautioning children to behave, lest Nazmir's twisted practioners of &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; come to snatch them from their beds. And those who dare brave the swamp have a terrible habit of disappearing, never to return. The &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s of Nazmir are the monsters that haunt every &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"child\"&gt;child&lt;/a&gt;'s nightmares\u2014and for good reason.\nWelcome to Nazmir. \nNazmir is a primordial swampland, replete with a diverse ecology of insects and dangerous beasts. Many of the once grand temples and buildings now lay in ruins, scattered throughout the region like broken teeth. Vegetation has encroached upon the stone walls and buildings, reclaiming the land piece by piece. Your treacherous journey alongside Princess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; begins along one of Nazmir's many broken and waterlogged pathways.\nIt is here that the blood trolls perform vile rituals in tribute to their blood god &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'Huun&lt;/a&gt;. While the Zandalari King &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; and his advisors have ignored this threat for too long, his daughter, Princess Talanji, is prepared to take this menace head-on\u2014and aligning with the four loa in Nazmir may be the only answer.\nYour first mission: seek out the bat &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hi'reek&lt;/a&gt;, the loa of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt; loa &lt;a href=\"Torga\"&gt;Torga&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt; loa &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt;, and appeal to them for help\u2014if they can give it.\nThe blood trolls present a serious threat to the Zandalari. With the power of their blood god, they seek to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;great troll nation&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and potentially spread beyond their island borders. They fuel their &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; with profane blood rituals, harnessing &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; monstrosities to do their bidding. Many who enter the swamps do not leave, instead becoming a sacrifice to G'huun.\nSodden marshes and tributaries mark the landscape of Nazmir, fed by the grand waterfalls spilling from the cliffs of Zuldazar high above. The &lt;a href=\"Razorjaw%20River\"&gt;Razorjaw River&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20River\"&gt;Shattered River&lt;/a&gt; both wind through Nazmir as well, contributing to the marshes and wetlands that dominate the region.\nEach step in your search for the loa of this region will take you further into the heart of blood troll territory\u2014and provide an opportunity to demonstrate to the Zandalari the value of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as their allies.\nLoa Do Call to You.\nAllying with Bwonsamdi, the Loa of Death, comes with advantages. But as with any deal with death, it also comes at a steep price. \nIn the area surrouding Bwonsamdi's temple, blood troll strongholds and villages burble with the blood of their victims, and evidence of their depravities mar the landscape. These signs serve as a warning and declaration that the blood trolls are to be feared\u2014that they are the ultimate power within Nazmir, and that those who do not bend to their will will be destroyed.\nYou won't be the only one braving the fury of the blood trolls, however. Always in search of a good story, the &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s make a regular pilgrimage to visit the turtle loa Torga despite the omnipresent danger the blood trolls pose. Don't let their enthusiasm for a rousing yarn fool you, though; they are able allies in the fight against the blood trolls\u2014especially if they think they'll emerge with a worthwhile tale to tell.\nBlessings of the loa be upon you as you make your way ultimately into the &lt;a href=\"Underrot\"&gt;Underrot&lt;/a&gt; (a 5-player &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; in Nazmir)\u2014you're going to need it as you take on the horrors that fester within.\nA vast coastline surrounds Nazmir to the north and east, with the Shattered River demarking the southern border along Zuldazar, all offering bountiful opportunities for fishing, hunting, swimming, and treasure hunting. To the west you'll find the bubbling &lt;a href=\"Shoaljai%20Tar%20Pits\"&gt;Shoaljai Tar Pits&lt;/a&gt;, where the cloying scent of smoke drifts up from vents within the earth, choking the air with a haze of ash and dust. Just west of the tar pits on the westernmost border, the pathway into the arid desert of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; awaits, offering even more opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Zandalari."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nAmong the necrolords, strength is rewarded and weakness cast aside. The souls of the ambitious and contentious are forged into an immortal army charged with the defense of the Shadowlands.\nIn the birthplace of necromantic magic, those who master the powers of death turn legions of ambitious souls into relentless armies. Should you join the Necrolords, you will take on the role of protector of the Shadowlands and carry the weight of a divided house upon your shoulders. But are you the one that prophecy has foretold?\nIf you\u2019re a believer in the power of might? Then the Necrolords Covenant just may be where you place your loyalties within the Shadowlands.\nRenown Rewards.\nAs you\u2019re put through your paces and prove your mettle to the Necrolords through their Covenant Campaign, you\u2019ll build Renown. Increasing Renown will provide you access to unique rewards from your Covenant. Learn more about Renown in our Covenant Systems article.\nIn your pursuit to earn Renown, you\u2019ll go into the Maw to recover wayward souls and bring them to your Covenant Sanctum; some will even embark on Adventures on your behalf.\nCovenant Sanctum: The Seat of Primus.\nWhen you join the Necrolord Covenant, you\u2019ll gain access to the Seat of Primus, a unique Sanctum available only to their members. As their seat of power, it\u2019s here that you\u2019ll meet with key figures, take on new quests, and store Anima. As you progress through the Necrolord campaign, you\u2019ll also have opportunity to upgrade additional features within your Sanctum.\nEach of the four Covenants have features that they share among them, but they also have a feature that is uniquely their own. For the Necrolord Covenant, it\u2019s the Abomination Factory.\nAbomination Factory.\nDuring the first weeks of the Necrolord Covenant Campaign, you\u2019ll be introduced to Rathan and Emeni, who you will work with to establish a small community known as the Butchers Block. It\u2019s here that various constructs loyal to the Seat of the Primus gather and where you\u2019ll unlock a new crafting system\u2014Abominable Stitching.\nYou\u2019ll need to gather a variety of resources to begin your journey into mastering fleshwork and bringing a variety of constructs to life. Each of these constructs will become residents of the Butcher Block, adding their own unique personalities, quests, and (in some cases) companionship on your adventures.\nMixing Pools.\nWe hope you\u2019re not too squeamish, because there\u2019s literal buckets of slime in your future if you choose to join the Necrolord Covenant. You\u2019ll work with other players to convey buckets of colorful slime to a mixing pool, which will summon a repeatable boss event based on which colors you\u2019ve coordinated.\nAbominable Transportation.\nThe Necrolords have a truly unique method of traversing around Maldraxxus. With a little elbow grease and a few extra spare parts, you can utilize the Abomination Factory to create a friend to carry you wherever your adventures take you. Whether you want them to carry you on their shoulders (complete with their tiny top hat), or just want to tool around through the immaculately maintained fields of Bastion, you\u2019ll travel in ultimate style.\nIf staying on the ground isn\u2019t your thing, you may want to set your sights on the Necropolis high above. It makes a circuit around the zone and may inspire a little goblin ingenuity.\nNecrolord Adventures.\nIn Adventures, you\u2019ll put your tactical skills to the test by sending your allies into the Shadowlands and lending aid to the Necrolords Covenant. While this feature is available to each Covenant, the allies you recruit and the missions you give them will be unique to the Covenant. You\u2019ll need to get to know the strength and weaknesses of those you send out with the scouting map.\nAnima Conductor.\nPlayers can enable additional content with their Covenant\u2019s realm by investing Anima into specific areas in Maldraxxus. When you restore Anima to a location, it revitalizes the area, allowing you to access new quests, make it easier for you to unearth wondrous treasures, or lure out powerful foes to slay for rewards. Different areas are tied to different content unlocks.\nThe Strongest of Soulbinds.\nOnce you\u2019ve proven your worth, you\u2019ll unlock the ability to Soulbind with one of several select characters in the Covenant, who will share their distinctive powers with you in the form of a variety of traits and bonuses.\nThe warforged necrolords you assisted in Maldraxxus will form a special bond with you if you join their Covenant. Below are descriptions of each along with a few example powers they can bestow upon you.\nPlague Deviser Marileth is as eccentric as he is brilliant, and created some of the most efficacious potions in all of Maldraxxus. When the House of Plagues was destroyed, Marileth was driven mad in the aftermath. Marileth\u2019s creative solutions prove vital to the war effort . . . despite the occasional side effect. \nEmeni, the Slaughter Daughter was assembled in the stitchyards of Maldraxxus. In life, she was a powerful noble who slaughtered hundreds of her siblings to claim the throne. She respects your strength and prowess as you work together to exterminate their mutual enemies. A legend in her own right, her notoriety rises even higher as she binds her soul to the Maw Walker\u2019s.\nBonesmith Heirmir is the Primus\u2019s apprentice and among the oldest mortal souls in Maldraxxus. With eons of training and practice, she is the foremost expert on forging weapons and armor made of bone and steel. The arsenals she creates keep the House of the Chosen and you fully equipped to face the enemies that surround them.\nMight of the Necrolords.\nWhen you join the Necrolord Covenant, you\u2019ll gain two new unique abilities\u2014one signature ability and one class ability.\nSignature abilities are available to all Covenant members regardless of class, race, or specialization.\nCovenant class abilities provide additional combat-oriented gameplay options that are tailored to the theme of that Covenant.\nWe look forward to sharing more information as development continues, and we hope this preview gives you some insight on what the Necrolord Covenant has to offer\u2014or what you can offer them.

Search &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; for the new quest, \u201c&lt;a href=\"A%20Call%20to%20Action%20%28quest%29\"&gt;A Call to Action&lt;/a&gt;\u201d, to begin a quest line to discover the depth of Helya's influence well beyond &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20Harbor\"&gt;Tideskorn Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nYour primary goal will be to unlock new &lt;a href=\"Helya%27s%20Conquest\"&gt;Helarjar World Quests&lt;/a&gt;. These will then appear for you all across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, so you can help put a stop to Helya's infernal impact.\nA New Invasion.\nThe coastline of the Broken Isles is under assault from an invasive, predatory species, and they're breeding out of control! These new &lt;a href=\"Falcosaur\"&gt;Falcosaur&lt;/a&gt;s drop &lt;a href=\"Falcosaur%20Egg\"&gt;Falcosaur Egg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Falcosaur%20Feather\"&gt;Falcosaur Feather&lt;/a&gt;s, reagents for new &lt;a href=\"First%20Aid\"&gt;First Aid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cooking\"&gt;Cooking&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s.\nSave an &lt;a href=\"Orphaned%20Falcosaur\"&gt;Orphaned Falcosaur&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt; to begin a journey toward understanding these hungry creatures. You might just earn a unique new mount along the way.\nRaiding with Leashes IV.\nPet Battlers rejoice! The time has finally come to delve into &lt;a href=\"Ulduar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in search of new rare pets and the chance to do battle with a new Celestial foe!\nPictured here: &lt;a href=\"Stardust\"&gt;Stardust&lt;/a&gt; (special encounter), &lt;a href=\"Boneshard\"&gt;Boneshard&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Marrowgar\"&gt;Lord Marrowgar&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;a href=\"G0-R41-0N%20Ultratonk\"&gt;G0-R41-0N Ultratonk&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mimiron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Tentacle\"&gt;Creeping Tentacle&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;).\nStardust the celestial bunny won't come easily. To get your hands on this rapturous &lt;a href=\"rabbit\"&gt;rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, you'll have to first obtain all 16 new pets from bosses across three raid dungeons. Only that impressive act will earn you an invitation (in the mail) to take on &lt;a href=\"Algalon\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; and his legendary pets: &lt;a href=\"Comet%20%28Algalon%27s%20pet%29\"&gt;Comet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Constellatius\"&gt;Constellatius&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Cosmos%20%28pet%29\"&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;. You must then defeat him with a team of your own in glorious battle!\nSomething, Something, Something, Guard Dog.\nWhen he died, the second that &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Weavil\"&gt;Dr. Weavil&lt;/a&gt;'s heart stopped, his ultimate plan was put into motion. After &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s looted his body, a viscous, yellow fluid slowly filled his veins, and jumper cables were implanted to shock him back to . . . life. Was this undeath? Alchemical engineering? No one is quite sure, but it left him sallow-skinned and over four times as evil as before.\nWhat's worse, he started an internship program.\nReturn to &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Isle&lt;/a&gt; to get to the bottom of Dr. Weavil's insidious plans, and perhaps you'll take home a nice souvenir. These include:\nThe &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s are tameable. You just have to get to them.\nGetting there won't be easy. Dr. Weavil kind of went nuts and covered Alcaz Isle with anti-aircraft artillery (so you can't fly), proximity mines (so you can't run in a straight line), and defensive turrets (so you can't think straight). Make it past those and you'll still have to overcome his interns: &lt;a href=\"Leper%20gnome\"&gt;Drudge Gnome&lt;/a&gt;s who mindlessly work for the little big guy.\nAnd then there's Dr. Weavil himself\u2014just waiting for you in his compound, which probably has a guard dog.\nIt has a guard dog.\nFor more on World of Warcraft Patch 7.1: Return to Karazhan, check out our preview video and the recent Q&amp;A with Game Director &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt;."}

The Darkmoon Faire isn\u2019t what it used to be and it isn\u2019t where it used to be. The management hasn\u2019t changed but the Faire certainly has. It\u2019s a whole new animal. Tickets? You don\u2019t need those old tickets, just rip \u2018em right up, \u2018cause we\u2019ve got new tickets!

Things have changed \u2018round here: we\u2019ve got an island all to ourselves now, and what an island it is. Mist-shrouded Darkmoon Island is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma. It\u2019s a place of mystery and wonder, and you wouldn\u2019t believe the deals we made to get it\u2026 or who we made \u2018em with. But never mind that, just follow me right through here and I\u2019ll show you what the Darkmoon Faire is all about.\nAll new! All spectacular!\nCatch a show at the marvelous main stage or witness a dazzling fireworks display. But don\u2019t stare too long or you might miss the stunning spectacles that surround you. Gaze in awe of our magical menagerie, get your fortune told by the amazing &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt;, go on a pony ride, experience the healthful effects of carnival food, and more!\nOf course, there\u2019s more to the Darkmoon Faire than just fantastic shows and culinary delights. You can still turn in your &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Cards\"&gt;Darkmoon Cards&lt;/a&gt;, but you wouldn\u2019t just come here for measly ol\u2019 cards when there\u2019s so much more to see, experience, and win.

All it takes to earn these fabulous rewards is a few &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%20Prize%20Ticket\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire Prize Ticket&lt;/a&gt;s and a good &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the carnies. How do ya get your grubby mitts on some tickets? I\u2019m glad you asked!\nStep right up! Try your luck! Everyone\u2019s a winner!\nHave we got games?

Once a month, you\u2019ve got a shot at tickets, and the fun never stops \u2018cause you can play as many times as you like. But that\u2019s not the only way to win big!\nThe Darkmoon Faire Field Guide.\nIt\u2019s your passport to riches, my friend. Y\u2019see, we need a few things \u2014 just some junk, nothing valuable to a big hero like you. We call \u2018em Darkmoon Artifacts, and there\u2019s all different kinds to be found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Field%20Guide\"&gt;Darkmoon Field Guide&lt;/a&gt; helps you discover artifacts while you\u2019re explorin\u2019 &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, slayin\u2019 monsters, and fightin\u2019 in &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. Without a guide, you\u2019d never notice \u2018em, and it\u2019ll help keep you focused on the stuff we want. Whether you just reached level 10, or you\u2019ve crushed the biggest baddies in the land, we need somethin\u2019 from nearly everybody. You won\u2019t have to go too far out of your way to get \u2018em and each month you\u2019ll get a new opportunity to seek out an Artifact for us. What do you get out of the deal? Don\u2019t you worry, you\u2019ll get your cut. When you bring a Darkmoon Artifact back to us, you\u2019ll get valuable experience (it builds character, you know!), earn a better reputation, and possibly earn precious Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets too!\nOh, did I mention that you can use the Field Guide to get to Darkmoon Island whenever the Darkmoon Faire\u2019s monthly extravaganza is up and running?\nSo, you want to work in show business?\nMaybe you\u2019d like a little peek behind the scenes, eh? Want to see what it takes to run the greatest show on Azeroth? Well, it\u2019s not all sunshine and cotton candy, my friend. There are &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s to heal, &lt;a href=\"food\"&gt;food&lt;/a&gt; to cook, and buildings to fix. If you\u2019re willing help keep the show going and put your skills to work, you\u2019ll not only impress us, but you can get experience, Darkmoon Prize Tickets, and even polish up your skills \u2014 up to five skill points per profession, per Faire week, if you\u2019re good at what you do!\nDarkmoon Deathmatch!\nLike any good carnival, the Darkmoon Faire has a shady side. You can leave the skilled labor to the suckers and go for a faster score instead. If you\u2019ve got the minerals, the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Deathmatch\"&gt;Darkmoon Deathmatch&lt;/a&gt; offers an experience unparalleled since the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pitmaster%20Pei\"&gt;Pitmaster Pei&lt;/a&gt; has a big old &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Treasure%20Chest\"&gt;treasure chest&lt;/a&gt; just brimming with goodies and Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets that he\u2019ll drag out into the Darkmoon Deathmatch Pit every three hours or so. Everybody wants it, so if you want a piece of the action you\u2019ll just have to jump in and prove that you\u2019re the toughest one in the Pit.\nOh, the Faire is perfectly safe, Clem. Just don\u2019t wander into the woods..\nNow, now, don\u2019t panic. Darkmoon Isle might be a bit spooky, but except for the Deathmatch Pit, the Faire itself is completely safe, I guarantee it. It\u2019s a sanctuary even, and we won\u2019t let anybody\u2019s beef ruin the fun. The shadowy woods surroundin\u2019 the fair are another thing entirely, though. I wouldn\u2019t say that people have disappeared into those woods never to return, but, well\u2026 people disappear into those woods never to return. So watch your step , and your back, when you leave the Faire. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn ya!\nMark your calendar.\nNow that you know how amazing the new Darkmoon Faire is, you won\u2019t want to miss it. Just take a look at your in-game &lt;a href=\"calendar\"&gt;calendar&lt;/a&gt;, and the Darkmoon Faire dates will show up there on the first week of every month. Darkmoon Faire barkers and displays will also pop up in every capital city to herald the arrival of the Faire. &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; himself has even started up a mailer to make sure that no one misses out!\nHitch a ride.\nDuring the first week of each month, convenient Darkmoon Faire outposts with Darkmoon Portals will appear in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, offering free rides to Darkmoon Island and the Faire!\n&lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Mage\"&gt;Darkmoon Mage&lt;/a&gt;s in capital cities and on Darkmoon Island will also be around to help you get between the Faire and various capital cities. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, so naturally you\u2019re obliged to compensate them for their services.\nThe all new Darkmoon Faire is coming to Darkmoon Island in patch 4.3. Don\u2019t miss it!"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae Covenant&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nIn the realm of Ardenweald, where spirits of nature are reborn, you will help shape the fate of the night fae by protecting their sacred groves against the vile Drust.\nIf you choose to return to this twilit realm as an ally of the Night Fae Covenant, the friendships you cultivated during your time in Ardenweald will be ready to take the next step.\nRenown Rewards.\nAs you progress through the Night Fae Covenant Campaign and complete tasks for your new allies, you\u2019ll build Renown. Increasing Renown will provide you access to unique rewards from your Covenant.\nIn your pursuit to earn Renown, you\u2019ll go into the Maw to recover wayward souls and bring them to your Covenant Sanctum; some of these souls will even embark on Adventures on your behalf!\nLearn more about Renown in our Covenant Systems article.\nCovenant Sanctum: Heart of the Forest.\nWhen you join the Night Fae Covenant, you\u2019ll have access to Heart of the Forest, a unique Sanctum available only to their members. As their seat of power, it\u2019s here that you\u2019ll meet with key figures, take on new quests, and store Anima. As you progress through the Night Fae campaign, you\u2019ll also have the opportunity to work on additional feature upgrades within your Sanctum.\nEach of the four Covenants have features that they share among them, but they also have a feature that is patently unique to them. For the Night Fae Covenant, it\u2019s the Queen\u2019s Conservatory.\nQueen\u2019s Conservatory.\nAll members of the Night Fae Covenant can access the Queen\u2019s Conservatory, a celestial garden where they will harness the power of rebirth that flows through Ardenweald to help the souls of ancient deities to return to life.\nDuring your adventures in the Shadowlands, you will come across the preserved souls of celestial spirits from across the cosmos. Within the Queen\u2019s Conservatory you will find the power to aid you in restoring those souls to their former glory.\nTo do so you will work with the Queen\u2019s Warden to nurture the ancient souls back to strength using the magic of the Wildseeds of Ardenweald. Inside the garden of the Queen\u2019s Conservatory you will have access to two types of plots\u2014the Wildseed Pods themselves, and Catalyst Plots. You can plant different catalysts in the plots connected to each Wildseed to infuse that seed with extra strength. Each type of catalyst will provide a different type of bonus to the regrowth process.\nOne catalyst might reduce the incubation time required to restore a soul, while others may influence the amount or quality of the reward cache you receive from each restored soul. For once restored to their full strength, the restored deity will show their gratitude with a reward cache, which can contain anything from resources to special cosmetics, such as pets and mounts.\nManaging the various Wildseeds and plots allows you to try to maximize the efficiency of your garden. Learning the best ways to use and place your catalysts will be the key to unlocking the true potential of the Queen\u2019s Conservatory.\nTravel System: Fae Circles.\nNight Fae players are able to enlist the aid of Marasmius, an ancient and venerable member of the Court of Night who serves as the living transportation network of Ardenweald. As you restore the Sanctum, you\u2019ll help Marasmius repair himself, unlocking new transportation network tiers that grant access to mushroom rings around Ardenweald\u2014including places that can only be accessed by the mushroom network.\nThere are three tiers of Anima Transport that you\u2019ll unlock over time by increasing your Renown Level. Here are some examples:\nNight Fae Adventures.\nYou\u2019ll put your tactical skills to the test by sending your allies into the Shadowlands and lending aid to the Night Fae Covenant. While this feature is available to each Covenant, the allies you recruit and the missions you send them on will be unique to the Covenant. You\u2019ll need to get to know the strength and weaknesses of those you send out with the scouting map.\nAnima Conductor.\nPlayers can enable additional content with their Covenant\u2019s realm by investing Anima into specific areas in Ardenweald. When you restore Anima to a location, it revitalizes the area, allowing you to access new quests, making it easier for you to unearth wondrous treasures, or luring powerful foes which can be slain for rich rewards. Different areas are tied to different content unlocks.\nMeet Your Night Fae Soulbinds.\nOnce you\u2019ve proven your worth, you\u2019ll unlock the ability to Soulbind with one of several select characters in the Covenant, who will share their distinctive powers with you in the form of a variety of traits and bonuses.\nThe cunning night fae you befriended in Ardenweald will form a special bond with you if you join their Covenant. Below are descriptions of each along with a few example powers they bestow upon you.\nNiya is a sylvar who was tasked with guarding and caring for the wildseeds in her grove, whom you met in a time of tragedy as her grove was left to wither so that its anima could be reclaimed. As she journeyed with you, Niya learned the hard truths of survival admidst the drought. An expert hunter and tracker, her skills will aid resolving the drought, and the other threats to Ardenweald.\nDreamweaver is a calm and serene faerie who\u2019s adept at peering into the dreams of nature spirits who slumber within the forest\u2019s wildseeds as they await their rebirth. Dreamweaver helped you form a bond with one particular wildseed whose sleeping spirit reached out. His healing powers provide support as Ardenweald is besieged by outside forces.\nKorayn, a huntress of the Wild Hunt, is a strong-willed leader and ferocious fighter. Tasked with protecting the forest from the most dangerous and elusive threats, she will not rest until her quarry is slain and Ardenweald\u2019s safety is secured. When Hibernal Hollow came under attack, it is Korayn\u2019s leadership and resolve that helped win the day.\nPower of the Night Fae.\nWhen you join the Night Fae Covenant, you\u2019ll gain two new unique abilities\u2014one signature ability and one class ability.\nSignature abilities are available to all Covenant members regardless of class, race, or specialization.\nCovenant Class Abilities provide additional combat-oriented gameplay options that are tailored to the theme of that Covenant.\nWe look forward to sharing more information as development continues, and we hope this preview gives you a taste of what the Night Fae Covenant has to offer. Learn more about Ardenweald in our previously published article.\n\"Rewards, mechanics, and abilities are still in development and subject to change, so be sure to check back for periodic updates on worldofwarcraft.com as we approach the release of Shadowlands.\""}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nWelcome to Oribos.\nThe city of Oribos serves as the crossroads of the Shadowlands. Here, mortal souls are judged by the Arbiter before being sent to their final destinations, and shadowy denizens swap gossip and anima\u2014the soulborn essence that fuels the Shadowlands.\nYour arrival in Oribos provides a glimmer of hope in a dark time: For reasons no one can explain, the Arbiter has gone dormant and is no longer directing souls to their just afterlives. Instead, every one of them is being damned to the torment of the Maw\u2014a place from which you were the first to successfully escape. As the heroes of the Alliance and the Horde journey through the uncharted realms of Death, Oribos welcomes weary travelers from both factions\u2014but forces them to set aside their differences while inside the citadel\u2019s walls.\nOribos\u2019s Inhabitants.\nMeet the denizens of Oribos.\nThe Soul Stream.\nFlowing through the very center of Oribos is the soul stream, made up of all the mortal souls entering the Shadowlands. Though intended to be judged by the Arbiter and sent to the afterlife each has earned, every soul\u2014noble and villainous alike\u2014is instead heading straight into the Maw.\nRing of Fates.\nNow that mortals roam the Shadowlands, Oribos has attracted Brokers from across the realms of Death come and trade goods within the Hall of Curiosities. Just as in Azeroth\u2019s sanctuary cities, Oribos offers all the services an adventurer would need, such as profession trainers (found within the Hall of Shapes), a bank (Hall of Holding), and PvP vendors. You\u2019ll also be able to access barber shops which will provide updated appearance options for your characters in a future alpha update.\nRing of Transference.\nThough long isolated due to the effects of the anima drought, the Eternal City has once more opened its gates allowing travelers to come in and out of Oribos freely using the portals and flight master\u2019s services within.

{"id": "720908", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=720908", "title": "WoW Blog/Prepare to Engage", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Ashran Preview: Prepare to Engage\", an official blog by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It's about the &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nBuilt upon the remnants of an &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; civilization, Ashran looks deceptively like a nice enough island just off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;. And it probably would be a lovely place to visit if not for the never-ending tug-of-war between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; taking place in the central region of the zone. Then again, this might just be just your kind of excursion.\nAshran offers tons of opportunities for players to engage in a variety of activities, whether they want to go it solo or join a group, slay monsters, or engage in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; with their rival faction. \n&lt;hr&gt;\nBuilding World PvP into Ashran.\nOver the years, players have been asking for more opportunities to engage in &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;, and we've experimented with a variety of approaches to that in places like &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;. Creating opportunities for unscripted, unexpected skirmishes might seem simple on the surface, but they're often difficult to engineer without sacrificing the unpredictable nature of these encounters. In its purest form, world PvP means no boundaries or limitations on when skirmishes break out. When creating areas specifically designated for PvP encounters, gameplay objectives will always have an impact on how people play and engage with each other. In the end, many will choose the path of least resistance to achieve their faction's win condition, and sometimes that path involves simply ignoring other players.\nIn order to create the type of atmosphere that encourages more free-form world PvP in Ashran, we decided to apply lessons we've learned from the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;. By giving players more personal goals and opportunities\u2014such as killing creatures\u2014&lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s are more likely to find themselves spontaneously engaging in PvP to compete for them. We want players to get caught up in the moment and become emotionally invested in the outcome of each new encounter, whether it's just getting the drop on a member of the opposite faction player or getting revenge for a stolen kill. While Ashran still has plenty of objective-based conflict (more on that in a bit), if you want that distinctive flavor of world PvP, the island has that for you too.\nThis Island is No Fantasy.\nLocated off the coast of Tanaan Jungle, Ashran is a large, open PvP zone for players who have reached the max level of 100, and it offers a little something for everyone. Players can reach the island easily a few different ways, including using a flight path or by unlocking quick access within their &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; once it reaches Tier 3. The more daring\u2014or foolhardy\u2014adventurers could also try doggy paddling to the island, but we don't recommend it. (Seriously, we wouldn't try it if we were you. You've been warned. In a world where pretty much everything wants to kill you, you're best off traveling to an island of pure conflict the safest possible way. We really wouldn't steer you wrong on this one.)\nUnlike previous PvP zones, such as &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; or Wintergrasp, no raid group is required to take part in the excitement, and the zone will cap out at approximately 100 players per side, opening the door to some truly epic-sized confrontations. To keep the action amped up, the same large group of regular realms will feed into the zone, so it's likely you'll run into some familiar faces whenever you visit, both friend and foe. There will be plenty of room to roam, as Ashran measures approximately the size of the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;. The intention is to provide as much of a true world PvP experience as we possibly can to those who choose to frequent the island. The odds may not always be in your favor, but with so many places to hunker down to either hide or lie in wait, there are plenty of opportunities to achieve whatever goals you've set forth for yourself.\nThe Lay of the Land.\nAt each end of the island, separate from the conflict enveloping the isle, players will find a small sanctum of relative safety. Full-sized Horde and Alliance hubs sit behind each faction's base, offering pretty much everything a regular city would.\nReady to dive into the fray? One main artery runs through the center of the zone, and it's here that you'll engage in an endless faction tug-of-war. At opposite endpoints, Horde and Alliance bases wait to be captured, and you'll be fighting for control of five additional capture points as you make your way down the lane. Capturing these points along the way will push you and your faction toward the enemy base, making it possible to take the battle all the way to the opposing faction's base. To effectively hamstring your opponents and hobble their efforts for a time, you'll just need to take down their General within their base. Doing so will not only garner you bragging rights, but will also deny the opposing faction access to their General, who serves as a Conquest vendor.\nAt the central hub, the Ogre King stands waiting, flanked by his two bodyguards. Engaging one of the bodyguards and proving your worth in combat will win the Ogre King to your faction's side, and he will fight for you for a time. But beware! His endurance is limited, and the longer he goes undefeated, the more susceptible to damage he becomes.\nAs in many &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt;s, each faction will have a Resource count available to them. Once a faction's Resources drop to 100, they'll get a little extra help via a randomly spawning Captain who will begin to fight for their side. Many of these will bear familiar names such as &lt;a href=\"John%20Swifty\"&gt;Swifty&lt;/a&gt;, who will fight for the Alliance, or &lt;a href=\"Mindbender%20Talbadar\"&gt;Talbadar&lt;/a&gt;, who will fight for the Horde. There's no guarantee who will ultimately come to your aid, however. Each time a side reaches this Resource count, a new random captain will join the fray.\nBeyond the Tug-Of-War.\nThere's more to Ashran than the conflict in the central lane. Around Ashran there are additional points of interest (POIs) and monsters to slay. The various POIs offer a variety of random events which will allow players to win awards for the Horde or Alliance. Buffs can also be earned by killing other players or &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s. There are currently seven POIs set around the edges of Ashran\u2014we'll go into detail on each of these later on down the line.\nRighteous Rewards.\nAs you make your way around Ashran, you'll be collecting currency from other players and from monsters you've slain. This currency can then be turned in at your base for additional bonuses for your faction, such as Mage Portals or a Warlock Gateway. Or you can choose to summon a random\u2014and truly epic\u2014NPC to join in the fight. You'll want to take care, though, and plan your turn-ins accordingly. One losing encounter with a player of the opposite faction can strip you of your hard-fought treasure and have it wind up in their pockets instead.\nYou'll also be able to collect zone-bound items (usable only on the island) to give yourself a little extra advantage as you take on the various challenges around Ashran.\nFor those looking for the next step in gear, Ashran will provide access to Conquest-quality gear that is unavailable elsewhere.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nBuilding on lessons learned from the Timeless Isle and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, we want players who make their way to Ashran to always have something exciting to do, and to offer them a true world PvP experience. Whether your aim is to engage in PvP or take on the various points of interest, there's bound to be something to get your adrenaline going."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nIn Shadowlands, Azeroth\u2019s heroes journey into the realm of the dead after Sylvanas Windrunner tears open the veil between life and death. As they explore four otherworldly zones\u2014Bastion, Maldraxxus, Ardenweald, and Revendreth\u2014players will meet the Covenants that rule the afterlife realms in the Shadowlands. Your final destination in the narrative arc is the shadowy realm of Revendreth.\nWelcome to Revendreth.\nYou arrive with urgent news for Sire Denathrius, the Master of Revendreth and ruler of the Venthyr. The realm is in a midst of a rebellion caused by the anima drought that\u2019s swept over the Shadowlands. The only thing more meaningful than your survival is your discretion \u2014 you\u2019ve walked into a den of secret keepers who are all ears as much as they are all teeth. If you are to deliver this message and save these lands you must play court and trust your instincts, for the Venthyr don\u2019t always mean what they say and your new fickle friends can quickly turn into formidable foes.\nPlace of Pride.\nRevendreth is made up of seven distinct districts, each presided over by a Harvester \u2014 powerful Venthyr who have upheld the ways of this place since creation to encourage spirits to repent for their past sins. Those who are successfully reformed are presented with a choice: Return to Oribos to be sent on to another afterlife, or remain in Revendreth and become one of the Venthyr. As for those who resist redemption? They\u2019re banished to the Maw.\nHome to the most decadent Venthyr loyal to Sire Denathrius, the Castle Ward is dangerous to any who are unwilling to side with the Master. The nobles who reside in the inner citadel are the oldest Venthyr and have earned their place in the shadow of The Master and are kept in order by the Countess, Harvester of Desire.\nRuled over by the Fearstalker, Harvester of Dread, the Forest Ward is comprised of hunting grounds where the Venthyr leach pride (in the form of anima) from their victims. Extraction is simple: Give victims a sense of hope and freedom then hunt them down; a harsh lesson in humility.\nThe first steps of Azeroth\u2019s champions within Revendreth are in the Village Ward, Darkhaven. Lorded over by the Harvester of Envy, this humble hamlet is full of wishful dredgers and Venthyr who aspire to be welcomed into the aristocrats residing in the Castle Ward. Downwind of Castle Nathria, its citizens look on enviously as they toil away in the refuse of soul waste and desiccation of reality while the anima drought decays this place away.\nCastle Nathria.\nLooming above all is Sire Denatrius\u2019s fortress, Castle Nathria. This ancient stronghold houses the Master, his loyalists and\u2014if you listen to the traitorous rebels\u2014something sinister that could shatter societies across the Shadowlands. . .\nRevendreth\u2019s Inhabitants.\nMeet the denizens of Revendreth.\nThese are but a few of the entities you\u2019ll encounter in Revendreth. While adventuring, it's best to stay vigilant\u2014you might even cross paths with long-passed heroes of Azeroth who now wander this world. . .\nVenthyr Covenant.\nWhen players reach maximum level and have explored the first four zones, they\u2019ll be able to pledge themselves to a Covenant, like the Venthyr. Each Covenant offers its champions abilities, along with other powers and cosmetic rewards that can be unlocked through a Covenant Campaign\u2014an epic storyline unique to the faction. This alliance also gives the player access to a Covenant Sanctum, a hall only open to players who have forged a pact with its rulers.\nTo give you an idea of what to expect, you can view a list of the Covenant signature and class abilities \"Please keep in mind that all these are a work in progress and may have additional changes during the course of development and testing, so all abilities shown are subject to change.\"\nThere are more mysteries yet to unravel in Revendreth, and not all as it seems\u2014what the Master says is one thing, and the reality is another matter entirely. As one of Azeroth\u2019s greatest heroes, it falls to you to shine light upon the truth.\nWe look forward to sharing more information as development continues, and we hope this preview prepares you for Revendreth and perhaps selecting the Venthyr Covenant!\nWill you be joining the Venthyr Covenant?

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.1.0\"&gt;Rise of the Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; patch implemented in the game.\nArticle.\n\"In years past, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt;, encompassing the wise and &lt;a href=\"scholar\"&gt;scholar&lt;/a&gt;ly progenitors of the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, heroically assisted the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; with thwarting the nefarious activities of their brethren in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. Yet the chaos unleashed by the recent &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; has reshaped the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;'s philosophy about the world and the dwindling remnants of their &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;. Led by a mysterious prophet known only as &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari have issued a call to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s embattled troll populations: unite into a single mighty &lt;a href=\"empire\"&gt;empire&lt;/a&gt; and save their race from extinction.\"\n\"Thus far, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; trolls have answered the summons and received aid from the Zandalari, allowing them to rebuild their respective capitals in Zul'Gurub and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Not all trolls, however, have so eagerly adopted the Zandalari's grandiose vision of a new troll empire. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; are opposed to the warmongering espoused by Zul. To prevent the burgeoning Gurubashi and Amani troll forces from wreaking havoc on Azeroth, Vol'jin has reached out to his Horde comrades and members of the Alliance for assistance. Should the Darkspears' campaign fail, a new troll empire shall rise and bring war to a world already beset by suffering and conflict.\"\nA Threat Fought in Secret.\nUsing a great deal of discretion, Vol\u2019jin has dispatched Darkspear delegates to the capital cities of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; calling for all able-bodied &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to investigate recent threats that have risen in the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe outlook isn't good. The Gurubashi tribe, their strength renewed, is running rampant throughout Stranglethorn. Players will have a chance to embark on all-new level-85 solo &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s in Stranglethorn and will discover exactly what tribulations lie ahead -- Gurubashi leadership is still largely intact and rehabilitated through the new union with the Zandalari. Along the way, players will assist a sassy, headstrong Darkspear spirit-talker named &lt;a href=\"Bwemba\"&gt;Bwemba&lt;/a&gt;, they'll track down the elusive &lt;a href=\"Hemet%20Nesingwary\"&gt;Hemet Nesingwary&lt;/a&gt;, and they'll encounter many of the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28instance%29\"&gt;new Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt;es throughout the steaming jungles of Stranglethorn.\nRewards for addressing the issues in Stranglethorn include an adorable &lt;a href=\"Panther%20Cub\"&gt;panther pet&lt;/a&gt; of your own to care for. Players should seek out Vol'jin's representatives in Orgrimmar or &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to begin their adventure.\nReturn to Zul'Gurub.\nThis ancient city has once again become the staging grounds for an empowered Gurubashi people to strike against those who they perceive to be invading their ancestral lands. Now backed by the Zandalari, the Gurubashi present all-new challenges for players in this level-85 5-player Heroic &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. While players may see some familiar faces in this dungeon, the encounters and fight mechanics have been considerably updated. For allying yourself with the Darkspears, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Broodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Kilnara\"&gt;High Priestess Kilnara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zanzil\"&gt;Zanzil&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do%20the%20Godbreaker\"&gt;Jin'do the Godbreaker&lt;/a&gt; would like to make one thing clear -- your intrusion will cost you. Take their heads and you\u2019ll be presented with a treasure map. You\u2019ll want to seek out its precious booty, including an account-bound ring with a gem so big it\u2019s visible when worn!\nAlso, for those with a high enough &lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; skill, an additional boss can be unlocked in Zul\u2019Gurub. &lt;a href=\"Gri%27lek\"&gt;Gri'lek&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Renataki\"&gt;Renataki&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hazza%27rah\"&gt;Hazza'rah&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wushoolay\"&gt;Wushoolay&lt;/a&gt; will be randomly selected to put an end to those who dig too deep for greater riches. Should your group survive the challenge, you'll unearth a selection of rewards available from any of the four bosses, as well as loot unique to each boss.\nThe Amani Regrouped.\nWith the aid of the Zandalari, the remaining Amani have reassembled under new, sturdy leadership in &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; has been converted into a challenging level-85 5-player Heroic dungeon. For those who fought &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; back during &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, much of the dungeon will feel similar, but the mechanics have been updated to suit a 5-player group. &lt;a href=\"Akil%27zon\"&gt;Akil'zon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nalorakk\"&gt;Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jan%27alai\"&gt;Jan'alai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halazzi\"&gt;Halazzi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hex%20Lord%20Malacrass\"&gt;Hex Lord Malacrass&lt;/a&gt;, and Daakara look to bring their tribe out of hiding and into the spotlight as a force to be reckoned with. Challengers beware.\nBoth Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub will require players to have a minimum average item level of 346 before they can enter. These two Heroic dungeons will exist in a separate Heroic difficulty tier in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt;, above the current &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; Heroic dungeons. In return, they will offer players item level 353 epic-quality loot. Players can expect to find items for nearly every gear slot available in these two dungeons, though much focus has been placed on offering players itemization for hard-to-fill slots or specializations, such as bracers, helms, shoulders, guns, and wands.\nRare Mounts and More.\nAs with the original iterations of Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman, players will have a chance to obtain updated rare &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s. The &lt;a href=\"%3ASwift%20Zulian%20Panther\"&gt;:Swift Zulian Panther&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%3AArmored%20Razzashi%20Raptor\"&gt;:Armored Razzashi Raptor&lt;/a&gt; are obtained in Zul'Gurub, while the &lt;a href=\"%3AAmani%20Battle%20Bear\"&gt;:Amani Battle Bear&lt;/a&gt; can be earned by killing the first four bosses of Zul'Aman in a limited amount of time.\nThe interests of the Zandalari no longer align with your own. Vol'jin needs your help to stop this play for power. Will you rise to the challenge?"}

Whether you're &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, you'll be able to get in on the action with the use of the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; or by queuing (in the case of Heroics) with two of your friends.\nNew Scenarios.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20in%20the%20Snow\"&gt;Blood in the Snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere is a clear and present danger to the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; isn't going to let slide due to dwarven infighting. It's ultimately &lt;a href=\"Moira\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt;\u2014along with the aid of some Alliance heroes\u2014who step up to the plate to defend their new home, teaching the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;s a lesson in loyalty and the value of fighting together for a common cause. You'll be asked to step forth to aid Moira in this story-driven Scenario.\n\"This Scenario is a part of the Battlefield Barrens storyline.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Heart%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Dark Heart of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nSomething's afoot in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; has sent &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s to excavate a mysterious artifact. However, their efforts seem to have stirred up more than the crew can handle on their own. Your mission (should you choose to accept it) is to go into the Vale and do a little much needed clean-up. Things aren't quite right in the Vale and it seems Garrosh is looking for more leverage in the battle with the Alliance.\n\"This Scenario is a part of the storyline.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20Ragefire\"&gt;Secrets of Ragefire&lt;/a&gt;.\nConcerned with the recent disappearance of his &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; has recruited the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;'s elite &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; unit to investigate. Having tracked the culprit to an abandoned section of &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire&lt;/a&gt;, you'll assist the Gob Squad in their search and help put a stop to whoever is behind these abductions. Doing what Goblins do best, you can bet there will be plenty of explosive action. You know it's serious business when they even call a pool pony into play!\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20on%20the%20High%20Seas\"&gt;Battle on the High Seas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe war between the Horde and Alliance isn't confined to land. You'll need to take to the High Seas in this Scenario and fend off enemy forces to prove your faction's naval might isn't to be trifled with. Once you've made sure the ship is safe, you'll need to swing into action (watch out for rope burns) and make sure the enemy doesn't have a chance to send another boarding party or take another shot. There's more at stake than pride.\nNew Heroic Mode.\nA Heroic difficulty option has been added for Scenarios, allowing those who have the right stuff to ramp up the challenge. This mode is available for the four new Scenarios\u2014Blood in the Snow, Dark Heart of Pandaria, Secrets of Ragefire, and Battle on the High Seas\u2014and two previously released Scenarios\u2014&lt;a href=\"Crypt%20of%20Forgotten%20Kings\"&gt;Crypt of Forgotten Kings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"A%20Brewing%20Storm\"&gt;A Brewing Storm&lt;/a&gt;. To queue for this new mode, you'll need an item level of 480 (ilvl 480) and some well-seasoned (but not too salty) friends to join you.\nTaking on Heroic Scenarios will award &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Point\"&gt;Valor Point&lt;/a&gt;s and a chance to obtain &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt;-quality items. You'll also be able to complete a bonus objective for additional Valor. It's important to note that you'll only be able to earn bonus Valor within Normal or Heroic, but not within both on the same day. Random Heroic Scenarios will reward a &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Cache%20of%20Treasures\"&gt;Heroic Cache of Treasure&lt;/a&gt; and 120 Valor Points for successful completion of the instance."}

He turns his foes' weaknesses against them, leaving his vulnerable adversaries at the mercy of his voracious pets.\nLike others of his ilk, Viceroy Nezhar is obsessed with harnessing the power of the Void to serve his own ambitions. Drawn to the Seat of the Triumvirate by the immense darkness emanating from deep within, Nezhar will stop at nothing to claim it for his own. Given the viceroy's experiments at infusing vessels with the power of shadow, the implications of what he might accomplish on Argus are dire indeed.\nWhen Velen and his followers fled Argus aboard the Genedar, the naaru L'ura stayed behind to buy the draenei time to escape. Kil'jaeden, enraged by this betrayal, ordered the wounded naaru sealed away in the Seat of the Triumvirate. Over the long millennia that passed, L'ura fell from Light to Void. Her elegant song of courage and hope became a shadowy dirge of despair, luring those seeking to lay claim to her power."}

While many of Shadowmoon's denizens study &lt;a href=\"prophecy\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt; among Karabor's ancient stone circles, plotters with darker ambitions lurk in the valley's vast underground cave network, gazing greedily at the sacred temple.\n\"Zone Music Piece: Eternal Night\"\nIn &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Shadowmoon Valley serves as the starting zone for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players once they've endured the initial rigors of &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; and survived their first encounter with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. To take you on a journey through Shadowmoon's forests, temples, and secrets, we've tapped one of the creative minds behind the zone, Senior Designer &lt;a href=\"Helen%20Cheng\"&gt;Helen Cheng&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat's the story in Shadowmoon Valley?\nHelen Cheng: After a daring escape from the Iron Horde in Tanaan Jungle, Alliance players crash land on the northern shores of Shadowmoon Valley.\nThe valley is tranquil and serene. Rolling green hills give way to lush, violet forests. Draenei temples stand proudly beneath a star-studded sky. Here, the draenei have built wonders of their civilization\u2014the town of &lt;a href=\"Elodor\"&gt;Elodor&lt;/a&gt; with its majestic &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Sha%27tar\"&gt;Altar of Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; serves as the proud home of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Exarchs\"&gt;great Exarchs&lt;/a&gt;, while the shining Temple of Karabor acts as the font of all holy learning. Under and &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Akama\"&gt;Exarch Akama&lt;/a&gt;'s watch, all is well.\nBut times are changing. The Iron Horde have called the native &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s to join their ranks. The , led by , yearns to prove itself worthy to . Beneath the valley's bright moon, a hangs in the sky. For centuries, the Shadowmoon have been forbidden to tap its &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt;-touched energy . . . until now. Will Warlord Ner'zhul succeed in harnessing the star's power to destroy the draenei and the Temple of Karabor? Or will Prophet Velen, aided by his disciple &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and a few fearless heroes\u2014be able to stop him?\nMeanwhile, trouble brews amongst the Exarchs, the most powerful and influential draenei heroes. Even as they debate the future of the draenei on their adopted homeworld, there is growing evidence of a traitor among their ranks. Who can be trusted?\nThe &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;s sense a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic presence in the northern woods of Shadowmoon Valley. As they hunt for the source of the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy, a sinister truth is revealed: , the Destroyer of Dreams, has returned.\nMost importantly, as a proven champion of the Alliance, you are charged with establishing the Alliance foothold on . The land is harsh and unforgiving, and the Iron Horde has amassed an enormous army without equal. Before you can hope to defeat them, you must build a stronghold\u2014&lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;your Garrison&lt;/a&gt;\u2014from the ground up and gather allies to face this indomitable foe.\nWhat are some of your favorite places within the zone?\nHelen Cheng: Shadowmoon Valley is one of the most beautiful places on Draenor, with a breathtaking variety of stunning areas. I would say that the two most striking aspects of Shadowmoon Valley are the draenei and Shadowmoon orc areas.\nThe draenei architecture in Shadowmoon is really impressive. You get everything from a merchant town in &lt;a href=\"Embaari%20Village\"&gt;Embaari Village&lt;/a&gt; to the valorous training grounds of the Exarchs in the north to the crystalline dome that is &lt;a href=\"Teluuna%20Observatory\"&gt;Teluuna Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. The draenei are cultured and sophisticated. Theirs is the pinnacle of an advanced society, and their towns and cities reflect a perfect balance of beauty and function. I really love all of the draenei locations\u2014and there are more in other zones\u2014but the Temple of Karabor has to be one of my favorites. The sheer size and scale of the place is incredible, and it's remarkable to see it in its glory before the events of &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, which turned it into the Black Temple under &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s control.\nThe Shadowmoon clan structures are impressive as well. The Shadowmoon were once a wise people, with a deep respect for the elements and a natural curiosity about the stars. They are natural-born leaders with a strong affinity for &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. However, since they joined the Iron Horde, Ner'zhul has strayed from the ancient ways. You can see this gradual decay reflected in their way of life. The &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Fields\"&gt;Burial Fields&lt;/a&gt; is a place where the Shadowmoon traditionally bury and honor their dead. That place has become defiled and corrupted with void magic. Their ancestors, whom they once revered, are now being brutally tormented. Ner'zhul's stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Anguish%20Fortress\"&gt;Anguish Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, is an open-air ziggurat with a sacrificial pit in its center. In a nearby dungeon, players will see that there are more dark secrets hidden beneath this compound.\nTell us more about the Alliance garrison!\nHelen Cheng: Nestled near the northern shores and with a commanding view of the main road, the Alliance &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; location is of immense strategic importance. Prophet Velen will give the land to players as a thank-you for their deeds in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;jungles of Tanaan&lt;/a&gt;, the intro zone. But there isn't much time to rest\u2014as great as the Prophet is, he needs your help. Your Garrison is awfully close to Shadowmoon territory, so be prepared to defend it.\n...the Alliance Garrison location is of immense strategic importance.\nYour Garrison will start as little more than an outpost, and your laborers will quickly run into trouble as they discover that even the forests of Draenor can be their enemy. But before long, you should have a comfortable Town Hall to call home and a Barracks that you can use to train new recruits. One of the perks of having your home base here is the ability to sound a \u201ccall to arms\u201d anywhere in Shadowmoon, and Alliance troops will rush to your aid.\nKick your feet up \u2013 after all, the Garrison is all yours.\nCould you name three of your favorite locations players should check out on their journey through the zone?\nHelen Cheng: Once you've settled in, you should take a quick jaunt over to the town of Elodor, home of the revered Altar of Sha'tar with its stunning view of Karabor and the surrounding ocean. There you can meet the five Exarchs who act as the hand of the Prophet, guiding draenei society, and you can witness their own internal conflicts as they argue about their place in this savage land. Don't miss the nearby &lt;a href=\"Rangari%20Enclave\"&gt;Rangari Enclave&lt;/a&gt;, where the elite &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s of the draenei train\u2014you won't see mushrooms that size for another 30 years!\nIf you're the adventurous type, try spelunking in &lt;a href=\"Bloodthorn%20Cave\"&gt;Bloodthorn Cave&lt;/a&gt;. Don't mind the flesh-eating &lt;a href=\"pale%20orc\"&gt;pale orc&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014they only kill you when provoked. Also, don't eat the local mushrooms. They can be rather . . . potent.\nWe've heard mixed reviews about &lt;a href=\"Gloomshade%20Grove\"&gt;Gloomshade Grove&lt;/a&gt;. Some folks rave about the pristine beaches, while others are just never heard from again. If you see anything that looks like a flower, makes a sound like \u201cmawarwaawa,\u201d and has very sharp teeth, run away! Though it's probably too late for you, so oh well. Don't say we didn't warn you!\nYou're probably wondering if there are any creatures on Draenor that won't bite your head off. Try heading over to the &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Moor\"&gt;Shimmering Mor&lt;/a&gt;. This enchanted forest glade is home to wild &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. Awww, they're just so cute! No, you can't take one home . . . oh, who are we kidding? You'll probably find an egg or some-such to raise eventually.\nFinally, don't forget to stop by Embaari Village. This draenei &lt;a href=\"merchant\"&gt;merchant&lt;/a&gt; town is known for its delicious food and exotic wares. No trip to Shadowmoon is complete without a tasty meal and a mug of honey mead.\nAs with all places on Draenor, Shadowmoon Valley is filled with sights to see, adventures to be had, and savage enemies to destroy. Enjoy your journey!\nNext, our voyage will take us north into the Horde starting zone of &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Blog/Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned for more!"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nIn our latest &lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; zone preview, we turn our gaze upward to the beautiful Spires of Arak. Here, the &lt;a href=\"High%20arakkoa\"&gt;winged arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; plot atop their high perches, well out of the reach of the brutal &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the cursed wingless outcasts below.\nLocated in the southernmost part of , the Spires of Arak is a zone of soaring heights and shadow-drenched crags\u2014but as with much of the planet, the beauty of this place hides something sinister. Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Don%20Adams\"&gt;Don Adams&lt;/a&gt; and Associate Quest Designer &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cash\"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt; fill us in on what to expect.\nZone Music Piece: Spires or Arak by Russell Brower\nWhat awaits players among the Spires of Arak?\nDon Adams: First of all, we love the arakkoa, and we knew players would be excited to see them again. The Spires of Arak is their home territory, so it felt like the right place to really dive in and explore their culture. We already teased the flying arakkoa at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt;, but players might be surprised to find the familiar cursed arakkoa from &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; there too, only with a fancy new model. We felt it was important to portray both sides of the arakkoa, and their duality gave us some interesting themes to draw on throughout the zone.\nIn The Burning Crusade, the arakkoa of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; had pretty much fallen entirely into evil, but in Warlords of Draenor we see them at a crossroads. They're outcasts, hated and oppressed by the flying arakkoa who are torching their &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt;s with an enormous beam weapon fixed atop &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;. To make matters worse, the Shattered Hand orcs have begun expanding into the region, killing anyone in their path. These &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;arakkoa outcasts&lt;/a&gt; are caught between several enemies, and they really have nobody on their side before you show up.\nOver the course of the zone, you're helping this shady resistance group of cursed arakkoa to make their final stand. You're learning about the curse they bear, the ancient gods of their land, and the very real threat posed by the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, the ruling caste of zealous arakkoa in Skyreach. Your adventure leads to two climactic events in the zone: one involving the plight of the outcasts against the flying arakkoa, and another focusing on the Shattered Hand fortress of &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Hold\"&gt;Bladefist Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat's the zone's ambience like?\nDon Adams: You first enter the zone through a mountain pass that shows off some of the harsher elements of the landscape. Boulders are suspended overhead by huge thorny vines reaching out from the mountainside. As you progress down the path, arakkoa refugees push past you in a mass exodus from Skettis. You reach a dramatic vista to see Skyreach looming high above a forest canopy stretching out into the horizon.\nSkyreach and its satellite spires maintain an imposing presence throughout the entire zone. You can look up and see them from pretty much anywhere\u2014a constant reminder of the threat looming overhead.\nOverall, the vibe in the zone is dire and dark, with hints of light scattered throughout. You are helping these underdogs, and they're extremely shady and creepy, but you can sense some potential within them. Hopefully players will connect with the cursed arakkoa and forgive them for the whole \u201cmonstrous &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt;\u201d thing back in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar\"&gt;Terokkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat are some of your favorite locations in the zone?\nDon Adams: You can get a great sense of the look and feel of the Spires of Arak from the Artcraft post detailing the zone's level design and environment art. The forested regions are dark and mysterious, while the sun-bathed coastal plains are blanketed in brilliant wildflowers. There are contrasting visuals throughout the zone, and yet somehow it all feels tied together.\nOne of my favorite areas has to be , with its narrow alleys that evoke the feeling of a bustling bazaar; the wild, uprooted terrain; and precarious walls. We wanted to show that a landslide had swept through the city, and you can actually follow the wash all the way down the mountain to find more ruined pieces settled in the ponds below. Skettis is such a great intro to the zone, offering a straight-on view of the glorious Skyreach from the dilapidated slums full of squatting outcasts.\nI also absolutely fell in love with the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Crag\"&gt;Howling Crag&lt;/a&gt;, which is a bonus objective area on the northeastern side of the zone. The canyons, caves, and land bridges crisscrossing through the area create this very cool vertical element with several tiers of gameplay space. The place really feels hidden, and since we don't explicitly send you there for &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, you get to discover and explore it on your own.\nOne last area I'd like to call out is &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Akraz\"&gt;Veil Akraz&lt;/a&gt;, one of the outcast villages blasted by the Skyreach beam weapon. It's such a great display of the destructive power in the hands\u2014talons?\u2014of the Adherents of Rukhmar. You really get the sense that this was an idyllic little outcast village, and now it's an inferno with a scar of glassed earth running through the center.\nWhat outposts will players be able to build in the Spires of Arak, and how do they impact the Garrison?\nJohnny Cash: &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;commanders&lt;/a&gt;, your &lt;a href=\"Garrison\"&gt;Garrison&lt;/a&gt; forces have established &lt;a href=\"Southport\"&gt;Southport&lt;/a&gt; on the western coast as your home away from home in the Spires of Arak. &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, your forces have erected &lt;a href=\"Axefall\"&gt;Axefall&lt;/a&gt; not far inland. Heroes of both factions, you'll quickly find that your outpost is struggling to survive.\nAs you quest through the Spires of Arak, you'll be presented with the choice to construct an Inn to help you house more soldiers and supplies or a Trading Post to establish trade agreements with friendly locals. Which building you choose to construct also leads to a unique quest line.\nBased on your choice, you'll receive a powerful ability usable within the Spires of Arak. The Inn lets you hearth to your outpost on a very short cooldown and also gives you the ability to gain rested experience anywhere in the zone. The Trading Post grants you the ability to call in a smuggling run, which lets you purchase rare and powerful goods unavailable elsewhere\u2014you'll find these very helpful as you battle the Adherents of Rukhmar and the Shattered Hand.\nTo the south of your outpost, &lt;a href=\"Rivett%20Clutchpop\"&gt;Rivett Clutchpop&lt;/a&gt; has set off with the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Draenor%20Expedition\"&gt;Steamwheedle Draenor Expedition&lt;/a&gt; on a daring drilling venture. However, something has gone terribly wrong, and you're the only one who can help. After rescuing Rivett and his crew, you'll receive blueprints to construct a &lt;a href=\"Salvage%20Yard\"&gt;Salvage Yard&lt;/a&gt; at your Garrison. Your Salvage Yard will offer you a daily selection of, well, salvage. Sometimes you'll get vendor fodder, but there's always a chance your hardworking salvage crew will find something truly tantalizing.\nThe zone has a little something for everyone, and there are tons of other surprises waiting as you brave its formidable terrain."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nWe sat down to talk about Stormheim with Lead Environment Artist &lt;a href=\"Ely%20Cannon\"&gt;Ely Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Don%20Adams\"&gt;Don Adams&lt;/a&gt;, and Associate Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Trevor%20Huwe\"&gt;Trevor Huwe&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Stormheim and what you'll experience there.\n[ \"Embed of Soundcloud Soundtrack \"]\n Stormheim composed by Russell Brower.\n\"The land of Stormheim is one of harsh beauty, a reflection of the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who dwell here. As you explore, you'll learn more about vrykrul culture, including the origins of the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; and the terrifying &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, you will contend with the &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;vrykul God-King&lt;/a&gt; as he races to claim the Stormheim's &lt;a href=\"Pillar%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillar of Creation&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; masters. Ultimately, your quest will take you into the very heavens where the greatest &lt;a href=\"Champion%20%28rank%29\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s of the vrykul await to test your worth.\"\nQ. How would you describe the zone's ambience? What's it like?\nEly: We set out to capture a verdant, mid-height mountain landscape with heavy basalt rock formations enshrouded in the kind of mists that you would see on the underside of a heavy cloud bank. It feels very wet\u2014these guys are living in a damp environment with there's always a sense that a storm is hanging overhead.\nThe zone starts with a heavy, oppressive atmosphere, and gradually moves into more of a bright, golden, fall-like environment to lift the mood. Then it moves back into a heavier, repressive mood again.\nWe really tried to use the environmental changes to go hand-in-hand with the story for this zone. It also starts heavy and then really moves into a little bit lighter story, then back to heavy.\nDon: I would describe the ambience of the zone as dramatic. There are really big, dramatic cliffs. The &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; loom over the whole zone, and you can almost see it from everywhere. The mountain is right there, and there's a crazy storm swirling over it. It's filled with really dramatic vistas and cliffs.\nEly: It's really a rugged, big environment.\nDon: It's imposing. And you feel really small when you're in Stormheim.\nEly: It's different from &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; in that Stormheim has more of a weather dynamic\u2014the storm when you first come in is lingering all around your view. You can see the storm head on the horizon and all the way around to the clearing right over the Halls of Valor. But like I said, it progresses into that lighter, brighter mood. Then you're in the forest and you're not on the big mountains\u2014but the mountains are all around you.\nTrevor: There's also a lot of really cool juxtaposition in Stormheim. You have these harsh rocky cliffs, but interspersed there is this verdant green running through it. It's very much like the Scottish Highlands.\nIt definitely feels like a place that you would find Vikings and that kind of thing. It also has these cool changes in environment where you'll go from these nice rolling green hills to the mystic city of &lt;a href=\"Haustvald\"&gt;Haustvald&lt;/a&gt;, made of stone\u2014it's almost like a giant crypt. Then there's &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;, where everything feels very much like you're in the underworld.\nEly: We tried to show show that the Vrykul here have a long history, and have been here a lot longer than in some of other zones you've encountered them previously. There's more stone in their architecture. Haustvald is a very good example where they've actually burrowed down into the rocky ground and built this old, crypt-like temple\u2014it's all built of stone. We wanted to show that they've been here, that they thrived here, versus just recently showing up like they did in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrevor: Their cities, &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hrydshal\"&gt;Hrydshal&lt;/a&gt;, are very much fortified. You can tell that these people have lived in this land and they fought for the land. There are high walls, too. People probably tried to take it from them, but they stood their ground. They have this really hardy, fortified civilization here.\nEly: There's really a history and connection to the land that they've been living on.\nQ. Which locations would you say are some of your favorites, and why?\nEly: Oh yeah. I like Haustvald. It's my favorite area in the whole zone.\nTrevor: I was going to say that, too\u2014probably Haustvald. Just from a visual standpoint. When you go in, it's got this really weird sense of being both simultaneously gigantic and claustrophobic. You see these big monoliths, but then you've got these little tombs that you would be going into. It really speaks to what the mystics are who live there, because the &lt;a href=\"mystic\"&gt;mystic&lt;/a&gt;s are the Vrykul masters of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt;. The place they live looks like a giant stone tomb.\nDon: And then you have the &lt;a href=\"Runewood\"&gt;Runewood&lt;/a&gt; all around it, too. It's this mystical forest that's just awesome to see, with a talking tree named &lt;a href=\"Vydhar\"&gt;Vydhar&lt;/a&gt;. That area just sings.\nI also really like the Kvaldir area in &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn%20Harbor\"&gt;Tideskorn Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. It's where the Kvaldir tribe are originally from, and it tells the story of how they first came into contact with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and ended up being cursed. It's a super creepy awesome area that's not quite like any other in &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nEly: Then there's the obvious, Helheim.\nTrevor: Yeah, Helheim is sort of the easy obvious answer. It got knocked out of the park.\nDon: It goes back to the theme of \"imposing\". The statues are imposing, along with the mountain and the Halls of Valor. Then once you get into the depths of Haustvald and into Helheim, you see Helya\u2014and she's huge. It's grand in scale, and there are these moments that are like something out of epic literature.\nQ. Why do you think a player would want to start in this zone first?\nDon: &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; vs. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrevor: How about Vrykul, &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt;, Kvaldir, oh, and lest we not forget, grappling hooks. Basically, when we set out to do Stormheim our general goal was to try and create this Norse epic where the player is the character in the middle of it. So if you're a fan of Vrykul culture, if you want to learn more about the Kvaldir, if you dig dragons. . . .\nDon: &lt;a href=\"Storm%20dragon\"&gt;Storm Dragons&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrevor: What else do you need to hear other than Storm Dragons?\nEly: This zone has such a great main storyline, but it has such great side stories, too\u2014some really cool and funny ones that lend charm to the zone.\nDon: Tension between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; has been building since the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; invasions, and this is the zone that kicks off more of that. It's red versus blue right out of the gate, which then leads off into this epic story. It then returns to Alliance versus Horde again later. If that's still fresh in your mind and you want to chase down Sylvanas, then this really is the zone for that.\nQ. What is it that will bring them back to this zone? We know there are World Quests and Dungeons to look forward, but what else?\nTrevor: I'm not going to say why, but the Sixtrigger brothers. There's also Shield's Rest, which is a maximum-level area off the east coast of Stormheim and out in the water. It's like an ancient burial ground that's being raided by Kvaldir. They're trying to get these powerful souls like the mystics that have been there forever. There are also some dragons there too.\nEly: And grappling hooks. There are lots of treasures to find and little nooks and crannies to explore.\nDon: This is also where you can collect the best-named herb in the game of all time, &lt;a href=\"%3AFjarnskaggl\"&gt;:Fjarnskaggl&lt;/a&gt;.\nTrevor: You also get to fish up the &lt;a href=\"%3AOodelfjisk\"&gt;:Oodelfjisk&lt;/a&gt;.\nEly: Some of the best named &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt; materials ever are in Stormheim. And you get to talk with the tree Vydhar more\u2014well, the tree talks to you.\nDon: I think the Kvaldir is also a good point to bring up. Without spoiling anything, we'll say that Helya's not done, so you may have to come back to deal with the Kvaldir.\nTrevor: There are &lt;a href=\"world%20boss\"&gt;world boss&lt;/a&gt;es there too, so during your level-up experience you may have gotten killed by &lt;a href=\"Nithogg\"&gt;Nithogg&lt;/a&gt; a time or two. When you return at max level, you'll be able to get your revenge for that.\nQ. Is there anything else that players should look forward to that you haven't mentioned yet?\nTrevor: I think the big thing is, there is a big central storyline in Stormheim and it's massive in scale, it's heavy, so it may be tempting to just keep following that road, but every now and then you'll want to branch off to the side because there are some really fun little things to break up that flow. You might meet some memorable cool characters; you might have some fun things happen that aren't part of the main story.\nDon: Some of the most memorable things might be the ones we don't send you directly to that you just find. There are a lot of really awesome side quests we added in.\nTrevor: That's another thing. Follow the grappling hooks. Follow them even when it seems like they aren't going in a direction you need to go because you might find something there.\nDon: Yeah, we didn't place any of those hook points on accident. They're worth following and if you're not a demon hunter, maybe take some goblin gliders with you just in case you find yourself in a precarious situation.\nThere's also a lot of verticality to the zone. Highmountain is the tallest zone, but Stormheim probably has the widest range of high and low points because it comes out of Highmountain and goes all the way down to sea level. It's one of the reasons it looks so imposing\u2014the cliffs.\nEly: It has a long view distance too. You could probably glide a long way.\nTrevor: Another little tip: if you're leveling up in the Runewood and your screen gets dark and it starts to snow\u2014run."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nLocated in the northernmost region of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, Stormsong Valley is home to &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;House Stormsong&lt;/a&gt; and the mystical &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt;. Wielding great power over the seas, the tidesages impart their blessings upon the mighty &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt;. Join us as we take you on a brief tour of Stormsong Valley.\nThe lands of Stormsong Valley are lush with green grasses and rock-strewn rolling hills. Wildlife and plant growth thrive here, fed by the inland streams and the invigorating sea air. It is a region made rich by the harmony between both land and sea.\nWelcome to Stormsong Valley. \nAs with any great mystery, you'll need to find and follow the clues before you. Begin by taking a ferry to the &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Monastery\"&gt;Stormsong Monastery&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps the sisters and brothers there will have more insight on the missing fleet. Thankfully, you won't be alone for your journey. A ward of Harbormaster &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Crestfall\"&gt;Cyrus Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, your guide &lt;a href=\"Taelia\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; is a knowledgeable companion eager to help you get to the bottom of things in Stormsong Valley.\nThe signs of the sea are everywhere in the monastery, but an itch between your shoulder blades feeds the impression that you're unwelcome. Answers aren't easy to come by and danger is lurking nearer than you think.\nWord from someone within the resistance is that the fleet is not truly lost but trapped by dark forces. It will be up to you to find allies within Stormsong Valley to help you root out the heart of this conspiracy and bring the fleet home. &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt; from the town of &lt;a href=\"Brennadam\"&gt;Brennadam&lt;/a&gt; in the north is one such ally. You'll need to meet with him to find out what more he knows of the challenges you'll face.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Highland%20Pass\"&gt;Highland Pass&lt;/a&gt; is the only land route into Stormsong Valley, but a blockade halts passage between Brennadam and the rest of Kul Tiras. Once you find a way through, you'll crest the pass to take in the breathtaking sight of the land stretched out before you.\nMeet the Neighbors.\nThe reception you'll receive in Brennadam isn't a warm one despite the beauty of the surrounding town. The citizens are angry at the soldiers for seizing their harvests and failing to protect the people they are meant to serve. Brother Pike will help find the answers you seek, but each discovery is another knot in a skein that wends through this troubled land. There is more beneath the surface to be discovered, and you sense darkness waiting just out of sight.\nThe further inland you go, the more apparent it becomes that the void's corruption has burrowed deeply into the land, the wildlife, and its people. Those of able body (if not able mind) are either conscripted or manipulated into serving the tidesages and the malevolent will that commands them.\nUnder the Siege.\nOn the western coast, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Daelin\"&gt;Fort Daelin&lt;/a&gt; is under siege by the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. Brutes pummel the stone walls even as harpoons drive further into the walls above them. Without aid, the levee holding back the sea will plunge the fertile valley into the naga-infested depths.\nA Prickly Situation.\nEmboldened by the soldiers neglecting their duties, vicious creatures have encroached on the noble people of Stormsong. Whether it's &lt;a href=\"ettin\"&gt;ettin&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Millstone%20Hamlet\"&gt;Millstone Hamlet&lt;/a&gt; or the territorial &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;, these threats will only grow more aggressive without someone to push them back.\nMonsters of the Sea.\nOn an island to the northeast resides the seat of power for both House Stormsong and the tidesages: the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;. Its very foundations are carved into the rocky outcroppings, and the sign of the &lt;a href=\"kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; adorns its ancient structures.\nThere's a long road to take through this beautiful but treacherous land. Bringing House Stormsong back into the fold and freeing the Kul Tiran fleet are paramount to defending the kingdom against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s incursion. Those brave enough to explore Stormsong Valley's vast coastlines will meet a brave, noble people who embrace the land they live in and the bountiful sea they so love.\nWhen you're ready to go beyond the lands of Stormsong Valley, the stygian hills of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; await to the southwest, and to the southeast lies the capital of Kul Tiras, &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "722189", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=722189", "title": "WoW Blog/Suramar", "text": "This article is a copy of \"Legion Zone Preview: Suramar\", an official blog by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It's about the &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nIn this zone overview, we sat down with Senior Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Burke\"&gt;Steve Burke&lt;/a&gt; to talk about Suramar, the new maximum-level zone in &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, to learn more about what you'll experience there.\n[ \"Embed of Soundcloud Soundtrack \"]\nSuramar by Russell Brower.\n\"All roads lead to Suramar, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; metropolis at the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The corrupted &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; fuels the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; elves and provides them the sustenance they need to survive. Those who are cut off from it live as &lt;a href=\"nightfallen\"&gt;nightfallen&lt;/a&gt;, their bodies wasting away as they search desperately for the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;al energy they need to sustain them. Atop the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;palace of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, deep within the walls of the massive city, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; plots the next step of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s grand scheme. . . .\"\nQ. How would you describe the zone's ambience?\nSteve:Suramar is steeped in history. This is the elven capital. Here we have the Nightborne, which is a new group of characters, but really it's an ancient group. These are the old night elves, and they were the rulers of the world at one point in time.\nOne of the things that's cool about this zone is the Nightborne have retreated within a bubble for the last 10,000 years, so the land around them has become ruined and overgrown. There's a collapsed location that players will see that I just love\u2014it really helps show and tell that story.\nIn the northeast, we have the &lt;a href=\"Moonguard\"&gt;Moonguard&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of an ancient order of super-powerful &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s. They have this deep history, and &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; had even been one of them\u2014a &lt;a href=\"Commander%20%28rank%29\"&gt;commander&lt;/a&gt; of the Moonguard. At this time, everyone who was born with yellow eyes was taken to join them. It was a great honor to be trained to become one of them\u2014they were a really powerful force.\nThis being a level-110 zone, you can't start questing until you've gotten to maximum level. This makes Suramar a unique zone in Legion, and creates a special vibe for the zone\u2014you can really sit back and enjoy the story at your own pace. And because you aren't leveling, we wanted to build this zone a little bit differently. For one, we wanted a lot of discoverable things, so that if you're out exploring you have lots to happen upon along the way. You're not going to be lead to them, though. You're meant to gradually explore the zone and all of its nooks and crannies, and take it all in a bit at a time.\nWhen creating the various locations around Suramar, we wanted to remind players of the different experiences they had as they leveled up, and remind them of all of the crises that have happened. So we have a little follow-up for &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, with some &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s who have come in as &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. We have some &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. We even have some underwater experiences that might remind players of &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;. And of course, we also have the Burning Legion\u2014we wanted a wide variety to make sure that Suramar hit more than one note.\nWe also really wanted to have an \u201cexclamation point\u201d in this zone. We did that with &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. We've done big cities before like &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, but this one is a really special place. It's urban, but it's an adventure zone\u2014a hostile city, which makes it special all on its own. And the artists just knocked it out of the park.\nWe wanted to show players a different perspective here, too, and make sure people really understood the Nightborne and everything that's really going on here. We wanted to give you a look from the inside, and decided to use a disguise mechanic so you could infiltrate their society and really get a sense of what it's like to be one of the Nightborne. You can get &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s from Nightborne characters you otherwise would have been fighting. It was a little bit risky to do, but I think it's played out really well.\nQ. How are players introduced to this zone? And since it's max-level, how does the story progress here?\nSteve: When you reach max level, you get a quest in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; has intercepted a signal and wants you to investigate. There's this call for help from &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; of the exiled Nightborne that you might have read about in the comic \u201c&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Twilight of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;,\u201d which shows the events that lead right up to the quest. You are thrown right in with Thalyssra, who is the wounded Nightborne there, and you get to see firsthand the effects of the Nightwell on them for this past 10,000 years. They've come to rely on it so heavily, and being exiled from the city is a fate worse than death. As soon as they're exiled, they begin deteriorating fast\u2014until they become a mindless husk forever. We really wanted to make sure you feel that tension.\nWhile their situation is hopeless, there is something that the player can do to help\u2014even if it's just trying to stave off this terrible thing for the last of these very noble people and this great elven culture. They're descending into corruption and clinging to life, but the player can keep them from slipping into that. We wanted to make the gameplay around this experience something that wasn't too onerous, but also something that you didn't just dismiss. We wanted to give context to the moment-to-moment gameplay so that people care about what they are doing. There's a lot of tragedy here, but there's hope too.\nYou'll also get to visit with people you know here\u2014your old friends, if you will. There's some lighthearted moments here too, but we hope we evoke a lot of goosebumps. There's an emotional story to experience here, and we hope we've succeeded in delivering that to players.\nQ. Which locations would you say are some of your favorites, and why?\nSteve: Aside from the city\u2014which the artists really outdid themselves on\u2014there are several stories and locations that stand out, like Moonguard. The tale of the mages there is great, and the mountain retreat where they train is awesome. &lt;a href=\"Tel%27anor\"&gt;Tel'anor&lt;/a&gt; is also really awesome\u2014at first we didn't know quite what we were building, but after playing with ideas back and forth with the level designers, it eventually became clear: this is a graveyard. This is where their old heroes go to rest. I think they executed on that really well. It's a beautiful location.\nBut &lt;a href=\"Falanaar\"&gt;Falanaar&lt;/a&gt; is my favorite. It's big. It's actually bigger than a &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;. The story is that there's an underground network in the zone with these ancient, elven-build halls\u2014it really gives another dimension to the zone, and the location and the amazing visuals really show the age of it. Like I said, we're talking about an area that's 10,000 years old\u2014it's actually collapsed in parts, and there's nothing quite like this in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. You get to go down and explore the depths. In places you can see the water from the surface above, breaking through and coming down into it.\nOnce we got the rough pieces in place, we realized this was really going to be a special place. We also knew that with the way World Quests work, we'd be bringing players back here, so we wanted an area that was worthy of that. It's a place you can take the time to explore and take in all of the details at your own pace. There's a world boss here. There are a few different entrances to it as well, which should make it fun for explorers. Both this location and Suramar city are really fantastic locations for people to visit, explore, and experience.\nThere are also suburbs up at the top, which we wanted to keep separate and distinctive. We wanted to show what the Nightborne are like without the demons\u2014the juxtaposition between this noble and ancient race and this corrupt demonic force. We wanted to make you wonder, \u201cHow did they get to the state they're in now?\u201d We really wanted to have a location that allowed you see them in their own setting\u2014clear of demons and pristine. It's all just Nightborne in their natural habitat, though there's still that vibe that the place is still unfriendly to people who aren't one of them. You'll get to see them in that environment first, and then a little later you get sent further into the depths of the city where you get to see the involvement of the Burning Legion.\nWith the Nightborne, there are no slums\u2014there are just grades of \u201cHow elite are you?\u201d They've all been in this bubble for 10,000 years, and they're trained in hand-to-hand combat and spellcasting. They're these consummate warriors, but they train as sort of a sport. Because for most of that time, there was no threat. They were closed off from the world. They worked on becoming as elegant as they could, and now you've got this arrogant, super-refined culture colliding with the forces of Gul'dan. You're seeing Felguard marching around these pristine neighborhoods. It's jarring.\nIt resonates, though, and you get a feel of most of the society wondering, \u201cWhat have we done here?\u201d And at the same time, they're paralyzed with fear because they don't want to be exiled. They don't have any choice but to stay so they can partake of the Nightwell\u2014but now they're rationing out the mana wine. Now there's scarcity and hunger in the streets. You've got this real contrast between those who are all in and marching to the drum of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her advisors, and the people who aren't and the scarcity they deal with. There's a sense of oppression. The place seems ripe for the people to rise up against the leadership, but they are paralyzed with fear that they could be cut off from the Nightwell.\nQ. How often should players expect to return to this zone and the city of Suramar?\nSteve: This is an easy one. This is a max-level zone, so we wanted to make sure we really built it with the end-game in mind. We wanted to make sure players had plenty to do. I think that the World Quests are rewarding and going to pull you all across the expansion, and then when you've knocked those out for the day, this is the place you're going to come back to so that you can absorb the story. It plays out over time and will lead up to the raid that will be available here later. I hope people live here when they aren't in their &lt;a href=\"Order%20Hall\"&gt;Order Hall&lt;/a&gt; or out doing World Quests."}

It's about various aspects of \nArticle.\nBefore you looms a gateway to an untold land, minded by towering watchers who regard you from their pedestals with malevolence. Drawn by the call of the unknown, you steel yourself and pass through the portal, ready to explore this boundless world of magic and monsters.\nWorld of Warcraft Classic returns you to a lost era of war and exploration, where you can enjoy a dynamic, immersive world filled with kindred adventurers all seeking to overcome the challenges that face them and make names for themselves as champions of Azeroth.\nReady to play? Here are some tips to get you started.\nYour Realm and You.\nFinding the right realm to suit your playstyle is the first step in beginning your Classic journey. While logging in and being faced with a slew of nigh-incomprehensible names might be daunting at first, understanding acronyms is key to settling on the realm you\u2019ll call home.\nPledge Your Allegiance.\nOnce you\u2019ve selected your realm, it\u2019s time to make the defining decision: will you join the ranks of the indomitable Horde? Or will you stand beside the steadfast Alliance? Your choice dictates which races (and, in certain cases, classes) are available to you, so choose wisely!\nThe Alliance.\nDriven by a sense of justice and a desire to illuminate the darkest corners of the world, the Alliance seek to bring order to Azeroth\u2019s war-torn lands and emphasize honor and tradition above all else. The races that comprise the noble Alliance are:\nThe Horde.\nA coalition of outcasts who have forged a union in the flames of survival, the Horde values action and strength, committed to enduring in an unforgiving land that would see it extinguished. The proud peoples of the Horde are:\nStay Classy.\nAfter deciding where your loyalties lie, the final step before you set foot on Azerothian soil is choosing a class. Do you enjoy charging into the fray, blade brandished? Are you the type to skulk amongst the shadows, dispatching enemies with cruel efficiency? Or do your interests lie in aiding allies from afar with benevolent magics? Whichever you prefer, there\u2019s a class for you.\nAll classes are able to deal damage and adventure alone, but some can also fill the role of \u201ctank\u201d or \u201chealer.\u201d Playing a \u201ctank\u201d involves shielding your allies and drawing the ire of monsters toward yourself, while playing a healer involves keeping your friends alive with restorative spells. Groups of players are most effective when they have characters able to fill all three roles. Whatever you would like to do, you can customize your character\u2019s skills according to your desires allowing you to focus more on a particular role or playstyle if you so choose. Some weapons and armor are restricted to certain character classes, and different classes derive different benefits from equipment found in the world.\nInto the Unknown.\nNow that you\u2019ve decided on your server, faction, race, and class, it\u2019s time to give your character a stylish look, whip up a name, and hit that \u201cEnter World\u201d button. Though your journey has just begun, you\u2019ll soon be ready to take on all Azeroth has to offer. Explore the world, delve into dungeons, party up with other players, and enjoy your adventures! Once you\u2019ve dinged 60, ready yourself to descend into the depths of Blackrock Mountain and face the fearsome Nefarian in Blackwing Lair, now live on Classic servers!\nNew to WoW Classic?

We unabashedly absconded with a little of Associate Quest Designer &lt;a href=\"Johnny%20Cash\"&gt;Johnny Cash&lt;/a&gt;'s* time to learn what's waiting for players here. \nLocated in the heart of Draenor, Talador offers significant strategic value to the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; should they complete their quest to gain control. The city of , a shining jewel of &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; civilization, now lies in the Iron Horde's clutches, and the situation is looking grim..\n\"Zone Music Piece: Last Light by Neal Acree\"\nWhat can you tell us about the path that leads players into the events taking place in Talador? How does the story evolve within this zone?\nJohnny Cash: After coming out of a major confrontation against the Iron Horde in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; and leaving one of their bases in ruin, you and your forces have begun erecting an outpost just north of the draenei city of in a bid to push back the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Fleet\"&gt;invading fleet&lt;/a&gt;. Under the command of the ruthless , the Iron Horde has already made landfall on the &lt;a href=\"Orunai%20Coast\"&gt;Orunai Coast&lt;/a&gt; and have taken most of northern Talador\u2014including the sprawling city of Shattrath, the trade capital for all of draenei civilization. If they aren't stopped soon, all of Talador will fall into 's grip, and the rest of Draenor is sure to follow. Talador's strategic location at the heart of Draenor would give the Iron Horde the perfect launching point for their amassing forces in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt;.\nPushing the Iron Horde back will be no simple feat, however. They have greater numbers, a stronger foothold, and one of the most brilliant military &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;generals&lt;/a&gt; to ever live backing its mission. A confrontation of epic proportions between Warlord Blackhand and within Shattrath will shake the city's foundations, and not every hero who enters may make it out alive.\nEven once the Iron Horde is routed out of Shattrath, the city will not remain safe for long, as new foes are waiting to emerge and lay claim to the city. The &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerai&lt;/a&gt; are a sect of draenei who have aligned themselves with the to usher 's twisted schemes into fruition. With most draenei cities razed and sacked by the Iron Horde, allies are few and far between . . . but they do exist. Pockets of draenei resistance dot Talador's forests, eager to retake their homes and enact vengeance on their assailants. In an ancient caldera to the east at a major &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt; nexus, &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; have taken up residence. Perhaps most curiously, there have been several sightings near the city of &lt;a href=\"Aruuna\"&gt;Aruuna&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;arakkoa outcasts&lt;/a&gt;\u2014flightless bird-men powerful in the ways of &lt;a href=\"shadow%20magic\"&gt;shadow magic&lt;/a&gt;. Some say their existence is little more than a legend, but players will have to find out for themselves if the rumors are true\u2014and if they are, what brings the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; outside of their ancestral home in &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; . . . or, more importantly, who.\nOn top of all of the very real threats players face in their first foray into Talador, a darker, more sinister threat lurks to the south. &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt;, right hand of Gul'dan, leads a massive assault on the holy mausoleum of , resting place for all draenei &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s pour in at the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Front\"&gt;Burning Front&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Xandros\"&gt;remains of a ruined world&lt;/a&gt; somewhere in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadow Council eyes the city of . leads the , ancient defenders of Auchindoun, in a desperate effort to hold off the seemingly endless waves of death. If their lines falter, Teron'gor will have unhindered access to innumerable draenei souls . . . and plans to consume them to gain a terrible power not meant for mortal hands. But the Auchenai have an ally that Teron'gor did not expect. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; felt the demonic presence and have flocked to Auchindoun's aid, and will call upon players to help turn the tide\u2014but will they be enough?\nHow would you describe the zone's ambience and the creatures that can be found in it?\nJohnny Cash: Talador is home to the heart of draenei civilization. It is stunningly beautiful, and the zone has a palette of oranges, golds, and greens that make it incredibly vibrant.\nIt's particularly lovely at dusk and into the evening, where its gentle orange sky fades into a dazzling starry night. The zone really showcases the breadth of draenei life: the sprawling trade hub of Shattrath, the massive mausoleum that is Auchindoun, the iconic city of Tuurem, the mythical Telmor (it does exist!), and so many others. Talador is more than a pretty place, though, and there is a prevailing sense of urgency that you feel everywhere you go. The Iron Horde and the Shadow Council threaten to unravel all that you've done in one fell swoop. Talador also boasts these great contrasts everywhere: old versus new, tranquil versus literally on fire.\nOf course, while you're in Talador you'll have run-ins with the many creatures that call this great forest home, many of whom have adapted unique hunting techniques to survive. The devious &lt;a href=\"Warp%20stalker\"&gt;stalker&lt;/a&gt; is able to change its skin coloration to camouflage it, allowing it to ambush prey or escape predators unseen. Mighty &lt;a href=\"teroclaw\"&gt;teroclaw&lt;/a&gt;s, flying beasts that use their strong beaks to sever both flesh and bone, rule the skies here rather than the &lt;a href=\"rylak\"&gt;rylak&lt;/a&gt;s found in many of Draenor's other locales. &lt;a href=\"Moth\"&gt;Moth&lt;/a&gt;s are drawn to the plentiful water sources, and have developed the ability to channel the abundant &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; energy in the air around them into condensed blasts. Those same water sources are home to all sorts of electric &lt;a href=\"eel\"&gt;eel&lt;/a&gt;s, poison &lt;a href=\"frog\"&gt;frog&lt;/a&gt;s, and even mighty &lt;a href=\"riverbeast\"&gt;riverbeast&lt;/a&gt;s. Some caves are home to ferocious territorial &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s that few dare disturb\u2014their venom is said to be able to alter both the body and mind. &lt;a href=\"Tiger\"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt;s prowl the lower mountain ridges, hungry for their next kill. Talador looks like a welcoming place . . . but every forest has its dark side.\nWhich locations are some of your favorites? Any highlights players should make sure to see and experience?\nJohnny Cash: Talador offers some truly diverse locations that are all worth a visit. You're seeing these places that you may be familiar with from &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in a totally different light. You know more or less where everything is in Talador already if you braved the &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, but nothing in those locations is quite as you remember it. That's what makes it so exciting to explore. I would say there are three main areas and their surroundings that really define Talador: Shattrath, Auchindoun, and the northeastern forest.\nShattrath is initially occupied by the Iron Horde and is exponentially larger than the Shattrath players know from The Burning Crusade. Carefully manicured trees and hedges lines its walkways, and numerous rises, canals, and bridges connect several large, unique sections of the city. One section is protected and cordoned off by an ornate, magically enhanced shell structure. Nearby, Shattrath's docks offer ample room for &lt;a href=\"Merchant\"&gt;traders&lt;/a&gt; from all across Draenor to come peddle their wares\u2014or for an Iron Horde war fleet to bring their ships. Those who prefer to live a quieter lifestyle outside of the hustle and bustle of the big city may find themselves in Tuurem or a village along the Orunai Coast. \nAuchindoun has not yet been sullied by the Shadow Council, and players will have a chance to see it in all its glory. Draenei from all around make pilgrimages there to pay their respects to their ancestors and the recently deceased. The northeastern forest may not have an enormous city dominating its horizon, but it is far from short on sights worth seeing. Your Garrison outpost stands tall in an ideal position for accessing the whole of Talador, wherever your presence is needed. \nWhat outpost bulidings are available, and what will players be able to earn for their Garrison?\nJohnny Cash: Talador will offer some really cool choices that will affect your Garrison. You'll have the opportunity to build an Arcane Sanctum or an Arsenal in the last available spot in the outpost. Which building you choose will offer you a different questing experience, a blueprint to construct a Mage Tower or Armory at your Garrison, and a special follower. Each building also unlocks a special zone ability to use anytime you're in Talador. You can call in an artillery strike from the cannon mounted on the Arsenal, or summon a guardian orb from the Arcane Sanctum that will follow you around for a time and fry any enemies that dare to get too close.\nTalador is full of enemies to slay and problems to solve, and I hope you enjoy playing it as much as we did making it. Good luck; have fun!\nWe hope you've enjoyed learning more about Talador, and we look forward to continuing the journey through Draenor in our next zone preview.\n\"*Not to be confused with the original \u201cman in black,\u201d though Johnny\u2014like most game designers\u2014does own a healthy collection of black T-shirts. He does not, however, take song requests.\""}

Completing &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20missions\"&gt;missions&lt;/a&gt; will provide materials for your Shipyard, supporting your ongoing efforts to control the seas of Draenor.\nThe Story Continues.\nMuch like the previous &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Campaign\"&gt;Garrison Campaign&lt;/a&gt; chapter-based quests, a new series of random quests will take players through the developing story and further into the jungles of Tanaan, including key locations such as the cave in which sacrificed his eye. Over the course of your journey, you'll learn that Gul'dan and his fanatical allies have even more sinister plans up their sleeves. \nObjective Hubs.\nOnce your new outpost is established, you'll go on the offensive and choose one of two hot spots each day to assault. Your goal is to undermine Gul'dan's plan to drag the whole of Draenor into chaos. There are seven new areas to explore, including:\nMore to Explore and Discover.\nThere will be even more to discover as you make your way through the ongoing battle for Tanaan. Safety is an illusion, and the jungle houses more than just Gul'dan's new Horde.

When you Timewalk these dungeons, you'll find that your character's power and gear has been scaled down to a fraction of what they normally are, and you may have never ventured into some (or all) of them, so it's a good idea to prepare yourself now.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nOutland: The Arcatraz.\nThe mighty Tempest Keep was created by the enigmatic &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;: sentient beings of pure energy and the sworn enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to serving as a base of operations for the naaru, the structure itself possesses the technology to teleport through alternate dimensions, traveling from one location to another in the blink of an eye.\nWith Outland serving as the strategic battlefront in the ongoing &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the naaru recently used Tempest Keep to reach the shattered land. However, when the naaru set out from their stronghold, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; quickly raided the dimensional fortress and assumed control over its satellite structures. Now, guided by some unknown purpose, Kael'thas manipulates the keep's otherworldly technologies, using them to harness the chaotic energies of the &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nAchievements and Reputation.\nIf you've not gotten them before, completing this dungeon will award The Arcatraz and , the latter of which is required for &lt;a href=\"%3AOutland%20Dungeon%20Hero\"&gt;:Outland Dungeon Hero&lt;/a&gt;.\nKilling enemies in this dungeon increases your standing with The &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "722578", "revid": "39502074", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=722578", "title": "WoW Blog/The Deaths of Chromie", "text": "This article is a copy of \"The Deaths of Chromie: Time To Act\", an official blog by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It's about the &lt;a href=\"Deaths%20of%20Chromie\"&gt;Deaths of Chromie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\n&lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;: gamine &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;, powerful &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt;, and time-twisting ally; a friendly force who makes \u2018being Chromie' look so easy, so much fun. Which is why it's heartbreaking to have to tell you that when patch 7.2.5 hits, Chromie will die. Again, and again, and again, and again.\nWhich goes to show that being Chromie is equally a blessing and a curse. Of course Chromie is chirpy, it makes sense: she protects the timelines, stopping any who dare to unleash chaos and destroy our rightful, hopeful future. But it also has a significant drawback - Chromie knows that many possible futures contain cruelty, pain, and destruction. More specifically, they contain death.\nChromie has always known when she (and you, incidentally) will die, but something has changed in her timeline \u2013 and not for the better. The death she now sees is not the one she's supposed to have, which is where you come in. You must help Chromie investigate who is behind these attacks and put a stop to them. And, maybe, you'll work out what Chromie did (or didn't) do that's got somebody hellbent on ending her life.\nTime Waits For No Gnome.\nPlaying with time poses some interesting problems. Time is intangible, which is why its behavior feels erratic - speeding up when we're having fun and slowing down when we're doing something we're not fantastically excited about. But this is your chance to witness just how quickly time flies when the death of a good friend hangs in the balance.\nAs sure as the moons circle &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s beard grows ever greyer, the only way to measure time is to observe it changing. That's why we can draw the logical conclusion that the arrow of time moves forward, because we can remember things that happened before now, but we don't remember what's happened next. Until now.\nIt's That Time Again (And Again).\nIf you offer to help Chromie, she will send you forward in time to the moment of her death, then work backwards in the forwards to make the now move forward in the right direction \u2013 which is not backwards, but needs to be forwards in the right version of forward. Still with me? Good. Because our unknown &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt; has done their homework: pre-empting the many ways you and Chromie can put a stop to their plan. All you can do is work back from effect to cause \u2013 learning as you re-visit events \u2013 shutting down all the possible ways that Chromie can die.\nSo, Champion, are you ready for some time-travelling, dragonshrine-visiting, portal-opening, buff-giving, reputation-rewarding, transmog-collecting, head-spinning, Chromie-saving battles? Head to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, speak with Khadgar, and take the portal to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest\"&gt;Wyrmrest&lt;/a&gt;. Lend Chromie your brains, and your brawn, to prevent her untimely death. Because Chromie finally gets her very own story to tell, and it's about time."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\nIn &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; content &lt;a href=\"patch%204.3\"&gt;patch 4.3&lt;/a&gt;, players will make their ultimate stand against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; the Destroyer. Almost a year has passed since the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; burst forth from the &lt;a href=\"Maelstorm\"&gt;Maelstorm&lt;/a&gt; to bring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; down upon the mortal &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s. Now the determined survivors from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; have rallied to unleash vengeance of their own.\nTo prepare for this earth-shattering battle, the Blizzard Insider recently discussed the upcoming Dragon Soul raid with &lt;a href=\"Scott%20Mercer\"&gt;Scott Mercer&lt;/a&gt;, lead encounter designer from the World of Warcraft team. Read on for all the epic details.\nBlizzard Insider: Before we dive into the details, can you tell us about Deathwing's character arc to date?\nScott Mercer: Deathwing has changed the face of Azeroth probably more than any other villain in &lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;'s history. He tore the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; in half. He caused tidal waves that transformed both continents. He even burned his claw marks into &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, leaving his personal signature on the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; capital. In many ways Deathwing embodies the Cataclysm itself, not just as the direct cause of it, but also as the thematic center of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt;. His violent transformation from Earth-Warder to Destroyer ultimately led to all these changes across Azeroth, so in a very direct way, his character arc represents the force that set the entire expansion into motion.\nThat said, we've been building towards a showdown with Deathwing for some time. Players have been wrestling with his &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; minions since before Cataclysm, and we've already seen Deathwing defeat &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; in single combat. The powers that be in Azeroth know Deathwing presents a mortal threat, so in the wake of all the chaos and destruction, forces are finally rallying to oppose him. That's how patch 4.3 begins, with the major players of Azeroth gathering to decide how they are going to tackle this seemingly unstoppable monster. \nInsider: Can you tell us about the new 5-player dungeons that lead into the Deathwing raid?\nScott Mercer: The short version is that the players are sent on a series of &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s to recover the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; artifact so &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the other &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s will have the firepower they need to confront Deathwing. The new 5-player &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s involve the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; and require the players to go forward in time to witness a &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;future&lt;/a&gt; where Deathwing has destroyed the world. Then, from that bleak future, they must go &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;back in time&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; to recover the Dragon Soul and bring it back to &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight%20%28instance%29\"&gt;the present&lt;/a&gt;. We've discussed a lot more details on the new 5-player dungeons in other interviews. They're going to lead in directly to the patch 4.3 &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; instance, which is called Dragon Soul. When the raid begins, the players have recovered the Dragon Soul artifact and arrive at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; to find it under siege by Deathwing's forces. \nInsider: Aside from a battle with Deathwing, what other encounters do you have planned for the Dragon Soul raid?\nScott Mercer: When players first arrive at Wyrmrest, they have to fight off a variety of Deathwing's minions who are laying siege to the temple. There's &lt;a href=\"Morchok\"&gt;Morchok&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Gemstone%20colossus\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt; who is pounding the base of Wyrmrest, and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zon%27ozz\"&gt;Warlord Zon'ozz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yor%27sahj%20the%20Unsleeping\"&gt;Yor'sajh the Unsleeping&lt;/a&gt;, two servants of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s in league with Deathwing who are summoning more minions to sack the gates.\nIn addition to lifting the siege around Wyrmrest, the players also have to return to the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to get the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; so the Dragon Aspects can refocus their power into the Dragon Soul. We have some new gameplay elements in mind for these raids, including a mechanic where players are granted the ability to dodge a deadly attack from a &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt; by phasing away.\nInsider: What details can you tell us about the Deathwing raid? How does it differ from other raids?\nScott Mercer: Dragon Soul is the most story-driven raid we've ever created. We're even building several cut scenes to transition between the last three stages of the final encounter with Deathwing.\nThe first stage occurs as players are flying on an airship, chasing down Deathwing while his Twilight's Hammer &lt;a href=\"drake\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rider\"&gt;rider&lt;/a&gt;s are swooping in to harry the pursuit. In the second stage, players paratroop commando-style onto Deathwing's back and start ripping up his armor, trying to pry a hole big enough to give Thrall a clean shot with the Dragon Soul. During this phase, players are actually riding on Deathwing as he's swooping around and trying to knock the players off with barrel rolls and such. Players will have to hang on at key points in the fight to avoid falling while also tangling with all kinds of monstrosities that are rising out of Deathwing's corrupted magma blood. Once the players get enough of Deathwing's armor off, Thrall blasts Deathwing with the Dragon Soul and sends him crash-landing into the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;. \nInsider: Very cool! And the final stage?\nScott Mercer: Well, the interesting thing about Deathwing's armor is that it wasn't really built to keep things out--he doesn't have to worry about weapons like swords and arrows. Instead it was built to keep things in. His body is this incredibly volatile mixture of corruptive energy and burning magma, so without his armor to hold it all together, he starts to lose it and come apart in all kinds of crazy ways. The final stage of the raid begins when Deathwing's deformed body rises out of the Maelstrom to face off against the players in the final showdown. I won't go into too much detail about this final stage, but I will say that it's going to be unbelievably epic. Even in his weakened state, Deathwing still presents a major threat, and bringing him down will require the combined efforts of the players, Thrall, and even the other Dragon Aspects. \nInsider: What difficulties did you encounter while designing the Deathwing battle? \nScott Mercer: It took a lot of new technologies to set up the fight on Deathwing's back. The artists in particular focused on selling the fantasy that you're grappling with a giant dragon midflight. We've never done anything quite like that before. Overall, setting the right scope for an encounter like Deathwing required a lot of development disciplines working together--artists, coders, encounter designers, level designers, and animators. We built corrupted Deathwing as a giant set piece with a lot of moving parts--probably our most complicated character model to date--but we felt it was necessary to convey the epic scale and do justice to the final boss of Cataclysm.\nInsider: Let's talk loot. What rewards await players who are strong enough to tackle Deathwing the Destroyer?\nScott Mercer: There will be a new tier of &lt;a href=\"armor%20set\"&gt;armor set&lt;/a&gt;s, of course. We're also adding a new &lt;a href=\"legendary\"&gt;legendary&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;--a &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Father\"&gt;pair of daggers&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s--with a new quest chain involved in obtaining them. The artists and animators are working on a new &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;, a drake from the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; that borrows many visual elements from the Alexstrasza character model. Players can get one version of the new mount as the reward for the meta &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt; for completing all other Dragon Soul achievements. There will also be a second, rarer version of the mount, that's obtainable as a single, guaranteed drop off Heroic corrupted Deathwing. \nInsider: Thanks for your time. Is there anything else you'd like to share before you go?\nScott Mercer: Sure, there's a lot going into the next content update besides just the Dragon Soul raid--&lt;a href=\"Transmogrification\"&gt;Transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20Storage\"&gt;Void Storage&lt;/a&gt;, the new &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt;, and more.

Without warning, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;'s armies surged toward &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, intent on burning the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; to the ground. In the ensuing conflict, many brave heroes gave their lives to protect Hyjal from destruction. By their noble sacrifices, the impossible was achieved: the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; pushed Ragnaros's minions back into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n\"Now, the battle to protect Hyjal rages in Ragnaros's smoldering realm. As territory is gained and Azeroth's champions edge closer to the Firelands' inner sanctums, a monumental task lies ahead. Entrenched around Ragnaros's lair -- &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt; -- are his most trusted guardians, including the turncoat &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt; and their mysterious leader. Yet Hyjal's defenders cannot afford to shy away from any of these dangers. Should Ragnaros prevail against the incursion and succeed in destroying Nordrassil, Azeroth will suffer a blow from which it might never recover.\"\n&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2\"&gt;patch 4.2&lt;/a&gt; will offer hardy &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s an opportunity to turn the tide in the Firelands, a huge outdoor raid of the highest difficulty, with 10-person and 25-person normal and Heroic modes. It will be a scorching opportunity to delve into this Elemental Plane, where six unique bosses stand between you and the reinvigorated Ragnaros. The great &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;fire lord&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber is shielded by:\n&lt;a href=\"Beth%27tilac\"&gt;Beth'tilac&lt;/a&gt; [The Red Widow].\nHer fiery webs reach far overhead, daring her adversaries to simultaneously face their fears of both spiders and heights. Only by taking hold of her webs and climbing into her domain yourself will you find a way to thwart her evil designs.\n&lt;a href=\"Lord%20Rhyolith\"&gt;Lord Rhyolith&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeroes face a difficult challenge: attack this massive &lt;a href=\"magma%20giant\"&gt;magma giant&lt;/a&gt;'s bulk while forcing him to move against his will among volcanic eruptions that ultimately spell his doom... or yours.\n&lt;a href=\"Alysrazor\"&gt;Alysrazor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAre you ready to fly the fiery skies? Catch her singed feathers and use them to soar above the inferno, or perish at the whim of this swift &lt;a href=\"firehawk\"&gt;firehawk&lt;/a&gt;.\nShannox.\nThe ferocious &lt;a href=\"flamewaker\"&gt;flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s of this Elemental Plane are terrifying enough, but &lt;a href=\"Shannox\"&gt;Shannox&lt;/a&gt; has brought companions to his side in defense of the Firelands.

Ragnaros's normal and Heroic modes offer two completely different encounters for raiders to conquer.\nBecause the Firelands raid is outdoors, players will be able to mount and attempt to avoid the highly dangerous groups of enemies milling about. The order in which you engage the first four bosses in the zone will be up to you.\nThis will also be one stop of many in a quest to build the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa\u2019s Rest. A weapon of unsurpassed quality, Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa\u2019s Rest will not only require a spectacular effort by its owner to construct; it will reward the entire guild with a new and unique non-combat pet upon completion.\nA tantalizing collection of unique rewards await those who brave the heat, and defeat the lords of the Firelands. With a new raid tier of armor and weapons, three new mounts (including the rare and highly sought flaming Anzu), a slew of new personal and guild achievements, an epic storyline, a grand musical score, and seven unique boss encounters, 4.2 and the Firelands raid will burn an indelible mark in World of Warcraft history.\nAre you prepared to taste the flames?"}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nTo be cast into the Maw is to be doomed to a bleak eternity. In this tumultuous, hopeless land, the vilest souls in the cosmos are imprisoned and tormented forever. Should the ancient evil chained here break free, all of reality will be consumed.\nReturn to the Abyss.\nThe Maw is where you\u2019ll begin your journey in the Shadowlands\u2014and after you\u2019ve traveled through the realms of Death, you will once again be called upon to return and face its horrors. Here, you will engage in an ongoing conflict with the Jailer to restore balance to the Shadowlands. Your ventures and accomplishments in this dreadful place will help you better understand your enemy and gain power to withstand his relentless assaults. However, every triumph draws the watchful eye of the Jailer, who will send his forces to assail you until you succumb to darkness.\nWhen you defeat enemies in the Maw or complete quests, you will earn Stygia that you can use to purchase Cyphers\u2014powerful tools and buffs\u2014to aid your survival within this terrible place as well as Torghast, Tower of the Damned. One of the Cyphers you can purchase from Ve\u2019nari ensures that you will always get to pick from at least two Anima Powers from any source that grants them. For those who wish to take a bit of the Maw with you on your travels, you\u2019ll also be able to trade in your Stygia for cosmetics, including pets.\nShould you succumb the Jailer\u2019s forces in the Maw, some of your precious Stygia will slip through your fingers. However, if you are daring enough to return to the place where you fell, you\u2019ll be able to reclaim your lost Stygia.\nSoul Salvation.\nSince the Arbiter went dormant and stopped directing souls to their just afterlives, all have instead been damned to the torment of the Maw. Many souls in the Maw are already too far gone, but a few possessing strong enough will to endure the Maw\u2019s torments can still be saved. If you free these souls and bring them back to your sanctum, then not only have you righted a cosmic wrong, but you\u2019ve also recruited a new member to your Covenant!\nThe Jailer\u2019s Domain.\nThe entities that roam the Maw are powerful enemies not to be trifled with. You will need to use every ability, tactic, and trick at your command in order to survive.\nEye of the Jailer.\nAs you progress through the Maw, slaying Mawsworn and dismantling the Jailer\u2019s forces, the Jailer will notice your presence. Completing quests, opening treasures, and defeating rare enemies in the Maw will attract the Eye of the Jailer. The master of the Maw will torment you with increasingly treacherous punishments\u2014including siege fire that will deal devastating damage and assassins that will hunt you down. There are five different Threat Levels. Once you reach Threat Level 5, your life will be siphoned until you fall, and you will not be able to re-enter the Maw again until the next day.\nWe look forward to sharing more information as development continues, and we hope this preview prepares you for the Maw and all it has to offer.\nWhat mysteries are you most looking forward to unveiling in the Maw? Join the discussion on the forums.\n\"Rewards and mechanics are still in development and subject to change, so be sure to check back for periodic updates on worldofwarcraft.com as we approach the release of Shadowlands.\""}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt; zone and &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20Invasion\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt; that was implemented in the game.\nArticle.\n\"Following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Fire%20elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; minions assaulted &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in a bid to set the ancient &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; ablaze. Although the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and their allies heroically repelled this invasion, their work on the sacred mount is far from over. In the newly healed Regrowth, &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his comrades have transformed the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; into a staging ground for an assault on Ragnaros's domain: the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;. Thus far, their efforts have been frustrated by a resurgence in elemental activity that has engulfed &lt;a href=\"the%20Regrowth\"&gt;the Regrowth&lt;/a&gt; and divided Malfurion's forces.\"\n\"If Hyjal's defenders quell this counterattack, they have plans to create a permanent outpost in the Firelands from which to maintain an eternal vigil over the molten elemental realm. To do so, Malfurion's &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s are planning to use an enchanted &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tree\"&gt;Sentinel Tree&lt;/a&gt;. With its roots sunk deep in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself, this extraordinary tree's protective canopy will grow in the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, providing a much-needed shelter for the Guardians of Hyjal. Yet accomplishing such a feat will take weeks of brutal fighting against foes such as the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, a splinter group of &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; bristling with Ragnaros's fiery powers. Regardless of the many challenges ahead, Hyjal's protectors and other heroes remain steadfast in their goal to establish a foothold in the Firelands. The safety of Hyjal and Nordrassil hinges on the campaign's success.\"\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%204.2\"&gt;patch 4.2&lt;/a&gt;, stalwart &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s will have the opportunity to test their mettle at two new &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt; areas located in the fertile hillsides of Mount Hyjal and the burning depths of the Firelands. Known as the Regrowth and Molten Front, these areas will offer an unprecedented amount of daily solo content for level-85 players to enjoy -- including over 60 new quests, four \"unlockable\" iLevel 365 gear &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, and a world that evolves right before your eyes.\nUnlock Your Destiny.\nLike many of the daily quest areas already in the game, the Regrowth and Molten Front will feature several stages of content. Players will begin their journeys at the renewed Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal, joining forces once again with &lt;a href=\"Matoclaw\"&gt;Matoclaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%20Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; to repel invading armies of elementals. From there, they must open a portal directly to the Firelands and establish a forward outpost that the Guardians of Hyjal, led by Malfurion Stormrage, can use to thwart further incursions by Ragnaros's forces.\nRather than these stages only becoming available after a certain period of time or at the end of a long quest series, players will instead get to use a new alternate currency called &lt;a href=\"Marks%20of%20the%20World%20Tree\"&gt;Marks of the World Tree&lt;/a&gt; to unlock them at their own pace.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Champion's Seal&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Marks of the World Tree can be earned by completing quests located in both daily quest areas. These marks can then be turned in to &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s to open up individual daily quests, unique daily quest chains (detailed further below), up to four vendors selling a brand-new tier of gear, and important fortifications including a &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;, an armory, and a legion of &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;s.\nYou'll have a lot of freedom in choosing what content you unlock and when, giving you more control than ever over your questing experience. What's more, this element of choice won't only be reflected in the content you can access, but also in the world around you. As you help Malfurion's druids gain a stronger foothold in the Firelands, you'll start to see new NPCs and structures appear, and the fledgling Sentinel Tree planted at your arrival at the Molten Front will begin to grow into a massive protective canopy.\nPersonal Progression, Personal Gain.\nUnlike the Isle of Quel'Danas, though, which unlocked in stages for all &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s on an entire &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; (at the same time), progression at the Regrowth and Molten Front will be completely personal. Your actions will have a direct impact on what quests you'll unlock next, and how each hub will evolve visually.\nTo ensure that friends can play together even if they're not progressing identically, we've avoided separating players through &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt; for all but a couple individual quests. The hub may look very different from one player to another, but they can all still adventure together. No matter where you are in the progression, the Sentinel Tree will be alive and thriving with fellow defenders of Mount Hyjal!\nI Choose You, Druids of the Talon! (Or maybe you, Shadow Wardens!).\nWithin the Regrowth and Molten Front daily quest areas, players will have numerous options, both in terms of the content they unlock and what quests they might play through on a daily basis. One of the first places players will get to experience this type of \"modular\" gameplay is near the entrance to the Molten Front, in the forward base known as &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%27s%20Breach\"&gt;Malfurion's Breach&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn addition to your normal duties at this outpost, you'll also be asked to secure the aid of two benevolent orders stationed in Mount Hyjal: the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Skylord%20Omnuron\"&gt;Skylord Omnuron&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, a fierce group of night elves under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Saynna%20Stormrunner\"&gt;Captain Saynna Stormrunner&lt;/a&gt;. This will be a pivotal point in your progression within the Molten Front and represents the first big unlock of new content for the area.\nTo secure the allegiance of the druids and &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, you'll need to collect Marks of the World Tree to present to each order's leader. Once you've gained the appropriate amount of marks and turn them in, you'll unlock a unique set of daily quests tailored to either the Druids of the Talon or the Shadow Wardens. If you unlock the Druids of the Talon dailies, your journeys will take you into the shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Furnace\"&gt;Furnace&lt;/a&gt;, an area wreathed in constant flame; the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Flow\"&gt;Molten Flow&lt;/a&gt;, a river of lava inhabited by &lt;a href=\"flamewaker\"&gt;flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s for as far as the eye can see; and &lt;a href=\"Fireplume%20Peak\"&gt;Fireplume Peak&lt;/a&gt;, a floating island protected by hot-tempered &lt;a href=\"fire%20hawk\"&gt;fire hawk&lt;/a&gt;s. If you opt to unlock the Shadow Warden dailies, you'll lay siege to the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Spire\"&gt;Forlorn Spire&lt;/a&gt;, wresting it from the enemy's grasp and establishing a new forward outpost. From there, you'll be poised to attack the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Clutch\"&gt;Widow's Clutch&lt;/a&gt;, the breeding grounds for hordes of &lt;a href=\"fire%20spider\"&gt;fire spider&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Wildflame%20Point\"&gt;Wildflame Point&lt;/a&gt;, a base of operations for the nefarious Druids of the Flame.\nOnce you've recruited both the Druids of the Talon and the Shadow Wardens, you'll have the option to choose which set of daily quests you complete each day. You'll only able to be complete one set of daily quests per reset (either the Druid of the Talon dailies or the Shadow Warden dailies), but the choice of which path you take is up to you.\nVariety is the Spice of Life.\nEarlier, we mentioned that over 60 new quests would be available at the Regrowth and the Molten Front. Since this is quite a lot of content -- almost half a zone's worth! -- many of these quests will be randomized into smaller groups. Out of 15 possible quests at a certain hub, for example, you might be able to pick up between three to five each day. This should help keep the content feeling fresh and fun, and your daily quest load a lot more manageable.\nThis randomization will also play off the environment. On one day, you may be tasked to bolster the defenses outside of Malfurion's Breach against an onslaught of &lt;a href=\"Molten%20giant\"&gt;Molten Giants&lt;/a&gt;. On another, you'll be pitted against &lt;a href=\"lava%20worm\"&gt;lava worm&lt;/a&gt;s that have surfaced throughout the outpost. These quests will be based on the events taking place around you and are likely to change daily.\nRewards? I Love Rewards! Hippogryphs all around!\nYou'll be rewarded handsomely for your efforts in these embattled regions. In addition to all the new gear you'll be able to purchase from the unlockable vendors, you'll also receive an additional set of rewards upon opening up all the available content at both daily quest areas.\nPlayers who take on this task will be presented with a stunning &lt;a href=\"%3AFlameward%20Hippogryph\"&gt;:Flameward Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; (shown below), as well a special one-time quest line that will explore the origins of &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt;, the powerful Druid of the Flame who commands the Firelord's forces at the Regrowth and Molten Front, and why her hatred for Malfurion Stormrage burns so brightly.\nAfter years of preparation and maneuvering, the &lt;a href=\"Firelord\"&gt;Firelord&lt;/a&gt;'s power is now potent enough to threaten Azeroth with a devastating invasion. The Guardians of Hyjal will require the aid of the mightiest heroes to have a chance of survival. You've heard their call -- will you answer?"}

The &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; will take place sometime after &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3\"&gt;patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shattering.\nShortly before December 7, Azeroth will change forever. &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; will emerge from the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, bringing about the Shattering of the world and burning anyone and anything in his path. The events leading up to the release of World of Warcraft: Cataclysm will reach their culmination, and Azeroth's citizens will face the devastation they feared all along.\nThe Elemental Invasion.\nAfter the appearance of &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; agents in Orgrimmar and Stormwind City, Azeroth's defenders swiftly thwarted the cult's bid to destroy the two capitals. Yet these victories have done little to soothe fears over Azeroth's calamitous state. Earthquakes continue shaking the world with greater frequency than ever before. Wayward fire spirits have engulfed Orgrimmar, threatening to reduce the proud Horde capital to ash. Across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;, a sudden influx of earth spirits has rocked the foundations of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the once-indomitable &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; bastion to the brink of collapse.\nEven so, a glimmer of hope has come in the form of ancient tablets recovered in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. These mysterious artifacts are believed to hold clues concerning Azeroth's tormented elementals -- a claim that can only be validated once the artifacts are delivered safely from the northern continent. The gifted &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; Thrall has also begun his own efforts to shed light on the disasters befalling the world. Of great concern, however, is whether anything will be left of Orgrimmar and Ironforge by the time answers are found...\nThe events leading up to Cataclysm are underway, and the disturbances will only become more severe as the weeks pass, so stay vigilant! Pay close attention to your faction leaders, Thrall and Varian; be on the lookout for unfamiliar faces gathering on the city streets; and don't miss out on the all-new &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s featured during this one-time-only series of events.\nWrath of the Elements.\nLittle progress has been made toward mending Azeroth's dire condition. Thrall has nonetheless continued forging ahead in search of answers. Most recently, he journeyed to his ancestors' lands in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; on the shattered world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. At the fabled &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, he has met with other wise shaman, including the venerable dwarf &lt;a href=\"Gavan%20Grayfeather\"&gt;Gavan Grayfeather&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to glean even the smallest shred of insight that could help him save Azeroth from ruin.\nMeanwhile, Twilight's Hammer &lt;a href=\"cultist\"&gt;cultist&lt;/a&gt;s have been caught infiltrating Orgrimmar and Stormwind City, sparking panic and suspicion among the two great cities' inhabitants. Although the cult's earlier bid to wreak havoc on these capitals had failed, this new development has raised fears that the Twilight's Hammer is poised to launch another, far more devastating attack.\nThe events leading up to Cataclysm are underway and a great disturbance of the elements has erupted. Don't miss out on the all-new quests featured during this one-time-only series of events.\nThe Invasion Has Begun.\nPanic has seized Orgrimmar, Stormwind City, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and Ironforge. In each of these great capitals, guards have ordered citizens to evacuate in preparation for what they believe will be an elemental invasion of catastrophic proportions.\nYet not everyone has chosen to flee.\nSeveral brave heroes have resolved to face the coming storm. Members of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; and leaders from among Azeroth's noble &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s have also assembled to protect these Horde and Alliance strongholds from destruction. Exactly how the impending elemental assault will unfold remains unknown... and even the most ardent defenders are on edge as they await the threat of annihilation.\nThe events leading up to Cataclysm have reached a tipping point. Be sure to take advantage of this one-time opportunity to embark on unique new quests and fight for the survival of your homelands.\nElemental Invasion Survival Kit.\nAzeroth's capital cities, once bastions of trade and commerce, are now under siege by forces from the Elemental Planes. While faction leaders have recently established &lt;a href=\"Evacuation%20Portal\"&gt;Evacuation Portal&lt;/a&gt;s throughout each city, allowing concerned denizens to safely escape before the next full-scale invasion occurs, we understand that accidents can still happen. In the event of an emergency, for example, you may become trapped, separated from your evacuation party, or be otherwise unable to reach a secure location.\nTo ensure that you're adequately prepared for this worst-case scenario and can survive until reinforcements arrive, we've created a list of items to include in an Invasion Survival Kit to help you withstand the wrath of the elements.\nThe following items are recommended for all Invasion Survival Kits:"}

It's about various romantic places around the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nWhen love is in the air, our thoughts often turn to romance of the personal variety. Each year around now, the time comes to grab your romantic picnic basket, blanket, and umbrella, and sweep your companion off their feet as you take them somewhere nice for once. Don't know precisely where that might be? No problem \u2013 we've got you covered.\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#6 \u2013 Nagrand Skylands.\nHave these remarkable islands floating in the sky above &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; been called romantic so much that they've become clich\u00e9? Probably, but that's no reason not to take your sweetheart here and take in the beauty and wonder of a &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;world torn asunder&lt;/a&gt;.\nYes, that sounded quite poetic, and for good reason. This place is inspiring on many levels. For one, you'll need to be able to fly to get up here, which means using an &lt;a href=\"%3AX-53%20Touring%20Rocket\"&gt;:X-53 Touring Rocket&lt;/a&gt; if only one of you knows how to fly. Another good reason to choose one of these hunks of rock in the sky: there's very little chance you'll be surprise-attacked. It's so private that your enemies will almost never come looking for you so far above the fray. You could get away with anything up here.\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#5 \u2013 Along the riverside (Grizzly Hills).\nBetween the peacefulness of the flowing river and the utterly heartwarming music you'll hear while you're here, this tranquil spot in the otherwise dangerous &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; is hard to beat. It's definitely worth the trip to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; with your date.\nWhat a nice place to get out your &lt;a href=\"%3ALovebird%20Hatchling\"&gt;:Lovebird Hatchling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Peddlefeet\"&gt;Peddlefeet&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"%3AToxic%20Wasteling\"&gt;:Toxic Wasteling&lt;/a&gt;, and let them scamper around the riverbanks! Perhaps a leisurely pet battle between the two of you would spark something exciting and new. Impress your partner with the knowledge that Toxic Wasteling eats other critters. Everyone loves a know-it-all.\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#4 \u2013 The Heartland (Valley of the Four Winds).\nHave you been to the &lt;a href=\"farm\"&gt;farm&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt; lately? They're wonderful! Furthermore, there must be a love-related reason that this region is called The &lt;a href=\"Heartland\"&gt;Heartland&lt;/a&gt;. The word \u201cheart\u201d is right there in the name. It's right there.\nPick a spot and then pick some food in this bountiful breadbasket of beauty. You're on a picnic after all, and eating is surely among the three or four most enjoyable activities you'll want to share with your loved one. Did you remember to pick up some &lt;a href=\"Box%20of%20Chocolates\"&gt;Boxes of Chocolates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bag%20of%20Heart%20Candies\"&gt;Bags of Heart Candies&lt;/a&gt; before heading out here? They're probably vegan, or close enough.\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#3 \u2013 Crystalsong Forest (Northrend).\nWhen you're ready to make the magic happen, take your sweetie to this glowing land of beauty and peace in the heart of Northrend. Hold each other close as you look around in wonder at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Shandaral\"&gt;Ruins of Shandaral&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by the crystalline remains of the &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, which was almost wiped from existence by the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in this place. Then quickly change the subject away from &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; genocide.\nThis is a fantastic spot to earn the Achievement \u201c&lt;a href=\"%3AThe%20Rocket%27s%20Pink%20Glare\"&gt;:The Rocket's Pink Glare&lt;/a&gt;\u201d. All you need to do is shoot off 10 &lt;a href=\"Love%20Rocket\"&gt;Love Rocket&lt;/a&gt;s in 20 seconds or less. They make great pink hearts in the sky above your picnic, which is sure to take your minds off of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; who haunt this place. Everything will be okay; focus on the &lt;a href=\"firework\"&gt;firework&lt;/a&gt;s!\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#2 \u2013 The Arboretum (Jade Forest).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt; sure picked a lovely place to set up their training grounds, and you should set up your picnic right here in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Blossoming trees seem to perpetually drop pink blooms all over everything here, and there's a stream that runs around the encampment, and the &lt;a href=\"cloud%20serpent\"&gt;cloud serpent&lt;/a&gt;s-in-training drift to and fro. It's idyllic, for real.\nIf you obtained a &lt;a href=\"%3AForever-Lovely%20Rose\"&gt;:Forever-Lovely Rose&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Hummel\"&gt;Apothecary Hummel&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"%3AHeart-Shaped%20Box\"&gt;:Heart-Shaped Box&lt;/a&gt;, this is the place to give it to your date and let her know that you're forever in debt to her priceless advice. She'll surely eye you like a Pisces when you do.\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n#1 \u2013 Azurebreeze Coast (Eversong Woods).\n&lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong woods&lt;/a&gt;! Has there ever been a more romantic place in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;? Sure, this region used to be much more romantic, and it now sports a huge &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; down the middle. Okay, we'll admit that the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; right there to the south is a bummer. And yes, there are bunches of angry &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s on the west coast, and the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ruins of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; are a drag. But don't lose hope yet! You've got love and a picnic basket, right?\nHead to the east of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, right past &lt;a href=\"Duskwither%20Spire\"&gt;Duskwither Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and when you get to the Forbidding Sea, put down your blanket and soak up the glory. You've brought your special someone to a place where love is bound to happen. Everywhere you look, the grasses are green and the trees are golden. It's simply perfect \u2026 if you like that sort of thing.\nGood for:\n&lt;hr&gt;\nLife's a Picnic.\nThere you have it: the Top Six Most Romantic Spots for a Picnic in Azeroth (and Outland). Do you know of an even more delightful place to take someone you adore? We doubt it, but you can share your secret love location in the comments below! \nDon't be shy.\nAlso, check out Crendor's take on this subject in his newest video!"}

It's about &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s model change in .\nArticle.\nFortified citadels lay in ruins. Ancient forests burn brightly in the light of the setting sun. Arid stretches of desert, once known to claim even the most hearty of travelers, now house fertile oases teeming with new species of flora.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; changed a great many things. While the landscapes of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; may have been the most visibly affected by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s return, many of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s heroes have also undergone drastic physical transformations of their own.\nOne of the most notable metamorphoses in Cataclysm is that of Thrall. Thrall He's worn many titles in his lifetime: &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf Clan&lt;/a&gt;, and, most recently, &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Now, as the son of &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; puts down the mantle of warchief and takes up the simple garb of a shaman once again, we take a look back at his journey and the events that shaped him into the orc he is today.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; was once a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic weapon of indiscriminate slaughter -- a far departure from the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' proud and shamanic origins. Thrall's rise to become Horde warchief, however, changed everything. After escaping from his enslavement by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall helped rally the remnants of the Horde, revitalized the orcs' shamanic traditions, and established a refuge for his embattled race in the arid land of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. In the years that followed, the image of Warchief Thrall bearing the &lt;a href=\"Doomhammer\"&gt;legendary warhammer&lt;/a&gt; and battle-worn black armor of the late &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was etched in the minds of friends and foes alike. All that the Horde had become -- its courage, its strength, and its honor -- Thrall embodied.\"\n\"When Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; spirits grew increasingly erratic just prior to the Shattering, Thrall was torn between his worldly responsibilities as warchief and his spiritual duties as a shaman. Ultimately, he followed his instincts and entrusted control over the Horde -- and everything he had labored to build -- to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall also shed the armor that had come to symbolize him as warchief and donned the simplistic robes and prayer beads of a shaman. While Garrosh has made questionable changes to the Horde in recent times, Thrall remains focused on allaying the forces that threaten to tear Azeroth itself apart. Some members of the Horde might want him as their warchief, but the world needs him as a shaman above all else.\"\nWe'll be examining other key characters' transformations -- including those of Garrosh, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; -- in the months ahead, so come back soon."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nLocated in the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; subcontinent and nestled between the sea and great mountain ranges to the north and south, the ancestral home of the &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Proudmoores&lt;/a&gt; is a bustling land of opportunity\u2014if you know where to look. Join us as we take you on a brief tour of Tiragarde Sound and the &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe region of Tiragarde Sound serves as the heart of Kul Tiras. Nearly bisected by the capital city of Boralus, the land is rich with wildlife in the hills and mountains to the north and south, and its people enjoy the bounty of the oceans to the south, east, and west. It is a realm of people in touch with both the land and the sea.\nWelcome to Tiragarde Sound. \n[\" Embed of YouTube Video: https://youtu.be/oWpyw4rp_HY \"]\nAny hopes for a warm reception in Tiragarde Sound will be quickly dashed upon your arrival. Wounds run deep between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt;s, inflicted by the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;tragic events&lt;/a&gt; that led to the death of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Your mission of diplomacy will begin on rough political seas, and the journey to redemption will be a long one.\nThe heart of Kul Tiras is sick with infighting and corruption. Gangs run rampant, while the region's noble leaders squabble for power and influence. It will take determination to get to the root of all that is transpiring here and restore the glorious legacy of the Proudmoores\u2014the future of the Alliance depends on it.\nBoralus is a city beholden to the sea. Roughhewn wooden planks line intertwining walkways, terraces, and stairs. Sea-weathered rooftops and awnings adorn the buildings, while amber-lit windows and walkway lanterns lend honeyed tones to the atmosphere. Stone thoroughfares and hanging colorful nautical flags strike a contrast to the sea-worn brick-and-wood construction, creating a sense of warmth despite the chill of the surrounding sea. The sounds of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Gull\"&gt;Tiragarde gulls&lt;/a&gt; can be heard crying overhead as you explore your new home away from home.\nIron-reinforced locks in the center of &lt;a href=\"Boralus%20Harbor\"&gt;Boralus Harbor&lt;/a&gt; bar the way from the sea into the inner channels at the heart of the city, while &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s on either side serve as an additional deterrent to vessels approaching with ill intent. Great galleons make their berth in the harbor, but at first blush, these ships don't appear to be quite the naval force the Alliance was expecting to find in Kul Tiras.\nWithin the harbor's &lt;a href=\"Tradewinds%20Market\"&gt;Tradewinds Market&lt;/a&gt;, visitors will find everything they need for an extended stay in Boralus. &lt;a href=\"Merchant\"&gt;Merchant&lt;/a&gt;s from all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; are drawn here to hawk their wares, traveling well-establishing trade routes between here, the town of &lt;a href=\"Hatherford\"&gt;Hatherford&lt;/a&gt;, and the fertile lands of Stormsong Valley. Facilities include an &lt;a href=\"inn\"&gt;inn&lt;/a&gt;; three portals to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;; a ship to Stormwind; &lt;a href=\"Profession%20trainer\"&gt;Profession trainer&lt;/a&gt;s; a &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s; an &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Map\"&gt;Expedition Map&lt;/a&gt;; and more. Don't forget to pick up your &lt;a href=\"Ferry%20Pass\"&gt;ferry pass&lt;/a&gt; so you can travel by sea as well.\nMind where you wander in this expansive city, and take care where you wind up. Not everyone in the city is a fine, upstanding citizen, and it's dangerous to find yourself on the wrong side of town.\nBeyond the City.\nYou'll find many more estates and ports to explore throughout Tiragarde Sound. You'll soon discover the situation among the nobility is becoming explosive, and you'll need to seek out the source of it all.\nTo the northwest of Boralus lie the green rolling hills of &lt;a href=\"Norwington%20Estate\"&gt;Norwington Estate&lt;/a&gt;, where you'll be able to delve into Kul Tiran culture, take part in their festival, and embark on a tour. Animal husbandry and horsemanship are important disciplines to the Kul Tirans, many of whom are skilled &lt;a href=\"rider\"&gt;rider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"falconer\"&gt;falconer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFurther north you'll encounter the &lt;a href=\"Roughnecks\"&gt;Roughnecks&lt;/a&gt;, who are responsible for training the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s used by the Kul Tirans. You'll need your cold-weather gear if you plan to trudge into the &lt;a href=\"Waning%20Glacier\"&gt;Waning Glacier&lt;/a&gt; and brave the bitter cold winds that blow through its crenellated passages.\nWhile they're renowned for their naval prowess, the people of Tiragarde Sound are accomplished &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as well, even going so far as to seek out the terrifying monsters that lurk in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Those who enjoy a little hunting and fishing will want to visit &lt;a href=\"Kennings%20Lodge\"&gt;Kennings Lodge&lt;/a&gt; south of Boralus, and there's plenty of opportunity to seek out game in a land where wild &lt;a href=\"Fjord%20Mustang\"&gt;Fjord Mustang&lt;/a&gt;s run free\u2014there's something for everyone here.\nHere Thar Be Pirates.\nFurther south, you won't find a bigger hive of scum and villainy than &lt;a href=\"Freehold\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt;. It's populated by &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s, scoundrels, and those who claim to seek to live free of Kul Tiran control. These scoundrels pose a growing threat to the ruling families of Kul Tiras and are due to be reined in before it's too late.\n\"*There are three new dungeons in Kul Tiras: &lt;a href=\"Freehold%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Freehold&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Boralus\"&gt;Siege of Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nSiege of Boralus.\nThere is much to experience in Tiragarde Sound, and untold dangers await throughout its hills and valleys. Inland, the mountains and forests provide prime hunting grounds. A vast coastline borders Tiragarde Sound to the south, west, and east, where those brave enough can fish, boat, swim, and hunt for treasure\u2014just be sure to bring some earplugs for the &lt;a href=\"siren\"&gt;siren&lt;/a&gt;s on the southern coast.\nWhen you're ready to venture outside of Tiragarde Sound, the rolling hills and mountains of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt; lie to the north, while westward you'll find the stygian hills and mountains of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;. Your opportunity to earn your way into the good graces of the Kul Tirans awaits."}

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt; implemented in the game.\nArticle.\n\"An island off the coast of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, Tol Barad is a historic land now sought-after by the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Its strategic, isolated location makes it an ideal stronghold from which to conduct military strikes. In , a battle will be waged to seize control of this prized territory. Should you triumph, unique rewards await you. Read more about this all-new world &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;ing zone here.\"\nThe Fight for Tol Barad.\nSimilar to &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;, Tol Barad will serve as an open world PvP zone, although there is also a hub on &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad%20Peninsula\"&gt;Tol Barad Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; for both &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s to complete &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s. Reachable by &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, or via a level-85 mage teleport or portal, Tol Barad will accept up to 80 players per faction to engage in brutal combat across the island's surface. Unlike Wintergrasp, Tol Barad will not have &lt;a href=\"Tenacity%20%28Wintergrasp%29\"&gt;Tenacity&lt;/a&gt; buffs. Instead, the queue system will attempt to match each side at a 1-to-1 ratio. Battles will take place every two hours and thirty minutes, giving the offensive faction a chance to claim territory.\nTol Barad will feature capture-point gameplay. There are three keeps and three towers for the defending side to hold. When destroyed by the attackers, each tower will add five minutes to the standard fifteen-minute battle timer. In order to win, though, all three keeps must be captured and controlled by the attackers. If these keeps cannot be taken by the attacking forces, the defending faction will claim victory in Tol Barad. Similar to &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;, Tol Barad determines whether a keep has been captured by the number of players from each side in the immediate area. There is, however, a new twist: each time a member of your faction is killed in the immediate vicinity of a keep, a slider bar will move slightly in favor of the opposing faction. So not only does the size of each force in the area determine who controls each keep, but losing allies during the contesting process determines control as well.\nIn order to destroy the defenders' towers, attackers will have access to an all-new type of war machine: &lt;a href=\"Abandoned%20Siege%20Engine\"&gt;Abandoned Siege Engine&lt;/a&gt;s. Six of these Siege Engines will be placed around the map, and these vehicles can be used to bombard the towers. In contrast to the Siege Engines of Wintergrasp, these machines cannot attack players or buildings while the vehicles are being driven. Instead, players must drive them within range of a tower and jump out, allowing the vehicle to transform into an automated cannon that can lay siege to the tower. The Abandoned Siege Engine will continue to damage the closest tower in range until the machine is destroyed by opposing forces.\nTo the Victor Go the Spoils.\nPlayers who win the battle for Tol Barad will be awarded honor points in addition to &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad%20Commendation\"&gt;Tol Barad commendations&lt;/a&gt;. These commendations can be used along with new reputations as currency with special &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s who sell &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s, and more. In addition, the controlling faction will have unique access to extra daily quests. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Archavon\"&gt;Vault of Archavon&lt;/a&gt;, Tol Barad gives those who control it the chance to form a raid and best foul beasts locked within &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt; for precious rewards.\nQuesting for a Living.\nAside from the battle to control Tol Barad, there are many quests available to both factions just off of the main island on Tol Barad Peninsula. Members of the Horde will assist &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Hellscream's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, an all-new faction vying for control of Tol Barad. At odds with the Horde are &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, an Alliance faction also seeking to command the territory. Six unique quests, randomly determined from a larger pool of missions, will be offered daily. This will allow for diversity in completing quest objectives as you explore Tol Barad Peninsula over time. The faction that controls Tol Barad will also have sole access to six additional daily quests. Completing each of these exclusive quests will award experience, gold, and Tol Barad commendations. By accomplishing these tasks, players will learn of the perilous inmates held within the prison on Tol Barad, as well as why this isolated land is of great importance to Hellscream's Reach and Baradin's Wardens. In addition, increasing reputation with these new factions will grant access to incredible rewards.\nWith so much at stake in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Tol Barad will be fiercely sought-after by the Horde and the Alliance, but it's up to you to help determine which side makes this island the next great military port of the Eastern Kingdoms."}

Highly replayable and inspired by roguelike games, heroes are invited to explore its ever-changing halls and chambers and do battle with the minions of the Jailer, Torghast\u2019s vile ruler. Those who brave its trials can claim legendary treasures and help free the heroic spirits wrongfully trapped within.\nTorghast is an otherworldly place, with an ever-shifting interior. There are many areas to discover, and at this time players will be able to explore Skoldus Halls and Fracture Chambers.\nYour Mission.\nWith every floor, enemies will become stronger but you\u2019ll also become more powerful by using temporary skills called Anima Powers. Levels will also become more complex the higher you climb\u2014the first few floors will have a simple layout, but higher up you\u2019ll be dealing with traps, puzzles, and locked doors that will require keys held by ruthless enemies.\nAlways Changing.\nThese dynamic wings change their layout each time you step inside, and they can also be influenced by the Jailer\u2019s command\u2014changing the types of enemies you encounter and the Anima Powers available for you to choose between.\nThe Power of Anima.\nAnima Powers grant you the incredible strength needed to take on the Jailer\u2019s more challenging allies. They will often directly improve one of your Covenant class or signature abilities, modifying it with powerful properties for you to wield. Anima Powers can be found hidden in corners, tucked away in phylacteries, or carried on the bodies of the Jailer\u2019s servitors. Keep an eye out for powers that interact with one another in interesting ways!\nPhantasma and Vendors.\nSometimes enemies will drop Phantasma, a currency that is unique to Torghast. You may also find Phantasma from Anima Powers or breakable objects. Your Phantasma all disappears as soon as you leave Torghast. Occasionally, you may find a Broker, a Phantasma vendor within Torghast, who will allow you to spend your Phantasma to buy Anima Powers, along with other consumables that will aid you on your run.\nDeaths and the Tarragrue.\nBy and large, your failures in Torghast are measured in deaths, not with a timer. Dying repeatedly alerts the Tarragrue, a lumbering iron-clad creature that will appear at the level\u2019s entrance and slowly move toward its end. If he sees any heroes, he will chase down and kill them. If he reaches the end of the level or kills all the players in the level, your run ends and you are thrown out of Torghast.\nLegendary Rewards.\nAs you climb the tower, you may discover a floor that contains a Legendary chest. Inside you\u2019ll discover reagents to craft legendary items that can be taken to a mysterious rune sage who will help you build legendary items. You are in full control\u2014you can choose which type of equipment you\u2019ll make and what powers will go in them to make them truly your own.\nWe look forward to sharing more information as development continues, and we hope this preview prepares you for the trials of Torghast!\nWhat kind of Anima Powers would you like to see? Join the discussion on the forums.\n\"Torghast is still in development and subject to change. Legendary items are still being worked on and are not currently available in alpha. Check back for periodic updates on worldofwarcraft.com as we approach the release of Shadowlands.\""}

You'll also find key places such as the tainted &lt;a href=\"world%20tree\"&gt;world tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; fortress that dates back to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n[ \"Embed of Soundcloud Soundtrack \"]\nEnraptured Woodlands Composed by Edo Guidotti and Jason Hayes.\nQ. How would you describe the zone's ambience? What's it like?\nSteve Burke: We were really shooting for what would be the closest to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; realized on Azeroth. Every square inch of this forest has been manicured by the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s for hundreds of years. We've got the Grove of Cenarius here, so that's the fount of all druidism, right? That's where all these uber &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Arch Druids&lt;/a&gt; have trained, so a lot of big history has happened there.\nThen juxtaposed with this, we have the Emerald Nightmare. It was exciting, but it was tough for us to pin down how we would execute on that. We had some fits and starts, but I really like where it landed. You've got this big transition of \u201cHey, in the last week or two the World Tree that's there has become completely corrupted.\u201d It's spreading throughout the forest, and I think we've got that really cool battle line drawn right through one of the Arch Druids' groves. It's just being taken over so you really get to see that cause and effect and contrast. Seeing what it does to the druids and the creatures\u2014the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014is really cool. We also have &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, who's a villain who has a little bit of familiarity, so we didn't have to do too much to establish him. You get to hate him right away.\nTo break that up, we really felt we needed Black Rook Hold for something a little different. We have a &lt;a href=\"Bradensbrook\"&gt;Gilnean village&lt;/a&gt; at the foot of Black Rook Keep, where they've carved out their own little area that wasn't being used by the druids. It's that classic little village in the shadow of the keep above.\nQ. Which locations would you say are some of your favorites, and why?\nSteve Burke: Black Rook Hold is definitely one of my favorites. This point of interest (PoI) in particular is my favorite because I had a blank slate. I could say, \u201cOK, as a designer what makes the best PoI?\u201d Not just art, but the gameplay and hitting that fantasy. I sat down with &lt;a href=\"Julian%20Morris\"&gt;Julian Morris&lt;/a&gt; and other leads and talked about previous points of interest where you could stand in them and just digest the whole thing. It's not accessible, and you can't necessarily reach it, but you can get that goal of, \u201cOh man, I can't wait to get into that place or up over the hill.\u201d It kind of tells its own story just by looking at it. The setting already kind of speaks to you, and then we can focus on the little local stories and just have fun weaving you through. Especially something this epic where you gradually get there in the end. You've kind of solved a mystery\u2014or set the stage for a dungeon, in this case. It's really great.+\nAnother one is the Grove of Cenarius, and that is one of my favorites just because of all of the history. This is &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. This is where he is. It was hard making this zone just in regard to how much druid lore we have out there. All these big characters\u2014how do we do service to them all? If we threw everything in here, your head would be spinning. You'd get to spend two seconds on this character, and then you wouldn't be able to really know them.\nSo we're talking about the story that we want to tell as you go through the zone that takes up a little bit of player bandwidth just to say, \u201cOk there's Xavius again and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; has empowered him. They've kind of resurrected him and now he's impacting this force.\u201d So a part of the story. How many characters do we get to fit in here without blowing the player's mind? It was just clear Cenarius had to be here, but he's so big and he's so powerful, how can we have a crisis here if he's part of the picture? He can just blow anything away, right? I like the way it landed where he's just so interconnected with the Emerald Dream that when the Emerald Dream is under assault by the Nightmare, it has affected him in a very serious way. So we got to have him in the zone visibly, just not in a state where he can really impact events. \nWe can also still play with big characters\u2014we've got Malfurion, and later we have &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; in there. That was tricky, since both &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; interact with her. With her chasing after Malfurion, who's been lost, there was enough urgency that it felt OK for her to use you as a Horde player, to set our differences aside for right now. For her, it's a matter of making some very difficult choices between her husband and her duty to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the Temple of Elune, it's under siege, and there's a lot to lose there. This was something I always wanted to build towards\u2014we've never seen anybody of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s stature physically in the game. How do we get that to happen? \nQ. Why do you think a player would want to start in this zone first?\nSteve Burke: I would say they shouldn't\u2014they should save it for last. It's tricky though. All of the zones are great. I hope this is where druids are going to want to go. They should feel like this is their place, and if they don't, I've done something wrong. That was day one where I was like, \u201cOk, I get to play with Val'sharah. Obviously, we have got to play these druids up in a way we just haven't done before in the game.\u201d\nThere's been a lot in our lore that talks about how important they are, but here I just wanted to give them a story that would be super intimate to them\u2014playable and appreciable by everybody, but one that would really resonate with them. Their &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Class Hall&lt;/a&gt; is here, but I wanted the zone and the zone story to be something they could connect with in a special way, so hopefully we did that.\nQ. What is it that will bring them back to this zone?\nSteve Burke: Mechanically, we have &lt;a href=\"World%20quest\"&gt;World Quests&lt;/a&gt;\u2014that's the easy answer. Storywise, there's an epic story that goes through and touches on Black Rook Hold with &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;. We've got the level-up dungeon, which is the &lt;a href=\"Darkheart%20Thicket\"&gt;Darkheart Thicket&lt;/a&gt; underneath the World Tree, and we've got the max-level dungeon with Black Rook Hold, so that will definitely bring you back.\nBut yeah, the World Quests\u2014hopefully we set the table for you so that it will bring you back and put you into that familiar setting where you can keep helping to push back the Nightmare.\nQ. Is there anything else that players should look forward to here?\nSteve Burke: There are a lot of little touches everywhere, but I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who's looking forward to that exploration."}

They guide troubled souls upon the rigorous path to atonement, harvesting anima to keep their realm strong.\nIf you\u2019re seeking a bit of grace wrapped in a bit of sin, then look no further than the aristocratic and elegant Venthyr Covenant. Every day among them brings punishment and reward\u2014though telling the two apart can get a bit fuzzy. But beneath the polish and refinement, the seeds of rebellion against the master of the realm, Sire Denathrius, lie planted. . . .\nIf you\u2019re a master of discretion and keen on intrigue, then the Venthyr Covenant is waiting for you to join them.\nRenown Rewards.\nAs you\u2019re put through your paces and prove your mettle to the Venthyr through their Covenant Campaign, you\u2019ll build Renown. Increasing Renown will provide you access to unique rewards from your Covenant. Learn more about Renown in our Covenant Systems article.\nIn your pursuit to earn Renown, you\u2019ll go into the Maw to recover wayward souls and bring them to your Covenant Sanctum; some will even embark on Adventures on your behalf.\nCovenant Sanctum: Sinfall.\nEach of the four Covenants have features that they share among them, but they also have a feature that is uniquely their own. For the Venthyr Covenant, it\u2019s in the form of an elaborate party within the Ember Court.\nThe Ember Court.\nThe venthyr are a people who embrace the finer things. Their elegance and aristocratic air is most prominently on display in the Ember Court, where grand galas are hosted. Receiving an invitation\u2014let alone being seen\u2014is paramount to a venthyr\u2019s reputation. Prince Renethal is seeking to establish a new order\u2014with your help.\nYou\u2019ll be tasked to invite guests, arrange for some refreshments, fend off party crashers, and in general play host or hostess with the most-est. You\u2019ll get to live the full experience of the venthyr and witness more of their larger-than-afterlife personalities\u2014while getting some loot for making the event a success.\nTravel System: Blood Mirrors.\nAs you seek to restore Sinfall to its peak glory, you\u2019ll focus on upgrading different aspects of the Sanctum. One of these is a transportation network that makes it easier to get around\u2014especially within the Venthyr Covenant\u2019s own dominion of Revendreth.\nTrue to their nature, the Venthyr have their own distinctive way of traveling using Blood Mirrors. With the aid of a master mirror maker, several mirrors can be altered or reconstructed throughout Revendreth to provide an investing individual with shortcuts and quick access across the landscape.\nVenthyr Adventures.\nIn Adventures, you\u2019ll put your tactical skills to the test by sending your allies into the Shadowlands and lending aid to the Venthyr Covenant. While this feature is available to each Covenant, the allies you recruit and the missions you assign them will be unique to the Covenant. You\u2019ll need to get to know the strength and weaknesses of the adventurers you send out with the scouting map.\nAnima Conductor.\nPlayers can enable additional content with their Covenant\u2019s realm by investing Anima into specific areas in Revendreth. When you restore Anima to a location, it revitalizes the area, allowing you to access new quests, make it easier for you to unearth wondrous treasures, or lure out powerful foes you can slay for rewards. Different areas are tied to different content unlocks.\nMeet Your Venthyr Soulbinds.\nOnce you\u2019ve proven your worth, you\u2019ll unlock the ability to Soulbind with one of several select characters in the Covenant, who will share their distinctive powers with you in the form of a variety of traits and bonuses.\nThe proud venthyr you befriended in Revendreth will form a special bond with you if you join their Covenant. Below are descriptions of each, along with a few example powers they can bestow upon you.\nNadjia the Mistblade is the self-proclaimed greatest duelist to ever wield a blade, who rebels at stagnation and longs for the next new experience. Wherever there is trouble, you can expect to find Nadjia there at the heart of it. She is ready to turn her skills to the defense of Revendreth at your command, and her entertainment.\nGeneral Draven served Revendreth for eons as commander of the Stone Legion. He is on the front line of any battlefield, will fight with honor to the very end, and never leaves a soldier behind.\nTheotar the Mad Duke knows all too well that insanity is no excuse for bad manners! Exiled from traditional aristocratic circles, he formed his own court of outcasts to gossip with. Whether weaving powerful magic through his favorite teapot or animating dredgers to carry his umbrella for him, Theotar wields the incredible power of Revendreth in his own, eccentric way.\nSharing in the Wealth.\nWhen you join the Venthyr Covenant, you\u2019ll gain two new unique abilities\u2014one signature ability and one class ability.\nSignature abilities are available to all Covenant members regardless of class, race, or specialization.\nCovenant class abilities provide additional combat-oriented gameplay options that are tailored to the theme of that Covenant.\nWe look forward to sharing more information as development continues, and we hope this preview gives you a taste of what the Venthyr Covenant has to offer.

It's about the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nArticle.\nLocated in the north west of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, Vol'dun is a vast and unforgiving land. Dunes of sand, salt flats, and bone breaking rocky terrain stretch from coast to coast, meeting up with &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; to the east and Zandalar to the south. Danger here comes as much from the arid and unrelenting landscape as it does from the creatures who eke out a living here.\nWelcome to Vol'dun. \nThe region of Vol'dun serves as a death sentence for those exiled from &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. But the land's apparent lack of of life is merely a mirage, and there's more to be learned if you scratch beyond the surface.\nPrincess &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt; has heard word that her father's &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;general&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jakra%27zet\"&gt;Jakra'zet&lt;/a&gt;, is secretly sending troops into Vol'dun. If you are to prove the value of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to her and secure the might of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Zandalari fleet&lt;/a&gt;, you'll need to venture into this inhospitable terrain to seek him out, learn of his plans, and put a stop to them before he takes down the entire &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nVenturing from the capital city will prove to be dangerous for you and your small team, and simply crossing the border would tip your hand to those who serve the general. As with any flight into hostile land, you'll need to be prepared . . . for anything. \nAs you explore this harsh land, you'll meet the &lt;a href=\"fox\"&gt;fox&lt;/a&gt;-like &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;\u2014a keen and intelligent race of nomadic scavengers capable of turning what they find into opportunities to thrive. But not all who live here are free. Once an ally to the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s, the reptilian &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; have taken to subjugating anyone they can as &lt;a href=\"slave\"&gt;slave&lt;/a&gt;s, and the vulpera are an easy target for their machinations. If you're to survive in Vul'dun and get to the heart of general Jakra'zet's plans, you'll need all the allies you can get. Lending aid to these creatures is bound to pay off.\nVulpera &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;s travel from hideaway to hideaway, peddling their wares, engaging in trade, and spreading information they pick up along the way. If you're fortunate, you'll be able to catch a ride on one and learn a bit more about these resourceful inhabitants.\nRemembering to Forget: We're All Akunda Now.\nTo the south looms the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Akunda\"&gt;Temple of Akunda&lt;/a&gt;. Like Nazmir and Zuldazar, this land is served by several of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;. Many who seek sanctuary travel to this temple to forget the ills of the past and serve the great loa &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt;. There is more to discover here, and with a little extra effort, you'll be able to get in this loa's good graces.\nNorth east of the Temple of Akunda, an outpost of outcasts has taken root near Atul'aman. Despite frequent sandstorms and short supplies, they've begun to herd &lt;a href=\"alpaca\"&gt;alpaca&lt;/a&gt; here among the harsh terrain. Keeping the herd safe from the likes of &lt;a href=\"hyena\"&gt;hyena&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27duni%20Dunecrawler\"&gt;Vol'duni Dunecrawler&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"saurolisk\"&gt;saurolisk&lt;/a&gt;s can be trying at best, and surviving off the land has hardened these people. They don't trust outsiders, and &lt;a href=\"marauder\"&gt;marauder&lt;/a&gt;s holing up in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Scorched%20Sands%20Arena\"&gt;Scorched Sands Arena&lt;/a&gt; regularly plague this fragile settlement, stealing what little supplies they have.\nRest Your Head at the Goldtusk Inn.\nTucked away near Atul'aman and nestled within a deep cavern is the hidden &lt;a href=\"Whistlebloom%20Oasis\"&gt;Whitebloom Oasis&lt;/a&gt;. Inside you'll find the &lt;a href=\"Goldtusk%20Inn\"&gt;Goldtusk Inn&lt;/a&gt;, which is run by a quirky innkeeper\u2014&lt;a href=\"Rhan%27ka\"&gt;Rhan'ka&lt;/a&gt;\u2014with a few curious requests. Lending Rhan'ka aid, a hand or two, and a bit of your bravery (or maybe a lot of it) will land you a few extra benefits, such as a new flight path and fully functioning inn you can make your own haven from the brutal heat of the desert.\nBits o'Honey?\nJust to slightly north of Whitebloom Oasis, a vulpera known as &lt;a href=\"Rikati\"&gt;Rikati&lt;/a&gt; sells some curious \u201cfood\u201d and drink such as &lt;a href=\"%3ABilewing%20%22Honey%22\"&gt;:Bilewing \"Honey\"&lt;/a&gt;\u2014it's probably not what you think it is. Nothing in this desert really is. If you're the adventurous type and have a bit of an iron stomach, you may want to stop by and explore new culinary frontiers.\nCaught between the Sethrak and the Sea.\nIf you're looking for tales of &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s, then look no further than the &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zem%27lan\"&gt;Port of Zem'lan&lt;/a&gt; to the southwest. It wouldn't be worth visiting if there wasn't word of a curse and treasure. The sounds of &lt;a href=\"gull\"&gt;gull&lt;/a&gt;s seem peaceful even amongst the broken vestiges of the port, and sethrak still patrol nearby. There are tales and mysteries to unravel here.\nAshvane Incursion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Company&lt;/a&gt; has infiltrated the southern region of Vol'dun. If you didn't already have to worry about General Jakra'zet, sethrak &lt;a href=\"slaver\"&gt;slaver&lt;/a&gt;s, cursed pirates, marauders, and a hostile desert filled with creatures bent on killing and (probably) eating you, adding these particular &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt;s to the mix isn't going to make things any easier for you. \nA Refuge Away?\nOn the northeastern coast along the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Crag\"&gt;Whispering Crag&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s have set themselves up in the &lt;a href=\"Tortaka%20Refuge\"&gt;Tortaka Refuge&lt;/a&gt;. They are plagued by &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; to the east, dwindling supplies, and very large &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s. If you're the least bit arachnophobic, Vol'dun won't be high on your list of vacation spots.\nIf you visit the &lt;a href=\"Slithering%20Gulch\"&gt;Slithering Gulch&lt;/a&gt; to the south, you may discover some of Nazmir's tortollan pilgrims. Their journey incomplete, they now stand before the sethrak up for auction to the highest bidders.\nWhere Even Snakes Fear to Tread.\nTo the north, the &lt;a href=\"Skycallers%27%20Spire\"&gt;Skycallers' Spire&lt;/a&gt; dominates the landscape. A large hooded snake looms above, crackling with lightning. It is here that you'll find the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Sethraliss\"&gt;Temple of Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; and uncover the darkness within.\nThere is plenty to explore throughout Vol'dun, and what first seems like a wasteland comes to life with deadly vibrancy once you scratch the harsh exterior. The sand-bleached bones of giant &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s litter the land, long since picked clean and polished to a gleaming smooth by the shifting sands. Brief moments of reprieve from the heat can be found to the north in the small stretch of marsh and in the caverns and oasis tucked away from the unrelenting &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemember, water can make a difference between life and death, for you and for others who may desperately need it. You never know what a difference a drop or two can mean at the right time, in the right place.\nBeyond Vol'dun to the east are the fetid swamps of Nazmir, and to the south you'll find the sprawling ancient capital of the Zandalari, Zuldazar. Bringing the Zandalari fleet into the might of the Horde will take grit and determination. Surviving Vol'dun could take everything."}

Now, with Azeroth's world-soul revitalized, the awesome primal might of the Shores stirs anew, rousing the dragons' ancient allies and age-old enemies from their long millennia of slumber.\nHeroes of the Alliance and Horde are invited by Alexstrasza to aid the red dragonflight in this vibrant and menacing land. \nThis land is stirring with the reawakening of elemental energies. Long ago, the elements were present in their most primal, unfettered form; however, the resurgence of magic in the Dragon Isles has caused that energy to reawaken.\nGeysers and hot springs are commonplace, and powerful streams and rivers carve grottoes into the colorful rocks and sediment. Waterways feed into the land's heart and the Life Pools of the red dragonflight.\nWhile millennia ago this area was populated with dragon architecture like the rest of the Broodlands, most of those structures have long since fallen into decay and become overgrown.\nVolcanic areas are alive with molten earth and fire. As the elevation rises, the land becomes harsher. In these imposing mountains, Neltharus, the Obsidian Citadel was built by the black dragonflight so that the Earth-Warder could defend the Broodlands. Abandoned long ago, the imposing fortress has now been claimed by the djaradin.\n&lt;hr&gt;\nInhabitants of the Waking Shores.\nElemental magic manifests everywhere, with earth, air, water, and fire taking physical form. New types of elemental beings are rising, as well as animalistic creatures infused with this magic. Here are some that you will happen upon in your travels:\n&lt;hr&gt;\n&lt;hr&gt;\nThe Waking Shores are just the beginning of your adventures throughout the Dragon Isles. Help your allies push back against enemies, new and old, who are bent on controlling this ancient place of elemental power.\nWe look forward to sharing more details as development continues on Dragonflight.

Join us on a brief tour through the oldest city in the world and the majestic land that surrounds it, and get a glimpse of the flora and fauna that dwell in this ancient domain.\nHigh above the jungle canopies, the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Throne\"&gt;Golden Throne&lt;/a&gt; serves as Zuldazar's city center, with some of the most breathtaking views in the region. It is from here that &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, king of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, rules. A vast, ancient cityscape of interconnected terraces sprawls out below, dotted with temples devoted to the loa, which are maintained by their loyal servants.\nWelcome to Zuldazar. \nThings aren't as they should be in the great empire. The land is charged with dark secrets, and rumors of a rebellion swirl. As a representative of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, you'll need to earn the trust of King Rastakhan and the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt; to gain access to Zuldazar's resources and superior naval force. The Horde's war efforts depend on it.\nVisitors can find anything they need for an extended stay in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the city. Facilities include an inn, portals to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"profession%20trainer\"&gt;profession trainer&lt;/a&gt;s, a &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Training%20dummy\"&gt;training dummies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, and more. It's easy to get lost this ancient, multileveled city\u2014but that only emphasizes its vastness and grandeur.\n\"Things to Try: Take a ride on a &lt;a href=\"Caravan%20Brutosaur\"&gt;Caravan Brutosaur&lt;/a&gt;! Trained to haul goods throughout Zuldazar, &lt;a href=\"Brutosaur\"&gt;Brutosaur&lt;/a&gt;s offer a slow but steady ride around the city's terraces.\"\nIn the southern part of city at its lowest point, you'll find the expansive &lt;a href=\"Port%20of%20Zandalar\"&gt;Port of Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. It is here that the Zandalari berth their mighty fleet and traders from around Azeroth sell their wares and services.\nFor those of sufficient might (level 115) and have completed an introductory quest, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Rez%27okun\"&gt;Captain Rez'okun&lt;/a&gt; will facilitate access to &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expeditions\"&gt;Island Expeditions&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Expedition%20Map\"&gt;Expedition Map&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Savage Surroundings.\nZandalar's rich tapestry of flora and fauna deserve research and cataloguing. The Zandalari have shown themselves to be able &lt;a href=\"Beastmaster\"&gt;beast master&lt;/a&gt;s, having domesticated many of the creatures that roam the land. Some of these serve as helpful allies to the Zandalari; others prove obstacles to those who would seek to exploit the jungle's resources.\nTamed &lt;a href=\"Ravasaur\"&gt;Ravasaur&lt;/a&gt;s, Brutosaurs, &lt;a href=\"Pterrordax\"&gt;Pterrodax&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Direhorn\"&gt;Direhorn&lt;/a&gt;s make up just a portion of their menagerie. There are countless other wild beasts that make their homes in surrounding jungles, from &lt;a href=\"Muddy%20Riverbeast\"&gt;Muddy Riverbeast&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Roaming%20Nibbler\"&gt;Roaming Nibbler&lt;/a&gt;s.\nTortollan Knowledge Is Power.\nBoth inside the city and beyond its borders, you'll encounter a new race: the &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;. These ancient seekers are constantly in pursuit of knowledge and the acquisition of rare artifacts. They're always in need of brave souls to help them acquire what they seek. Aiding them can be risky, but ultimately it will be worth your while to have these erudite people on your side.\nWhere Kings Lie.\nIf you follow the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Road\"&gt;Golden Road&lt;/a&gt; from the city and up into the mountains to the west, you'll eventually reach &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;. These ancient pyramids have served as the resting place for Zandalari kings for millennia. With each passing ruler, new rooms are constructed to house the deceased's vast wealth.\nKing's Rest.\nA vast coastline surrounds Zuldazar to the south, east, and west, offering bountiful opportunities for fishing, boating, swimming, and treasure hunting. To the north, the marshland of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; awaits exploration, offering plenty of opportunities to earn your way into the good graces of the Zandalari."}

The shows were about 80% talk and 20% music, with most of the music being split between preshows and royalty-free music played when there were no shows or archives playing on the stream. The stream utilized Shoutcast, a popular internet radio streaming platform.\nOn July 24th, 2019, Athalus announced on the 'Countdown to Classic' podcast that Warcraft Radio would be relaunching on August 18th, 2019 with many of the original show hosts and team members. Currently, Warcraft Radio is utilizing Twitch to broadcast shows.\nHistory.\nWoW Radio's exhibitions were acknowledged and publicized by Blizzard, often featured on the original, official WorldofWarcraft.com Website more than ten times between 2004 - 2006. WoW Radio was invited to attend BlizzCon 2005 and broadcast the only live video feed covering everything on the show floor. In future years, WoW Radio broadcasted the only endorsed live audio feed from the show floor in 2007, 2008, 2009.\nThe station began as one show, Saturday Nights with Athalus, on October 11th, 2004. Athalus recognized that World of Warcraft would be a significant cultural event and had previously produced Shoutcast programming for another game. In May 2004, Athalus began participating in the original Closed Beta. After several months of becoming familiar with the game, Athalus began WoW Radio's first official stream.\nThe first two years led to the creation of many successful shows including Slanik's Vendor Trash, Totalbiscuit's Blue Plz, KikiJiki and Totalbiscuit's EPIC, Emperor's The Emperor's Court, Leto's Ancient of Lore and many others. WoW Radio was an early pioneer of the concept of streaming live commentary while playing video games, a format which has evolved in the following years to include video through platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. WoW Radio was also an earlier pioneer of live recording of podcasts.\nIn May 2005, a successful meeting between Athalus and Blizzard's representation at the San Diego Comic-Con resulted in an invitation to host live video coverage from the floor of the first Blizzcon. Many interviews were held at Blizzcon, including with Grubby, Richard Knaak, Frank Pearce, and Tristan Pope. While successful, the coverage was not without issues. Millions of hits were made against the WoW Radio website, but only a limited number of concurrent viewers could be supported on early internet video streams. These limitations led Blizzard to bring on DirecTV for future video programming at Blizzcon events with their Virtual Ticket.\nAfter several months of hosting shows after Blizzcon 2005, Athalus decided to begin a career in Game Development and left the station on March 18th, 2006 after his final goodbye show. Athalus went on to work as a Game Designer on MMORPGs at Sony Online Entertainment. At that time, Athalus transferred ownership of the station to TotalBiscuit.\nWith the appointment of Totalbiscuit as Station Owner, Totalbiscuit promoted Slanik to fill the role of station manager. The station began a phase of rapid growth, expanding their show line up to the largest it had been in the past. During this period shows like \"The Happy Hour Tavern\", \"Octale and Hordak vs The World\", \"The Weekend Report\", \"The WoW Insider Show\", \"TurpsterTime\", \"Playtime with Moiren\", \"Shadow council\" and \"Endgame\" to name just a few, were created and aired on a weekly basis.\nAs the station expanded they were producing up to 10 different discussion shows each week as well as community-created content, such as the WoW Idol contest which involved community members producing original or parody songs based on World of Warcraft. During this period the station also experimented with hosting shows based on other popular MMORPGs, hosting \"At the Side of the Prancing Pony\" a show based on the MMO Lord of the Rings Online.\nDuring this period the station managed to secure interviews with many prominent WoW Community members, creators, and Game Developers including Nihilum, Richard A. Knaak, Rufus Cubed (Terran Gregory &amp; Ezra Ferguson), Death and Taxes, Method, Kungen, Oxhorn, and Mike Morheim\nOn January 3rd, 2010 the station announced that they would be broadcasting their final shows in the following month. Individual hosts would move on to their own websites, or in groups. Totalbiscuit had since created his own website called &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.cynicalbrit.com/\"&gt;The Cynical Brit&lt;/a&gt;. \"The Donut Shop\", \"MaxSpeed\", \"Essence of RP\", \"But Wait! There\u2019s Lore!\" and more was moved to \"&lt;a href=\"http%3A//omfg.fm/\"&gt;Original Media for Gamers&lt;/a&gt;\", or \"OMFG\". Finally \"Octale and Hordak\", along with \"Casually Hardcore\", have created &lt;a href=\"Versus%20the%20World%20Productions\"&gt;Versus the World Productions&lt;/a&gt;, or VtW Productions. Duncor, Speedy40, and Railvas moved to a site they co-founded, Just Cool Enough. Which is now partnered with Alpha Geek Radio, founded by members of WoWRadio's Casual Hardcore.\nOn January 31, 2010, WoW Radio ended its 5-year live broadcasting with a send-off by TotalBiscuit and Athalus, the two owners during the stations run. The host of the shows had split into three new networks.\nInterviews.\nWoW Radio has conducted a large number of interviews with various persons and organizations of note within the WoW community. The following is a selection.\nWoW Radio 24/7.\nWoW Radio announced that it would be going '24/7' at the start of 2007. In preparation for the project, the station upgraded its streaming facilities significantly, upgrading its quality to 128kb/s Stereo, at 44khz bitrate, whereas previously it broadcasted in 56kb/s 44khz Mono format. WoW Radio's 24/7 project was known to involve scheduled reruns of archived shows, organized into blocks. It was also known that it intends to include several DJ sets and included a large selection of royalty-free music from such sources as OCRemix.\nAs of November 2007, the system went into public beta.\nThis system was successfully launched on December 1st, 2007, coupled with a major fix to the website to cope with excessive traffic. As a direct result of this service and the fixes to the site, daily traffic has increased by approximately 90%.\nAs of December 1st, 2007, WoW Radio's servers could handle 10,000 simultaneous live listeners.\nIssues of negativity and past controversy.\nIt has been highlighted on a number of occasions that WoW Radio could be highly negative and critical regarding the World of Warcraft computer game. This in itself was not necessarily a flaw and helped the station to achieve an independent style in their content, coming across more as fans of the game, rather than a corporate message medium. It had been known however for certain shows (in particular \"Blue Plz\" and \"Epic\", both hosted by TotalBiscuit, with \"Epic\" now having been retired) to have a particularly negative tone in places, both about general gameplay and Blizzard in particular. It should be noted that many value this particular point of view since there are few fansites willing to openly criticize Blizzard and its policies out of fear of alienating them. WoW Radio had long survived without the aid of Blizzard entertainment and it can only be presumed, therefore, has no such qualms. Some would argue that because of this independent stance, WoW Radio was one of the most valuable sources for WoW-related media and information online.\nWoW Radio has had altercations with Blizzard entertainment in the past, not least after an expos\u00e9 of their treatment at BlizzCon in 2005. Hosts pointed out specifically the number of roadblocks that had been thrown in the way of their efforts to broadcast the event, despite being invited to do so, and the uneven treatment that they had received in comparison to other organizations attending the event.\nProject Golddigger and Chronicles of the Goldfarmer.\nLater on, WoW Radio came under fire from Blizzard EU for the efforts of \"Project Golddigger\" and the \"Chronicles of the Goldfarmer\" movies in which TotalBiscuit was banned from the European forums and retaliated with a viral signature campaign to promote the movies, which spread like wildfire throughout the EU forum community. A large number of WoW Radio fans and staff were banned during this incident. There are varying opinions on the incident: it could be argued that the bans were justified as players were acting in defiance of the community manager's authority. Others point to the opinion that most of these players did not in fact breach the Codes of Conduct of Blizzard Europe's forum community, some going as far as to say that TotalBiscuit himself did not fall afoul of these regulations and that the ban was nothing more than an effort to silence a voice of dissent within the community who was rapidly gaining a following.\nWhat is clear however is that WoW Radio benefited significantly from the publicity of this event, some going as far as to call it a carefully orchestrated publicity stunt by station owner TotalBiscuit. As a result, however, WoW Radio can no longer promote on the European forums, with those attempting to do so receiving bans without prior warning or justification. While it is clear that no-one is in possession of the full facts surrounding this debacle, some suggest that there is far more to this incident than meets the eye and go as far as to suggest that someone within Blizzard Europe is holding a grudge.\nThis problem was only made worse when the EU Forums were spammed with multiple topics per forum advertising the site, against the wishes of WoW Radio themselves who were running a controlled, voluntary realm forum promotional campaign. Whatever Blizzard EU's issues with WoW Radio, no doubt compounded by the person who spammed the forums, resulted in many more 7 day suspensions.\nResolution of the conflict with Blizzard EU.\nAs of fall 2007, station owner TotalBiscuit announced that after talking to community managers from Blizzard Europe, the past issues had been reconciled and WoW Radio had since been supported on the EU forums and community watch segment of the website.\nRelaunch of Warcraft Radio.\nOn July 24th, 2019, Athalus announced on the 'Countdown to Classic' podcast that Warcraft Radio would be relaunching on August 18th, 2019 with many of the original show hosts and team members. As of 15th August, five shows have been confirmed so far;"}

Archives of their 5 years of podcasts is available at https://warcraftradio.com/classics/\nCurrent Shows.\nWarcraft Radio has begun again. Currently the following shows are on the relaunched Warcraft Radio:\nPast Shows.\nThe WoW Insider Show with Various.\nThe WoW Insider show was an unprecedented collaborative effort between popular WoW fansite and blog WoW Insider, part of the Joystiq network, and WoW Radio, to produce a weekly show and podcast based on WoW Insider's popular content for the week. The show featured 3-4 hosts per week, chosen from WoW Insider and WoW Radio staff, who took on a wide range of topics in a quick-fire debate format. The WoW Insider show ceased to air on WoW Radio for reasons unclear.\nWorld of Theorycraft with Alris and friends.\nWorld of Theorycraft brings you an in-depth look at what's under the hood of World of Warcraft and how to best make use of it to excel at your chosen class. Join Alris every week as he brings in guest experts to crunch the numbers and show you the math to success. World of Theorycraft went off the air due to the poor state of European Wrath beta, and may make a return at some point in the future.\nVendor Trash with Slanik.\nThis show holds the honor of being one of the longest running shows ever on WoW Radio. Starting a week after Blue Plz first aired in early 2005, Slanik dealt with light-hearted and irreverent content. He described the show as 'the guy who ends up with the vendor trash, after the other shows take all the epics'. Slanik held the position of station manager, and acted as WoW Radio's second in command.\nThe DungeonMaster - TotalBiscuit.\nThe DungeonMaster intended to be a complete audio raid-guide, covering every raid instance in The Burning Crusade. Hosted by an experienced raid-leader, each episodes covers a different instance with tips, tricks, and full strategy/walkthroughs for every boss in the The Burning Crusade. The show was a success, with the series ending with the Mount Hyjal episode, since TotalBiscuit had not completed Black Temple at the time, and was soon to stop raiding with his main entirely. There are currently no plans to release Black Temple and Sunwell episodes.\nL2P - Dustin &amp; theerik.\nLearn2Play (L2P) is hosted by Dustin and theerik, it takes you through the newbie areas. Teaching you about the mobs, the quests and professions. Telling you the most effective and fastest way to level your character. Ended due to theerik not being able to do the show for some time.\nMade of Win - Turpster &amp; Keylime.\nIs a show that covered different kind of subjects every week from WoW.\nTurpster Time - Turpster.\nA short-lived solo show, superseded by and merged with Made of Win after adding Keylime as co-host for show.\nThe Weekend Report - Turpster &amp; Leto.\nThe Weekend Report began as the show Leto took on after leaving Ancient of Lore (which is now The Lorekeepers). The show was a bit of commentary on what happened in the World of Warcraft community and, Leto's own local news. Turpster then joined the show, adding his personality and parodied songs to The Weekend Report fold. The show ended when Leto left the station.\nTitan - TotalBiscuit and Eriyanna.\nTitan was a change of direction for Totalbiscuit, bringing in female co-host (whom he then married) Eriyanna for a show with a unique 'battle of the sexes' theme. It featured, for the first time, an in-game challenge every week where the hosts squared off to show who was the 'proper dps class.' Titan produced 5 episodes before going off the air, with both hosts not entirely happy with the format or production values. Despite it's short run, Titan remains one of the most successful shows that WoW Radio has ever produced, and the only one to contain a marriage proposal live on air. Top that.\nThe X - Menuet.\nThe X, a show about general gaming, \"geek\" topics, console games and listener interaction used to air Saturdays on WoW Radio.\nEPIC - TotalBiscuit and KikiJiki.\n[EPIC] was the natural evolution of Blue Plz!. Totalbiscuit returned with a cohost, revamped features and greater focus. With Ask the Murloc turning into a long-running improvised radio-play, Nubcake News gaining scope and higher production values and the addition of World of Theorycraft (not to be confused with the show, hosted by Alris) which ranged from the sublime to the ridiculous, the show enjoyed wider listenership than Blue Plz! [EPIC] went off the air when Kikijiki resigned from the show-team due to real-life commitments.\nThe show spearheaded the 'Project Golddigger' initiative, aimed at raising awareness of goldfarming within the game and methods of which to disrupt it. It goes down in history as one of WoW Radio's most successful shows. TotalBiscuit now hosts Blue Plz! and TB's Show about Videogames.\nViolent Noise/Playtime - Moiren.\nViolent Noise, named after the WoW Radio guild Violent Noise, was a role-playing show hosted by Moiren in the Wednesday US time-slot. Every-week Moiren would name a topic like the family heritage of your character, and ask listeners to write into Moiren and tell her, after which she would read your reply on air. It helped to give your character more depth, and more ideas about how to develop him/her. Later she re-named the show Playtime and it moved to the EU Wednesday's time slot. Shortly after the time slot move, Violent Noise took a short hiatus due to Moiren's family commitments. After the Hiatus, Moiren left the station to pursue other projects.\nAncient of Lore - Leto.\nAncient of Lore was the first WoW radio show geared towards the Lore of Warcraft. He started out hosting the show by himself. Two features came and passed. The short lived 'Old Uncle Mac' and 'Ancient of Trash' with Vendor Trash host Slanik, which, after introduced, carried on for most of the duration of Ancient of Lore. Later on, two other hosts came onto the scene, Strixus and Kae. Towards the later part of the life of Ancient of Lore, Blizzard announced the new alliance race for the expansion to be Draenei. Leto was against the whole concept lore-wise and lost respect for blizzard and felt because of this he could not continue his show. He gave it to Strixus and Kae, and became known as the Lorekeepers. Leto went onto host the Weekend report with Turpster, before leaving the station in July 2007.\nThe Lorekeepers - Strixus, Kae and Burster.\nThe Lorekeepers continued where the Ancient of Lore left off, featuring detailed lore discussion interspersed with comedic and light-hearted features. It eventually came to regularly be hosted not only by Kae and Strixus, but with regular guest stars Nobunaga and Burster the Gnome. One regular feature was the Lorebusters, where gnomes in the Lorekeeper's R&amp;D department tested lore myths. Another was From Draenor with Love, a short lived but well received radio drama. The show ended in late 2007 after Strixus stopped playing WoW and could no longer devote the time to producing the show every week.\nStrixus is back in WoW and Co-Hosts Council of Six on OMFG.FM along with Kae, Leto, Shinoda, Nobunaga and AlmightyFarseer\nShadow Council - Duncor.\nShadow Council was a panel discussion show where the host Duncor and 2-3 guests would discuss the many of the aspects of the game and issues the community were talking about. Shadow Council was a based on WoW Radio\u2019s short lived show The Round Table which only had two episodes. Shadow Council\u2019s only features were \u201cDuncor\u2019s Opinion\u201d and a weekly two minute radio play called \u201cWidget\u2019s Lab\u201d. The show had 20 episodes before Duncor toke it off air saying that he was running out of steam and didn\u2019t want the show to suffer. Duncor had said he would bring the show back in some form but there has been no news of his next show as of yet.\nUser Interface - Alris and Menuet.\nUser Interface began in September 2006 with Speedyf40 and Menuet. In January 2007, Speedyf40 went on to host Maxspeed with Maxmaps and, Alris took over as host of User Interface. He remained with the show until it ended in March 2007. Alris went on to host World of Theorycraft and Menuet went on to host TheX. The show was described as \"Join Alris and Menuet as they explore the World of Warcraft with...you. User Interface is the show for the community at large. Our topics change week to week so your voice and opinion can be heard. Add to that some weekly segments that are totally interactive and you have the User Interface for the community.\"\nShort Stuff.\nShort Stuff was an initiative meant to create a podcastable knowledge base within WoW Radio, with short-run shows of limited length and number, on very specific topics such as classes and trade-skills. Such is the way of 'Short Stuff', shows often run for 3-4 episodes before going off the air. These shows can be downloaded through the archives after they have been aired, for easy reference by players. Short Stuff is currently on hold.\nKnow Your Role with Medros.\nOriginally known as Midweek review, this show was the second show on WoW Radio, with its host being the staff member #2 after Athalus, the original owner of the station. Medros left the station over disagreements with station management, and moved to MMO Radio, until it's eventual decline in early 2007. \nSaturday Night's with Athalus.\nThe original WoW Radio show which kicked off back in closed-beta in 2004, athalus was the station-founder, previously of Utopia Radio. His one-man show, was a huge success. The show went off the air as athalus's priorities changed and he eventually went to work for Blizzard as a GM.\nThe Round Table with Illusion and others.\nInitially conceived as a debate show for WoW Radio this show aired several times before going off the air and contained a quiz segment. This show is thought to have given birth to Shadow Council later on and set the stage for future debate events. \nThe Emperor's Court with Emperor1g.\nOne of WoW Radio's 'First generation' shows in the pre-Blue Plz era, The Emperor's Court was Emperor's R-rated look at the World of Warcraft. An extremely popular show, Emperor left the station during a crisis period and went on to produce other, popular podcasts. Reconciliation was made later on and Emperor returned in 2007 for a PvP-themed show, but only aired a single episode before deciding to pursue other projects until his recent return to podcast and shoutcasting.\nEndgame with Tyrrum.\nA raiding-centric show pre-Burning Crusade that is thought to have spawned the strategy-centric and short-lived 'Dungeonmaster' podcasts. Contained discussion of raiding and strategy as well as some walk-through elements. The show evolved into Farm-Status later on after Tyrrum had left the station and Cadwallion and Keylime had taken his place. \nFarm Status with Cadwallion, Keylime, Duncor and Nobunaga.\nAn evolution on the concept of Endgame, Farm Status covered Endgame and included a 'Naxx-watch' which tracked the progress in the bleeding-edge instance 'Naxxramus' from week-to-week with frequent updates on the big players in raiding. Known to have later become part of the groundwork for current show 'WoW Things Considered' \nStunlocked with ninety-nine.\nA short-lived show which began to air at the same time as Blue Plz! Ninety-nine went on to form a one-man network known as 'Stem Radio', which was a short-lived project in which he hosted Stunlocked. \nWarcraft Anonymous hosted by Hiko and Railvas.\nThe first step to getting help, is admitting you have a problem. However, we all know you don't have a problem! You can stop playing WoW any time you want, you just don't want to. Tune in to hear Hiko and Railvas talk about topics on every WoW addicts mind. The show relies greatly on listener input and interaction. So tune in, turn up, and zone out with Hiko and Railvas on WCradio.com's Warcraft Anonymous.\nThe Essence of RP with Almightyfarseer and Kexman.\nAlmighty Farseer and Kexman are your guides through the complex world of role-playing covering all aspects of RP and the roleplaying community. Also, they have a great love of drop ins and has more interaction with their listeners then any other show On WCradio. They have collected a core of listeners that are nick named Essence of the Essence of RP. The 6 listeners given them more content then any other people, they are TaurenTom, Mr. NNJ, Snapplemonkey, Seeth, Shinoda, and their IRC rep, Davlen.\nThe Happy Hour Tavern with Mickey-C, Dustin and theerik.\nThe Donut Boys return for another season of The Happy Hour Tavern, a place where everyone is welcome and drunken antics are never too far away. The Happy Hour Tavern is a rude, crude, thoroughly immature look at the World of Warcraft community, which is absolutely appropriate, considering the community prides itself on just those qualities. Featuring the popular radio-play \"The Chalice of Silvermoon\", alongside Quizboar and a whole lot of listener interaction.\nDowntime Downunder hosted by Various.\nDowntime got you down? Fear not, help is on the way as the WoW Radio team put on a marathon session of musical entertainment. Get interactive as the community gathers to request songs and socialize while the game servers are down for maintenance. This show is currently hosted by Madal, but airs irregularly due to the policy of rolling restarts.\nPUG.\nPUG is a light-hearted panel discussion show hosted by Thunderer, who plays the role of 'moderator', in the loosest possible sense of the word. Covering a variety of WoW topics, PUG is co-hosted by various special guest hosts, including podcasters, machinimators and prominent personalitie s within the WoW community. This show was launched after the departure of the WoW Insider Show, and airs in the same time-slot. In a first for WoW podcasting, PUG features a quiz-show by the name of Master-looter, in which the hosts compete for DKP, with Thunderer playing the role of quiz-master.\nPast Shows v2.\nHappy Hour Tavern, hosted by Kyle, Dustin and TheErik"}

This site was created by World of Warcraft players who loved the game and wanted to bring you the news, strategies, tips, advice and discussions that you were looking for.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowphiles.com/category/podcast\"&gt;The WoWphiles Podcast&lt;/a&gt; was also a World of Warcraft Podcast. \nOrigin.\nThe term WoWphile originated in 2009 when the website &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowphiles.com\"&gt;WoWphiles.com&lt;/a&gt; was launched. The goal was to define the group of people who loved the Warcraft universe without sounding negative by using terms such as \"addict\".\nAfter examining words in other niches such as Audiophile and Videophile, it seemed a perfect match to call the players who loved World of Warcraft: WoWphiles.\nWoWphiles Podcast History.\nThe WoWphiles Podcast debuted on November 25, 2009. The show was instantly met with high praise from listeners and began to rapidly build a dedicated fan base.\nJason and Modem would continue to be the primary hosts, but the show would add some new friends along the way.\nIcesnake offered to contribute an addon segment to the show called \"Icesnake's Addon Emporium\". Icesnake's segment would become a recurring segment on each episode of the podcast. The show would also add a lore contributor named Evinrue who would bring her vast knowledge and love of Warcraft lore to the show in a segment called \"Loreducation with Evinrue\".\n\"Little known fact: Evinrue was slated to be the original co-host before Modem. Before the show's first episode was recorded, Evinrue announced that she would not be able to record the show due to her conflicting schedule. Jason began to search for a new co-host and it was then that he asked his guildmate Modem if he would be interested in co-hosting.\"\nThe show would continue to add new segments, new guests and grow it's fan base as the game evolved and Cataclysm was released.\nAfter several months into Cataclysm however, the hosts saw their in-game guild dwindle as friends left the game and quit raiding. Jason in particular began to have less and less fun playing World of Warcraft and was only logging in during raids. As in-game frustrations continued and real life began to become more and more hectic the show suddenly stopped.\nOn March 21, 2011 the WoWphiles Podcast released their last show Episode #61. At the time neither Jason nor Modem knew that this would be their last show. They spoke every week and had intended to continue recording.\nJason however, kept delaying the recording of the podcast due to his frustrations with the game and his guild, coupled with the fact he had real life struggles when he lost his job due to his company making \"economic cutbacks\".\nThe podcast was delayed for weeks, which would turn into months. Then a year had gone by without the WoWphiles Podcast. There was no formal announcement because there was never a conscious decision made to end the show.\nOver the course of the year, Jason and Modem continued to talk about podcasting. They even developed concepts for two new podcasts they considered recording. Neither of those podcasts have yet to be developed.\nFans were noticeably angry and sad that their favorite podcast had disappeared.\nThe Return of the WoWphiles Podcast.\nIn July 2012 Jason and Modem began to once again discuss the possibility of podcasting. The two hosts had remained friends and talked online frequently over the course of the year they were off the air.\nWith the announcement of the Mists of Pandaria launch date, Jason began to think about playing World of Warcraft again. He missed playing the game and missed his friends who were still around. The thoughts of playing WoW again led Jason to also consider podcasting again.\nFor the first time in a year, Jason read the emails and listened to the voicemails from fans of the show. These messages had been sitting in his inbox unopened for a year while he completely avoided the situation.\nJason began to talk seriously about podcasting again and very soon the decision was made for the WoWphiles podcast to make a return.\nThe date of the first comeback recording was set for August 27, 2012, the day before the release of World of Warcraft patch 5.0.4. The last podcast was Episode #86 on Apr 1, 2013.\nEnd of an Era.\nOn February 4, 2014, Jason announced that Wowphiles was officially ending. He cited changed life circumstances, as well as no longer feeling the way he once had about WoW. Modem also agreed for the same reasons.\nCurrent Team.\nJason Zimmerman - Founder/Blogger/Host.\nJason is the founder of WoWphiles.com, primary blogger and co-host of the WoWphiles podcast. He loves all things WoW and especially talking and writing about his favorite video game.\nJacob aka \u201cModem\u201d - Podcast Co-Host.\nModem is a contributing author to the WoWphiles blog and the cohost of the WoWphiles podcast. He is a raid leader, altaholic, and a true WoWphile.\nPast Team Members.\nEvinrue - Podcast Contributer.\nEvinrue is the voice for the Alliance on the WoWphiles podcast and our resident lore junkie. You can catch Evinrue\u2019s segment \u201cLoreducation With Evinrue\u201d on each episode of the WoWphiles Podcast.\nIcesnake Frostfyre - Podcast Contributer, Blog Author.\nIcesnake can be heard on each episode of the WoWphiles Podcast during his segment Icesnake\u2019s Addon Emporium.

These cunning and ferocious creatures have found an especially welcome home among the orcs, who admire their endurance and keen survival instincts.\nThey live in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; gave rise to its own separate species of wolves that developed independently on that world. Many survived Draenor's destruction and transformation into Outland and can be found in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolves are &lt;a href=\"skinnable\"&gt;skinnable&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20the%20Dire%20Wolf\"&gt;dire wolf&lt;/a&gt; was once thought to be extinct except in the far north. It is highly sought by those preparing for winter. Similarly, another species of dire wolf found on , the &lt;a href=\"Smoky%20Direwolf\"&gt;Smoky Direwolf&lt;/a&gt;, is believed to reside mostly in the north and hates weddings.\nWolves and the Horde.\nThe wolves of the Horde are befriended, not domesticated, and are a major symbol of the Horde, especially to the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Long ago, the orcs tamed the large and swift wolves of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. These massive canines came to be the orcs\u2019 chosen companions as well as their favored method of transportation. The wolves\u2019 unflinching temperament made them especially well-suited for battling large prey. When the orcs became more warlike and invaded Azeroth, their wolves were bred for size and stamina so they could bear armored riders into battle. Dire wolves remain the favored mounts for orc fighters and can be purchased in the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. They serve as guards, scouts, pets, and partners. The large cousins of the wolf, the &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt;s, are used as the orc &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrcs and other Horde &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s hold them in high regard. They can speak to them and summon spectral wolves, and some serve a giant wolf spirit. According to , this \"Lo'Gosh\" is simply another name for the great white wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; call \"&lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;\". The attire of orc shaman often feature wolves, especially headgear in the form of wolf heads.\nThe &lt;a href=\"frost%20wolf\"&gt;frost wolves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; followed the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; from Draenor. Two giant wolves, &lt;a href=\"Duros\"&gt;Duros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Drakan\"&gt;Drakan&lt;/a&gt;, guard their chieftain.\nFor a brief time, many orcs would declare themselves \"hungry like an &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Wolf\"&gt;Orgrimmar wolf&lt;/a&gt;.\" Some &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; still use the phrase ironically. &lt;a href=\"Black%20War%20Wolf\"&gt;Black War Wolves&lt;/a&gt; are prized by Orgrimmar guards for their keen sense of smell.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Hellscream's&lt;/a&gt; command, Horde trainers began raising wolves to thrive in the shock and ferocity of sustained combat. The &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; use only the mightiest wolves for their mounts, bedecking them in armor that would break the backs of lesser creatures.\nKnown species.\nCorrupted types:\nAs a mount.\nWolves are sold by &lt;a href=\"Ogunaro%20Wolfrunner\"&gt;Ogunaro Wolfrunner&lt;/a&gt; located in Orgrimmar. &lt;a href=\"Freka%20Bloodaxe\"&gt;Freka Bloodaxe&lt;/a&gt; the Orgrimmar Quartermaster in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; also sells two unique wolves.\nSeveral new wolf mounts were also introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\".\nIn Warcraft III.\n&lt;a href=\"Creep\"&gt;Creep&lt;/a&gt; units:\nTwo wolves are summoned by &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Far Seer&lt;/a&gt;'s Feral Spirit spell, different wolves are summoned depending on the level of the spell:\n&lt;a href=\"Raider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Raiders&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Far%20Seer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Far Seers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; ride wolf mounts."}

It was created by &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; - the first worgen - in order to spread the worgen curse and search for the legendary &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Their goal, to use it to free the remaining worgen trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, and seek revenge on &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing he could not find the scythe by himself, Alpha Prime began his cult by recruiting Archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; and used him to spread the worgen curse to the humans of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The cult also had a presence in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, searching for the Scythe of Elune there after the death of its previous wielder, &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt;. In Gilneas, they were based in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt;, while the Duskwood branch based out of the now-abandoned &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Manor Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWar of the Satyr.\nThe origins of the Wolf Cult begin nine thousand three hundred years ago, as the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt; took its toll on the already crippled &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; people. Beginning to lose the war, some druids drew on the power of &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, harnessing the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;. Although a powerful weapon, it was difficult to control, and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; banned the form from use. Furious, some &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; rebelled and abandoned the front lines, determined to harness the wolf form. &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; - one of Malfurion's star pupils - followed soon after, after his friend Arvel died because of Malfurion's decree.\nRalaar too loved the raw fury and primal energy - or \"essence\" - of the pack form, but realized his &lt;a href=\"Shan%27do\"&gt;Shan'do&lt;/a&gt; was right. The Pack Form draws on the raw fury of Goldrinn, proving far too powerful to control. Led by Ralaar as their newfound \"alpha\", the Druids of the Pack brought the Fang of Goldrinn to &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt;, a Priestess who held the Staff of Elune. The Priestess called on the &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;moon goddess&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt; forged the two relics into one, creating the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The Scythe changed the kaldorei druids into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;; savage wolf-men able to communicate as elves, but fight with the fury - the essence - of the wolf god. Armed with this new form, Ralaar took the name Alpha Prime, recruited more kaldorei, and brought the fight to the satyr. They were successful, destroying a satyr stronghold that would have taken the kaldorei days. But once Malfurion called his former pupil a monstrosity, Alpha Prime led the worgen to attack the kaldorei as well, seeking revenge for the death of &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt;. Those bitten became worgen themselves in mere moments. Wrought with guilt, Belysra Starbreeze gave the Scythe of Elune to Malfurion, who soon after founded the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; to combat the worgen.\nMalfurion tricked Alpha Prime and the worgen and used the Scythe to banish them to the Emerald Dream. There, Malfurion believed that his former pupils would enter a peaceful eternal slumber beneath the enchanted tree known as Daral'nir, but would turn out to be eternal torment for creatures meant to run and hunt. With the worgen out of the way, and the satyr crippled, the kaldorei won the War of the Satyr. The coveted Scythe of Elune was given to the sentinel &lt;a href=\"Mel%27Thandris%20Starsong\"&gt;Mel'thandris&lt;/a&gt;, was &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;buried with her&lt;/a&gt; upon her death, and forgotten.\nThird War.\nAs the Scourge descended upon the Greymane Wall, Genn Greymane sought a means of defense. He ordered Archmage Arugal to summon the worgen; wolf men of human legend, believed at the time to be creatures of a shadow realm. In doing so, Alpha Prime and a number of his \"brothers\" were freed. They killed all undead in sight, before turning on the Gilneans as well. The Gilneans dragged their bitten comrades inside and closed the gates forever. Locked outside of the wall, Alpha Prime and his pack took Shadowfang Keep as their own.\nSoon after, while Genn and his men hunted the bitten inside Gilneas, Arugal sought out the worgen outside and pledged his loyalty to Alpha Prime. Together, the worgen and mage began spreading the curse to the humans of Silverpine forest.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTwenty five years after the Dark Portal, Arugal was left to run Shadowfang Keep on his own, while Alpha Prime and the Bloodfang used tunnels under the Greymane Wall, and began recruiting criminals within Gilneas.\nDecapitated by the Forsaken and buried in an unmarked grave, and the worgen under his protection turned to live on the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, Alpha Prime and his Bloodfang Pack had entered Gilneas using tunnels under the Greymane wall, and had been growing in number inside the nation for years. It is discovered that humans can become worgen, such as &lt;a href=\"Landen%20Stilwell\"&gt;Landen Stilwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Riders.\nMere days later, the Scythe was delivered to the kaldorei, and delivered to Gilneas by Valorn as quickly as possible.\nCataclysm.\nSoon, with Arugal's influence over the Silverpine worgen and using them to wreak havoc on his enemies, Alpha Prime later infiltrated Gilneas by using underground tunnels hidden underneath the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and started inducting &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s into the cult; turning them into worgen after they performed gruesome murders on innocent people, which came to be later known as the &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Slasher\"&gt;Starlight Slasher&lt;/a&gt; murders. The cult and its leader then allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, an enemy of Gilneas and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, who also had an interest in obtaining the Scythe of Elune. With Gilneas distracted by political divisions, the cult had been secretly afflicting Gilneans with the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;, bolstering the worgen population and using their numbers to build a feral worgen army that would be used to launch an attack on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;. An associate of &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;, only known identification being the surname &lt;a href=\"Cox\"&gt;Cox&lt;/a&gt;, was also a member. The devastating attack weakened the nation's defenses and paved the way for the later &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Forsaken invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the Forsaken discovered the whereabouts of the scythe, unbeknown to Alpha Prime, their machinations were foiled by &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen adventurers&lt;/a&gt; when the scythe was retaken and returned to &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt;. Believing that the Gilneans and priestess Belysra's night elves no longer wielded the scythe, Alpha Prime led the Wolf Cult to attack Belysra's forces at &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt;. To his surprise, Belysra unveiled the Scythe of Elune and tried to use the scythe to banish Alpha Prime's worgen back to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Before Belysra could complete the spell, she was shot in the arm by a Forsaken &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;. With Belysra dropping the scythe, Alpha Prime then had his Forsaken allies surround Belysra and her Gilnean allies. Alpha Prime took the scythe and was about to finish Belysra with it, but he was ripped to shreds by a &lt;a href=\"spirit%20wolf\"&gt;spirit wolf&lt;/a&gt; who turned out to be the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Arvell\"&gt;Arvell&lt;/a&gt;. With the death of their leader, the Wolf Cult scattered; leaving the Forsaken without their lupine allies and open to attack from the night elves and Gilneans.\nFollowing their leader's death, the remains of the Wolf Cult that survived were forced to disperse and went into hiding.\nLegion.\nIn Duskwoood, &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt;, who investigated the Wolf Cult in Duskwood, has returned to the area. &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt;, who had opposed the Wolf Cult in Gilneas, also arrived in Duskwood to investigate the worgen there. They brought the Scythe of Elune, which caused the Nightbane to become restless.\nCulture.\nTheology and religion.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Purity%20of%20Essence\"&gt;Purity of Essence&lt;/a&gt;\" was a book written by Alpha Prime that included pages of philosophies, rites, rituals, preachings, rantings, and more. It was written by Alpha Prime, printed by Maxwell Higgens, and comes in brown, green, and red hardback covers. Everything an aspirant needs to know is contained within.\nWhat some declare an attack, the Wolf Cult proclaims as a gift or blessing. The Wolf Cult refers to the worgen curse as the \"purity of essence\" or simply \"the purity\", worgen as \"pure ones\", and the Scythe of Elune as \"the Fang of the Father\". Alpha Prime called his followers brethren and brothers. After the bite, the first change is referred to as the awakening.\nGoldrinn and Elune were both worshipped by the Druids of the Pack, who would become the founders of the cult. The two deities are the sources behind the Scythe of Elune, and thus the worgen curse. Alpha Prime believed worgen to possess the fury and unbending will of Goldrinn as juggernauts of rage, held fast only by the magic of the moon goddess, embodied in what he saw as a pure form.\nHierarchy and leadership.\nThe Wolf Cult was led by Alpha Prime since the dawn of the worgen. However, as their numbers grew, the elder recruited those capable of leadership. This first included Archmage Arugal, the Gilnean who had released Prime and his followers from the Dream. Each resulting pack held its own leadership, with Gervase leading in Duskwood, Arugal leading the Shadowfang, and even several &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20Alpha\"&gt;worgen alphas&lt;/a&gt; among the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Worgen\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, all reporting to Alpha Prime. Alpha Prime attempted to recruit the Gilnean detective Halford Ramsey for this purpose. The Wolf Cult in Duskwood referred to Alpha Prime as The Master of All.\nRites and rituals.\nThe Righteous Kill (also called the \"final trial\" or \"final test\") is the rite of passage and is referred to as a test of loyalty for aspiring members. The challenge is described as the elimination of a foe or target who challenged the mind, body or spirit of the aspirant. But by the time of the attack on Gilneas, Alpha Prime was disobeying his own rules, and targets were unarmed, helpless, and defenseless. In Gilneas, the victims were all King Greymane supporters, were attacked with a knife, and became known as the Starlight Slasher murders. Once contained to Gilneas city, Duskhaven saw its first Starlight Slasher victim one day before the Cult attacked the city. This is how the cult determines if a human is worthy to join their ranks, but impressive spirit and rage may mark a human as worthy regardless.\nThe Blessing of the Blade is the rite of initiation performed by the Wolf Cult in Gilneas and Duskwood. The Wolf Cult holy book, Purity of Essence, says \"Upon completion of the test of loyalty, the aspirant will receive the blessing of the blade and be marked. Only those who are marked may be consecrated. Aspirants are marked with a scythe or sword by a member of the cult, with two others bearing witness. The aspirant is later bitten on the left shoulder, bestowing the worgen curse. Some humans join and serve the cult without becoming worgen."}

However, after the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; destroyed Dalaran and most of its populace, he fled to Shadowfang Keep above &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;. On the orders of King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, Arugal used &lt;a href=\"Ur\"&gt;Ur's&lt;/a&gt; research to summon the Worgen from what was later known as the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to help defend against the rampaging &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The feral wolf-men slaughtered not only the Scourge, but quickly turned on the wizards themselves. The worgen sieged the keep of the noble &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;. Situated above the tiny hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt;, the keep quickly fell into shadow and ruin. Driven mad with guilt, Arugal adopted the worgen as his children and retreated to the newly dubbed 'Shadowfang Keep'. He resided there, protected by his massive pet, &lt;a href=\"Fenrus\"&gt;Fenrus&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and haunted by the vengeful ghost of Baron Silverlaine.\nEventually, he created his own worgen cult, under the guidance of his &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt;, by spreading the worgen curse to places like the &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt; and using his magic to keep the worgen under his control. Soon, he had worgen packs such as the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20pack\"&gt;Shadowfang pack&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Moonrage%20pack\"&gt;Moonrage pack&lt;/a&gt; to do his bidding. Arugal and Alpha Prime's cult sought to find the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and use it to free the worgen still trapped within the Emerald Dream. His activities, however, eventually drew the ire of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and he was later assassinated by Horde adventurers.\nThe Scourge's Wolfcult.\nAfter Arugal was &lt;a href=\"Arugal%20Must%20Die\"&gt;defeated and beheaded&lt;/a&gt; by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Arugal's headless body was buried at the foot of the path leading up to his former stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. At the behest of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt; princes &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Keleseth\"&gt;Keleseth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Valanar\"&gt;Valanar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Theraldis\"&gt;Theraldis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Atherann\"&gt;Atherann&lt;/a&gt; resurrected Arugal in the service of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and sent him to the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; to subvert the &lt;a href=\"Trappers\"&gt;trapper communities&lt;/a&gt;. Arugal crafted a second Wolfcult under the Scourge's command, entirely separate from the one he had made under orders of Alpha Prime.\nArriving at &lt;a href=\"Solstice%20Village\"&gt;Solstice Village&lt;/a&gt; Arugal was quickly able to convert the population into worgen and later did the same in &lt;a href=\"Silverbrook\"&gt;Silverbrook&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Anatoly\"&gt;Anatoly&lt;/a&gt;, the trappers joined the cult because they believed that everyone would inevitably come to serve the Lich King and that it was better to do so as a worgen than by becoming an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. With the majority of the trappers willing joining the cult and the resisters killed or (as in the case of the workers of the &lt;a href=\"Hollowstone%20Mine\"&gt;Hollowstone Mine&lt;/a&gt;) cursed to undeath Arugal settled the Wolfcult's base of operations in &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Tower\"&gt;Shadowfang Tower&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmoon Isle&lt;/a&gt;, off the &lt;a href=\"Eastwind%20Shore\"&gt;Eastwind Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil the Alliance sent emissaries to ally with the locals in Silverbrook, the Wolfcult operated in secrecy; however, the Alliance eventually discovered the truth behind the trappers. By contrast, &lt;a href=\"Conqueror%20Krenna\"&gt;Conqueror Krenna&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Hold\"&gt;Conquest Hold&lt;/a&gt;, seems to dismiss any talk about worgen as \"nonsense\", though her sister &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt; recognized that the worgen were a threat.\nWith the aid of &lt;a href=\"Ruuna%20the%20Blind\"&gt;Ruuna the Blind&lt;/a&gt; and the trapper &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt;, whose father Mikhail was killed by the Wolfcult, adventurers learn about Arugal's resurrection and discover that the Wolfcult are agents of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. After this revelation, Sasha becomes more determined to uncover the whereabouts of her sister and journeys to the &lt;a href=\"White%20Pine%20Trading%20Post\"&gt;White Pine Trading Post&lt;/a&gt;. After adventurers successfully captured and delivered &lt;a href=\"Anatoly\"&gt;Anatoly&lt;/a&gt; to her, she was able to rescue her. At the same time, both Sasha and the adventurers learned about Arugal's locations. Eager to see the madness of the Wolfcult end, Sasha enlisted adventurers to end the Wolfcult leadership.\nOn Bloodmoon Isle, the adventurers killed one by one Arugal's lieutenants: &lt;a href=\"Varlam\"&gt;Varlam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Selas\"&gt;Selas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Goremaw\"&gt;Goremaw&lt;/a&gt;. With the secondary leadership of the Wolfcult dead, they moved into the tower, and after a ferocious battle, they definitely killed the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers Bronzebeard mentioned in their exploration report that despite Arugal's death the cult still continued to linger on Bloodmoon Isle. It is unknown if the other trapper settlements still hold loyalty to the Wolfcult, given that the main reason for joining for many was fear of the Lich King and Arugal.\nMembers.\nThese humans have the ability to transform into a worgen at will and are not forced to change at night. When they are killed they transform back into humans, ending their curse. However, there are some that have changed into a full-fledged worgen, these do not change and will remain as a skinnable worgen after death.\nSpeculation.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Lands%20of%20Mystery\"&gt;Lands of Mystery&lt;/a&gt;\", it is detailed that the Grizzly Hills was an area that was outside the range of the Scourge's domain and was firmly in the hands of the furbolg with no notable human presence. However, as Valgarde grew, its residents forced the Drakkari and furbolgs back into the Grizzly Hills and beyond, making the region safe enough for farmers to till the land. It is possible that the human villages in the Grizzly Hills were a result of this.\nThis would also explain how the Scourge managed to get a foothold in the Grizzly Hills; the invading humans broke the power of the furbolg that kept the Scourge at bay."}

Knaak&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew York Times bestselling author Richard A. Knaak's latest book chronicles a series of pivotal events in the aftermath of the Cataclysm, as conflict engulfs every corner of Azeroth. Hungering for more resources amid the turmoil, the Horde have pressed into Ashenvale to feed their burgeoning war machine. There, acting warchief Garrosh Hellscream has employed a brutal new tactic to conquer the region and crush its night elf defenders. Unless the Alliance can overcome its own political strife, the new warchief might succeed in seizing Ashenvale.\nWolfheart is the story of King Varian Wrynn's struggle to accept the worgen of Gilneas into the Alliance and come to terms with the wolf within himself. As the Horde threat emerges in Ashenvale, Varian's ability to triumph over his own failings will determine the fate of the entire Alliance.\nDescription.\nA slight movement in the opposite direction caught &lt;a href=\"Eadrik\"&gt;Eadrik&lt;/a&gt;'s attention. The doe, acting only on her instincts and unable to meld those with common sense, had chosen an inopportune time to begin running again.\nThe &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; lunged after her. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; waited for a moment, then stepped from the tree. If Eadrik was here, the lord of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; considered, then his master could not be far.\nThe bow once again ready, Varian moved in the direction from which Eadrik had come. The worgen hunted as a pack to a point. Being also men, those like &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn&lt;/a&gt; would seek their individual kills.\nVarian retraced Eadrik's path, moving through the brush as readily as the worgen. His eyes constantly surveyed the vicinity and his ears and nose sought signs of his prey.\nAnd at last he saw a worgen who could only be the Gilnean king. Genn flung himself after a massive boar with tusks so sharp and strong that, if the animal turned to face the worgen, Genn would truly risk death. At the moment, though, the boar thought only of flight.\nGenn, however, was fast gaining. He ran sometimes on only his legs, but other times used his hands, too. With a litheness that Varian had not even seen from the much younger Eadrik, the veteran ruler closed on the boar.\nHaving measured the situation, Varian entered the fray. Although without the \u201cbenefit\u201d of the curse, he moved with all the skill and pace of one who had survived more critical struggles than surely all the worgen combined. Yet, it was more than merely the reflexes of a former gladiator that served Varian now. Another force guided him, drove him in among the worgen as if he were one of their own and not simply a man. Others in the past had called him Lo'Gosh... and, at that moment, that name was more true of him than the one with which he had been born.\nIn the wake of the Cataclysm, conflict has engulfed every corner of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Hungering for more resources amid the turmoil, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has pressed into &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; to feed its burgeoning war machine. There, acting &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; has employed a brutal new tactic to conquer the region and crush its &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; defenders, a move that will cripple the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s power throughout the...\nWORLD OF WARCRAFT\nUnaware of the disaster brewing in Ashenvale, the night elves' legendary leaders, High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, conduct a summit near &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; in order to vote the proud worgen of Gilneas into the Alliance. However, resentment of Gilneas and its ruler, Genn Greymane, runs deep in Stormwind's King Varian Wrynn. His refusal to forgive Genn for closing his nation off from the rest of the world years ago endangers more than just the summit: it threatens to unravel the Alliance itself.\nVarian's animosity is only one of many unsettling developments in Darnassus. An uneasiness creeps over the once-immortal night elves as the first of them fall victim to the infirmities of age. While they cope with their mortality, tensions flare over the reintroduction of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the highest caste of night elf nobility, into their society. Many night elves are unable to pardon the Highborne for the destruction unleashed on Azeroth millennia ago by their reckless use of magic.\nWhen a murdered Highborne is discovered on the outskirts of Darnassus, Malfurion and Tyrande move to stop further bloodshed and unrest by appointing one of the night elves' most cunning and skilled agents to find the killer: the renowned warden &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. Yet with all that is transpiring in Darnassus, the Alliance might be powerless to stop the relentless new warchief Garrosh from seizing the whole of Ashenvale."}

Each tribe has its own independent leader and goals, but they are sometimes capable of diplomatic relationships with outsiders. Most wolvar shun &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magic and instead focus on being &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, and though they may appear primitive at first glance, the tribal leaders of the wolvar are often very powerful in the latter discipline.\nReligion.\nThe wolvar appear to worship different creatures for one reason or another, most notably the &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Kartak%20the%20Abominable\"&gt;Kartak the Abominable&lt;/a&gt;.

Nethergarde and Okril\u2019lon have already fallen, and while the Horde and the Alliance moved as quickly as they could to get reinforcements to their people, they are too late. The Iron Horde invasion has begun.\nIn this desperate hour, King Wrynn and Warchief Vol\u2019jin have called upon their greatest champions to join the front lines in the Blasted Lands and do whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde...before the rest of Azeroth falls before them.\nPrepare yourself. Draenor is waiting.\nCharacter and class changes.\nWelcome to a look at character and class changes. We're trying a new patch note format, which we hope will help better convey the reasoning for many of the changes being made and what they mean for you, while providing more background into issues we're trying to solve.\nLooking for a TL;DR summary of the character and class changes? Here you go!\n&lt;a href=\"Stat%20squish\"&gt;Stat squish&lt;/a&gt;.\nCharacter progression is one of the defining characteristics of a role-playing game. Naturally, that means that we're continuously adding more power to the game for players to acquire. After 4 expansions and over 9 years of this growth, we've gotten to a point where the numbers involved are no longer easy to grasp. And worse, much of the granularity that's available is tied up in tiers of older content from &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, none of which are really relevant anymore. It's no longer necessary for &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; quest gear to be nearly twice as powerful as &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; quest gear, even though the two zones are only a couple of levels apart.\nIn order to bring things down to an understandable level, we've reduced the scale of stats throughout the game, back to as if they continued scaling linearly through questing content from levels 1 to 90. This applies to creatures, spells, abilities, consumables, gear, other items... everything. Your stats and damage have been reduced by a huge amount, but so have creatures' health. For example, your &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; that previously hit a creature for 450,000 out of its 3,000,000 health (15% of its health), may now hit that same creature for 30,000 out of its 200,000 health (still 15% of its health). In effect, you will still be just as powerful, but the numbers that appear will be more easily parsed.\nIt's important to understand that this isn't a nerf, and we have special handling in place to preserve players' existing ability to solo old content. Players will deal bonus damage against lower-level creatures from past expansions, and will take reduced damage from them.\nWe've also removed all base damage on player spells and abilities, and adjusted &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Power\"&gt;Attack Power&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Power\"&gt;Spell Power&lt;/a&gt; scaling as needed, so that all specializations will scale at the same rate.\nWe've also streamlined the multitude of various types of Haste % and Critical Strike % bonuses.\nPrimary character stats and attack power.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Primary\"&gt;\"primary\" stats&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Agility\"&gt;Agility&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strength\"&gt;Strength&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Intellect\"&gt;Intellect&lt;/a&gt;, are foundations of a character's power. But they have not been created equally, making it difficult to properly balance them against secondary stats. The leading reason for this is that Agility and Intellect also provide &lt;a href=\"Critical%20strike\"&gt;Critical Strike chance&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Power\"&gt;Attack Power&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Power\"&gt;Spell Power&lt;/a&gt;, whereas Strength does not. In order to achieve better balance, we've removed the Critical Strike chance increase from Agility and Intellect. Still, it felt like Agility-based characters should critically strike more often, so we've raised those classes' baseline Critical Strike chance to compensate.\nWe've consolidated the way that Attack Power and Spell Power function and scale, to make those values clearer and correct some scaling issues regarding caster weapons relative to physical weapons.\nActive mitigation has worked very well as a tanking model. So, moving forward we want to keep the amount of &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parry\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; on tanks on the low side. This helps prevent encounters from causing very spiky damage on tanks, which generally isn't much fun. Dodge and Parry gains from Strength and Agility are being reduced to help accomplish this. Additionally, items in \"Warlords of Draenor\" will not have Dodge or Parry on them as a stat. Some Dodge and Parry can still be gained through class-specific effects.\nItemization changes.\nWe're making a number of changes to itemization based on a single philosophy: We want to increase the chance that any given item drop is useful to someone in your group. To support this philosophy we're making a few changes to stats. Most items found in Draenor will work for all specializations within a given class, so that you never have to grumble when you see, for example, Intellect plate drop in a group that lacks a Holy paladin.\nWe're also reducing the number of role-specific stats: &lt;a href=\"Hit\"&gt;Hit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Expertise\"&gt;Expertise&lt;/a&gt; are gone, as are &lt;a href=\"Dodge\"&gt;Dodge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Parry\"&gt;Parry&lt;/a&gt; as stats on items, replaced with a single tank stat of Bonus Armor. Armor and Spirit will be specific to tanks and healers respectively, but all other secondary stats will have universal appeal.\nBecause of the magnitude of this change, we're retroactively applying this philosophy to items in Mists of Pandaria. After the pre-expansion patch you may find that some of your items contribute different stats, but they should still be good for your class.\nNew secondary stats added\n\"Mists of Pandaria\" and future items\n\"Warlords of Draenor\" and future items\nIn an effort to reduce the physical mitigation of some classes, we've modified the amount of Armor provided by some armor types.\nHit and expertise removal.\n&lt;a href=\"Hit\"&gt;Hit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Expertise\"&gt;Expertise&lt;/a&gt; were not fun stats. They acted to remove a penalty, instead of making you stronger. Most players treated Hit/Expertise caps as mandatory (rightfully so), with failure to reach those caps as a trap of sorts. After adjusting, &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;gemming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"reforging\"&gt;reforging&lt;/a&gt; gear to meet that cap, players could then go after the actual damage-increasing stats. We decided to remove Hit and Expertise, and make it so you don't need them. We still want melee specializations to attack creatures from behind when possible, so attacks from the front will have a 3% chance to be parried that cannot be eliminated for non-tanking specializations.\n&lt;a href=\"Secondary%20stat%20attunement\"&gt;Secondary stat attunement&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA new concept that we're introducing is each specialization having an attunement to a particular secondary stat. These take the form of a passive ability that grants a 5% increase to the amount of a specific secondary stat gained. This provides a good starting point for where to focus your secondary stats. Usually, it will be your highest throughput stat (not counting Spirit for Healers, and Bonus Armor for Tanks, which is an optimal secondary stat in most cases). There are exceptions, and raw throughput may not even be the biggest concern in some situations. Treat this as a guideline, not a rule, about which secondary stat to favor.\nPlayer health and resilience.\nWe're planning several interconnected changes designed to provide better-tuned gameplay for healers and improve the healing dynamic in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe high amount of base &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Resilience\"&gt;Resilience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Fatigue\"&gt;Battle Fatigue&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" caused characters to feel much weaker in PvP than they did in &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;. To address this disparity, we're approaching \"Warlords of Draenor\" with the goal of shrinking that gap as much as possible. To reduce dependence on Resilience, we needed to increase player survivability against other players, and we chose to do this by essentially doubling (post-&lt;a href=\"item%20squish\"&gt;squish&lt;/a&gt;) player health.\nOn its own, that increase in health would make players more survivable in the world at large, so we're also increasing creature damage and the effectiveness of healing spells to balance things out. The net result of these changes is that individual attacks will knock a smaller chunk off of a player's health pool in PvP, but your survivability in PvE remains unaffected.\nDoubling player health gave us room to reduce Resilience and Battle Fatigue, but our goal was to be able to remove them entirely. In order to achieve that, we're also reducing PvP spike damage across the board by lowering Critical Damage and Critical Heals against players in PvP to 150% of their normal effect (down from 200%). The changes have allowed us to reduce Base Resilience to 0%, and [remove Battle Fatigue].\nChanges to PvP\nChanges to Health Pools\nRetuning healing spells.\nOne of our goals for healing is to tone down the raw throughput of healers relative to the size of player health pools. Currently, as healers and their allies acquire better and better gear, the percentage of a player's health that any given heal restores increases significantly. As a result, healers are able to refill health bars so fast that we have to make damage more and more \"bursty\" in order to challenge them. Ideally, we want players to spend some time below full health without having healers feel like their groupmates are in danger of dying at any moment. We also think that healer gameplay would be more varied, interesting, and skillful if your allies spent more time between 0% and 100%, rather than just getting damaged quickly to low health, forcing the healer to then scramble to get them back to 100% as quickly as possible.\nTo that end, we're buffing heals less than we're increasing player health. Heals will be deliberately less potent compared to health pools than before the &lt;a href=\"item%20squish\"&gt;item squish&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, as gear improves, the scaling rates of health and healing will now be very similar, so the relative power of any given healing spell shouldn't climb so much over the course of this expansion. For those concerned about what this means for raiding, don't worry\u2014we're taking all of these changes into account when designing Raid content for \"Warlords of Draenor\".\nIt's also important to note that spells that heal based on a percentage of maximum health are being effectively buffed by the massive increase to player health pools, so we're lowering those percentages to offset the effect. That may make them appear to have been nerfed\u2014however, the net result is that those percentage-based heals stay about the same as before relative to other heals.\nAll of these changes apply to damage-absorption shields as well. Additionally, we're toning down the power of damage absorption in general. When they get too strong, absorption effects are often used in place of direct healing, instead of as a way to supplement it. We will, of course, take these changes into account when tuning specializations that rely heavily on absorbs, such as Discipline Priests.\nWe also took a look at healing spells that were passive or auto-targeted (so-called \"smart\" heals). We want healers to care about who they're targeting and which heals they're using, so that their decisions matter more. To that end, we're reducing the healing of many passive and auto-targeted heals, and making smart heals a little less smart. Smart heals will now randomly pick any injured target within range instead of always picking the most injured target. Priority will still be given to players over pets, of course.\nAnother of our goals for healing in this expansion is to strike a better balance between single-target and multi-target healing spells. We've taken a close look at the mana efficiency of our multi-target heals, and in many cases, we're reducing their efficiency, usually by reducing the amount they heal. Sometimes, but more rarely, raising their mana cost was a better decision. We want players to use multi-target heals, but they should only be better than their single-target equivalents when they heal more than two players without any overhealing. This way, players will face a meaningful choice between whether to use a single-target heal or a multi-target heal based on the situation.\nFinally, we're removing the low-throughput, low-mana-cost heals like &lt;a href=\"Nourish\"&gt;Nourish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Light%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Holy Light (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Heal%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Heal (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt;, because we think that while they do add complexity, they don't truly add depth to healing gameplay. (We're also renaming some spells to re-use those names. For example, &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Healing%20Wave\"&gt;Greater Healing Wave&lt;/a&gt; is being redubbed Healing Wave.) However, we still want healers to think about their mana when deciding which heal to cast, and so the mana costs and throughputs of many spells are being altered to give players a choice between spells with lower throughput and lower cost versus spells with higher throughput and higher costs. Here are some examples from each healer class.\nAll of this discussion of efficiency may cause most healers to start worrying about mana regeneration and their mana pool. To allay those concerns, we've increased base mana regeneration a great deal at early gear levels, while having it scale up less at later gear levels. This will make all of these changes play well even in early content such as &lt;a href=\"5-player%20Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic Dungeons&lt;/a&gt; and the first tier of Raid content, and also play well in the final Raid tier without mana and efficiency becoming irrelevant due to extremely high regeneration values.\nThat's a lot of big changes for healers: reduced throughput, a more deliberate pace, less powerful \"smart\" heals, weaker absorbs, fewer spells, and a new focus on efficiency decisions. We're confident that we can apply lessons learned from previous expansions to make this the best healer experience yet: more dynamic, less punishing, and frankly a lot more fun.\nGeneral Changes to Healing\nRacial traits.\nWe want races to have fun and interesting perks, but if those traits are too powerful, players may feel compelled to play a specific race even if it doesn't suit their aesthetic preference. For example, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Berserking\"&gt;Berserking&lt;/a&gt; ability was extremely powerful, and their &lt;a href=\"Beast%20Slaying\"&gt;Beast Slaying&lt;/a&gt; passive was often irrelevant, but occasionally tremendously powerful compared to other racial passives. On the other end of the spectrum, many races had few or no performance affecting perks. We also needed to replace or update a number of &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racials&lt;/a&gt; that previously granted &lt;a href=\"Hit\"&gt;Hit&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Expertise\"&gt;Expertise&lt;/a&gt;, since those stats have been removed.\nWe decided to bring down the couple high outliers, then establish a fair baseline and bring everyone else up to that. We achieved that by improving old passives, replacing obsolete ones, and occasionally adding new ones where needed. Our goal with these changes is to reach parity amongst races.\nAbility pruning and consolidation.\nOver the years, we've added significantly more new spells and abilities to the game than we've removed. This has led to the complexity of the game increasing steadily over time, to the point we're at now, where players feel like they need dozens of keybinds. There are many niche abilities which could theoretically be useful in some rare case, but usually are not. There are many abilities that we'd be better off not having. We decided that we needed to make a strong push for paring down the number of abilities each class/spec has. That means making some abilities restricted to certain specs that really need them instead of being class-wide, and outright removing some other abilities. It also includes removing some Spellbook clutter, such as passives that could be merged with others, or with base abilities.\nHowever, this doesn't mean that we want to reduce the depth of gameplay, or \"dumb it down.\" We still want there to be interesting decisions during combat, and for skill to matter. But, that doesn't require complexity; we can remove some needless complexity and still retain the depth and skill variance.\nOne type of ability that we focused on is temporary power buffs (\"cooldowns\"). Removing those also helps achieve one of our other goals, which is to reduce the amount of cooldown stacking in the game. In cases where a class/spec had multiple cooldowns that typically ended up getting used together, often in a single macro, we merged them, or removed some of them.\nWhat abilities and spells got cut is a very, very difficult question to answer. Every ability is vital to someone, so we don't take this process lightly. We hope that even if we cut your favorite ability, you can see it in the context of our larger goals. It's important to remember that the point of these changes is to increase players' ability to understand the game, not to reduce depth of gameplay. We attempt to prune abilities with the intent to reduce the amount of keybind/macro bloat and merging abilities that served a similar purpose but are otherwise redundant together.\nPlease see the &lt;a href=\"%23Class%20changes\"&gt;classes&lt;/a&gt; section for changes specific to each class.\nCrowd control and diminishing returns.\nAnother big takeaway from \"Mists of Pandaria\" is that there was simply too much &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; (CC) in the game. To solve that, we knew that we needed an across-the-board disarmament. Here's a summary of the player-cast CC changes:\nAdditionally, we've significantly reduced the number of throughput-increasing cooldowns and procs, in order to further reduce burst damage. Please keep in mind when reading the specifics of the patch notes that some classes may have lost abilities, or had the power of select abilities reduced. These changes were made in the context of the above goals. Other classes have a reduced crowd-control ability overall. We believe that this entire package of changes will make PvP a more enjoyable experience for everyone.\nMovement speed.\nMoving quickly has always been a powerful bonus in \"World of Warcraft\"; however, the logic of how various movement speed bonuses stack (or don't) has generally been inconsistent and poorly explained. Under the old set-up, each movement speed bonus would become more powerful when combined with another, so we would limit what can stack with what, and prevent certain abilities from being used when another one is already in effect. We decided to change the movement speed system to make it more transparent, with rules about stacking that are easier to understand, and with fewer restrictions.\nPreviously, multiple movement speed modifiers on you were multiplicative, meaning that if you had two different +25% movement speed bonuses, they resulted in a total movement speed of 56% (1.25*1.25 = 1.56).\nMovement speed bonuses have been changed to be additive. The previous example with two different +25% movement speed bonuses would result in a total movement speed of +50%. The logic governing which bonuses stack with others has been simplified as well.\nAdditionally, restrictions that prevented a player with a temporary speed bonus from receiving or activating a second temporary speed bonus have been removed. Both bonuses will now apply to the character, but only the one with the highest magnitude will have any effect.\nExamples of self-only passive bonuses: &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt;, Movement Speed enchants, &lt;a href=\"Quickness\"&gt;Quickness&lt;/a&gt; racial for Night Elves, &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Presence\"&gt;Unholy Presence&lt;/a&gt;\nExamples of shared or temporary bonuses: &lt;a href=\"Angelic%20Feather\"&gt;Angelic Feather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sprint\"&gt;Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stampeding%20Roar\"&gt;Stampeding Roar&lt;/a&gt;\nBuffs and debuffs.\nAll specializations provide some common buffs and debuffs. These are important to the game because they encourage cooperation, make you stronger when you work together with others, and promote raid composition diversity. However, we saw room to revise these buffs and debuffs. In addition to the above changes, we revised which buffs and debuffs are provided by Hunter pets. Please see the Hunter Pet Abilities section for a full list of changes.\nTwo new stats have been added that benefitted all players. Also added were three new debuffs (Weakened Armor, Physical Vulnerability, and Magic Vulnerability) that each benefitted only half of the group. While that could be interesting, the two physical debuffs were redundant, and felt that the two new stats would be better suited as raid buffs. So, we made that replacement.\nWeakened Blows was a debuff that mattered almost exclusively to tanks, and that every tank automatically applied. We removed the debuff and reduced creature damage to compensate.\nThe Cast Speed Slow was a debuff type that mattered almost exclusively to PvP, and made combat much less fun for casters in addition to encouraging the use of instant-cast spells. We decided that it was best to remove casting speed debuffs. \nAs part of a push to combine the different types of Haste in the game as much as possible, we merged &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Haste\"&gt;Spell Haste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Speed\"&gt;Attack Speed&lt;/a&gt; into just Haste, which benefits everyone.\nSome classes received new abilities to provide some of harder-to-find buffs/debuffs, increasing their utility to the Party or Raid.\nRaid utility balance.\nVarious classes bring various abilities that provide utility to parties and raids. We talked about one type of utility in the Buffs and Debuffs section, above. However, there are other types of raid utility, and it's been in need of more attention. In general, raid utility, especially raid-wide defensive cooldowns, had grown too strong. So many classes and specializations had defensive cooldowns that we had to make raid damage extremely high, as raids would be stacking or chaining together multiple cooldowns. We'd like to return to a system where it's the healers who heal through the scary moments, not the damage dealers, for example.\nTo do so, we've established a new baseline level of raid utility that a specialization should bring, and brought everyone to that new standard by reducing the effects of some abilities, or removing some abilities altogether.\nInstant-cast heals.\nOver time, healers have gained a bigger and bigger arsenal of heals that they can cast while on the move, which removes the inherent cost that movement is intended to have for them, while also limiting players' ability to counter healing in PvP. This left &lt;a href=\"Silence%20effect\"&gt;silences&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;which we're trying to curb&lt;/a&gt;) as the only ways to actually limit an enemy player's healing output. We're still preserving the option to instantly heal, but are reducing the number of instant-cast healing abilities overall. Raid and dungeon encounter damage during high-movement phases will be adjusted accordingly.\nPeriodic effects.\nThere are many effects in the game which deal periodic damage over time (DoT) or healing over time (HoT). Historically, these have typically done something called \"snapshotting\"; they were based on your stats at the time that they were cast, and that was used for calculating their effect for their full lifetime. In Mists, if a warlock casts Corruption on an enemy while Heroism is active, that DoT will continue to tick rapidly based on the temporary haste effect, even after Heroism fades. This has led to some gameplay that has both good and bad sides.\nSnapshotting encourages refreshing those periodic effects when your stats are high, such as when a temporary buff procs. On the upside, there's a high amount of skill involved in maximizing that. On the downside, it's not intuitive, and the skill ceiling is so high that few can reach it without the use of specialized add-ons. To make matters worse, the benefits of maximizing periodic snapshotting is so high that it creates a balance problem. Players maximizing periodic snapshotting (primarily through the use of add-ons) do drastically more damage than intended. If we balance around taking full advantage of snapshotting, then the players who aren't doing so would fall unacceptably far behind in damage output.\nUltimately, we've decided that snapshotting isn't a productive mechanic for the game. The vast majority of periodic effects in the game that snapshotted no longer do so. The only exceptions are ones that do damage based on a percentage of a previous ability's damage (such as the &lt;a href=\"Ignite\"&gt;Ignite&lt;/a&gt; from a Fire mage's &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt;, or the periodic damage on a Windwalker monk's &lt;a href=\"Blackout%20Kick\"&gt;Blackout Kick&lt;/a&gt;), as they inherently act as a delayed damage multiplier to those abilities. Temporary effects which buff the damage or healing of other spells specifically will continue to do so for their lifetime; for example, &lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Flame\"&gt;Unleash Flame&lt;/a&gt; (which increases the damage of the shaman's next fire spell by 40%), when used on a &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Shock\"&gt;Flame Shock&lt;/a&gt;, will continue to increase the damage of the periodic effect for its entire lifetime, despite being consumed when the Flame Shock is cast. We still of course want skills and their use to embody interesting choices, and intelligent and skillful use of abilities.\nSkilled players will still be able to take advantage of temporary power buffs like trinket procs, and you'll still want to cast your hardest hitting spells within those proc durations. The benefits just won't extend outside the trinket procs' duration. As such, this high-skill gameplay is there, it's just rewarded more consistently. For example, a Priest's trinket procs and an already active Shadow Word: Pain will begin dealing more damage the instant the proc effect occurs, but will return to normal when the proc duration ends. Skilled players will be able to play within these proc durations to maximize effect, but it won't be as detrimental to output to anyone who isn't actively and skillfully using them to their full extent.\nWe also made another change to periodic effects. Haste has long affected the tick rate of periodic effects, and their duration has been rounded to whole numbers of ticks, in order to mostly preserve the original duration of the spell. This lead to Haste breakpoints where having specific amounts of Haste would cause certain periodic effects to gain an extra tick. Part of gearing your character involved trying to reach those Haste breakpoints, but not go over by too much. This was a fairly tedious number to manage, which was again mostly handled by add-ons and guides. With some new tech we're now able to calculate the effect of Haste on tick time dynamically. Any fraction of a full period left at the end of an effect will do a tick of damage or healing in proportion to the remaining time. In other words, there are no more Haste breakpoints; Haste now smoothly and accurately affects periodic effects for the entire duration.\nThis also opened up the opportunity to revise how we handle refreshing periodic effects. For the vast majority of spells and abilities, we had a standard rule that any refresh would add the new cast's duration after the next tick of the existing effect. In simpler terms, you can refresh anywhere between the last and second-to-last tick of a DoT or HoT with no loss. Warlocks had a special passive that changed this logic to allow refreshing with no loss anywhere in the last 50% of a DoT. We liked the flexibility that this provided; though felt it was a bit too powerful. No longer tied to whole tick times, we chose to extend the mechanic that Warlocks had to all classes, but reduce it to 30%. Everyone can now refresh their periodic effects anywhere in the last 30% of the duration for full benefit, and no lost tick time.\nTank vengeance, resolve, and PvP.\nThe changes to tanking made in \"Mists of Pandaria\" turned out quite well, overall. But there were a few rough parts that we're going to smooth over. The biggest one is the offensive capabilities of &lt;a href=\"Vengeance\"&gt;Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;. We like that tanks can provide meaningful DPS to their group, however, it swung wildly based on the fight, even surpassing the dedicated damage dealers occasionally. To solve this, we're going to remove the offensive value of Vengeance, but preserve the defensive value, by making it increase the effect of your active mitigation buttons, instead of &lt;a href=\"Attack%20Power\"&gt;Attack Power&lt;/a&gt;.\nThen, to keep tank DPS meaningful, we'll be raising their damage, since it would be meager with no Vengeance Attack Power (Vengeance accounted for 70-90% of a tank's damage on high-tank-damage fights in \"Mists\"). To do that, we're increasing the damage of several prominent tank abilities. For plate-wearing Tank specializations, Riposte has been redesigned to convert Critical Strike into Parry, a defensive stat. That also helps keep secondary stats balanced in offensive value for them.\nTanks in PvP.\nFinally, we have the topic of tanks in PvP. Apart from a few niche cases like flag carrying; tanks have been intentionally non-viable in serious PvP for several expansions now. The reason for this was simple: fighting against tanks was very frustrating, not fun. They were near-invincible, had numerous CC abilities (primary stuns), but did little enough damage to not be able to kill you (in most cases, anyway). By excluding them from PvP, we preserved the enjoyment of the rest of the playerbase. However, that has the obvious downside that people who prefer to play tanks are excluded from doing so in PvP.\nWe decided that we could do better, and satisfy everyone involved. Our other changes to tanks in Warlords of Draenor got us most of the way there. Tanks' damage will already be tuned to be somewhat weaker than damage dealers, but not trivial. We've already removed the additional CC that they had during the CC Disarmament and Ability Pruning. All that remains that makes them frustrating to fight against is their invincibility. So, we're causing tanks to take increased damage in PvP, so that the net result is that they both deal and take somewhat less damage than damage dealers.\nQuality of life improvements.\nFacing requirements.\nStrict facing requirements can be frustrating to deal with, especially in hectic Raid combat or PvP environments. In order to ease this frustration, we decided to remove or significantly loosen the facing requirements of all attacks that required the player to be behind their target.\nTooltip clarity.\nBeing able to quickly understand what an ability does by glancing at the tooltip is of paramount importance to learn how to play with a given class or specialization. We've taken an extensive look at the tooltips for all class abilities, and revised them to be as clear and concise as possible.\nIn some rare cases, we've removed mention of niche information that we don't think is needed. If that's the case, please note that a change to the ability's tooltip does not mean that functionality has changed. If the change in question is not mentioned in the Patch Notes, there has been no change to the ability.\nSelf-sustainability.\nAnother area of gameplay that we polished is how characters are able to sustain their own health, primarily when frequently killing enemies, such as in solo questing.\nReforging.\nThe original intent behind &lt;a href=\"Reforging\"&gt;Reforging&lt;/a&gt; was to offer a way for players to customize their gear, but in practice it offered little in the way of true choice. Players attempting to optimize every piece of gear were well advised to look up how they were supposed to reforge an item in an online guide or tool that had already determined the optimal choice. It added yet another step to the list of things that must be done to a new item before it was ready to be equipped, reducing the joy of getting an upgrade into a chore.\nIf an upgrade drops, we want you to be able to equip it with a minimum of fuss. It is for those reasons that we're removing Reforging from the game.\nCombat resurrections.\nCombat resurrections are an extremely powerful tool that players have while in combat. Naturally, we apply some limitations. In \"Mists of Pandaria\", that limit was 1 resurrection during a given raid boss encounter for 10-player modes and 3 for 25-player modes. With Flexible difficulty introduced in Patch 5.4, we erred on the forgiving side, and gave Flexible Raids 3 resurrections regardless of raid size.\nIn \"Warlords of Draenor\", the Flex tech has expanded to more difficulty levels, and we needed a new system to handle combat resurrections more fairly. We knew that continuing with a constant 3 would encourage using the smallest possible raid sizes, while scaling with hard breakpoints would discourage specific group sizes just under those points. Additionally, the limit is not shown anywhere in-game, so it can be easy to lose track of how many resurrections the raid has available (or even know that the limit exists).\nSo we've built a new system to be more transparent, and improve usability.\nGlyphs.\nWe made several improvements to the &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt; system. While leveling, characters unlock glyph slots at several specific levels. However, in order to get glyphs, characters need to visit an &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; (and potentially pay way more gold than an average character of that level has yet), or know a &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;scribe&lt;/a&gt; from which to request them. To solve this, we've made characters learn some glyphs automatically as they level. Additionally, we now have the ability to make some glyphs exclusive with each other, or require specific specializations.\nProfessions.\nSome of our goals with &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s in \"Warlords of Draenor\" are to make them more of a personal choice, and less of a mandatory \"min/max\" selection. To that end, we're removing the direct combat benefits of professions. Additionally, we've made it easier to level &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;. Healing potions have gone mostly unused lately, compared to combat stat potions. We chose to solve that problem, along with a problem with warlock utility, by having healing potions and &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;s share cooldowns.\nTransformation effects.\nThe Transformation system has been improved. Characters can now be affected by multiple transformation effects at once. While multiple transformation or shapeshift effects are active, only the highest priority one will be visible. This allows transformation effects to persist while shapeshifts are active. Additionally, many restrictions on being transformed have been removed.\nClass changes.\nDeath knight.\nA number of changes were made for death knights. Several cooldowns were made spec-specific. Frost and Unholy's rotations remain unchanged for the most part. Blood received revisions to their Active Mitigation design to bring them up to par with changes to other Tanking specializations. Runic Power generation of &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt; was standardized, to make it more understandable and balanced.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ablity%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for a discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For death knights, this focused on removing abilities that were redundant, cooldown reduction, or abilities that were not used often.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nThe biggest change here is the merger of Blood Boil into Pestilence. This change effectively turned Roiling Blood into a passive ability; which we replaced with a new talent, Plaguebearer. For Blood specialization, we removed Rune Strike and are adjusting the cost of Death Coil so that it can be used in Rune Strike's place.\nAnother change was to polish up the effect of diseases on the damage of other abilities. Diseases now do enough damage on their own to warrant using them. Having diseases act as multipliers on the damage of other abilities became extraneous and cluttered up the tooltips of those abilities. Those multipliers have been removed, and consolidated their benefits into the corresponding base spell. These changes also results in a slight reduction to ramp-up time.\nFrost changes.\nIn \"Mists of Pandaria\", Frost death knights suffered from rotations that were designed to allow flexibility in ability usage, so that you could pool some resources in order to make decisions about which ones you spent and in which order. Dual Wield vs Two-Handed had different rotational priorities, with different strengths and weaknesses. However, tuning ended up such that you reached a point where you just had to spend all of your resources as fast as possible to avoid wasting any, and all of that depth went out the window. For \"Warlords\", we've adjusted the tuning of several abilities and passives, to ensure that that doesn't happen again, and the rotational decisions and skill are maintained.\nThe goal is that Two-Handed Frost death knights favor their physical damage, slicing through their enemies with heavy Obliterates, whereas Dual-Wielders favor blasting their foes with frost damage, but both overlap considerably to maintain a cohesive specialization.\nUnholy changes.\nIn order to better balance the scaling rates and value of secondary stats for Unholy death knights, we reduced the power of their passive &lt;a href=\"Unholy%20Might\"&gt;Unholy Might&lt;/a&gt; ability, and added a new passive ability to make Multistrike more effective.\nBlood changes.\nActive Mitigation was a very successful design that was inspired by death knights' tanking style. However, it went beyond that, and death knights themselves were somewhat left behind in that regard. We made several changes to bring up the interactivity of Blood combat. This includes making &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt; cause healing based on attack power, but be affected by the new &lt;a href=\"Resolve\"&gt;Resolve&lt;/a&gt; passive (see &lt;a href=\"%23Tank%20vengeance%20and%20resolve\"&gt;tank vengeance and resolve&lt;/a&gt; above), which gives it the traditional increase from recent damage. Plus, &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Tap\"&gt;Rune Tap&lt;/a&gt; is being significantly improved, to become a strong Active Mitigation button. Additionally, we removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Blood death knights to value &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crit\"&gt;Crit&lt;/a&gt; as important secondary stats. In order to achieve that, we made &lt;a href=\"Riposte%20%28death%20knight%20ability%29\"&gt;Riposte (death knight ability)&lt;/a&gt; give defensive value to Critical Strikes, and Scent of Blood give defensive value to Multistrike. To solve GCD-capping issues and increase the value of Haste, we also removed the passive rune regeneration increase from Improved Blood Presence. Finally, we tweaked the targeting AI of &lt;a href=\"Dancing%20Rune%20Weapon\"&gt;Dancing Rune Weapon&lt;/a&gt;, and fixed it up to properly copy most talents that you know.\nDeath Pact.\nSince the Ghoul pet is now Unholy only, that presents a problem for &lt;a href=\"Death%20Pact\"&gt;Death Pact&lt;/a&gt;. We revised Death Pact to not require an undead minion, but work a little differently. We left it at 50% heal, which is effectively a 33% buff to it from before (see &lt;a href=\"%23retuning%20healing%20spells\"&gt;retuning healing spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Player%20health%20and%20resilience\"&gt;player health and resilience&lt;/a&gt; above), and added a healing absorption shield for 50% of the amount healed instead. It should now be a more effective heal for staying alive immediately, but with the downside of needing to heal through the healing absorption shield before being healed any further.\nMiscellaneous.\nThere were also a few other miscellaneous changes. The Runic Power generation of Anti-Magic Shell was standardized, to make it more understandable and balanced. Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places, so the important rune regeneration talents could be acquired earlier. Conversion was changed to cost different amounts by specialization, instead of reducing Runic Power generation differently by specialization. This way, Runic Power beyond what you spend on Conversion is not penalized.\nDruid.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For Druids, we focused thinning out the niche and abilities that were not used often. We made sure to retain abilities for Druids to function in off-spec roles, since that flexibility is a defining characteristic of the class.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nFor consolidation of abilities, we merged several passive abilities. One notable change is the merging of the Ravage into Shred, and Pounce into Rake; saving a couple keybinds that were only used in conjunction with Prowl.\nGuardian changes.\nGuardian druids had increased Armor as their Mastery for a while now. However, one of the new secondary stats available to all tanks is &lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Armor\"&gt;Bonus Armor&lt;/a&gt;. We didn't feel that the difference of being additive vs. being a multiplier was significant enough to warrant keeping their Mastery around. Additionally, active mitigation hasn't played out as well for Guardians as it has for some other tanks. We decided to redesign the Mastery for Guardian druids to something that compliments the Avoidance-heavy nature of &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Defense\"&gt;Savage Defense&lt;/a&gt;, and also to improve the usability of &lt;a href=\"Tooth%20and%20Claw\"&gt;Tooth and Claw&lt;/a&gt; for more consistent damage reduction. Note that 's calculation uses the damage before any other absorbs you have, and before Tooth and Claw's effects, so that it isn't negatively affected by any of the changes.\nThe maximum number of charges that can be accumulated for &lt;a href=\"Savage%20Defense\"&gt;Savage Defense&lt;/a&gt; has been reduced to make its uptime more consistent between short and long periods of tanking. Rage for Guardian druids has been problematic throughout \"Mists of Pandaria\". Most of their rage generation was extremely passive, and most of their button presses either didn't affect their survivability, or only trivially did so. We made changes to Haste and Critical Strike, to try to solve these rage generation problems, and improve their rotation. We also added Ursa Major, in order to give a defensive value to the new Multistrike stat.\nFeral changes.\nFeral druids received one major change, and few tweaks beyond what's been mentioned above in &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Facing%20requirements\"&gt;facing requirements&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Combo%20Point\"&gt;Combo Point&lt;/a&gt;s are now stored \"on the player\", meaning that when you switch targets, any accumulated Combo Points remain with you. &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Fury\"&gt;Primal Fury&lt;/a&gt; was changed to let it affect area attacks as well. Critical strike chance of &lt;a href=\"Ferocious%20Bite\"&gt;Ferocious Bite&lt;/a&gt; was changed in order to increase the value of Critical Strike. &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Savage%20Roar\"&gt;Glyph of Savage Roar&lt;/a&gt; was reworked to better achieve its intended effect.\nBalance rebalanced.\nWe have some extensive changes for Balance druids. One of our guiding principles with game design is that things should be \"easy to learn, hard to master\". We're not particularly happy with the &lt;a href=\"Moonkin\"&gt;Moonkin&lt;/a&gt; rotation because it was actually hard to learn, and easy to master (especially with regards to periodic damage effects no longer snapshotting). Energy and &lt;a href=\"Eclipse\"&gt;Eclipse&lt;/a&gt; mechanics were not intuitive for many newer players. Once you became accustomed to the rotation, there wasn't much additional depth to mastering it; maintain two DoTs, hit these other two buttons whenever they light up, and spam one of two buttons in between. In order to try to make it easier to learn, but also add some gameplay depth and challenge we're making a significant revision to the rotation. The list of changes is quite dense, so here's a summary of the changes.\nSummary of changes to Balance:\nThat's the basics of the new Moonkin rotation. There's room for improvement beyond that, learning to optimally maintain both periodic damage effects while maximizing their damage, timing Starsurges to optimize the benefit of its buff, make use of &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hurricane\"&gt;Hurricane&lt;/a&gt; for area damage, and taking advantage of the strengths of each side (such as Moonfire and Sunfire having significant differences now). Here are the full details of the changes.\nDetails of changes to Balance:\nTranquility simplification.\n&lt;a href=\"Tranquility\"&gt;Tranquility&lt;/a&gt; has an amazingly strong effect (pour a ton of healing into the whole raid/party), but had excessive complexity for a relatively simple task (5 different targets per tick, a short HoT, stacking, varied strength by raid size). So, we simplified it significantly. It still will be used just as it always has been.\nRestoration changes.\nRestoration druids got a few changes as well. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4\"&gt;Patch 5.4&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Efflorescence\"&gt;Glyph&lt;/a&gt; was introduced where you could choose to attach your Efflorescence to &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Mushroom\"&gt;Wild Mushroom&lt;/a&gt;, instead of to &lt;a href=\"Swiftmend\"&gt;Swiftmend&lt;/a&gt;. That was a rousing success and the glyph was taken by nearly all Restoration druids. It felt like a much better situation to us, so we decided to remove the glyph, and bake that gameplay in permanently. &lt;a href=\"Genesis\"&gt;Genesis&lt;/a&gt; and fill a similar need for burst healing, so Wild Mushroom: Bloom has been removed; leaving Wild Mushroom to focus on the Efflorescence effect.\nSecondly, while we are fine with the playstyle where a Restoration druid blankets their Raid in &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Rejuvenation\"&gt;Swift Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; passive made that too strong, and limited their scaling with Haste. We removed that passive to encourage using other spells more, but still allow Rejuvenation blanketing as a viable playstyle. Omen of Clarity got changed to not trigger more often with Tree of Life as it was too strong in our new healing model. Soul of the Forest was also redesigned to fit better with Restoration and Genesis based on the new design for periodic effects.\nTalents.\nThe level 90-Talent row for druids was designed to encourage hybrid gameplay. We decided that, while you shouldn't have to give up a significant amount of your primary role throughput in order to gain the off-role benefit, you also don't need to gain an actual benefit to your primary role throughput benefit either. We've reduced the power of their primary role benefit, making them roughly neutral in their effect on your primary role. Note that the increase to off-role healing from &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Nature's Vigil&lt;/a&gt; is not actually a buff (see &lt;a href=\"%23retuning%20healing%20spells\"&gt;retuning healing spells&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Player%20health%20and%20resilience\"&gt;player health and resilience&lt;/a&gt; above).\nHunter.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning or consolidating class abilities.\nHunters have lacked a strong distinction between the different specializations. What we mean by that is that the hunter specializations all had rotations that felt similar, with Marksmanship and Survival having the most blurred identities (&lt;a href=\"Beast%20Mastery\"&gt;Beast Mastery&lt;/a&gt; felt well rooted in the pet). Hunters were also some of the most afflicted by button bloat. To address these problems, we opted to make changes to each specialization's rotation, primarily through removing abilities, and making some of them unique to each spec. This means things like &lt;a href=\"Aimed%20Shot\"&gt;Aimed Shot&lt;/a&gt; being the primary Focus dump for Marksmanship, instead of &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shot\"&gt;Arcane Shot&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Serpent%20Sting\"&gt;Serpent Sting&lt;/a&gt; being available only to Survival. Hunters also had a large number of cooldown abilities, which we've also cut down (some of which we moved to the talent tree, competing with other active buttons). \nRotation depth and talents.\nWe've changed the combat rotations of each hunter specialization (primarily through ability pruning) with the goal of them being a platform to build upon with talents. To facilitate this, we've modified several talents to add additional rotational depth. Hunters had many talent options which added abilities to their rotation, but most of them had quite simple usage, with little interaction with your rotation or other abilities. Now, there should be more of a variety; still some simple talents, but also some talents that create a more engaging combat rotation.\nAspects.\nOne of the most difficult abilities to decide to cut was &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Hawk\"&gt;Aspect of the Hawk&lt;/a&gt;. It began to feel fairly meaningless, since it was used virtually all of the time in combat, so might as well have just been passive. We decided to cut Aspect of the Hawk, and bake in its benefit to the other abilities. The remaining aspect abilities are all utility only, and are being moved off the stance bar and made toggles.\nOverall, hunters should see a drastic reduction in the number of active buttons, and have a clearer distinction between the different specializations. With some of these changes, you may find yourself favoring a different specialization. Keep in mind that &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20Perks\"&gt;Draenor Perks&lt;/a&gt;, earned from levels 91 to 99, will serve to further distinguish the different specializations. \nMarksmanship changes.\nOne of our new secondary stats, Multistrike, is strikingly similar to the Wild Quiver Mastery for Marksmanship hunters. To address this similarity, we replaced Wild Quiver with a new Mastery: Sniper Training. Marksmanship hunters that favored Mastery before will want to favor Multistrike for a similar feel. For their new Mastery, we wanted to add some depth to their moment-to-moment gameplay, and compliment Critical Strike. In order to do that, we brought back the concept of Sniper Training.\nWe also changed the design of Chimera Shot (and fixed its name), in order to better capture the intended flavor. Finally, we added an interaction between Careful Aim and Rapid Fire (and indirectly Aimed Shot through a Draenor Perk), so as to add a bit more depth to their gameplay.\nSurvival changes.\nApart from rotational changes through Ability Pruning, changes for Survival hunters mostly center on Lock and Load. We changed how Lock and Load is triggered to increase the value of Multistrike, provide gameplay depth and the ability to pool damage more. Also note the new passive ability, Survivalist, which increases multistrike chance by 10%, in order to give Survival Hunters some baseline Multistrike chance.\nHunter pet abilities.\nWe did a comprehensive pass on &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt; abilities. As mentioned above in &lt;a href=\"%23Crowd%20control%20and%20diminishing%20returns\"&gt;crowd control and diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt;, all full crowd-control abilities have been removed from Hunter pets and replaced those with new abilities, including spreading some that were previously restricted to exotic pets. Additionally, hunters can now tame beasts from new pet families.\nMiscellaneous.\nThere were also a few other changes, primarily for quality of life and rotational consistency.\nMage.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For mages, we removed several of the unused and niche abilities from each specialization that didn't use them primarily.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nMost of the mage abilities required little consolidation. The most notable change here is turning Armor spells into passive abilities for each specialization.\nTalent revisions.\nThe mage class has good specialization distinction when it comes to their single-target rotations, but utility and area-of-effect spells were heavily shared between specializations. Commonly, these spells were redundant as well. We made many of their spells specialization-specific (as described in &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; above). And probably most significant, we made changes to several existing talents.\n&lt;a href=\"Presence%20of%20Mind\"&gt;Presence of Mind&lt;/a&gt; was extremely strong for instant crowd control (CC), which we wanted to curtail. Rather than completely remove Presence of Mind, we made it a base Arcane spell and a new talent in its place, &lt;a href=\"Evanesce\"&gt;Evanesce&lt;/a&gt;. At first, it may seem out of place for Evanesce to be on a movement-focused talent row. In practice, it offers Mages the option to remain stationary instead of moving away from avoidable damage.\nGoing along with our goals to reduce cooldown stacking across all of the classes, we decided to remove &lt;a href=\"Alter%20Time\"&gt;Alter Time&lt;/a&gt;'s DPS contribution. Alter Time has a number of clever movement and utility uses, but in practice it was mostly being used for additional uptime of offensive cooldowns. mages also had many redundant forms of survival utility, so we moved a utility-only version of Alter Time into the talent tree, replacing &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Shield\"&gt;Temporal Shield&lt;/a&gt;.\nA few of the abilities reset by Cold Snap were made spec-specific, or could be overridden with talents, so we expanded what it can affect to compensate.\nIce Ward was changed to make it more competitive with the rest of its talent row.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Bomb\"&gt;Mage Bomb&lt;/a&gt; level-75 Talent row, the bomb row, was also problematic. We chose to add the bombs to all mages' rotations in order to spice them up a bit, to provide rotational variety. That succeeded, and we're overall happy with how they interact with your rotation in a single-target situation, but they also came with the prospect of multi-dotting (applying your damage-over-time spell to many enemies, individually), which we don't feel is an appropriate fit for mages. Additionally, in order to make all 3 bombs useful to all specializations, we had to lose some of their spec-specific perks. And, even more importantly, many mages did not like DoT gameplay at all.\nIn order to solve all of these problems, we decided to merge the 3 current bomb talents into one that changes based on spec. That allows us to reintroduce spec-specific perks to each bomb, and makes room for some non-DoT alternatives.\nOne of the most problematic Talent rows in the game has been the mage level-90 row. The primary theme of the row was mana, which only Arcane mages actually cared about. Bonus damage was added in, making it functional for all mages, but muddled in its goals. Additionally, some of them just weren't fun to play with. We've revised the row to be purely about damage, and made them have less maintenance cost. Arcane mages will have enough mana regeneration without these talents to perform well.\nFrost changes.\nFrost mages enjoyed newfound PvE viability in \"Mists of Pandaria\", and we intend to continue that into the future. However, we do want to clean up some rough spots, especially around their valuing of secondary stats, and the amount of instant-cast spells in their rotation. The &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Armor\"&gt;Frost Armor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shatter\"&gt;Shatter&lt;/a&gt; changes increase the amount of Haste/Critical chance that they can acquire on gear before they start hitting soft caps. The Shatter change also lowers the value of Critical Strike for a bit. The changes to the level-75 Talent row meant that having a Bomb spell is no longer guaranteed, so we changed the way that &lt;a href=\"Brain%20Freeze\"&gt;Brain Freeze&lt;/a&gt; is triggered. Ice Lance's non-frozen damage was doubled to make up for no longer having access to Fire Blast and reducing redundancy in the process.\nFire changes.\nFire mage's rotation is looking solid with the new &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20Perk\"&gt;Draenor Perk&lt;/a&gt;s. However, their cooldown strength could use a buff.\nArcane changes.\nIn order to make room for more Haste effects to apply to &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Blast\"&gt;Arcane Blast&lt;/a&gt;, we raised its cast time and damage slightly. We also made &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Charge\"&gt;Arcane Charge&lt;/a&gt;s last longer, to aid in questing and encounters.\nMonk.\nThe brand-new class for \"Mists of Pandaria\", monks, turned out to be a ton of fun. Brewmasters stayed fairly solid all expansion long. Windwalkers needed a few tweaks here and there, especially to their Mastery, and still have a few shortcomings that we hope to improve, but overall worked quite well. Mistweavers had a bit of a rollercoaster ride, veering between weak and strong over the course of the expansion. Most of our changes to monks will focus on Mistweavers, to try to get them just right.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For monks, the pruning focused on niche abilities. One removal of note is that of Healing Sphere. The active ability to place a Healing Sphere was particularly awkward to use, but overpowered if used perfectly. So we removed it, and replaced it with Healing Surge for Windwalkers and Brewmasters.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nMonk ability consolidation is fairly straightforward. It includes merging of some passive abilities, and removing unneeded abilities that didn't create the gameplay depth they had been intended to.\nMistweaver changes.\nAbout midway through the expansion, it became clear that mana was not valuable for Mistweavers. We tried some adjustments to solve that, but it proved too large of a change to make at the time. We chose to just live with that problem for the time being, and tune them around not really caring much about Spirit or mana (once they reached epic gear).\nNow that we have the time to tweak things for Mistweavers to acquire new gear, we're making changes to get them in the right spot. Initially, we experimented with giving Mistwavers a 1-second global cooldown (GCD) akin to that of the rogue to give them a faster combat feel. However, it's proven difficult to balance. Haste is attractive to healers because it lowers not just cast time but GCD as well. Therefore, monks valued Haste much less than other healers. We explored a few options, but ultimately landed on changing the core GCD for Mistweavers from 1 second to the standard 1.5 seconds, which you will be able to reduce with Haste. This will feel jarring at first, but we're confident that it's for the best, long-term.\nAnother issue with Mistweavers is that of &lt;a href=\"Eminence%20%28monk%20ability%29\"&gt;Eminence (monk ability)&lt;/a&gt;, which has never really played out how we had hoped. The intent with Eminence was to create an alternate play style to fulfill the fantasy of healing through dealing damage, since we knew a lot of players had that fantasy, and a new class was the perfect opportunity to satisfy that.\nHaving two play styles in one spec (Eminence, and traditional Mistweaving, healing primarily through casting heals) proved challenging to balance, because we don't want players to take the best parts of both and stack them into an unintended superior spec. The most notorious of these cases was \"&lt;a href=\"Jab\"&gt;Jab&lt;/a&gt;-Jab-&lt;a href=\"Uplift\"&gt;Uplift&lt;/a&gt;\". In order to solve this problem, we're giving Mistweavers two stances. Stance of the Wise Serpent will continue to be the stance from which to do traditional Mistweaving. The new &lt;a href=\"Stance%20of%20the%20Spirited%20Crane\"&gt;Stance of the Spirited Crane&lt;/a&gt; will be the stance to use for Eminence. You can swap stances at will, with only the cost of a GCD and any current Chi that you've accrued. The intention is that Crane Stance allows Mistweavers to trade healing for damage; it should fall somewhere in the middle between being a full healer, and being a full damage dealer. \nHealing spheres.\nHealing Spheres have been improved. You'll no longer waste them when running over multiples at once when you only need a little healing. We significantly improved the Mistweavers' Healing Spheres effect when they expire. We also made &lt;a href=\"Afterlife\"&gt;Afterlife&lt;/a&gt;'s Healing Spheres consistent with the rest of the class.\nShared ability changes.\nThere were several changes that affected multiple monk specializations. We'd like to see monks using &lt;a href=\"Transcendence\"&gt;Transcendence&lt;/a&gt; more often, so its usability has been improved (some baseline, and some in a &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20Perk\"&gt;Draenor Perk&lt;/a&gt;). For &lt;a href=\"Touch%20of%20Death\"&gt;Touch of Death&lt;/a&gt;, we like that it's a unique execute being usable only once, but found it impractical to use on bosses and have improved its usability. For &lt;a href=\"Tiger%20Strikes\"&gt;Tiger Strikes&lt;/a&gt;, we buffed it to grant &lt;a href=\"Multistrike\"&gt;Multistrike&lt;/a&gt; ability which it was similar to already, and extended it to work with all monk specializations. To better balance the damage of Brewmaster versus Windwalker where both share many of the same abilities, we removed the damage increase provided by Tiger Stance, and increased the damage of melee abilities to compensate.\nWindwalker changes.\nFor Energy-based gameplay to function well, the primary limitation on ability usage should be Energy, not time. That breaks down when a rotation becomes limited by available GCDs, rather than by Energy. Windwalkers were hitting this \"GCD-cap\" too easily, causing scaling problems as they geared up, and removing rotational choices. To solve this problem, we\u2019ve made a few tweaks that will slow down their rotation slightly; but still allow Windwalkers who enjoy the GCD-capped playstyle to have options available to focus on Haste and Energy regeneration. Individually, these may sound like significant nerfs, but Windwalker damage has been adjusted to compensate for these changes. The goal is to address the issue with GCD-capping while not reducing DPS.\nThere are a couple of additional changes for Windwalkers. &lt;a href=\"Storm%2C%20Earth%2C%20and%20Fire\"&gt;Storm, Earth, and Fire&lt;/a&gt;, got buffed to make it smoother to use. We also buffed &lt;a href=\"Fists%20of%20Fury\"&gt;Fists of Fury&lt;/a&gt; because we felt that the ability wasn't giving a strong enough damage boost given its restrictions and impact on the Monk's rotation.\nBrewmaster changes.\nFor Brewmasters, &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Ox\"&gt;Gift of the Ox&lt;/a&gt; has been modified to allow it to scale defensively with the new Multistrike stat. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ox%20Statue\"&gt;Black Ox Statue&lt;/a&gt; has been modified to aid Monks in establishing threat on new enemies instead of shielding allies. We also removed the Misfire effect, as it did not live up to its original idea, and was unnecessary.\nPaladin.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For paladins, the pruning focused on removing niche abilities, and trimming cooldowns.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nThere were a few mergers of passive abilities, and some tweaks to a couple of abilities.\nHoly changes.\nWe made several changes for Holy, to go along with other larger system changes to compensate for the removal of &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Guardian of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt; from Holy, and merged its benefits into &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Favor%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Divine Favor (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. In order to follow through on our change to merge all types of Haste %, we removed the Spell Haste % from &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Seal of Insight&lt;/a&gt; to a Holy-only passive, so that it didn't also increase Protection's baseline Haste by 10%. Our changes to healer mana and mobility also indirectly increased the value of &lt;a href=\"Selfless%20Healer\"&gt;Selfless Healer&lt;/a&gt; by a large amount, so we brought it back down to be even in power with the other talents on its row. We also raised the range of &lt;a href=\"Denounce\"&gt;Denounce&lt;/a&gt; to be consistent with other spells. Lastly, we adjusted the critical strike chance of &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Shock\"&gt;Holy Shock&lt;/a&gt;, to increase the value of Critical Strike for Holy paladins.\nProtection changes.\nFor Protection, we tweaked &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Flame\"&gt;Eternal Flame&lt;/a&gt; in order to reduce its massive self-healing amount, and provide better balance between talents on that row. We also added a new passive, &lt;a href=\"Shining%20Protector\"&gt;Shining Protector&lt;/a&gt;, in order to give defensive value to the new &lt;a href=\"Multistrike\"&gt;Multistrike&lt;/a&gt; stat. Holy Wrath's damage and cooldown were also increased, and Sanctified Wrath changed to buff it further, in order to give Protection Paladins more burst threat and damage, while retaining its core damage-splitting identity.\nMiscellaneous changes.\nWe made a few additional changes to paladins. We revised the functionality of &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Righteous\"&gt;Hammer of the Righteous&lt;/a&gt; a bit, such that its performance is about the same, but its tooltip is much clearer. We also made &lt;a href=\"Execution%20Sentence\"&gt;Execution Sentence&lt;/a&gt; much more attractive to use as an emergency button. We also revised how &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Flame\"&gt;Eternal Flame&lt;/a&gt; interacts with Holy Power, and allowed it to once again trigger . One big change for Retribution that isn't mentioned here is the removal of &lt;a href=\"Inquisition%20%28paladin%20ability%29\"&gt;Inquisition (paladin ability)&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt;), which will have a notable effect on their rotation.\nPriest.\nPriests received several significant changes, mainly focused on reining in Discipline's damage absorption shields, improving quality of life for Discipline and Holy specializations, and solving single-target damage issues for Shadow.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For priests, pruning focused on removing redundant off-role abilities, trimming cooldowns, and removing niche abilities.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nPriests had quite a few bits of complication strewn throughout their spells which we polished out.\nLevel-90 talents and Atonement.\n&lt;a href=\"Atonement\"&gt;Atonement&lt;/a&gt; was the original damage-to-healing conversion ability, but grew out of control during \"Mists of Pandaria\". We decided to reduce its effectiveness, to bring it more in line with our goal of it being an option to trade significant healing for significant damage (ending up somewhere between a full healer and a full damage dealer). Another place where Discipline's absorbs were too strong was in their interaction with the level-90 talents, especially in large raids. Near the end of \"Mists of Pandaria\", we uncapped the AoE healing of that talent row; that has proven to be a mistake in Discipline's case, not just because it caused the level-90 talents themselves to heal for too much, but rather because the gigantic overhealing that that produced translated into gigantic &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Aegis\"&gt;Divine Aegis&lt;/a&gt; absorbs.\nHoly changes.\nFor Holy priests, our biggest concern is with the &lt;a href=\"Chakra\"&gt;Chakra&lt;/a&gt;s. We think that Chakras are the defining abilities of Holy priests, but that they haven't lived up to their potential. We decided to move more of their effectiveness from their raw throughput buff (which felt like a penalty for being in the wrong chakra, rather than a bonus for being in the right Chakra) into their bonus effects, and the Holy Word spells that they grant. Please note that all Priest healing spells have been retuned to account for the loss of throughput increases from Chakras. We also returned &lt;a href=\"Renew\"&gt;Renew&lt;/a&gt; to a normal 1.5-second global cooldown (GCD), so that Renew blanketing is still possible, but less ideal without Haste. Finally, the ability for Power Word: Shield to critically strike or Multistrike is now baseline for all Priest specializations instead of just Discipline so that it continues to be a viable choice for Holy at higher gear levels.\nShadow changes.\nShadow priests had one large problem toward the end of \"Mists of Pandaria\": single-target damage. Their AoE and multi-DoT damage was some of the best around, so they still ended up competitive on most fights. But, in any fight that was mostly single-target, they felt lacking. Additionally, one of the new stats we're adding in Warlords of Draenor, &lt;a href=\"Multistrike\"&gt;Multistrike&lt;/a&gt;, is almost exactly what their current Mastery, &lt;a href=\"Shadowy%20Recall\"&gt;Shadowy Recall&lt;/a&gt;, does for DoTs. So, we took these two problems and came up with a change that we think will solve both of them. The result is a new Mastery, which primarily increases single-target damage. Shadow priests who want to focus on single-target damage can aim for Mastery in their gearing; or, when multi-dotting is more valuable, prefer other secondary stats over Mastery. \nThe cooldown of &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Blast\"&gt;Mind Blast&lt;/a&gt; has also been adjusted to make Haste more valuable for Shadow, and removes Haste breakpoints.\nTalent revisions.\nSeveral talents were split into different versions by specialization. We revised the effectiveness of some of these talents to better balance talent choices on their row. We also swapped the Level-15 and Level-60 talent rows so players are presented with core Priest themed abilities earlier in the leveling process.\nTo get back to a balanced place, we've reapplied the &lt;a href=\"Area%20damage%20caps\"&gt;AoE caps&lt;/a&gt; to the level-90 Talents, making them consistent with all other AoE heals, and reduced their effectiveness across the board. We've compensated for this in the tuning of Priest baseline heals.\nMiscellaneous changes.\nFirst, there are a couple of quality-of-life changes for &lt;a href=\"Prayer%20of%20Mending\"&gt;Prayer of Mending&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Angelic%20Feather\"&gt;Angelic Feather&lt;/a&gt;. Next is a fix for a problem with &lt;a href=\"Void%20Tendrils\"&gt;Void Tendrils&lt;/a&gt;, where it lasts its full duration against creatures that had no way to attack it, such as in certain raid encounters (note that the health reduction is to keep it where it was in health, compared to player health doubling). We also removed the Mana generation from &lt;a href=\"Shadowfiend\"&gt;Shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt;, in order to simplify it to being a burst-damage-cooldown. And last but certainly not least, we're making Holy Nova an efficient AoE healing spell for Discipline priests.\nRogue.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For rogues, a couple of abilities were changed to be specialization specific where they were redundant, did some thinning on cooldowns.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nRogues received several mergers of passive abilities. There's also additional cooldown thinning with the change to Tricks of the Trade.\nCombo Points.\nThe biggest change for rogues is a fundamental change to how &lt;a href=\"Combo%20Point\"&gt;Combo Point&lt;/a&gt;s work. They're now shared across all enemies; you can swap targets and you won't lose your Combo Points.\nCombat changes.\n&lt;a href=\"Bandit%27s%20Guile\"&gt;Bandit's Guile&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting mechanic that is important to Combat gameplay, but wasn't working out quite as well as we think that it could. In particular, there's basically no way to adjust when you're going to be in &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Insight\"&gt;Deep Insight&lt;/a&gt;, other than stopping your rotation (and thus wasting energy, combo points, temporary effects, cooldown time, etc.). So, we're making an adjustment to &lt;a href=\"Revealing%20Strike\"&gt;Revealing Strike&lt;/a&gt; and Bandit's Guile. The intention here is that you can use Revealing Strike in place of &lt;a href=\"Sinister%20Strike\"&gt;Sinister Strike&lt;/a&gt; when you want to delay Deep Insight (such as to line it up with a specific upcoming fight mechanic), and have little lost damage besides the overall Deep Insight uptime. We don't expect this nuanced rotation adjustment to be used by all Combat rogues, but having a little more control over the pace of your rotation will be useful to some.\nAlso worth noting here is the removal of &lt;a href=\"Ambidexterity%20%28rogue%20ability%29\"&gt;Ambidexterity (rogue ability)&lt;/a&gt;. This was done to reduce the amount of damage coming from auto attacks for Combat Rogues. We've increased the damage of their active abilities to compensate and make them more rewarding.\nFinally, we changed Main Gauche to accentuate the importance of the off-hand weapon for Combat.\nArea-of-Effect attacks (Assassination, Combat).\nAmong some other changes to improve rogue AoE damage, we made a couple of baseline changes, and added a few &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20Perk\"&gt;Draenor Perk&lt;/a&gt;s that impacts their AoE.\nSubtlety changes.\n&lt;a href=\"Honor%20Among%20Thieves\"&gt;Honor Among Thieves&lt;/a&gt; is an extremely powerful ability, but has the downside that it adds significant disparity between character power while soloing and while in a group. We made this change to bring up the soloing Subtlety rogue, without having a significant impact on their performance while in a group. The passive ability Sinister Calling also received significant change to better balance scaling rates, the value of secondary stats, improve Multistrike for them, and add rotational depth.\nSubterfuge.\n&lt;a href=\"Subterfuge\"&gt;Subterfuge&lt;/a&gt; has proved too powerful, and frustrating to play against in PvP, so we decided to reduce its defensive capabilities, while preserving its offensive power. We changed the Subterfuge period to allow the use of &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; abilities without actually stealthing you, similar to &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dance\"&gt;Shadow Dance&lt;/a&gt;.\nShaman.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For shaman, we removed some niche abilities, and also split out a few abilities by specialization.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nShaman had a number of extra abilities that were consolidated to provide a smoother rotation flow. Mana regeneration and mana costs for Elemental and Enhancement were made compensate for abilities removed via Ability Pruning. The removal of Weapon Imbues was significant. There was always one right answer for each specialization, and so we made the appropriate Weapon Imbue passive to each spec, or tuned abilities around its removal.\nFinally, there's the removal of Rolling Thunder. In concept, this is a simple merger of Rolling Thunder into Fulmination, but also with some consolidation of its effects; the mana recovery component was removed along with other mana changes, and the random chance was removed while maximum stack size was increased to compensate. The randomness in Rolling Thunder became redundant, because there already was a source of randomness in Elemental Overload now that Multistrikes trigger it.\nElemental and Enhancement changes.\nFor Elemental and Enhancement, we had a few problems to solve. Enhancement suffers from having their damage split among so many damage sources that none of it feels impressive. We changed the damage of several abilities to try to reorganize their damage into fewer, more impactful abilities, while keeping the net total the same. For a long time Elemental shaman was one of the specializations most impacted by movement, at a time where other casters were increasingly able to cast while moving.\nIn \"Warlords of Draenor\", we're pulling back on the ability for many casters to deal damage while moving, and that includes Elemental. They will still have some ability to deal damage while moving, through Shocks, &lt;a href=\"Unleash%20Elements\"&gt;Unleash Elements&lt;/a&gt;, and instant &lt;a href=\"Lava%20Burst\"&gt;Lava Burst&lt;/a&gt;s. For &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Lightning\"&gt;Chain Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, we wanted to reduce the impact of Haste soft capping, and so changed &lt;a href=\"Shamanism%20%28Wrath%20Classic%29\"&gt;Shamanism (Wrath Classic)&lt;/a&gt; to increase damage instead of reduce cast time. Additionally, we simplified &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Shear\"&gt;Wind Shear&lt;/a&gt; by removing its impact on threat, which no longer matters.\nElemental Overload and Molten Earth.\nOne of the new secondary stats, &lt;a href=\"Multistrike\"&gt;Multistrike&lt;/a&gt;, functions very similarly to Elemental Overload. We wanted to keep Mastery and Multistrike feeling distinct, but also know how iconic and important Elemental Overload is for Elemental Shaman. So, we decided to merge the two together with Multistrike driving Elemental Overload, and give the Elemental specialization a new Mastery. For the new Mastery, we wanted to strengthen the Elemental Shaman's connection to earth energies, and added damage that continues while the Shaman is moving. The summary of all this is that if you liked Mastery before, favor Multistrike instead for the same effect. Or try out the new Mastery: Molten Earth. Chain Lightning and Earthquake were also improved significantly to offset the fact that Elemental Overload was a massive buff to it, but Molten Earth is not.\nRestoration changes.\nRestoration shaman had the most passive and smart healing of any healer, and so received some reductions in that area, along with buffs elsewhere to keep them competitive. \nMiscellaneous.\nWe also made a couple quality of life improvements to shaman Shield spells.\nWarlock.\nWarlocks received some polish but remain relatively unchanged. They saw the most change of any class in \"Mists of Pandaria\", and so were in need of less revision this time around.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For warlocks, that primarily focused on removing niche abilities.\nAbility consolidation and refinement.\nSoulburn had several extremely niche spell amplifications which were removed. We distinguished Hand of Gul'dan and Chaos Wave further by removing the snare from the former and improving the snare of the latter. Beyond that, there was a simple consolidation of some abilities.\nRaid utility.\nWe felt that warlocks brought too much unique raid utility, so decided to tone down &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Gateway\"&gt;Demonic Gateway&lt;/a&gt;. We moved healing potions and Healthstones into a cooldown of their own, and made them usable once per combat.\nAffliction changes.\nFor Affliction, we're happy with their rotation. But, &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Soul\"&gt;Drain Soul&lt;/a&gt; was causing them to be too strong in situations where they had a steady supply of small creatures to kill. We reduced the effectiveness of its on-kill effect in order to solve this. Additionally, Soul Swap was changed to cost 1 Soul Shard to push it into its intended role of being a more expensive but faster method of applying your periodic damage effects, and better balance it against Haunt.\nDemonology changes.\nWe were unsatisfied with Grimoire of Sacrifice for Demonology. Fundamentally, it did not fit Demonology's theme to sacrifice their pet, full time. We had toyed with ideas where it acted as a temporary cooldown for Demonology, but have decided to replace it with a new talent, which is more theme-appropriate, and fits well against the competition in that talent row. We also tweaked the design of Master Demonologist, in order to solve some edge cases, and simplify and clarify its effects.\nMovement abilities.\nWe've reduced the ability for ranged damage dealers to deal damage while moving in Warlords. Kil'jaeden's Cunning became a problematic talent because its mobility made warlocks much stronger compared to other casters. We redesigned how the ability works to be more powerful in bursts instead of always affecting only some spells.\nMiscellaneous.\nFinally, there are a couple of miscellaneous changes. For Drain Life, we reduced the base healing somewhat, but massively increased the effectiveness of the Glyph which increases its healing, so as to help open up more potential Drain Life use in ideal situations. And lastly, we simplified Shadowburn a bit.\nWarrior.\nAbility pruning.\nSee the &lt;a href=\"%23Ability%20pruning\"&gt;ability pruning&lt;/a&gt; section above for discussion of why we're pruning class abilities. For warriors, we focused on removing abilities that were redundant, and making some tweaks to their rotations.\nStance changes.\nWarriors have always had stances; they're very important to the feeling of being a warrior. In order to make stances more meaningful, and ease keybinds, we made stances have their own action bars, and re-added stance restrictions on abilities. However, we also made it so that you'll automatically be shifted into the appropriate stance if you try to use an ability that isn't usable in your current stance. One important difference between this and previous incarnations of warrior stances is that these abilities are rotational, not utility cooldowns. Stances are now more for different gameplay modes (dealing damage vs. tanking). There shouldn't be cases where you find yourself swapping stances, use an ability, and then immediately swapping back.\nArms changes.\nWe wanted to fix a few problems with Warriors. Prominently, we still weren't happy with Arms' rotation (and neither were many players), so we've made some more changes. The goal is to remove needless complexity while simultaneously adding more depth. As mentioned in the above section on Ability Pruning, Overpower and Heroic Strike have been removed for Arms warriors. \nIn addition, we weren't satisfied with the Mastery for Arms. The intended flavor for Arms is about hitting with few, big, and heavy weapon strikes. Strikes of Opportunity actually went opposite of that, adding frequent little hits. We've replaced Strikes of Opportunity with a new Mastery which accentuates their intended design.\nBurst damage cooldowns.\nAs with other classes, we wanted to reduce cooldown stacking. Cutting &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Banner\"&gt;Skull Banner&lt;/a&gt; did a ton to help that across the whole game. But for warriors specifically, we needed to make further changes, including merging some of the personal benefit of Skull Banner back into &lt;a href=\"Recklessness%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Recklessness (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;. Also, to make up for &lt;a href=\"Throw\"&gt;Throw&lt;/a&gt; being removed, we modified &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Throw\"&gt;Heroic Throw&lt;/a&gt; to be more frequently usable.\nHaste for warriors.\nHaste has long been a problematic stat for warriors, usually being of little value. As part of our commitment to ensuring all secondary stats are valuable (except Bonus Armor for non-tanks and Spirit for non-healers, of course), we're making a significant change to warriors, to ensure that Haste has strong, competitive value. We're giving all warriors a new passive, which lets haste affect their global cooldown, and the cooldowns of their very-short-cooldown rotational abilities.\nProtection changes.\nProtection warriors have received a few notable changes. First, we removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Protection warriors to value Haste and Critical Strike as important secondary stats. In order to achieve that, we made Riposte give defensive value to Critical Strike. The aforementioned &lt;a href=\"Headlong%20Rush\"&gt;Headlong Rush&lt;/a&gt; also helps for valuing Haste.\nTalent changes.\nA few warrior talents also were in need of revision. First, &lt;a href=\"Second%20Wind\"&gt;Second Wind&lt;/a&gt; was problematic; it was sometimes too weak, and sometimes too strong. We chose to change it from a passive health regeneration effect to the new &lt;a href=\"Leech\"&gt;Leech&lt;/a&gt; effect, so that low-health warriors have to maintain combat in order to benefit, instead of kiting, hiding, or otherwise playing defensively. Enraged Regeneration was changed to account for the removal of Enrage from Arms.\nThe level-45 talent row was removed for crowd-control disarmament reasons, and also wanted to allow you to choose more rotational complexity through talents. We replaced the row with new talents, many of which are specialization-specific, giving you a variety of playstyle choices for your warrior.\nFor the level-60 and level-90 talent rows, certain combinations were proving problematic. We decided that &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Bolt\"&gt;Storm Bolt&lt;/a&gt; would better compete with &lt;a href=\"Shockwave\"&gt;Shockwave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Roar\"&gt;Dragon Roar&lt;/a&gt;, and that &lt;a href=\"Bladestorm\"&gt;Bladestorm&lt;/a&gt; would better compete with &lt;a href=\"Avatar\"&gt;Avatar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodbath\"&gt;Bloodbath&lt;/a&gt;, so swapped Storm Bolt and Bladestorm's positions. We also adjusted the effects of a few talents in order to make them more competitive with the talents on their row.\nFury changes.\nTo better separate the playstyles between Fury and Arms warriors, we've made several significant changes to Fury warriors and make them a better fit for the specialization's theme: a relentless, bloodthirsty berserker. In particular, Colossus Smash and Heroic Strike was removed, since those abilities resulted in gameplay that was the complete opposite of that intended style. Wild Strike was modified to fill the role of a quick excess Rage dump. We also felt that auto attack damage had become too high and moved some of that damage into Execute. Execute has been changed to now deal damage based on Weapon Damage instead of just Attack Power. Finally, we've updated some to spell alerts to improve usability.\nEnrage and Deep Wounds.\nWe also expanded &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28warrior%20ability%29\"&gt;Enrage (warrior ability)&lt;/a&gt; to affect all damage, not just Physical damage, and increased its duration slightly so that it can cover burst windows like Colossus Smash adequately. We're also making a change to the design of &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Wounds\"&gt;Deep Wounds&lt;/a&gt;, to try to limit is effectiveness in PvP, without hurting its effectiveness in PvE. \nAdditional changes.\nWorld environment.\nCreatures\nIsle of Thunder\nQuests.\nLegendary Cloak Quest Line\nRaids, Dungeons, and Scenarios.\nValor and Justice Point Removal\nPersonal Loot for Raids\nSiege of Orgrimmar\nLegacy raid changes\nDungeons\nChallenge Mode\nProving Grounds\nPvP.\nBattlegrounds and Arenas.\nBattlegrounds\nArenas"}

Not every talent needs to be useful in every situation; and in fact it's often better if they have strengths and weaknesses. But we do try to have each talent be useful in some situations, and make them close enough in value that if you really enjoy the gameplay of a talent you don't feel like you're dragging your group down by using it.\nFor these changes we focused primarily on tuning (tweaking numbers), and nearly all changes are buffs to underperforming talents. The goal is to reach more variety of viable builds, without bringing down the existing popular choices.\nHealer damage.\nDeveloper Commentary: Another change being made for Patch 6.1 is to bring the damage potential of healers up to a level that is sufficient and balanced.

Its release date was announced on March 23, 2017 during a Live Developer Q&amp;A with Senior Game Designer &lt;a href=\"Ryan%20Shwayder\"&gt;Ryan Shwayder&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"Last patch notes update: 2017-03-27\"\nNew Features.\nThe Broken Shore.\nReturn to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and take the fight to the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s power on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Begin your journey in a new Scenario, and then lead the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; against the demonic invasion of Azeroth.\nThe dynamic ebb and flow of Broken Shore will keep you on your toes as new &lt;a href=\"World%20Quest\"&gt;World Quest&lt;/a&gt;s, bosses, treasures, and a powerful demon command ship called the &lt;a href=\"Sentinax\"&gt;Sentinax&lt;/a&gt; make for an exciting new experience every day.\nJoin a region-wide, cross-faction effort to construct buildings that open new content and provide a variety of benefits to help in the fight against the Legion.\nNew Dungeon: The Cathedral of Eternal Night.\nThe upper chambers of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; were once a place of worship to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Legion's invasion, &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; minions have desecrated this holy place, twisting it into their own image. Now, this site will host a battle that could turn the tide of the invasion. While the Armies of Legionfall engage the fel army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the cathedral in a desperate hope to return the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to its resting place. Inside this new dungeon, you'll face:\nThis new dungeon is available in Heroic, Mythic, and Mythic Keystone difficulties.\nClass Campaigns.\nAfter securing a foothold on the Broken Shore and making progress with the Armies of Legionfall, every class continues its own campaign to unify in the war effort. Your &lt;a href=\"Class%20Hall\"&gt;Class Hall&lt;/a&gt; will be the base from which you will embark on a new quest chain, find a new potential Follower, and discover new class-specific World Quests.\nOnce your class campaign and the Legionfall campaign on the Broken Shore are complete, all new epic class mounts will become available to those who finish the subsequent class mount quests.\n&lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Demon Assaults&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Legion is preparing to assault Azeroth with renewed determination. After you regain a foothold on the Broken Shore, don't be surprised if &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; zones later come under attack. It will be up to you to fight to drive the Legion back and defend the lands of your new allies.\nFlying in the Broken Isles.\nTake your final steps to complete the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles%20Pathfinder%2C%20Part%20Two\"&gt;Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two&lt;/a&gt; achievement to unlock flying in the Broken Isles.\nLegion Reputation Progress.\n&lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; earned beyond will now contribute towards earning additional rewards from Broken Isles faction emissaries. These new reward caches have a rare chance to reward new faction mounts, such as the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Elderhorn\"&gt;Highmountain Elderhorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Dreamrunner%20%28item%29\"&gt;Wild Dreamrunner (item)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Leywoven%20Flying%20Carpet\"&gt;Leywoven Flying Carpet&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"PvP%20Brawl\"&gt;PvP Brawl&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA series of new twists on popular player-versus-player activities are on the way. Starting with \"&lt;a href=\"Southshore%20vs%20Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Southshore vs Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Gravity%20Lapse\"&gt;Gravity Lapse&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Scramble\"&gt;Warsong Scramble&lt;/a&gt;\", PvP Brawls offer a variety of mode, rules, and scenic changes to the usual &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battleground&lt;/a&gt; gameplay. Look for the Brawl option in the &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt; (default hotkey: i) Player vs. Player tab, under the Casual selection.\nPet Battle Dungeon.\nSomething nefarious is going on in the world of &lt;a href=\"pet%20battle\"&gt;pet battle&lt;/a&gt;s, and it's worth a closer look. If you have at least one level 25 battle pet, speak to &lt;a href=\"Breanni\"&gt;Breanni&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to get directions to this &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Critters\"&gt;new scenario&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpdated Features.\nCharacter Empowerment.\nYour bond with your &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;Artifact&lt;/a&gt; has grown stronger, and your &lt;a href=\"Artifact%20Knowledge\"&gt;Artifact Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; has continued to increase. Upon reaching Artifact Knowledge 25, you will receive the quest \"&lt;a href=\"Seeking%20Lost%20Knowledge\"&gt;Seeking Lost Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;\", which allows you to unlock further knowledge levels. Additionally, once you have 35 or more traits in your Artifact, the time has come to improve your Artifact even more. Unlock a set of new empowered traits, additional ranks for many of your original traits, and a new final trait by embarking on a new questline.\nYour weapon isn't the only thing increasing in power. From dungeon drops to World Quest rewards to items created with your professions, your armor upgrades at higher item levels than before. All the better to fight the Legion!\nTransmogrification Sets.\nA new 'Sets' tab in the &lt;a href=\"Appearances\"&gt;Appearances&lt;/a&gt; UI is where you'll find this new way of tracking item sets from previous &lt;a href=\"Raid\"&gt;Raid&lt;/a&gt;s, PvP Seasons, and more.\nClass Combat Updates.\nThe launch of \"\" included many updates to class animations, sounds, and spell effects. These improvements continue in Patch 7.2 with updates to Hunters, Death Knights, and Balance Druids.\nTab Targeting.\nTab targeting has been updated to feel more consistent. While in combat, you will no longer be able to accidentally tab to a target that is out of combat with you, unless you are looking to a new target and your hostile enemies are behind you. Furthermore, you're no longer able to tab to a target that neither your character nor your camera can see.\nChanges.\nClass Halls.\nArtifact Researchers now have explanatory dialogue options when you have completed all Work Orders they offer.

For the first time in a raid, your character will transform into the opposite faction (including their associated racial abilities).\nA dozen new, formidable boss encounters, including &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; himself, await you!\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth%20Season%202\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth Season 2&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth the adventures and the war being waged across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; are signified by seasons: times at which many factors and measurements change. Today begins Season 2 of Battle for Azeroth, and you'll find many new challenges and new rewards are now available in Dungeons and PvP content.\nA new season of rewards from dungeons has begun. Complete your best Mythic Keystone each week to earn higher item-level gear, and save up your Titan Residuum to purchase new, powerful Azerite items.\nBattle for Azeroth PvP Season 2 is now underway. Ranks and ratings have been reset, and you can now begin earning new rewards.\nNew epic Azerite gear is now available from Season 2 PvP, the Battle of Dazar'alor raid, World Quest Emissaries, and from the Mythic Keystone vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen in Zuldazar and Boralus. These new items will have a fifth ring with additional new trait options, starting at Heart of Azeroth level 15.\nThe new ring of traits provides two choices of traits per specialization, allowing players the opportunity to find items that have traits they particularly want and the freedom to create new and interesting combinations that may not have been possible before.\nFurther changes to items and rewards include:\nDecember 10, 2018.\n\"The war raging across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; has intensified.
