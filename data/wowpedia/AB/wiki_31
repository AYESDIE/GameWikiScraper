Known by his people as the Prophet, he has been granted the gift of the &lt;a href=\"Sight\"&gt;Sight&lt;/a&gt;, and \u2014 aided by the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 rejected offers of dark power from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and has guided his people as they fled from, and later fought against, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and their former &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; brethren. He is first among the draenei and is the arch-nemesis (formerly best friend) of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the draenei's flight to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they made a new home on the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt; and, sensing great courage in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Velen and his followers pledged themselves to this noble faction. The strengthened Alliance then helped the draenei reclaim their former holdings from the Legion. Most recently, Velen used the heart of the naaru &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; to sanctify the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' tainted &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, transforming the sacred fount into a source of &lt;a href=\"holy\"&gt;holy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; energies. He also managed with the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; to bring the void god &lt;a href=\"Saraka%20the%20Lighteater\"&gt;Saraka the Lighteater&lt;/a&gt; back to the Light as the naaru &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough the Legion's forces in Outland have been greatly diminished and the demonic invasion of Azeroth has been driven back, Velen remains fearful of an upcoming war between light and shadow. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Velen led the defense of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" from a Legion attack led by his own son &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;. After the deaths of both &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; and Rakeesh, Velen declared that he was neither prophet nor pawn, and that the draenei were returning home to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Following the defeat of Argus' &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;corrupted world-soul&lt;/a&gt; and the containment of Sargeras, apparently ending the Legion and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forever, Velen returned to Azeroth with his reunited people, offering his counsel to King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance in the conflicts to come, and noting that perhaps it was time for each one of them to forge their own fate.\nBiography.\nArgus.\nTwenty-five thousand years ago, the world of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; was shaped into a paradise by the &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; race who called it home. Velen, who is known and respected for his immense wisdom, compassion and magical prowess, rose as a leader of Argus alongside &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, forming the &lt;a href=\"Second%20Duumvirate\"&gt;Second Duumvirate&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring Velen's time, a strange curse which addled its victims' minds and diminished their memories began to spread across Argus. Most of the eredar, terrified of the prospect of losing their precious knowledge, argued that quarantining or even banishing the afflicted was the best course of action to prevent the curse from spreading. Velen, however, refused to abandon his people. Using &lt;a href=\"T%27uure%2C%20Beacon%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;T'uure&lt;/a&gt;, an artifact which had fallen from the sky some time prior and which was in fact the shard of a deceased &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, Velen walked among the afflicted at great risk to himself, calling upon the artifact's powers to cure all of the diseased eredar.\nVelen, Kil'jaeden and the eredar rulers' inner circle later bore witness to a grand demonstration held by the &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thal%27kiel\"&gt;Thal'kiel&lt;/a&gt;, who led an order of &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Wakeners\"&gt;Wakeners&lt;/a&gt;. First, Thal'kiel summoned orderly rows of the old, familiar &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; constructs he and his followers were known for, but then he summoned a storm of &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt; meteors to destroy the constructs as a symbolic display of the \"new era\" he foresaw for his people thanks to the arts of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic summoning he had recently discovered. However, when he looked upon his colleagues' faces, Thal'kiel didn't see the approval he expected. Kil'jaeden's expression was remote and inscrutable, but Velen harshly condemned Thal'kiel's actions and forbade him from ever conjuring demons again, denouncing his \"new era\" as a failed experiment. Some time later, Thal'kiel resumed his experiments regardless, using cloaking magic to hide a demonic army he and his Wakeners were constructing with the purpose of installing him as dictator of Argus. The night before the planned coup, however, Thal'kiel's ambitious young apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, informed Velen and Kil'jaeden of his master's plans. To prove his loyalty to Argus' rulers, Archimonde himself led the attack on the Wakeners' secret training grounds and decapitated his former master with his own blade. Later, he would rise to rule the eredar alongside Velen and Kil'jaeden.\nVelen formed a deep friendship and affection with both Kil'jaeden and Archimonde. He even saw both of them as \"extensions of his soul\", so deep was their friendship. Velen and Kil'jaeden were particularly close, loving and respecting each other as brothers, as they had ruled Argus together long before Archimonde joined them. However, this peaceful state did not last forever.\nWhen Velen's &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; was born, Velen had a vision of himself holding a &lt;a href=\"Man%27ari\"&gt;fel-corrupted&lt;/a&gt; eredar as he died, but he did not understand it.\nExile.\nOne day, the peace of the eredar was shattered. &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Destroyer of Worlds, had noticed their achievements. Instead of destroying Argus, Sargeras appeared before the three leaders in the form of a benevolent entity, offering to transform them into an even more powerful race of beings, with the goal of unifying all the races of the universe. In return, the eredar would serve him as his perfect spellcasters, spreading his universal union with every world they touched. Two of the eredar's triumvirate of leaders, Archimonde and Kil'jaeden, along with two-thirds of the eredar population, took the offer. Only one eredar leader realized the true horror of Sargeras' &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;: Velen.\nVelen, unlike Archimonde and Kil'jaeden, had the gift of \"Sight\", and was granted a vision by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"K%27ure\"&gt;K'ure&lt;/a&gt; of the truth of Sargeras' plot. The utopia that Sargeras had promised was a lie, much to Velen's horror. He at first saw himself at the head of a vast eredar force of the Light, spreading the gifts of their race to worlds beyond count, as Sargeras had said; the next moment, he saw the truth. Sargeras had no intention of unification. His vision was one of death, of razing entire worlds to bare rock and ashes. And the eredar were not to be the bringers of enlightenment with their new powers; they would be &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt;, twisted, malevolent shadows of their former selves devoted to the destruction of worlds for the glory of Sargeras' terrible &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Horrified, Velen desperately prayed for guidance. K'ure appeared before him, reassured Velen that his plight had been heard, and instructed him to gather up his followers and go to the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%27s%20End\"&gt;highest mountain on Argus&lt;/a&gt;, during the longest day of the year. \nVelen asked his friend &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; to gather his &lt;a href=\"Nuuri\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and son, but Talgath was on Kil'jaeden's side and delivered them to him instead. Talgath led a squad of man'ari eredar to pursue Velen's refugees, but they were held off by &lt;a href=\"Hatuun\"&gt;Hatuun&lt;/a&gt; who stayed behind. Velen and his followers barely escaped the newly created &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. From then on, Kil'jaeden vowed to hunt down Velen and his followers and slaughter them, even if it took a thousand years. As Argus grew smaller and smaller in the distance Velen begged the naaru to go back, but they told him that was not his path. Kil'jaeden would eventually take Velen's son under his wing and raise him as an agent of the Burning Legion named Rakeesh, meaning \"butcher\" in &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt;, letting Velen believe that the boy had been killed. During this time, despair gripped the renegades, and many even considered giving up, but Velen brought T'uure to bear and renewed his people's confidence and hope. \nThe Legion chased the exiles, or \"&lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;\" (\"Exiled Ones\") as they had come to be known, across the universe for thousands of years. Each time Kil'jaeden approached, the naaru granted new powers to Velen to preserve his race, though he eventually gifted T'uure to a promising young student named &lt;a href=\"Askara\"&gt;Askara&lt;/a&gt;. After millennia of flight, Velen and his people were finally able to evade the Legion settled on a world they named &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nRise of the Horde.\nVelen and the draenei were taken from Argus via the crystal-ship, the Genedar, that became known by the orcs as &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 \"Mountain of Spirits\". After crash landing, Velen and his followers buried almost-dead naaru &lt;a href=\"D%27ore\"&gt;D'ore&lt;/a&gt; into a place that would be known as &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs they settled onto their new homeworld, the draenei came into contact with the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish clans, and began to trade with them; the relations with the orcs were cordial but aloof and businesslike. While the draenei established themselves and built the city of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; as their capital, Velen set up his own private refuge at the Temple of Karabor, on the eastern edge of the lands of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon Clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile he was visiting the &lt;a href=\"town\"&gt;town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;, Velen met two orcs who would later shape the destiny of the Horde \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the chieftainship of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, and the future Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;; Telmor's captain of the guard, Velen's friend &lt;a href=\"Restalaan\"&gt;Restalaan&lt;/a&gt;, had rescued them from an ogre attack. Their dinner discussions spoke much of the orcish heritage and of the &lt;a href=\"prophecy\"&gt;prophecy&lt;/a&gt; relating to the Doomhammer, which Orgrim would receive upon the death of his father \u2014 the prophecy of how, after bringing salvation then doom in the hands of the last of the Doomhammer line, it would pass into the hands of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;one of non-Blackrock lineage&lt;/a&gt;, who would wield it and lead the orcs to salvation.\nOver the eons after their escape from Argus, Kil'jaeden continued his search for Velen and his followers but was frustrated when he found only traces of where they had been. His agents had managed to locate Draenor, and reported back to him both the conditions the draenei lived in and the people that lived on their world. Realizing that he had found the tool of vengeance, Kil'jaeden appeared to the elder shaman &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and informed him that the draenei were plotting against them.\nOver a short span of time, the draenei came under increasing attack by the orcs, convinced that the draenei were their enemies. Concerned, Velen sent a courier to Ner'zhul, asking for a reason behind the attacks, and requesting a meeting in the shadow of Oshu'gun. The orcs, however, had killed the courier, and Ner'zhul did not wish to attend the meeting himself. Instead, he sent for Durotan, who captured Velen and his entourage. Velen tried to explain the true purpose of Oshu'gun to the Frostwolves but Durotan and his chief shaman, &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, grew angered by what they perceived as &lt;a href=\"Blasphemy\"&gt;blasphemy&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, and despite the orders from Ner'zhul, Durotan released Velen and his fellows, taking their ata'mal crystals instead.\nOver time, attacks against the draenei became increasingly violent. The newly-established &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, now directed by Ner'zhul's apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; - who had become Kil'jaeden's pupil in the art of the warlock - began to assault and destroy draenei settlements to appease their new master. Durotan led the assault on Telmor, utilizing one of the captured crystals to allow him to lower the draenei's defensive cover. Velen's refuge at the Temple of Karabor was also attacked and defiled by Gul'dan and his new warlocks, who renamed it the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and set it up as the headquarters of their &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnbroken.\nAfter the attacks increased \u2014 including the final assault that destroyed the city of Shattrath \u2014 Velen and some of his followers went into hiding in the marshes along the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20Sea\"&gt;Zangar Sea&lt;/a&gt;, establishing &lt;a href=\"Telredor\"&gt;Telredor&lt;/a&gt;, and were never found by either the orcs or Kil'jaeden's minions. Velen remained in contact with neighboring draenei's camps. \nVelen was granted a vision in which he saw the Broken: formerly healthy draenei who had de-evolved during the orcs' murderous crusade to wipe out the draenei race. According to Velen's vision, the Broken would rise to power once again and aid their displaced brethren. Velen's vision was given substance in the form of &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, a one-time draenei &lt;a href=\"vindicator\"&gt;vindicator&lt;/a&gt; who had regressed while the orcs decimated his race and tore the planet apart. Like his fellow Broken, Nobundo had lost contact with the Light, and so he ventured far into the deserts of Outland to meditate and pray for guidance. After decades of silence, an unfamiliar voice finally answered his prayers. It was not the Light that whispered to him, but the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;Wind&lt;/a&gt;. The breeze spoke to him of lost truths, of the might of the elements\u2014of the delicate balance of power embraced by the shaman. Nobundo listened eagerly and learned all he could. When he judged the time was right, he departed the desert determined to use this knowledge to help the draenei race. However, most draenei refugees greeted the sight of a Broken with skepticism and outright prejudice. Only one of the healthy draenei did not shun the Broken: the wise and perceptive Velen.\nNobundo visited Telredor but hesitated to speak with draenei about shamanism. He even wanted to leave, but thanks to the wise words of Velen, he remained and introduced shamanism to draenei. Velen had heard the philosophy of the shaman before, but Nobundo revealed new truths. The elements were timeless; they stretched across the cosmos to inhabit every world they touched. With the proper training, the draenei might learn to wield this overlooked, seemingly inexhaustible source of power.\nVelen rejoiced to realize that his vision was coming to pass.\nEscape from Outland.\nVelen and his remaining followers remained hidden over the decades that passed since the draenei were massacred by the demonically-possessed Horde. During that period, great changes occurred in Draenor: The &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was opened, and the orcs invaded - but after years of warfare, they were finally defeated. When Ner'zhul, in a desperate attempt to escape Kil'Jaeden's wrath, tried to open portals to other worlds for the Horde to conquer, the incredible energies tore Draenor apart. In order to prevent this catastrophe from affecting their world, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; under the command of the archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; sealed the Dark Portal, cutting off both the orcs already in Azeroth and those they were battling on the fields of Hellfire Peninsula.\nOver a decade passed before anyone traveled through portals to Draenor\u2014now known as Outland. The half-demon night elf &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by his &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; allies, sought refuge from Kil'jaeden after Illidan failed to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the imprisoned spirit of Ner'zhul who controlled the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; back in Azeroth. As the blood elves, under the command of Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, took up residence in the naaru interdimensional fortress of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Velen decided it was time to gather what remained of his people and find a new place to take refuge once more.\nAided by the Broken &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, who introduced shamanism to the draenei, Velen personally led a raid to capture the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, one of Tempest Keep's satellite structures, and attempted to use it in order to escape Outland. The blood elves, realizing the draenei's intentions, sabotaged the transdimensional \"engine\" of the Exodar. As the draenei attempted to travel the dimensional planes, the reactor malfunctioned, hurtling the Exodar and its crew across the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; until one month ago, where it appeared\u2014coincidentally\u2014in the world of Azeroth. The damaged Exodar screamed across the skies of northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, pods ejecting and spreading across &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;a small island chain&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, before crashing on the west coast of what is now called &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the dust settled and the draenei began to establish themselves in settlements built from the wreckage of the Exodar, Velen and his people set themselves to exploring their new homeworld. Inspired by tales of the heroic Alliance that &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;stood&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;against&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;might of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Draenei have come to enlist their aid in their continued resistance to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe time for the draenei shaman to test themselves draws near, for the battle against the Burning Legion is once again at hand. And the fate not only of Azeroth, but of all worlds, hangs in the balance.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nHaving survived the crash, Velen continued to lead the draenei people from the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Lights\"&gt;Vault of Lights&lt;/a&gt;, deep inside the largest intact portion of the crashed \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", which served as the draenei capital in Azeroth. Velen and the draenei developed a friendship with the noble &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, something he had more or less foreseen in a prophecy.\nTogether, they uncovered a conspiracy involving the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, and their traitorous agents, &lt;a href=\"Engineer%20%22Spark%22%20Overgrind\"&gt;Engineer \"Spark\" Overgrind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sironas\"&gt;Sironas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s later reported to Velen that the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s were using &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Gate\"&gt;Sun Gate&lt;/a&gt;s, portals to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, to summon reinforcements and prime &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; for a blood elven invasion, and that a traitor was among the draenei. Velen created a battle plan and ordered &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt; to organize the military campaign in order to end the blood elven menace once and for all. Velen later oversaw the trial of &lt;a href=\"Matis%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Matis the Cruel&lt;/a&gt; and sentenced him to execution. Velen was one of the many to congratulate the Alliance adventurer for repelling the blood elven invasion and defeating the &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; traitor &lt;a href=\"Sironas\"&gt;Sironas&lt;/a&gt;. Velen also revealed that the draenei adventurer's destiny lay in Outland and urged them to let any Outland draenei know of their new home.\nAfterward, Prophet Velen and his noble refugees played a key role in urging the Alliance to &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and disrupt the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s nefarious activities. Armed with their unshakable faith in the Light, the draenei ventured to their embattled former home as steadfast members of the Alliance and defeated their ancient demonic rivals.\nThe prophecy of the Sunwell.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"A%27dal\"&gt;A'dal&lt;/a&gt;, Velen made the following prophecy:\nThe first line refers to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and its destruction by the Scourge; the second to the blood elves' reverence of Prince Kael'thas, and his \"gift\" of the naaru &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; to give power to the Blood Knight order; the third refers to the Blood Knights' discovery of Kael'thas' treachery (Kael'thas and his fel elves capture M'uru and take him to the Sunwell), and the fourth refers to &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, the Blood Knight leader, who renounces her ties to Kael'thas and swears her allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe fall of the Deceiver.\nFollowing the defeat of Kil'jaeden in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, Velen will arrive to congratulate the players, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;. Following the banishment of Kil'jaeden, Velen recovered the spark left after the defeat of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; and used it to recharge the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; with holy energies, directly saving the blood elf race from magical withdrawal despite the amount of wrongs the blood elf people have committed against him and his people.\nWar against the Lich King.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke, he sent his Scourge into all corners of Azeroth. To defeat the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and necropolises, members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Shattrath and created an artifact of the Naaru's Light. Adventurers of the Alliance delivered it to Velen for defense.\nVelen was present at the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;meeting during the Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, discussing the earthquakes, stating that he could feel them in the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and, having experienced similar tremors before, suggesting that perhaps fleeing their planet was the best option.\nCataclysm.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; was petrified, Velen sent Nobundo to represent the draenei at &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s memorial.\nThe Prophet has largely remained in seclusion, focusing his energies on nothing save the coming battle between Light and Darkness. However, during &lt;a href=\"Remember%20the%20Light\"&gt;Remember the Light&lt;/a&gt;, Velen comes in person to the &lt;a href=\"Harborage\"&gt;Harborage&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, to aid the desperate &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%20Avuun\"&gt;Anchorite Avuun&lt;/a&gt; in his tending to the mortally-injured &lt;a href=\"Magtoor\"&gt;Magtoor&lt;/a&gt;. Velen channels \"Extreme Unction\" (another term for \"last rites\") on the dying Broken, allowing him to be raised up by the Light.\nWolfheart.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Velen traveled to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the other leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Surprisingly, he had not been invited. Tyrande mentioned that they had assumed the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; as a whole had declared themselves neutral after defeating &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Velen dismissed the assumption and declared the draenei's allegiance to helping the Alliance, stating that they would remain on Azeroth for so long as they were needed. Nevertheless, he was treated as an honored guest. Even &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; wished to seek his opinion about the troubling matters of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; murders.\nWhen King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; finally arrived at the summit with his son and started his disparagement of &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, Velen was seen to have taken a sudden interest in &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;. It was after the verbal brawl between the two kings, that Tyrande and Malfurion noticed Velen talking with Anduin about the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;, but were interrupted when the prince's personal guards came to retrieve him. Later, while the Prophet was meditating in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20Gardens\"&gt;Temple Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin approached him again and resumed their talk about the Light.\nAfter overhearing the argument between Malfurion and Varian, Anduin informed his father about his decision to leave and train with Velen. When the young prince reassured Velen of his choice, the Prophet offered to take Anduin under his wing for a time and noted that he has a great destiny ahead of him within the Light.\nProphet's Lesson.\nAfter taking Anduin under this tutelage, Velen sought to find the path that would lead to victory over the Burning Legion, losing himself in his visions and refusing to see anyone aside from the human prince. When human refugees from the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; made their way to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; and camped out in front of the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin questioned why he never warned anyone else about &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. In answer, Velen showed him a vision of a world destroyed by the Burning Legion, and explained that despite the devastation wrought by Deathwing, finding a way to defeat the Burning Legion was of even greater importance. After Anduin left, though, Velen thought about the young prince's question and wondered why the Light, which guided him through visions both true and false, had not directed him toward the Cataclysm.\nLater, Anduin tried to get Velen to see what was happening outside the Exodar. The refugees were unhappy and demanded to see the Prophet; he was needed in the here and now. When Velen turned to face Anduin, he had a sudden vision of a hero in gleaming armor, leading not just the Horde and Alliance, but the dragons and naaru as well in a battle against a vast and all-consuming shadow. When the refugees started a riot, leading to a fight with the draenei guards, Anduin rushed to Velen, begging him to stop the needless slaughter. Anduin asked what the war against the Legion meant for those fighting outside, and reminded him that every life is a universe to be protected. Wondering how he had become so lost that he must be taught by a mortal child, Velen went outside and, in a booming voice, berated both the refugees and his fellow draenei for what had occurred, walking out onto the blood-soaked ground to help heal the fallen. Realizing that he had become so focused on the future that he had lost sight of the present, he resolved that the draenei would go out into Azeroth and help heal the world.\nTides of War.\nAfter Deathwing's defeat, Velen still kept Anduin under his tutelage, teaching him something new almost every single day.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;When Theramore was in danger of being invaded by the Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; asked Velen for help.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAt some point after the Alliance and Horde's landing in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Prince Anduin Wrynn was heavily wounded, with his bones broken after a confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. He was carried to safety at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; and is under emergency care. King Varian, while tending to his son, summoned Velen to Lion's Landing to help his son. However, in 5.2 Anduin states that he was healed by Pandaren Mistweavers. Velen apparently did the initial healing, while the monks did the rest. Velen told him that the pain would not go away and might increase with age.\nWith Garrosh's attack against Anduin and his possession of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the Prophet suspected that the warchief's leadership would end in disaster, not only for the Alliance but for all of Azeroth as well.\nThe Untamed Valley.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, Velen traveled to northern &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, presumably in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. He wanted to have good relationships \"with all on Pandaria\" and learn new knowledge.\nWar Crimes.\nVelen, alongside the other Alliance leaders, received a letter from &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen&lt;/a&gt; inviting them to the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, where Anduin joined him. He was the first witness of &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt;, retelling the tragic events of Durotan's visit to &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;, including Durotan killing his old friend &lt;a href=\"Restalaan\"&gt;Restalaan&lt;/a&gt;. When asked by &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; how he felt about orcs today, Velen replied that he was glad that the orcs overcame their previous ordeal and liberated themselves from Mannoroth. He also stated that he believed people could change, but when Baine directly asked Velen whether he felt Garrosh could change, as the orcs before him had, Tyrande interrupted Baine, accusing him of steering the witness, and &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; agreed, telling Baine that he was not to ask Velen to speculate.\nLegion.\nVelen attends the funeral of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who he considered a good friend. He argues with Jaina about fighting the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, saying that quarreling between the Alliance leaders is exactly what the Burning Legion wants and that his people have learned the price of trying to face the Legion while divided. Velen believes that now is the time that they need to join the Horde's strength to their own.\nIt was revealed that Velen has been working with &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; against those who would harm &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. After Faol decides to send a priest adventurer to claim &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;a weapon of great power&lt;/a&gt;, he joins Faol in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in order to travel to &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;. There the assembled priests combine their powers and the adventurer uses their artifact to reverse &lt;a href=\"Saraka%20the%20Lighteater\"&gt;Saraka the Lighteater&lt;/a&gt; back into &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;.\nVelen is present during &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;'s attack on Netherlight Temple and the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt; of the long-prophesied Army of the Light.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s guidance, an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; comes to deliver a mysterious lightbound object to Velen, but at that same time, the Legion begins an invasion of the Exodar, led by the eredar &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt;. After the adventurer helps to save draenei citizens and fight off demonic invaders, Velen reveals that the object is known as &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, the sentience core of the naaru prime: &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt;. Locked away within the core is wisdom crucial to the battle against the Legion, and only naaru born of Xe'ra can unlock it. &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt; is the last of this line, and the true purpose of the Legion's invasion of the Exodar was to destroy O'ros before the core could be unlocked. However, Rakeesh beats Velen and the adventurer to O'ros, destroying the naaru. They are joined by two of the adventurer's champions in the battle against the eredar general, and are successful in driving him to the brink of defeat, at which point he activates a self-destruct in his Fel Annihilator, threatening to destroy the entire Exodar and everyone inside it. However, as the heroes battle to defeat the eredar in time, Velen has a sudden realization, and without explanation demands that the heroes stop attacking Rakeesh. When the heroes refuse, Velen even turns against the adventurer, attempting to stop them by force, but ultimately Rakeesh is defeated.\nTo the surprise of the heroes, Velen kneels down and cradles the head of the eredar to his chest as he dies. Velen reveals that before the coming of the Legion he had a son, and when his son was born a vision had come to him of this day, in which he wept as he held a dying eredar in his arms; only now did he realize that Rakeesh was, in fact, his son, another example of Kil'jaeden's \"creative\" punishments. Velen is stricken by the death of his son, and tells the adventurer to return the Light's Heart to Khadgar and tell him \"the Light died here this day.\" As the adventurer prepares to leave, Velen speaks to the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Chosen\"&gt;Light's Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, renouncing the title of Prophet and declaring that he is no longer either prophet or pawn. After checking that &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Romuul&lt;/a&gt; survived the attack, Velen orders him to begin repairs on the &lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;vessel&lt;/a&gt;, telling the Chosen that the draenei are going &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Velen can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nLegionfall.\nVelen and champions of the order halls traveled to &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; spoke about using the Pillars of Creation to close the portal at the Tomb of Sargeras. However, Velen reminded all assembled that Gul'dan was merely a pawn and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; was still out there. Kil'jaeden, watching this all from his ship in orbit above &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, sent &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;s to assault Dalaran. While Khadgar looked worried as cries of alarm were heard around them, Velen did not look particularly surprised in light of his warning.\nVelen joins in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;second battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where he identifies &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; and tells &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to stop arguing. Afterward, he tells Illidan to enter the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt; and secure the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; while he and Khadgar enter the Tomb of Sargeras itself. Maiev insists on going with Illidan, saying that Velen trusts him too easily. Velen and Khadgar's initial assault on the tomb was a failure, and Khadgar informed the team inside the Cathedral of Eternal Night of this just before they activated the Aegis.\nAfter the heart of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt; is stolen from the vaults of Dalaran, Velen observes the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; and receives a vision of Kruul regenerating within the Nether, his heart hastening the process. He sends &lt;a href=\"Kor%27vas%20Bloodthorn\"&gt;Kor'vas Bloodthorn&lt;/a&gt; and an adventurer to the &lt;a href=\"Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, where they pry open a doorway to Kruul's realm. Later, the adventurer, Kor'vas, and Velen confronted Kruul inside the Twisting Nether. Before he could die Kruul overloaded himself with power to self-destruct and kill his opponents along with him, but Velen saved Kor'vas and the adventurer.\nSince an Alliance hero found King Varian's lost compass on the Broken Shore and returned it to the newly-crowned King Anduin, Anduin has not been eating or sleeping. Velen and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; attempt to console Anduin, but to no avail. When he leaves for the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; to pray, the two of them call on the hero to try and break Anduin out of his melancholy. Later, Velen and Genn have a discussion in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. While Velen foresaw Anduin becoming a great leader, Genn insists that visions don't win wars and Anduin may have a good heart but is untested. Nonetheless, Velen believes that the Light is strong with Anduin and he has faith Anduin will grow into his crown. Genn continues to insist that they and he need more than faith. Anduin, having overheard the conversation, travels to the Broken Shore in secret and has the adventurer tell his advisors where he has gone since if he told them himself, they'd only stop him. The adventurer tells only Velen, who is understanding of Anduin's decision and will relay the message to Genn when the time is right. At &lt;a href=\"Wrynnfall\"&gt;Wrynnfall&lt;/a&gt; in front of the Tomb of Sargeras, Genn shows Velen the site of Varian's death, and Velen comments that Anduin does not know the Legion like they do. Anduin arrives and reveals his worries and doubts about living up to his father's legacy. The young king finds one of the &lt;a href=\"Shalla%27tor%20and%20Ellemayne\"&gt;two blades&lt;/a&gt; comprising his father's sword &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; under the ash and sand and falls to his knees, but encouraging words from Genn and an image of his father cause Anduin to regain hope as the sword glows in his hands.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Velen confronted Kil'jaeden with Khadgar and Illidan while adventurers battled the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt;. Although Khadgar voiced his desire to seal the portal, Velen declared he was done hiding and followed Kil'jaeden into the Twisting Nether.\nAboard Kil'jaeden's command ship within the Twisting Nether, Velen confronted his old friend and declared his intent to stop Kil'jaeden's hunt across the stars. Kil'jaeden told Velen that he had lacked vision back then and refused to see the Legion's inevitable victory, while Velen insisted that Kil'jaeden had lost faith in the Light, and if the two of them had worked together they could have resisted Sargeras and saved Argus. Kil'jaeden questioned if the Light had saved Velen's son, or if what shone in Rakeesh's eyes when he died was hatred for the father who had abandoned him. Enraged, Velen declared his intent to fight alongside Azeroth's champions against Kil'jaeden and end his crusade.\nUpon Kil'jaeden's defeat, his ship began to crash toward Argus. As Kil'jaeden was on his deathbed, he told Velen that he was always envious of the latter's gift, faith, and vision. Kil'jaeden had never believed that Sargeras could be stopped, but wonders if perhaps Velen will prove him wrong. As he died and Khadgar prepared to teleport everyone back to Azeroth through a rift Illidan had opened with the &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt;, Velen silently placed a hand on Kil'jaeden's forehead. When the heroes of Azeroth vanished before him, Kil'jaeden closed his eyes as the fel within him caused an explosion that took out his ship. In the last moments of Kil'jaeden's life, Velen realized he had to let go of the past not only for his own sake but for Rakeesh's memory as well. Upon their return to Azeroth however, it was revealed that Illidan had left the rift from Azeroth to Argus open, and Argus became visible on Azeroth's sky. Khadgar, horrified, asked Illidan what he had done, and Illidan responded that sometimes the hand of fate must be forced.\nWhen Khadgar's teleport brought them to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, they saw Argus in the sky above them.\nShadows of Argus.\nIn secret, the draenei had been building a new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20ship\"&gt;dimensional ship&lt;/a&gt; called the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" to prepare to go to Argus. Velen gathered allies to join him in the assault on the draenei homeworld. Aboard it above &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, while final preparations were underway, Illidan confronted Velen about his faith; how he had allowed &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to corrupt &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and Kil'jaeden, and allowed the Legion to take Argus, and through it all did nothing, all the time believing he was following the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;'s will. When Illidan told Velen that his people's blood was on his hands, Velen snapped that Illidan would never understand what he did to save his people, to which Illidan replied that the Light was holding him back and Velen should forge his own path. At this time, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Artificer%20Romuul\"&gt;Grand Artificer Romuul&lt;/a&gt; arrived and told Velen that the \"Vindicaar\" was ready for its trip to Argus.\nAfter arriving above &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;, Illidan was at first dismissive of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; that Velen had intended to ally with as they were nowhere to be found. When the \"&lt;a href=\"Xenedar\"&gt;Xenedar&lt;/a&gt;\" appeared soon after the \"Vindicaar\"'s arrival, it was quickly shot down by the Burning Legion and Azeroth's forces rallied to begin the final battle for Argus. During the chaos of the battle, Velen heard of hooded &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; that lived on Argus, used as slaves by the Legion. After defeating the &lt;a href=\"Antaen%20Light-Breaker\"&gt;Antaen Light-Breaker&lt;/a&gt; alongside Illidan and heroes, he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Krokul%20Hovel\"&gt;Krokul Hovel&lt;/a&gt; where he discovered his old friend &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Hatuun\"&gt;Hatuun&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the survivors on Argus, but Hatuun hated him for leaving them behind. Velen also met &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, High Exarch of the Army of the Light, at last.\nWhen it was discovered that the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; had been revived by Sargeras as the first of a new \"Dark &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;\", Velen decided that they needed to travel to his home of &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Crown of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient eredar relic which he held one piece of, and Archimonde's and Kil'jaeden's should still have been in the ruined city. Returning to Eredath was hard on Velen, who remembered the day he fled and had to deal with the ghosts of eredar who died that day. When Archimonde's piece, the &lt;a href=\"Sigil%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Sigil of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, was secured, Velen contemplated on how Archimonde was disdainful of the Crown because alone his piece gave him little power, and if he had anticipated its use to them he surely would have destroyed it long ago.\nRetrieving the Sigil of Awakening attracted the attention of the Burning Legion, who came to Eredath to hunt down the forces of Azeroth. Velen had traveled with the Army of the Light to the &lt;a href=\"Arinor%20Gardens\"&gt;Arinor Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to search for the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden's piece of the Crown of the Triumvirate, prompting Turalyon and an adventurer to go and try to save them before it was too late. Velen was found in the ruins of his old home, before the childhood bed of his son, who he asked to forgive him. Once they reunited, Velen revealed that his old friend &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the Legion's presence on Eredath and aimed to take the Crest of Knowledge beyond their reach. At &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Kil'jaeden's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; they learned that long ago Kil'jaeden had thrown the Crest in the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt; to rot alongside &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt;. After Velen recalled the day Sargeras came to the eredar, Talgath arrived to confront his old friend.\nTalgath commented on how unlike Velen it is for the Prophet to stand his ground, but that it was a welcome change of pace. Velen attempted to reach a peaceful solution and told Talgath to stand down, but Talgath refused. During the battle Talgath taunted Velen, telling him how his departure wounded Kil'jaeden and how cold Velen had been leaving his wife and son behind. When Talgath was about to lose he attempted to flee, but Velen bound him with chains of light. Velen once more tried to get Talgath to help them find the Crest of Knowledge, but Talgath responded that they were too late, and not even the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; could escape the Seat of the Triumvirate where the Crest was hidden. Afterwards, Velen killed his old friend with a burst of holy magic.\nWith Talgath defeated, Velen realized from Talgath's words that the naaru L'ura had fallen to the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. This concept was a foreign one to Turalyon, who thought it impossible for a naaru to fall to darkness. As Velen explained, there was much Xe'ra had not wanted Turalyon to know. Alleria and an adventurer would be the ones to break into the temple, defeat L'ura, and retrieve the Crest of Knowledge. When they returned having slain L'ura, Velen voiced his mourning for the naaru. He placed his own piece, the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Prophecy%20%28lore%29\"&gt;Eye of Prophecy&lt;/a&gt; located on &lt;a href=\"Exodar%20Life-Staff\"&gt;his staff&lt;/a&gt;, with the other two to complete the Crown of the Triumvirate and empower the \"Vindicaar\". The fight could now be taken to &lt;a href=\"Antorus%2C%20the%20Burning%20Throne\"&gt;Antorus, the Burning Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Argus%20the%20Unmaker\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt; was finally slain by their combined efforts, and the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; prepared to use the last of his essence to imprison &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, Velen and the heroes of Azeroth returned to the \"Vindicaar\". To Velen's surprise, however, Illidan stayed behind to serve as the Dark Titan's jailer. Before leaving, Velen chuckled when Illidan asked whether or not he had foreseen this, and admitted that their survival was never in fate's hands, giving Illidan his final blessing with the Light as he departed.\nAfter Sargeras was imprisoned, and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; which had destroyed his world and so many others apparently ended forever, Velen talked about the countless nights of his life that were spent dreaming of returning to Argus, of seeing what had become of his home and saving it. There was no salvation to be had, but they did find victory. What would come next Velen couldn't say, but he would not wait for visions to guide him. He would do all he could to support Anduin, and to ensure he was prepared to face the threat that loomed in the darkness.\nBefore the Storm.\nWhen King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; summoned his councilors to Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"map%20room\"&gt;map room&lt;/a&gt; to discuss opinions on &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and Prophet Velen marveled at its power but were also aware of its potential for misuse. Sometime later, Anduin had breakfast with Genn and Velen and the two advised Anduin on how to go about his diplomatic tour. When Anduin asked Velen if he had any suggestions of what Stormwind could do to show its appreciation for the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, Velen told Anduin that his consideration about them was enough. Even so, Anduin insisted that they think of something tangible to gift the draenei and Velen smiled at his thoughtfulness.\nVelen accompanied Anduin in his diplomatic tour and attended the feast with the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; in celebration of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s gift to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. By the time dessert was to be served, Velen left with &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; to let Anduin and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt; speak. Later on, he was one of the Alliance leaders summoned by &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; for a meeting. Velen heeded Magni's plea for healers to heal &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and Anduin's discovery of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Following Moira's suggestion, Velen, Moira, and Anduin traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; in their mission to heal Azeroth.\nLater on, Velen returned to the draenei to spur their efforts in healing Azeroth while Anduin went to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to check on the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;' progress.\nFollowing the death of King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s manservant &lt;a href=\"Wyll%20Benton\"&gt;Wyll Benton&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin would later summon his advisers along with &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"map%20room\"&gt;map room&lt;/a&gt; to unveil his plan for a &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and their human loved ones. Velen was the only adviser in support of Anduin's idea as he believed the Gathering's success to be a stepping stone to peace and was worth the attempt despite the risks. The Gathering ended in tragedy however, and Velen went to council Anduin in his despair. Though Anduin longed for the innocence of his youth when he trained with Velen in the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, Velen told him they cannot go back to the past and he must face the hardships of being king. Velen advised Anduin to first find peace within himself before comforting others, elaborating that priests can only heal if they are steady themselves. He urged Anduin to go to the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; and grieve with &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; and also to seek &lt;a href=\"Saa%27ra\"&gt;Saa'ra&lt;/a&gt;'s council so he may know how to guide his people in coping with the tragic events.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nAfter reports indicated that &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had endorsed the campaign to conquer &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; and monopolize &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;, Velen and Tyrande traveled from Kalimdor to Stormwind to strategize with Anduin and Genn Greymane. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; stated that if the Alliance was in agreement, her army stood ready to deter the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign. Although Velen had hoped for a period of peace after the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, he also agreed with the other Alliance leaders' assessment and supported the deployment of night elven troops. Velen stated he hoped the troops sent to Silithus would deter the Horde from war and that they would end up being unnecessary. While Velen and other Alliance leaders were at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; aiding in the planning for the upcoming war, the Horde, having intended to divert the Alliance all along, attacked &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; had depleted most of their resources, the draenei's contributions to the Alliance war effort was very minimal, although several brave draenei nevertheless went to the kaldorei's aid. With the night elf fleet en route to Silithus, Ashenvale had only &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and a limited number of Darnassian defenders to defend it. \nWhen word reached Stormwind of the Horde invasion, the Alliance leaders realized that the Horde had deceived them into weakening Ashenvale's defenses. After King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt; took responsibility for the military failure, Velen comforted his former student by saying older heads than his had not expected this turn of events, but seemed deeply concerned despite his assurances. The Alliance leaders coordinated with each other to accommodate as many refugees as possible and to reinforce the Ashenvale warfront. Velen personally aided in the escorting of night elf refugees to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, telling Anduin it would be his honor to assist them, and spent the remainder of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; tending to the refugees' needs. Although it was mentioned that Velen stood ready to return to Azuremyst \"if need be\", the Horde appeared obsessed with their march to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, and the draenei were not apparently immediately threatened.\nTides of Vengeance.\nVelen can be found in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Room\"&gt;War Room&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;, helping the Alliance strategize for the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt;. He briefed adventurers about the disagreement between &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; regarding the allocation of troops for Tyrande's campaign to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Since Anduin could not provide any military aid at that moment, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; allies went to &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;fight for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; by themselves.\nVelen was later present on the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20vessel\"&gt;Kul Tiran vessel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; with the other Alliance leaders to witness the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; gifting the vessel to Anduin and rejoining the Alliance.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Velen was present at the Stormwind Embassy meeting where he learned that the armistice ending the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was signed. Remarking how each of them must their own path in the world, he believed that the time has come for the Horde to forge their own fate as well. Due to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; retiring the position of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; in favor of a &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;council-style leadership&lt;/a&gt;, Velen found himself questioning if the new path the Horde walked would be of peace or war. He then declared that only time could answer where it will lead.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; decided to send &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; to look over the Horde holdings within &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, in order to assess the needs and statuses of the people, how the wounds from the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; were healing, and where there were still aches within the Horde, Velen wrote them a letter extending an invitation to the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;. He also warned them about avoiding the territories of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, including the remains of Teldrassil, as they remained hostile despite the armistice.\nDragonflight.\nUpon receiving a message from &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Hatuun\"&gt;Chieftain Hatuun&lt;/a&gt;, Velen called upon &lt;a href=\"Virtos\"&gt;Virtos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dranarus\"&gt;Dranarus&lt;/a&gt; to send adventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to him abroad the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\". Upon their arrival, he revealed that after the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he offered to help Hatuun and &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt; rejoin the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, but they instead choose to remain on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. He further revealed that even though the Legion's leadership was slain and &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned, the Legion itself was still vast and that their mission to wipe them out was far from over. Upon arrival to &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;, Velen warmly greeted Hatuun only to be told that he was called for pleasantries, but to meet with an ally that Hatuun had acquired. Velen responded that it would be an honor to meet with any friends of his, only to reel in shock when the &lt;a href=\"man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;man'ari eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arzal%27kal\"&gt;Arzal'kal&lt;/a&gt; emerged from the shadows. The Prophet was quick to bind the demon in holy shackles and accuse Hatuun of allying with the Legion. As Hatuun worked himself into a fury over the accusations, Arzal'kal pleaded for Velen to hear him out and declared that he wasn't there to fight. After a moment of contemplation, Velen agreed and learned of Arzal'kal's history, of his desire for penitence for serving the Legion, to which Velen allowed him a chance to prove his words. Thus while Velen and Hatuun remained behind to converse, adventurers were sent to help Arzal'kal obtain his proof.\nAfter the pair returned with the &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Star\"&gt;Brilliant Star&lt;/a&gt;, one of the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Ata%27mal%20crystal\"&gt;Ata'mal crystal&lt;/a&gt;, Hatuun witnessed Velen welcome Arzal'kal (who reclaimed his birth name of Arzaal) and his like-minded man'ari into draenei society. As the Prophet and Arzaal departed together, Velen called upon Hatuun to think on his offer. For his part, Hatuun was surprised that Velen had decided to accept the man'ari into the fold and reflected that things were different now and that he could allow himself to hope.\nTactics.\nThe encounter with Velen is generally considered the easiest of the &lt;a href=\"faction%20leader\"&gt;faction leader&lt;/a&gt;s, and the virtually non-existent player traffic within the &lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt; leaves room for planning. It is often the first city to be attacked during a \"For the Horde!\" raid, due to its simplicity.\nThe raid should group up at the stairs, and to play it safe, pull Velen's two &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s before him. With them down, the raid can freely focus on Velen.\nVelen pulls with his battlemasters, though if disposed of beforehand will only be protected by his &lt;a href=\"Shield%20of%20Velen\"&gt;Shield of Velen&lt;/a&gt; elite guards. One tank is enough to hold him in such a case.\nVelen's abilities are not particularly potent, even after the step up to \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" level difficulty. His shield is easily broken, and his infrequent use of &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt; can be easily healed through. His Holy Smite ability will be randomly cast on a raid member. For the most part, the encounter is a good example of &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;, and the extremely low chance of an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; defense raid allows breathing space. \nAbilities.\nIn and , Velen in the \"Exodar\" received new set of abilities:\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBurning Crusade.\nAs we attempt to gain the help of the peoples of this world against the Burning Legion, we must also learn to live peaceably amongst them.\nPlease keep this in mind as your journey takes you throughout Azeroth.

As the ancient leader of the draenei, the prophet Velen has spent hundreds of human lifetimes carefully weighing and recording the futures he foresees so that creation itself does not fall. Velen\u2019s guidance preserved his people during an exodus from their homeworld, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, but his wisdom is in question after the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; on .\nAlso known as the Ageless One, the venerable Velen has seen countless worlds unmade by the Burning Legion, and is one of the few who remember all of them.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nHis origins lost to time, Velen was once a respected leader on his homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands of years ago, the Dark &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, offered Velen's people immense power, but he wisely refused it. He foresaw that accepting that power would lead to tremendous suffering. However, other, less principled individuals agreed to the titan's bargain. Velen realized that he could not safely remain on Argus. Defying the Dark Titan himself, Velen and his brave followers escaped with help from the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, mysterious beings of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;. The daring wayfarers called themselves &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, or \"exiled ones.\" Sargeras's army of demons, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, hunted the draenei. Velen thwarted the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s for millennia, until at long last he led his people to a world inhabited by brutish &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. There, they took sanctuary from their journey. They named this new world .\nDraenor.\nVelen and his people dwelled on Draenor in relative peace and stability for hundreds of years. The prophet noticed the talent of &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, a devotee of the Light with a dark secret which Velen sensed. He foresaw that for good or ill, she had a larger role to play.\nYet it was only a matter of time before the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; discovered them. When it did, the demons tried to incite the orcs against the draenei. But the orcs already had their own plans in motion. They rallied together to forge the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and threatened draenei settlements all over Draenor. Now, the ancient Prophet faces yet another threat. For as long as he has gazed into the skies above Draenor, a has lurked there. Velen had hoped never to confront it, but the orcs are prepared to unleash it. The Ageless One must protect his people, or else all will be consumed by darkness.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nVelen first came in contact with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Assault on the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, when they arrived on the shores of Shadowmoon Valley with several freed draenei slaves, including his student &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;Yrel&lt;/a&gt;, and gave them the land Lunarfall. After helping the Alliance to settle in &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt;, Velen and Yrel left but soon after sent Yrel back to direct the Alliance through the valley. He left to deal with the , led by Warlord , who began using the power of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; to attack the draenei. Velen arrived at &lt;a href=\"Teluuna%20Observatory\"&gt;Teluuna Observatory&lt;/a&gt; where Yrel's sister, &lt;a href=\"Samaara\"&gt;Samaara&lt;/a&gt; also arrived only to be captured. Soon after Yrel and the adventurer cornered Ner'zhul who threatened to bring down a being known as the Dark Star. Even though the building was secured, the Warlord and the captured draenei teleported away. The Prophet thus decided to locate and free them and went to &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Glade\"&gt;Twilight Glade&lt;/a&gt; where a camp was set up. He sent Yrel with a group of &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Shaz%27gul\"&gt;Shaz'gul&lt;/a&gt;, home of the clan, to free the captives. He also asked the adventurers to gather some ingredients for a spell that would show him a possible future. Once he meditated, he received a vision. If Ner'zhul and the Iron Horde succeed in obtaining the Dark Star, then the draenei will lose &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; and Velen himself will die in the defense.\nEager to stop Ner'zhul, he contacted , whom he befriended years ago, and now had abandoned her clan. The ex-mate agreed to help the Prophet and after showing the visions of Ner'zhul and Warchief Hellscream, she gave the Alliance a stone to enable entrance to &lt;a href=\"Anguish%20Fortress\"&gt;Anguish Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Once the adventurer deactivated its protecting barrier, the Prophet and Yrel entered its peak and watched Ner'zhul showing Grommash the power of the Dark Star by summoning a Void Lord. Once the enemy orcs left, the draenei destroyed the summoned creature and found Samaara on the brink of death. The draenei then left the area and returned to &lt;a href=\"Embaari%20Village\"&gt;Embaari Village&lt;/a&gt;. Desperate to stop this event, Velen confronted Ner'zhul himself, battling the shaman while Yrel and the adventurer fought off creatures from the Void. Velen offered the fallen shaman the chance to turn from his dark path and let the draenei help him; Ner'zhul retorted that his soul had already been consumed by the shadows, but as the tide of the battle turned the prophet asserts there is no shadow the Light cannot breach. In the end, when Ner'zhul succeeded in summoning the Dark Star, Velen gave his mark to Yrel and sacrificed himself to purify it and transform it into its original, true form: the naaru .\nThe naaru, Yrel and the Alliance then helped to save Karabor and stop the orc's invasion. After the battle, Yrel sent the adventurer back to Karabor where a monument for Velen was built. The student gave him &lt;a href=\"The%20Prophet%27s%20Arcanum\"&gt;The Prophet's Arcanum&lt;/a&gt; and upon playing it at the monument, an image of Velen appeared and explained him the history of draenei and the naaru.\nSome time later, the Exarchs gathered once more in Karabor in order to witness K'ara's blessing upon the Alliance commander. As the ceremony began, the spirit of Velen appeared, and the naaru spoke and blessed the adventurer through the Prophet.\nQuotes.\nLunarfall.\nA great leader sets an example for all those who follow.\nThey know when to speak, and when to listen.\nThey know when to stand and fight for their survival, and when to sacrifice it all for the greater good.\nAre you ready to lead, &lt;name&gt;?\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

At first, it seemed she had the situation in Ashenvale and &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; under control, but little by little her efforts faltered. One day, she simply disappeared. Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Melyria%20Frostshadow\"&gt;Melyria Frostshadow&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Ashenvale to continue her work. The Sentinels believed that she had her own reasons for leaving, and expected that she could return at any time. Velinde had done much in the past to earn their trust.\nBiography.\nVelinde's cleansing.\nFrostshadow sent some scouts to investigate the disappearance of the Sentinel and found that Velinde had prayed to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; for aid on her task. She prayed and prayed as she sought out an answer, and was eventually led to a book in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, set there by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; to expose the mistakes of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, that explained the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, which was entrusted to Velinde's own aunt &lt;a href=\"Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt;. Velinde made way to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Shrine of Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt;, where she discovered the Scythe of Elune hidden away. The weapon had the power to weaken the barriers of time and space, and holding the scythe in her hands, she received a vision of chaos. Wolf-men, the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, fought savagely, as fit their primitive race, but they faced an unflinching enemy: the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20the%20Emerald%20Flame\"&gt;Lords of the Emerald Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt was then that Velinde realized the true power of the scythe. By focusing on it, she was able to communicate with the worgen. However, it was not speech she used to contact them. The worgen heard and understood her. By further channeling the energy of the scythe, the barriers weakened more, and she was able to draw the worgen to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. She summoned a score and a half. The worgen followed her into battle and, with their brutish strength at her command, they tore into the demons of Felwood.\nThe worgen.\nIn the beginning, all was well. She summoned larger numbers of the worgen to fight at her side and she marveled. Though they were of simple mind, they exhibited impressive ability to coordinate their attacks and function as a group.\nShe identified the leaders in their packs and gave them command of small groups. She then organized her rescued warriors into multiple attack parties, sending them out into the tainted forest to fight the demons.\nShe waited as her attack parties rampaged through the Felwood, slaughtering the demons in their path. Velinde waited until the appointed time for her soldiers to return came and went; only a few did. She called and searched for the people Elune had entrusted to her. She found not a trace of those missing packs. She returned to her camp, her half-man servants enjoying the freedom Velinde had given them. She lifted her scythe to contact the worgen\u2019s violent home world. There she could bring more to her cause.\nBut though she had not summoned additional worgen, their numbers continued to increase. It was as though the scythe no longer required her intervention for the summoning process. She gathered as many of the packs as she could find, and ordered them to remain at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Shrine of Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt;. Velinde hurried to search the libraries in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and consulted with &lt;a href=\"Onu\"&gt;Onu&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, but not one scrap of information about these worgen could she find. She heard whispers of a &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; wizard named &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, who was said to have also summoned worgen. Velinde decided to venture to the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and find this wizard in hopes of learning from him.\nUnforeseen consequences.\nVelinde traveled to port in &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and booked passage to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Osprey\"&gt;Black Osprey&lt;/a&gt;. The worgen &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; was eager to get his hands on the Scythe of Elune. There was also a subject of Alpha Prime's, named &lt;a href=\"Varkas\"&gt;Varkas&lt;/a&gt;, who coveted the scythe and sought to usurp the power of his master. Varkas struck out with three others who would defy Alpha Prime, and went to intercept Velinde and the scythe. In &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, Velinde realizing she had been followed and went to seek shelter at the mine &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt; but was attacked right near the entrance. After being attacked she fell back into the mine but dropped her torch as the worgen leapt on her. Her torch ignited some nearby dynamite, which brought the mine down killing her.\nHer spectre can still be invoked near where the scythe was lost in Roland's Doom. &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt; picked up the weapon, triggering its effect of summoning. The mine was immediately filled with worgen, who then proceeded to rip the men apart. Jitters escaped with the weapon, but was hunted by the worgen across the woods, which were steadily darkening with the scythe's released curse.\nIn an attempt to rid himself of their chase, Jitters disposed of the weapon near the &lt;a href=\"Yorgen%20Farmstead\"&gt;Yorgen Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;, whereupon he encountered the Black Riders from &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The riders slaughtered &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt;'s family in front of &lt;a href=\"Jitters\"&gt;Jitters&lt;/a&gt;' eyes. The frightened man then escaped to &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;. The darkness lingers in Duskwood. Yet, the Scythe was found by the Wolf Cult before the Black Riders, the cultists that had the Scythe were hunted down by &lt;a href=\"Brink\"&gt;Brink&lt;/a&gt; an agent, they then gave it to an unnamed night elf.

She was once a servant in a kitchen.\nBiography.\nElsie apparently married Wyll Benton, a manservant of the kings and princes of &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Wrynn\"&gt;House Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, when they were young adults, and remained happily together for many years. Their social circles revolved around the royal families and the servants, as they themselves were.\nShe was in &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, visiting family in the castle and working in the kitchen, when &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; killed &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. By this time Elsie was 60 years old, or as she liked to put it, \"a young sixty.\"\nShe was raised into &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; and became &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in service of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, but glad that Wyll had been spared from experiencing that. Her first compulsion was to seek him out, but others told her that attempts to contact him would only lead to heartbreak for them both. She eventually came to accept that it was better that her husband believed her dead as she saw him as a good man who deserved to find closure from her death, and a chance to find love again with a living woman. She nevertheless kept wearing her wedding ring until her fingers no longer allowed her to and instead kept it safe in her lodgings.\nAt first, while getting used to her new existence, she went back to doing what she knew, namely serving. She assisted those newly raised into undeath who were terrified and disoriented with kindness and patience and helped rebury those who had refused to exist that way, which a part of her understood.\nOver the years though, she developed a desire to put her mind to use to learn and achieve new things. She assisted the Forsaken by attending to and mending the delicate flesh of her fellow Forsaken, and later studied with the apothecaries on ways to keep the Forsaken active and healthy, mentally and physically.\nShe considered &lt;a href=\"Parqual%20Fintallas\"&gt;Parqual Fintallas&lt;/a&gt; a friend. She began questioning the reason for being of the Forsaken's existence after a conversation with the &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tevan%20Whitfield\"&gt;Tevan Whitfield&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime after Sylvanas's sudden ascension to &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Vellcinda took it upon herself to create the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; to serve as interim &lt;a href=\"organization\"&gt;organization&lt;/a&gt; in order to lead the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; in the absence of the Dark Lady, as her Warchief duties brought her out of homeland. Though she led the Desolate Council as its Prime Governor, and thus the Undercity, during this time, Vellcinda merely viewed herself as a caretaker and would gladly step down in order for Sylvanas to resume her rule.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; parade, Vellcinda held a ceremony for the Forsaken who experienced the Last Death during the war against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. She implored &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; to urge Sylvanas to attend the ceremony, but her Warchief duties preoccupied her. She and the other members of the Council met in the throne room of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt; and led the ceremony where she remembered her friend Tevan. Representatives of all the Horde races were present. After the ceremony was over, Nathanos approached her and apologized for Sylvanas's absence that day. Their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Archbishop &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Faol\"&gt;Alonsus Faol&lt;/a&gt; who delivered two missives, one for Warchief Sylvanas and the second for Elsie Benton. Vellcinda was surprised because she hadn't heard the name for quite some time. As she read the letter from &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; about her husband Wyll passing away, she was moved and hoped that Sylvanas would agree with Anduin's plan about the meeting between &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and the Forsaken. She also decided to start using her previous name again. Some time after, she was present in a meeting with Sylvanas who specified the rules of the meeting. She closed the meeting by thanking her for permitting the reunion. Sylvanas then wanted to talk to her. Later on, Sylvanas had tasked Elsie with leading the Desolate Council in organizing the Gathering event from the Forsaken's side.\nThe day before the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, she met with Parqual at &lt;a href=\"Galen%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Galen's Fall&lt;/a&gt;. Even though she had no one to meet, she wanted to witness the reunions of the others. They noticed &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Lansing\"&gt;Annie Lansing&lt;/a&gt; giving scarves and sachets. She then listened to Sylvanas as she repeated the rules of the meeting. Elsie felt very proud to be a Forsaken now. During the meeting, she watched the reunions and witnessed one of Archbishop Faol's priestesses (who was secretly &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;) heal &lt;a href=\"Ol%27%20Emma\"&gt;Ol' Emma&lt;/a&gt; from heatstroke. Seeing she was alone at the reunion, Calia approached Elsie and struck up a conversation. They talked about how wonderful the Gathering was for both their peoples and Calia pointed out Anduin, who could be seen at &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;'s ramparts, and waved to him. She showed Calia her wedding ring that she'd put on a chain, and that she intended to leave it with the Alliance so it could be buried at Wyll's grave. However, when Parqual saw Calia and initiated a defection of several Forsaken participants, chaos erupted as Sylvanas signaled the recall of all Forsaken participants and later sent her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s to execute all the Forsaken on the field.\nShe was killed by Sylvanas's &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; as Calia Menethil attempted to convince her to defect into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, though she had not moved to follow Calia and was actively encouraging the other Forsaken participants to obey Sylvanas' recall. She was later &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;buried&lt;/a&gt; by the human attendees that lost friends and family during the bloodshed.\nMemorial.\nHer tombstone at the &lt;a href=\"Gathering%20graves\"&gt;Gathering graves&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; carries the epitaph:"}

Afterward, the dwarves spent the night drinking and sharing stories. Muradin told Velog that he had no doubt he left the Frostborn in the right hands. Velog told him that he missed him but knew that he was needed more elsewhere. Before leaving, Velog also showed Muradin how to find the oldest runes etched on Mithrios.\nAfter the Bronzebeard brothers left, Muradin sent a letter to Velog, inviting him, and any Frostborn who would care to make the journey, to Ironforge, hoping to bring their families together and wanting to show them Dun Morogh's interesting places - &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Distillery\"&gt;Thunderbrew Distillery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGood to see ya again!\nKing Stormheart has informed me that he will be taking his leave for a time... a grim memory brought back to him has left him with a score to settle it seems.

The two orders each vied for the support of the greater populace. The Anhari knew that to seize power over their race, they would need to control knowledge. The Anhari leader, Priest-Lord Velthreek, told his followers to secretly gather as many of the &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt; as they could and store them within their sun temple atop the Apexis spire, and for years they did so.\nThe Skalaxi order and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Salavass\"&gt;Sorcerer-Lord Salavass&lt;/a&gt;, eventually uncovered what was happening. Believing that knowledge was a basic right for all arakkoa and that it should be available to every member of their race, Salavass called for the immediate release of the crystals from the temple. Velthreek ignored the demand and declared the Anhari to be the sole rulers of the Apexis, and that they would decide who could access the crystals and their knowledge. Velthreek also claimed that he and the Anhari were the living representatives of the sun goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; herself, and that only by following the Anhari's teachings could the arakkoa attain the goddess' favor.\nSalavass knew that if the Skalaxi did not act, they would gradually become marginalized and lose their influence in society. He gathered his followers and struck at the sun temple to take the Apexis crystals by force. A terrible battle erupted at the gates of the temple, quickly spilling into the lower levels of the spire. Some sided with the Anhari and others with the Skalaxi, and for many months a civil war engulfed all of Apexis civilization. To turn the tide of battle, the Anhari ignited their colossal weapon, the &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, and prepared to incinerate the Skalaxi. Salavass knew that his order stood no chance against the weapon but refused to give up. He led a handful of his most gifted sorcerers to the top of the spire, storming through the guardians and reaching the Breath of Rukhmar itself. As the Anhari cut down the intruders, Salavass wove a spell to destabilize the weapon. It worked, but the result was catastrophic: a furious explosion erupted from the mechanism, instantly killing most of the arakkoa on the spire and shattering the land. After the light of the blast dimmed, Arak's single spire had been split into numerous smaller ones, and the surrounding region had become a barren wasteland. It would take generations for life to bloom in the area again, and even longer for the surviving arakkoa to recover. The Apexis civilization was no more."}

Another Kul Tiras fleet was expected, namely that of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Alverold\"&gt;Lieutenant Alverold&lt;/a&gt; who has not returned to this day. Naturally, the orcs didn't take kindly to this.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; struck, most of the Kul Tiras marines drowned. &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt; forces subsequently filled the vacuum."}

The &lt;a href=\"Rare\"&gt;Rare&lt;/a&gt;-Quality &lt;a href=\"Hunter%20Sets\"&gt;Hunter Set&lt;/a&gt; was called Lieutenant Commander's Pursuit, while the &lt;a href=\"Epic\"&gt;Epic&lt;/a&gt;-quality set was called the &lt;a href=\"Field%20Marshal%27s%20Pursuit\"&gt;Field Marshal's Pursuit&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 1.11 the two duplicate names were changed and both PvP set rewards were empowered. The Rare-quality set was renamed &lt;a href=\"Pursuance-Alliance\"&gt;Pursuance&lt;/a&gt; while the Epic set is now simply called &lt;a href=\"Field%20Marshal%27s%20Pursuit\"&gt;Pursuit&lt;/a&gt; (to avoid confusion and duplicate names). While the Epic gear will automatically rescale with the coming patch, players will need to re-purchase (and if necessary, reattain their old rank) in order to enjoy from the new Pursuance items that are significantly more powerful."}

He is a warrior-type mob with several abilities including &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Lieutenant Drake was an ambitious military man, with his eyes set upon the glory of command during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. His ambition was only matched by his hatred for the green-skinned orcs who had slain so many of his companions, a hatred which took form in his cruel treatment of the prisoners in the internment camps of Durnholde Keep.\"\nStrategies.\nFairly straightforward tank and spank. Although Lieutenant Drake has quite some health, he has no real dangerous abilities. That said keep clothies away from his Whirlwind attack. Be ready with Divine Shield, Fear Ward, Death Wish, etc. if the fear becomes a problem.\nHeroic Mode.\nWhen Drake appears, patrols despawn, and all of the sentries left at the bombed buildings will step aside to watch the flames. If you have left many sentries alive, the area under the bridge remains relatively safe, and you may jump down to confront Drake there as he patrols underneath. If instead you chose to clear the prisoner pit, you may use the stairs to keep your ranged DPS and healers at a safe distance.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, Frightening Shout posed a great risk to those outside its area of effect. Currently, Drake will remain on the tank unless threat is exceeded through the usual ways.\nIf your warrior waits to use &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt; until Drake yells \"Time to Bleed\", you can avoid the chance of your tank dying in 1 second from the &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt;, and melee right after."}

Laine questioned the nearby people about the event, which led to two different leads; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s. Laine didn't believe that neither gnolls nor murlocs could have killed the Furlbrows because the murder seemed too perfect. He decided to follow up given he had no other lead.\nSince neither of the two suspects had any worthy clues on them, Laine decided to initiate plan \"Be on the lookout for Two-shoed Lou\". Lou was an old informer of Laine's who lived on the &lt;a href=\"Furlbrow%27s%20Pumpkin%20Farm\"&gt;Furlbrow's pumpkin farm&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Two-Shoed%20Lou\"&gt;Two-shoed Lou&lt;/a&gt; pointed Laines detectives in the direction of an old mine, Jangolode Mine. Inside the mine, the detectives overhear a conversation between the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Glubtok\"&gt;Glubtok&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;shadowy figure&lt;/a&gt; about Glubtok joining forces with the shadowy figure. The detectives headed back to Two-shoed Lou to discuss the discovery which Lou refuses to talk about. Lou told the detectives that a couple of thugs recently showed up and might be of interest to the investigation.\nAfter disposing of the thugs two shots and a scream could be heard from the front of the farm.\u00a0Two-shoed Lou had been silenced and Laine knew it had to be a message to everyone who would rat out the organization behind the Furlbrows murder. Comparing the evidence with his detectives without much luck, they needed a better lead than a &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Clue\"&gt;water-soaked letter&lt;/a&gt;, some\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20Gnoll%20Clue\"&gt;scraps of red cloth&lt;/a&gt;, a mysterious conversation between the &lt;a href=\"Glubtok\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; and the shadowy figure and a confession from four thugs who had been killed in the process. Laine ordered his detective to talk to a &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Farmer%20Saldean\"&gt;Saldean&lt;/a&gt; southeast of the Furlbrow's farm. The Saldeans sent the detective to the Alliance stronghold where their adoptive daughter, &lt;a href=\"Hope%20Saldean\"&gt;Hope Saldean&lt;/a&gt;, was located. When the detective met Hope, Laine showed up to speak with &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Marshal Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; about the investigation and discusses the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Ripsnarl\"&gt;Ripsnarl&lt;/a&gt; who is locked in a stocks next to them.\nMarshal Stoutmantle and his agent &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt; gave the detectives some leads that point them in the direction of &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, where the Shadowy figure was organizing a rally of homeless and vagabonds to rise against Stormwind for neglecting the people while they prosper. With the help of a\u00a0&lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thoralius%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Thoralius&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of\u00a0&lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan&lt;/a&gt;, the detectives were able to assist the detectives by delving into the &lt;a href=\"spirit%20world\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;. By walking into the Deadmines and using the incense,\u00a0provided by Toralius, they were able to witness the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; three years ago. After the Alliance adventures left to tell Gryan of their success, a small girl came out from the shadows saying only one word, \"daddy...\".\nThe detective quickly returned to &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt; to inform Gryan about &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;. Upon telling Gryan about Vanessa the Brotherhood attacked and began to set the town on fire. Hope Saldean then revealed herself to be Vanessa VanCleef in disguise. Laine asked why Vanessa had the Furlbrows killed, she answered that they were the only ones who had seen her before the fall of her father. Gryan sent the detective to Stormwind to inform the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; about the attack on Sentinel Hill.\nHe then appeared inside the Deadmines, coordinating a strike at the Defias Brotherhood.\nQuotes.\nWatch your footing, rookie.\nThere's always something new to investigate."}

The &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon of Order&lt;/a&gt; knew this and gave the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; the knowledge and power to reverse the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Empire\"&gt;Black Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s unspeakable destruction. In time, nature rose, life flourished, and generations of plants and animals would grow and change. Imbued by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar the Life-Binder&lt;/a&gt;, known as the patron of all life and nature, &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Keeper Freya&lt;/a&gt; wandered the world, creating enclaves of life and nature in the places where the energies of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; had coalesced, such as &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The greatest creatures to emerge from Freya's enclaves were the colossal &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;. Seeing these creatures as her own children, Freya and the Wild Gods often wandered side by side through the primal forests and grasslands of early Azeroth. The area that they spent the most time at was the massive forested peak known as &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and it was upon the slopes of Hyjal that Freya bound the spirits of her beloved Wild Gods to the Emerald Dream.\nDuring a vision granted by &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Water\"&gt;Spirit of Water&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; detected Life and interpreted as an element composed of unspeakable energy, which binds the worlds together.\n&lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"chi\"&gt;chi&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; call it, is the life force that &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s manipulate. Spirit energy is intrinsically linked to the elements\u2014earth, air, fire, and water. This life-giving force interconnects and binds all things in existence as one. The amount of &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Life\"&gt;Spirit&lt;/a&gt; energy available on a planet regulates the temperament of the elementals. The more spirit energy, the more slumbering the elementals are. A world with raging elementals such as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; is indicative of a low supply of spirit energy. Beings of Life are known to flourish best in the sun's light rather than in the dark.\nWhen the quel'dorei linked their &lt;a href=\"Runestones\"&gt;Runestones&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Thas%27alah\"&gt;Thas'alah&lt;/a&gt;, they managed to bond the power of Life to their &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; spells. However, life and arcane magics may simply refuse to \"cooperate\" if there is any imbalance between them, which can prevent the intended effect or be dangerous for the spellcasters. Conversely, &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic is fueled by the sacrifice, often insignificant (a living fish, or a few strands of seaweed) and burning of life. It was considered as the greatest violation of life by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon of Order&lt;/a&gt;.\nLife magic is often portrayed with bright yellows or greens, as opposed to death's pale blues and greys.\nEmerald Dream.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; is a vast and ever-shifting dimension of spirits and nature magic that defies mortal perceptions of reality. The Emerald Dream represents how &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would have been if intelligent beings had not altered its surface, or what the world might some day be again. The Emerald Dream apparently has some kind of ancient link with the realm of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, where souls close to nature rest in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, essentially being opposite blooms connected to the same tree, with the former personifying Life in its waxing stages, and the latter embodying Life in its wane. Where the Dream represents the spring and summer of the cycle of life, Ardenweald reflects autumn and winter, in essence, being the highest expression of the relationship between endings and beginnings - between &lt;a href=\"Death\"&gt;Death&lt;/a&gt; and Life. In this world of untamed nature, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s gain insight and oneness with the Great Cycle.\nRaces of Life.\nWild Gods.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s are primal manifestations of life and nature found on both &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and other &lt;a href=\"planet\"&gt;planet&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of them appear in the form of gargantuan &lt;a href=\"animal\"&gt;animal&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tiger\"&gt;tiger&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"bird\"&gt;bird&lt;/a&gt;s. The Wild Gods of Azeroth are creatures of two realms, for while they inhabit the physical world, their spirits are bound to the ethereal &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nAncients.\nThe &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s are giant, sentient demigod-like trees that serve as protectors of nature. They were among the first creatures of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the first guardians of its life. Ancients are all connected to one another and can sense disturbances to the world from deep within their roots. Animals or other protectors of nature can nest in their branches, such as &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20life\"&gt;Trees of life&lt;/a&gt; are saplings of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. They suffered heavy losses during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and returned to the forests to spread their seeds and replenish their numbers undisturbed.\nTreants.\nThe &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s are mighty tree-folk imbued with great wisdom and strength native to the forests of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. They are powerful ancient trees that served under &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; in ages past and are closely affiliated with &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, as they are often seen accompanying powerful druids and &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nUses.\nThe elements that carve form into the universe are fluid forces of nature. Some beings seek to bend the power of these natural elements to their will. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, however, worship the protecting spirits of nature. They work with the natural life forces of the world, and harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature's raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones. By calling upon the powers of nature, druids are able to direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies.\nAs master shapeshifters, druids are deeply in tune with the animal spirits of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they can take on the forms of a variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, storm crow, or sea lion with ease. This flexibility allows them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. As druid healing involves life force being drained and transferred, they ask the surrounding nature to lend them their energy in order to cast spells or to aid them in battle. They call upon the versatility of nature to empower themselves, assuming the forms of primal beasts, summoning celestial energy, and channeling the restorative properties of the wilds to aid their allies.\nCreated by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, under the direction of the demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Axe%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Axe of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; is a &lt;a href=\"two-handed\"&gt;two-handed&lt;/a&gt; magical wooden &lt;a href=\"axe\"&gt;axe&lt;/a&gt; crafter with druidic magic. It was enchanted with a piece of Kalimdor's magic, making it light as a feather and stronger than any mortal-forged axe, and able to slice through any foe with ease.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20magic\"&gt;Blood magic&lt;/a&gt; is a form of tortured life magic that uses blood as a power source. &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s use blood magic to command the very life force of their enemies.\nEffects on beings.\nSome &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; were so transformed by the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; that they never left his realm, choosing to remain by Cenarius' side as his defenders. These few would cease to be elves and became woodland guardians physically altered forever.\nPractitioners.\nDruids.\n&lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s are the most known practitioners of nature magic. Druidism derives from nature, enabling them to channel natural energies and transform into animals. They live in a state of unparalleled union with nature, and are shape-shifters with an affinity for the plants and animal kingdoms. Tightly bound to the plant and animal kingdoms, they are natural shapeshifters, and so they know firsthand the abuse visited on their wild brethren. In consequence, despite their numbers, druids tend to be wary, reclusive, and difficult to spot. Few outsiders have plumbed the depths of their secrets. They maintain a deep connection to nature through the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, a primordial realm that encompasses all aspects of nature.\nThe many gifts provided by nature must sometimes be reciprocated. Restoration druids seek order in the world by tending directly to its many life forms. Friend to flora and fauna alike, they celebrate birth and growth. Where there is decay, they bring rejuvenation. Where there is abatement, they summon regrowth. Life not only needs protection\u2014it needs nourishment. To foster this harmony, the restoration druid builds a bond with the things that grow, gaining inspiration from the flower's bloom, the seed's sprout, the mushroom's spores, and the tree's growth. Like nature, the restoration druid perseveres through patience and persistence, the foundation upon which all life is built and sustained. They use this power to mend wounds and provide persistent remedies that keep their allies from falling.\nFeral druids also seek to curb imbalance in nature. They observe the fantastic intricacies of the physical world and the delicate fabric in which all living creatures are given purpose. Whether on land or in the sea, in a lush jungle or an uncultivated desert, death is part of the cycle which sustains life. Nature is an eternal dance between predator and prey. Like their feral brothers and sisters, guardian druids attune themselves to nature through the animal kingdom. They commune with the wild to understand how life perseveres through adversity. They know that the creatures who survive are often those built to best protect themselves and their kin. In this, they find a deep and harmonious value in the steadfast\u2014all the while recognizing that sturdiness requires an aggressive stance when danger comes near.\nHunters.\nFrom an early age, the call of the wild draws some adventurers from the comfort of their homes into the unforgiving primal world outside. Those who endure become &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and know the uncharted places of the world. The art of survival is central to their isolated life. Hunters track beasts with ease and enhance their own abilities by attuning themselves to the feral aspects of various creatures. Gifted with a deep empathy for all life, they have an uncanny knack for befriending wild animals, and are known for the lifelong bonds they form with animals of the wild, training great hawks, cats, bears, and many other beasts to fight alongside them.\nMonks.\nMasters of bare-handed combat, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s never rely solely on the need to have a weapon in their hands to defend against their enemies. Monks bring a unique martial arts style to any fight, and harness an exotic form of magical energy that's unfamiliar to those who practice other arcane arts, the &lt;a href=\"Chi\"&gt;Chi&lt;/a&gt;. They seek spiritual balance in life and in combat, and as dangerous as Monks can be on the battlefield, they're rarely looking to pick a fight without just cause. They view the world through a different lens, finding power through serenity and inner peace\u2014then expressing it through artful combat techniques and powers that mend life. Mistweavers monks are unique among those who heal. The energies they channel are mysterious, oftentimes misunderstood by commoners\u2014who rarely travel beyond the borders of their homelands\u2014as some form of folk medicine. But those who weave the mists wield the power of life's essence, using a mixture of preventative and restorative spells to mend their allies' wounds. The inner tranquility that guides mistweavers allows them to sustain their healing for long periods of time, and gives them the strength to care for multiple injured allies.\"\nShamans.\nShamanism is a deeply spiritual form of elemental magic that involves a connection with both, the natural and the spirit worlds. In fact, there is a relation between the spiritual magic of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; and the natural magic of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, which explains why the shaman were able to hear the spirits of &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt;. Some shaman find a serene affinity for the restorative properties of water. They do not necessarily seek the Light or turn to the divine, yet they feel a profound spiritual connection with the source from which all mortal life took root. So strong is their connection with water that the shaman is able to restore life and heal afflictions. They balance this with a command of the other elements, finding harmony in nature and purifying their allies as a tidal surge washes across a sandy shore. Some also dedicated themselves above all else to forging a deep bond with the elements. They have peered beyond the Elemental Plane, gleaning visions of an ancient past where manifestations of volatile energies once raged unimpeded across primordial Azeroth. Through careful study and dedication, they are able to channel such power into destructive magical surges, and taunt the very forces of nature.\nWildkin.\nThe &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; are serene, powerful creatures, believed by the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; to have been created by the moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to protect her sacred places. These gentle giants possess a natural energy described by an academic of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; to be &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic and similar to that of the night elves. Among them, the moonkin are blessed by Elune and spread nature's grace wherever they travel.\nDragons.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; became the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of Life and, together with her &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, they were made protectors of all life by the titan &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt;. Since this time, red dragons have always concerned themselves with maintaining the harmony and prosperity of life They consider themselves the custodians and defenders of life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but they will not hesitate to kill a creature if its actions endanger other lives. Red dragons understand the secrets of life, and in turn, those of death, like none others do and have been granted great power over both. The breath of red dragons burns but also rejuvenates, and whenever a red dragon walks or breathes upon the soil, the earth is renewed. A red dragon would never hurt a soul, unless they tried to hurt them first.\nOnce led by &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; the Awakened, the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; live only to serve the forces of nature and uphold the balance between mortal creatures and the ever-evolving world. &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragon\"&gt;Green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s are creatures of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, the ethereal dreamworld that all life is tied to. From there the green flight watches over nature, often assisted by the night elven &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. The dragons and druids work closely together within the dream where they can control the ebb and flow of nature and influence the evolutionary path it takes. Greens are, like the other flights, highly intelligent and always striving to learn more about the world they were entrusted to protect, fretting out the mysteries of creation and life - but keeping all such secrets hidden within the Emerald Dream.\nNight elves.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; are a powerful and mystical race who developed a strong empathy for the living forests of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and reveled in the harmonious balance of nature. The &lt;a href=\"Demigod\"&gt;Demigod&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; adored them and spent a lot of time teaching them about the natural world, as he believed they had the potential to become great caretakers of nature.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves founded a radically different society centered around &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;, striving to live in harmony and co-existence with nature and its inhabitants, and essentially becoming \"venerable guardians\" of the natural world as well as the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, instead of ruling most of Azeroth as its foremost superpower. They also reconnected with the widespread worship of their moon goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, under the guidance of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nTauren.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; are a noble race that embraces the natural world. Their race is one of spirituality and reverence for nature, as they strive to live honorable and dignified lives filled with respect for nature and the &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Mother\"&gt;Earth Mother&lt;/a&gt;. They consider death to merely be the shadow of life and hold that the ending of things is as natural as the birth of them.\nWorgen.\n&lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; are naturally drawn to and revere the wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, who in a way, is the progenitor of their race. Through this natural connection to nature, some took the path of &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;, while many also embrace and revere the nature-related spirits that resulted in their current status, such as &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and his newly found reverence for Goldrinn.\nBotani.\nThe &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; are a race of intelligent, bark-skinned humanoids native to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. 2,000 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; wandered the forests of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, and taught them unique ways to harness nature magic, notably to create pools of potent nature energies to transfer the spirits of fallen genesaur into new bodies.\nHarpies.\n&lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;Harpies&lt;/a&gt; employ nature-based magic to destroy the environments in which they settle, killing every creature they encounter and despoiling the land to build nests noted for their noxious odor.\nOrganizations.\nCenarion Circle.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; is a harmonious order that guides and keeps watch over the world's &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and their practices. The organization mostly consists of druids, with members of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; races.\nGuardians of Hyjal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; are a faction created during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, whose job is to protect &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. They are worshippers of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Aessina\"&gt;Aessina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tortolla\"&gt;Tortolla&lt;/a&gt;, and wish to repopulate the region with animal life.\nThornspeakers.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; are a group of druids located in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally founded by the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; druids, who did not agree with &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;'s war against the human settlers, and left Drust society. Druidism used to be the old ways of the Drust before the days of Tul, whose ways the Thornspeakers consider to have brought disgrace upon the Drust. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt;, the High Thornspeaker and the last of the Drust druids.\nIn the RPG.\nThe nature branch of &lt;a href=\"divine\"&gt;divine magic&lt;/a&gt; is almost entirely the province of one race. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elves&lt;/a&gt; follow no faith but that of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, while honoring the other &lt;a href=\"Ancient\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;s. Although all night elves pay tribute to Elune, those who truly hear her soft song choose the healer class and follow the path of either the druid or the priest. Most of the inhabitants of northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 namely the night elves, but also the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 worship or revere the Ancients. The night elves worship &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s only deity, the eternal moon goddess Elune. They revere most of the other Ancients, especially &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, the only Ancient to spend considerable time on the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Physical Plane&lt;/a&gt;. They also honor the moon goddess's companions, including &lt;a href=\"Agamaggan\"&gt;Agamaggan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aviana\"&gt;Aviana&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe furbolgs venerate the bear twins, &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ursol\"&gt;Ursol&lt;/a&gt;; and the evil satyrs revere &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Lord Xavius&lt;/a&gt;. The Ancients rarely interfere with life on Azeroth, but these races hold fast in their fervent beliefs that the Ancients exist and are watching events unfold. Adherents from these races do not receive their power directly from the Ancients they worship; their faith allows them to tap into an inner spark, focus divine energy and cast spells.\n&lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; is a female &lt;a href=\"Vanir\"&gt;Vanir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;, and the physical representation of life, nature, and healing in the universe; she revels in the joy and bliss in all worlds. Her portfolio includes nature, healing, life and, as she is a member of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, creation and order.\nThough both &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism seem to be separated by a very fine line, the means by which they reach their ends can be classified in a fairly straightforward manner. Druids worship the spirits through plants, animals, and the fundamental spirit of the wilds. Conversely, shamans worship the spirits through the four fundamental elements of earth, fire, wind, and water. Although nature spells are not a specifically defined category, a spell or effect falls into this subgroup if it clearly improves, enhances or summons creatures or objects that exist in natural, aboveground terrain.\nMidnight rituals of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; imbue its devotees with the ability to \"infect\" the undead with the spark of life \u2014 and in doing so, make them vulnerable as normal mortals. Just as the Scarlet Crusade trains its members to manipulate their life force, it also trains them to protect it. As a Crusader becomes more powerful they can use their life force to incinerate any who stand in their way."}

This tradeoff can allow warlocks to produce an endless stream of damage and death - while their health holds.\nStrategy.\nThis spell has a big impact on how to play a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;. It means that a warlock will never run out of mana, provided sufficient healing is available.\nA warlock in a party with a healer can boost their mana if the healer agrees. Note that the self-inflicted damage will rank low on the healers priority list - after the tank, and party members taking aggro. Healers should be willing to heal a Life Tapping warlock, as use of the ability is often critical to maintaining good DPS, as long as the warlock is reasonably considerate in their usage.\nWhen using Life Tap in parties, be considerate of the extra strain this places on the healer. Try to tap regularly and if possible at times when incoming damage is low. Tapping for a large amount of your health all at once, especially when you or other party members are already at low health, can stress and alienate your healer. A little communication never hurts. If you're planning on using Life Tap in unexpected ways (such as Life Tapping 30% of your health between boss phases), try to warn your healer first.\nWhile Life Tap will allow you to continue casting, it does trigger your &lt;a href=\"GCD%23Global_cooldown\"&gt;GCD&lt;/a&gt;, reducing your overall &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, and should be used sparingly."}

While it was never a roaring success as &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20the%20Ancients%20%28Warcraft%20III%20map%29\"&gt;Defense of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; was and still is, LOAP has become one of the most edited custom maps on Warcraft III. \nHistory.\nLOAP was first made by StankeyNuggets under the map name of Real Life not too long after Warcraft III's release. At what point the map name was changed to Life of a Peasant is unclear. LOAP has never had a uniform 'brand' of versions, and instead the recent new maps available now are copies of copies, and so the evolution of the map has been very erratic due to its extreme decentralization of order. \nGameplay.\nMost LOAPs have peasants, a Police Chief, a Drug Lord, and the Mafia. Some versions more prominent in Reign of Chaos have a Go-Kart Manager instead of a Drug Lord. Some versions also created entire new factions.\nThe job of the Police Chief is to maintain order in the land while fighting the Drug Lord and Mafia boss. The Police can enforce the law by arresting people and putting them in jail. This has often led to abuse, as there normally is no way for the person to get out of jail, the prison van can easily 'arrest' people without being prevented by the player, and the people playing the Police would often leave people in jail indefinitely. \nThe job of the Drug Lord is to sell drugs (items that can increase the stats of heroes). The Drug Lord holds a monopoly of supply of the drugs, as in most versions only he can harvest drugs, and as a result has full control over the price.\nThe Mafia's job is to fight the Police.\nPeasants in LOAP do not initially have a specific aim. Each peasant can have one job for receiving gold. Generally at the start of the game there is a rush by the peasants to get the mayor job (and in some versions the president too) as it is the only job that does not require you to do anything at all. Some of the numerous other jobs are a doctor, garbage collector and mailman.\nHouses are dotted around the map and can be bought at a set price. While their doors can be used as a temporary obstruction for enemies, they are largely for roleplay purposes. Some houses in some versions however come with a item storage box, a 'security building' (where you can train militia), and even cars.\nDespite LOAP having numerous versions, it's core gameplay does not change by much from version to version. Death for example is never permanent for any hero in LOAP. After an amount of time, the hero will resurrect at the doctor's surgery usually at the cost of losting a set percentage of money. This is why imprisonment is generally considered a worse punishment than death, unlike in real life. The general layout of the map is also kept the same, although some maps extend it.\nVersions.\nBecause LOAP is a fairly basic map lacking protection while certainly not lacking potency to easily give the host strong powers, it has come to be quite possibly one of the most edited Warcraft III custom maps of all time. Mapggnome.org holds more than 10,000 different LOAP versions. \nSome of the more prominent versions are:"}

Each life quest told the story of its respective race and what their purpose in the world is, often continuing the story set up in the \"smaller\" regular quests. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20%28playable%29\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; life quest revolved around their effort to develop a &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;new plague&lt;/a&gt; and would have involved rescuing the undead player character's father from captivity, while the &lt;a href=\"orc%20%28playable%29\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; life quest would give players a taste of the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic influence from their past and force them to combat it.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; planned to implement life quests after they had finished adding all of the game's regular quests. However, while life quests were intended to feel cool and individual, the developers increasingly found that they instead started feeling overly canned since they gave the same backstory to every player character of a particular race. The designers ended up steering in the direction of simply making epic high-level questlines with stories based around the &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s (such as the &lt;a href=\"Rewriting%20the%20Battle%20of%20Darrowshire%20quest%20chain%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Darrowshire questline&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Warlord%27s%20Command%20quest%20chain\"&gt;Horde Onyxia's Lair attunement&lt;/a&gt;) rather than trying to tell players what their character's life story is."}

The information used below is gathered from game information, confirmed-&lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt; lore books, and other confirmed canon sources. Information gathered from the non-canon sources of the &lt;a href=\"RPG\"&gt;RPG&lt;/a&gt; can be found further below. Please note that these ages are averages, gathered from that of various sources and usage of timelines as well as observations (such as &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; being unable to die of old age). These are not the confirmed limits of age, as there have been various characters who have lived long past the standard age of their race.\nFor races such as night elves or blood elves, who recently lost their &lt;a href=\"immortality\"&gt;immortality&lt;/a&gt;, the standards may differ according to age prior to their immortality, and if they were born before or after their race was given immortality.\nMortal races.\nEach maximum life span has been taken from various confirmed lore sources; races with more than one number listed denote the range of a standard age: for example, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; could live for 80 years, while another could reach the hundred. Below are listed races whose ages have been verified by these sources or there is enough gathered information to be listed. Races who have not met this standard are not included on this list; in addition, unless a source claims otherwise, the various clans of a race share the same life span (such as the three &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; clans). Regarding &lt;a href=\"hybrid%20race\"&gt;hybrid race&lt;/a&gt;s, their life spans are assumed to be a combination of their progenitors' ones.\nImmortal races.\nThese races are immortal and do not die of old age. Some even go as far as to not show weakness as they age.\nExtending life through magic.\nSome powerful mages can extend their lives through magic. The most prominent example being &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; who lived to be over 800 years old. She, of course, is a very special case as she had the powers of a &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; at her disposal.\nSpeculation.\nWorgen.\nThe age and life span of a worgen are unknown and may vary based on the race of the worgen before the transformation. As worgen are actually the result of the magical transformation of other races, they may not have a standard life span.\nThe original &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; are an example of long-lived worgen. They were former night elves who were put to slumber within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; at the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;. Released from their prison in modern times, they have shown little to no signs of aging. This could mean that their longevity as kaldorei upheld as worgen, or perhaps their slumber in the Emerald Dream suspended their aging.\n&lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; is an older human, and while he was described as fighting with a vigor that rivals that of younger worgen, he was shown to have aged, as his hair changed from grey to stark white since \"\".\nAs such, it is possible that the curse may extend one's life, or at least restore their vigor.\nIn the RPG.\nBelow are the current life span standards for various races at the time of \"World of Warcraft\" &amp; \"The Burning Crusade\" as given in the World of Warcraft RPG. Old age represents the average age of death for most individuals, most people on Azeroth will die of disease or of the natural, violent nature of the world before they reach venerable status. Mainly heroes ever reach the maximum age, as such maximum age represents the average range of death for unique individuals. These individuals live longer for whatever reason (perhaps will to live, better-living conditions, magic, or by other unnatural means). Please note that exceptions do exist and there are individuals, \"&lt;a href=\"legends\"&gt;legends&lt;/a&gt;\" who may outlive even those who attain venerable status. A good example includes night elves that have lived over 10,000 years (although this was with the help of immortality, which they have recently lost).\nRaces.\nEach maximum life span is derived from dice rules which are based on d6, d10, d12, d20, and d% dice. The table shows the lowest to the highest possible outcome for rolls which represent the range of maximum lifespan usually for heroes of any given race. The average person will die of old age before reaching venerable. It should be noted that the table does not always fit with written lore references to lifespans, and there are always exceptions to the rules as well, with individuals who live longer than the average \"maximum\" range. In the case where a second set of numbers is listed on the table, it is to denote where written lore accounts may differ from the dice mechanics, whenever applicable.\nDragons.\nWhile \"Manual of Monsters\" gives a ballpark figure to how much time passes between each stage of a dragon's life cycle, it lacks information on \"whelps\", but implies that whelps become \"drakes\" in one year of hatching from the egg (however this may no longer be accurate, although it seems to be supported by information given in \"&lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;\").\nAge ranges for dragons from Dark Factions represent race ages for the dragon (whelp) &lt;a href=\"creature%20class\"&gt;creature class&lt;/a&gt; (technically a dragon whelp creature class). As noted the game rules only describe how to play \"whelps\", specifically a red dragon whelp (which start out as adults, and can reach a certain maximum age range before dying). Other whelps must be made by modifying certain aspects of the creature class (subtypes and abilities). The age ranges are not equivalent to aging into drakes, mature, or dragonwyrm forms. There are no rules in the book on how to play a drake, but it discusses that players could create their own creature classes to describe drakes."}

As the naval wing of the Horde military, these combined navies protect the Horde's interests throughout &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, and have seen particularly frequent service against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and its &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;navy&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCreation of the fleet.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s arrived from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, they originally had no ships and even no naval tradition, as most of the superstitious &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; feared the open sea.\nBut following his victory in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; still wished the &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; pursued across the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;. So following the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde's&lt;/a&gt; conquest of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, Doomhammer planned to build a fleet of ships and launch a surprise attack in the heart of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity's territories. Many orcs had reservations about this, for they were not a seafaring people. However, Gul'dan and his &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt; urged their allies that it was the best course of action, and &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;in a bay&lt;/a&gt; tucked in the southwestern &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; Orgrim oversaw the construction of the fleet. To build the fleet, the Horde used iron and timber pilfered from their recent conquest of Khaz Modan and its &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gold%20mine\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the orcs knew little of shipbuilding, some of their ogre allies had maritime knowledge and helped construct the immense &lt;a href=\"juggernaught\"&gt;juggernaught&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 heavily armed and armored floating fortresses. The &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s also helped with their own &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt;, while the Stormreavers also captured &lt;a href=\"Submarine%23Goblin%20giant%20turtles\"&gt;giant sea turtles&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;, to be used as a submersible orcish craft after being pacified by potent spells of control. To augment this, Doomhammer also enlisted the aid of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. The warchief provided the goblins with vast quantities of gold as payment for new technologies, maps, information, and ship-building services. The orcs had virtually no need for gold currency, and they were still rich in it from plundering the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond conquering the remaining &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;human kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan and the Stormreavers were secretly assisting building the great navy in order to later find the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nSecond War.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Orgrim Doomhammer ordered the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; to establish a base of operations on the island of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Dare\"&gt;Zul'Dare&lt;/a&gt;, not far from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s shores, in order to prepare their strike towards the coastal &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; settlements. Just before the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; navy intercepted the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; fleet near the island, successfully attacking the enemy ships, but the arrival of three enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s turned the battle and Daelin and his ships were forced to retreat.\nWith the coast cleared, the Horde built several &lt;a href=\"oil%20platform\"&gt;oil platform&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; region before launching their landing on the coast of Hillsbrad.\nAfter the battle of Hillsbrad Foothills, most of the Horde navy was left anchored at the recently-conquered seaport of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan then enacted his plans and came back from &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; to take a portion of the fleet to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; later came back to Southshore as well in order to take the remaining ships and pursue the traitors. A lot of Horde ships ended up wrecked at &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20Wreckage\"&gt;Stormreaver Wreckage&lt;/a&gt;, while some others litter the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde navy ceased existing on Azeroth after these losses, but kept surviving somewhat on the orcish homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27kur\"&gt;Zeth'kur&lt;/a&gt; served as &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\n&lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s new &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish Horde escaped the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in stolen ships from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, throughout the entire &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; the Horde would produce little to no ships of their own, instead hiring &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; transport boats from &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Shipyard\"&gt;goblin shipyards&lt;/a&gt; when necessary. However, after the &lt;a href=\"second%20invasion\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had ended, the Horde could instead focus on expanding their presence on land as well as on sea.\nCataclysm.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; led to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, in which Warchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; ordered the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; to build an armada that he would name &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%20warfleet\"&gt;Hellscream warfleet&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to use it to persuade the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; to ally the Horde. However, corruption and delays in &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; meant poor quality despite high costs, but intimidating the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Foreman\"&gt;Bilgewater Foreman&lt;/a&gt; in charge helped get the warfleet done in time for the Horde to successfully launch an incursion into the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The Warchief, on board the warfleet, ordered the Horde air guard to seize the opportunity and attack the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; armada while it was in close formation. Though the Alliance apparently inflicted heavy casualties, the fleet was left seriously damaged following this ambush. The Horde's &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s too would pay for the sudden attack, when they were soon afterwards wiped out by a group of &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, having dispatched all their close air support to deal with the Alliance.\nElsewhere, the Horde's sea fleet was also attacked by Alliance naval forces in open waters en route to the Twilight Highlands, &lt;a href=\"Remains%20of%20the%20Fleet\"&gt;inflicting heavy damage&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Captain%20Skullshatter\"&gt;Captain Skullshatter&lt;/a&gt; commanded the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Fury%20Wreckage\"&gt;Storm's Fury&lt;/a&gt;\" into &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; where it was shut down and crashed.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde erected a naval blockade around &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, with the \"&lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Warchief's Fist&lt;/a&gt;\" engaging with the Alliance ship \"&lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20%28ship%29\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt;\".\nLater, the Horde navy was victorious at the coasts of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. A southern fleet encountered an Alliance envoy and an &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;uncharted landmass&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarrosh Hellscream sent &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Hagman\"&gt;Admiral Hagman&lt;/a&gt; to control the Horde fleet confronting &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Hodgson\"&gt;Admiral Hodgson&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance in a &lt;a href=\"battle%20on%20the%20High%20Seas\"&gt;battle on the High Seas&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Horde navy assaulted the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, too many of the Horde navy's ships were destroyed either by the Legion or by the Alliance. Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner had Horde dockmasters working overnight.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, much of the Horde's naval power was docked in the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; champions were sent to infiltrate the troll capital, and set fire to the ships.\nThe Horde fleet grew a great deal in size after the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s introduced their &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt; to the Horde. However, it was almost entirely destroyed by the Alliance during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; as the ships had been sabotaged and later detonated.\nRanks.\nThe Horde navy features ranks similar to &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy%23Ranks\"&gt;those&lt;/a&gt; of their Alliance counterpart.\nThe Forsaken do have an amount of Dread-Admirals and Dread-Captains such as &lt;a href=\"Tattersail\"&gt;Tattersail&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dread-Captain%20Coldfathom\"&gt;Coldfathom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dread-Captain%20Graham\"&gt;Graham&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Captain%20%22Moldy%22%20Nadeux\"&gt;Nadeux&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Captain%20Winge\"&gt;Winge&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them also share the same naval uniform, such as Tattersail, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Lightpast\"&gt;Captain Lightpast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Dreadwake\"&gt;Captain Dreadwake&lt;/a&gt;."}

Ner'zhul's army is sometimes called a new Horde, other times described as simply a remnant of the main Horde.\nHistory.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; still considered themselves part of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;original Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Couriers and messengers sometimes passed news back from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, such as about &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s victory against &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, and the massacre of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. The Draenic &lt;a href=\"Clan%23Orcish%20clan%20system\"&gt;clans&lt;/a&gt; welcomed these turns of events, accepting Doomhammer as their new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; and purging their own ranks of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s before the dark magic users could afflict any more of them. The &lt;a href=\"destruction%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;destruction of the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, however, led to the loss of this Horde identity and the clans fell back to infighting.\nFormation.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde of Draenor was rallied by the elder &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, who declared himself &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; returned to Draenor after the Horde's defeat in the Second War, he was informed of the situation and received orders that the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s he had brought with him should be used by all the clans collectively. Ner'zhul's plan was to steal certain artifacts from Azeroth that would enable him to open rifts to other worlds. Ner'zhul used fear and the brute force of his own &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; to maintain the fragile unity among the clans.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the Horde and controlled a special order of death knights who had the knowledge needed to rebuild the Dark Portal. They also captured &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and other members of the Horde. A Slayer of the Shadowmoon managed to defeat Mogor and his clan, freeing Grom and subjugating the order of death knights.\nNer'zhul then sent part of his clan, the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt; to attack the Bonechewer clan and steal the &lt;a href=\"skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;. But after they killed the captain of the Bonechewer and stole the skull, both the Thunderlord and Bonechewer clans desired to journey to Azeroth and have their clans triumph where Doomhammer had failed; Ner'zhul did not share that vision and attacked them. After that, there was no opposition to the reformed Horde and they prepared to enter Azeroth.\nOffensive to Azeroth.\nNer'zhul sent a renewed offensive into Azeroth with the intention of stealing a number of magical artifacts and using them to open new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s on Draenor. They destroyed &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, enlisted the aid of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the survivors of the Bleeding Hollow clan that hadn't crossed to Draenor and then attacked &lt;a href=\"New%20Stormwind\"&gt;New Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe objective of destroying New Stormwind was to steal the book of Medivh, but it wasn't found as it was stolen by Alterac soldiers before the Horde managed to steal it. Without choice, the Horde constructed a naval fleet and prepared to leave towards Alterac, but they attacked &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; first. Kul Tiras was not supported by the Alliance and was defeated, so the Horde controlled the seas once again. But before they continued to north, Ner'zhul ordered to enter the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and steal the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The Scepter was guarded by a &lt;a href=\"daemon\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt; but it was defeated.\nThe Bleeding Hollow clan returned to Draenor while Deathwing delivered the rest of the army in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; made a deal with the Horde, if they destroyed &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; nearest bases, Alterac would give them the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Horde of Draenor defeated the Stromgarde and Lordaeron forces they attacked &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and stole the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. After the victory, Deathwing arrived, exhausted and bringing news from &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance sent a host of warriors to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Morass\"&gt;Black Morass&lt;/a&gt; and engaged the forces of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, retaking Nethergarde Keep and managed to capture the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. The Slayer of the Shadowmoon rallied his forces and broke through the siege, returning the artifacts to Draenor.\nBattles in Draenor.\nAlthough the artifacts were returned to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; discovered that Ner'zhul wanted the knowledge of how to open portals. It was decided that an &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; should venture through the Dark Portal, both, to recover the stolen artifacts and to ensure that the Horde can never again threaten &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde of Draenor opposed the Alliance Expedition, at the Dark Portal they even sent some &lt;a href=\"daemon\"&gt;daemon&lt;/a&gt;s to defeat the Alliance, but this opposition was defeated. In an ironic twist, while the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; would keep their own side of the Dark Portal firmly under control, the Azerothian side of the Dark Portal switched sides several times during the late stages of the invasion, stranded forces of the Horde of Draenor stopping the larger &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; from keeping its expedition properly supplied and reinforced.\nThe Alliance attacked the &lt;a href=\"shipyard\"&gt;shipyard&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zeth%27kur\"&gt;Zeth'kur&lt;/a&gt;, but the Horde's clans were driven to new heights of fury and were superior in numbers; the clans were defeated and the Alliance constructed ships of war to cross the &lt;a href=\"Devouring%20Sea\"&gt;Devouring Sea&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the Horde was preparing for another attack on Azeroth, but this was discovered by the Alliance and although the Horde's army was too large to be defeated by the Alliance, they launched a strategic attack against &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; to force the orcs to retreat. During the battle the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg\"&gt;Kilrogg&lt;/a&gt; slain, but at a high price for the Alliance as &lt;a href=\"Kurdran\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt; was captured. Khadgar discovered in the ruins of Auchindoun that the Horde also needed the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, but this artifact could also be used to seal the Dark Portal forever. With the objectives of saving Kurdran and recovering the Skull of Gul'dan, the Alliance attacked &lt;a href=\"Deathwing%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Deathwing's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, after a battle they managed to defeat &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and completed their objectives.\nWhile Deathwing was defeated, the Horde used that time to strike against other Alliance forces: A great &lt;a href=\"Horde%20navy\"&gt;orcish armada&lt;/a&gt; threatened the captured coasts, and the armies of the Alliance were hard-pressed on many fronts. The Alliance decided to advance further into &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, as their only chance for victory was to recover the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; from Ner'zhul. The Horde fortified the coastlines but was defeated, the &lt;a href=\"Bonechewer%20clan\"&gt;Bonechewer clan&lt;/a&gt; managed to capture some Alliance soldiers, but their base was destroyed and the prisoners were released. Then the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt; blocked the pass to &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Fortress\"&gt;Shadowmoon Fortress&lt;/a&gt; but were defeated. The &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, aided by some forces of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; and some survivors of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; fought in the fortress itself, all led by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; and a special order of &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt;. During the battle the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt; used the distraction to steal the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; escaped with the necessary knowledge to construct the portals in his mind. During the battle Teron was slain and at the end of the battle the Horde was defeated.\nThe Horde then launched an attack on the Alliance fortifications at &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, although not well equipped their numbers were very great. The Alliance forces in Shadowmoon Valley returned to Hellfire Peninsula and reinforced the base, the orcs never managed to enter the base and had a complete defeat. At the end of the battle the &lt;a href=\"Laughing%20Skull%20clan\"&gt;Laughing Skull clan&lt;/a&gt; betrayed the Horde of Draenor and made a pact with the Alliance, at the trade of the Book of Medivh, they would destroy the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; to gain dominance in the northern clans of Draenor. The Alliance had to accept and secured the pass in the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; with the support of the Laughing Skull.\nNer'zhul held the ancient scepter of Sargeras in the air, intoning the final words of the spell of conjuration. The air began to swirl and pressed down the assembled masses of the Horde, the crimson skies broke open and revealed the chaotic pathways of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. As Ner'zhul deployed his remaining forces towards the new portals, the Slayer of the Shadowmoon asked: \"Master, shouldn't we recall all of our forces from Azeroth?\", but the ancient shaman replied coldly \"No, they have served their purpose. From this point on, all that we gain will be ours alone.\" The Slayer unquestioningly followed him into the swirling madness of the Twisting Nether. Ner'zhul and his followers escaped through the largest of the new rifts as Draenor felt the first of its death throes, the spell of Ner'zhul broke down the fabric of reality in Draenor; unleashing massive earthquakes and tidal waves upon its shores. Without choice, Khadgar and the Alliance had to return to the Dark Portal and destroy the rift between Azeroth and the doomed world of Draenor with the Skull of Gul'dan and the Book of Medivh.\nThe Alliance fought their way desperately to return to Azeroth, while &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, realizing that Ner\u2019zhul's mad plans would doom their entire race, rallied the remaining orcs and intended to cross the Dark Portal. As the Alliance had a base surrounding the Dark Portal Grom and his forces had to fight for their escape to succeed. They attacked the Alliance base but were later attacked from behind by the rest of the Alliance forces that were returning from Blade's Edge Mountains. As Hellscream and his orcs hacked their way through the human ranks in a desperate bid for freedom, they crossed through the portal, but the diminished Alliance Expedition forces were still holding back many orcs in Draenor's side while protecting Khadgar, and with help of the artifacts he destroyed the Dark Portal. In Azeroth's side, the Dark Portal suddenly exploded behind the orcs who have crossed, for them there was no going back.\nFate of the clans.\nThe Shadowmoon, Laughing Skull, Shattered Hand, and Bonechewer clans now make up the core of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Horde\"&gt;Fel Horde&lt;/a&gt;, transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s created by the blood of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and now on service in &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; was almost completely destroyed and the survivors were transformed into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s through the &lt;a href=\"blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; managed to escape from Draenor before Ner'zhul opened his portals, alongside part of the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow&lt;/a&gt; and part of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt;. These three clans later joined &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; when he revitalized the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt; maintained some of its &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20Stronghold\"&gt;holdings&lt;/a&gt; in the Blade's Edge Mountains, and a remnant of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; maintained one of its &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Village\"&gt;villages&lt;/a&gt; in the Shadowmoon Valley; when the Dark Portal was reopened during the Burning Crusade, these clans joined Thrall's New Horde as well.\nNer'zhul selfishly abandoned all the clans and escaped with just his elite followers in tow. The evil group of orcs crossed through their chosen portal just as Draenor blew apart in an apocalyptic explosion. As they thought that they had survived, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and his demonic minions ambushed them and turned Ner'zhul into the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, while his followers were turned into &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt;es.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cabal\"&gt;Cabal&lt;/a&gt; survived and are still in the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is unknown what happened to the &lt;a href=\"Bladewind%20clan\"&gt;Bladewind clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lightning%27s%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Lightning's Blade clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nClans of the Horde of Draenor.\nThough the unity of these clans was constantly threatened, fear of Ner'zhul and his Ogre-Mage, &lt;a href=\"Dentarg\"&gt;Dentarg&lt;/a&gt;, kept the clans in the line (excepting a few outstanding incidents).\nSpeculation.\nThe various &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Merchant\"&gt;goblin merchants&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20laboratory\"&gt;laboratories&lt;/a&gt; that could be found in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; during ' could have been survivors of the goblin mercenaries that followed the Horde of Draenor. Alternatively, they could be non-canon, similarly to the goblins in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; that sold Arthas and the Scourge zeppelins to cross a river in \"Warcraft III\", (in ' Arthas simply crossed the body of water on top of undead bodies)."}

{"id": "127738", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=127738", "title": "Horde technology", "text": "The many races of the Horde are far more primitive than those of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and thus are not nearly as technologically advanced. Most advances have taken place in the field of war machines and weaponry, and the Horde had to employ technological \"consultants\" - &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s - to create the city of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. The introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde sparked an increase in technological knowledge, although the technology of the blood elves is greatly augmented by their vast skills in the magical arts. However, the permanent inclusion of goblins, with their emphasis on engineering and mechanical development, into the Horde has opened up tremendous technological potential. Today, the Horde is slowly realizing real gains through technology, both for military and domestic purposes.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s season their heavy machinery with &lt;a href=\"%3Acoal\"&gt;:coal&lt;/a&gt; tar, which makes them flammable.\nIn the RPG.\nMembers of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; rarely take up the &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;'s calling; the faction largely views the use of &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; with disdain, stooping only to use goblin technology when they can afford to pay goblins to handle it. Members of the Horde are more likely to rely on shamanic or druidic &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. Relying on goblin innovation has served them well, and often goblins aided the orcs in times of need. Yet there are a rare few amid the orc and troll races who see the advantage of the tinker's craft. Most of them pursue the goblins' path of tinkering, favoring devices and instruments that can cause devastation on one scale or another. Tauren are the least likely to use technology, seeing it as a disturbing disharmony with the natural order. Trolls tend to be fascinated by the destructive properties of technology, and often find ways to put destructive devices such as explosives and firearms to use. Orcs are more adept with technology and the most likely to seek out firearms and other devices to use in times of war, but still they prefer the rewarding feeling of axe and spear through flesh. For an orc, firearms have little tangible reward in battle other than hurting the enemy; most find the weapons impersonal and lacking in honor.\nTechnology is still a new science in the eyes of the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Troll\"&gt;Troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; used only comparatively simple tools and weapons before &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s introduced technology to their people. When the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s came to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they brought with them certain advanced metallurgy techniques, but otherwise they knew little of the higher sciences. Only the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; look upon technology as more than a curiosity, although the orcs are slowly coming around.\nOf course, there are some exceptions. Within the deep jungles, troll tinkers seek to combine the &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; arts with technology. Orc &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s, not content to simply copy stolen dwarven designs, labor to understand the secrets of science to increase their combat firepower. Tauren scientists, still new to this mysterious craft, make enormous devices solely to test the limits of technology. The &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, ever seeking new ways to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, build devices large and small in the hopes of eradicating the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s forces once and for all.\nSome nay-sayers do not appreciate the slow spread of technology. They see this new science as inherently destructive, and believe that left unchecked, technology will eventually lay waste to Azeroth. The actions of certain groups, such as the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, are clear evidence of this. Some use magic or other means to halt the use of destructive technology, while a few &lt;a href=\"techslayer\"&gt;techslayer&lt;/a&gt;s use its own power against it. Techslayers study and learn what they can about technology, then use that knowledge to keep it in check. The Horde employs far more techslayers than the Alliance, primarily because technology has achieved a lower level of acceptance within the Horde's ranks.\nThe Horde isn't known for its technology or ranged combat, but it does have elements of both. Troll &lt;a href=\"axethrower\"&gt;axethrower&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"headhunter\"&gt;headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s dart through wooded areas, sniping at stray targets or flankers, while massive &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s rain death on closely cramped foes. Many siege engineers become reckless in battle, and friendly fire is a constant threat. The Horde severely lacks in technological prowess since the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s left their alliance. The Horde's reliance on divine magic and beasts has proven a downfall due to their unpredictable and exhaustible nature. And technology still baffles the Horde. Enemy forces can overwhelm a Horde warband with a single &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;; most warbands are simply ill equipped to handle a strong technological presence.\nAlthough there are always individual exceptions, the various races of Azeroth tend to view technology in different ways.\nOrc technology.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s think of technology as though it were another sort of weapon. To an orc, the engineering craft has little purpose but to help create new and improved methods to destroy his enemies. However, orcs see little reason to endanger themselves in the process. After all, one cannot rise to power within the Horde if one blows himself up with his own weapons! Therefore, orcish devices are carefully built and stable. Even those that are prone to failure include safety precautions that protect their users from harm. Orcs are not terribly innovative. Most of their scientific advancements build on the accomplishments of others. Thus, a number of their technological devices are simply improved weapons and armor originally designed by others. Orcish devices include improved armor, shields, weapons, firearms and siege engines.\nTroll technology.\nThe &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s don't consider technology a science, but another form of magic. To them, crafting a technological device is another way of creating a talisman or charm, only with more steps. Harnessing steam power is an alternative means of binding air and water spirits to do one's bidding. Most jungle troll inventions involve the use of natural and alchemical components combined with scientific applications. Jungle trolls don't specialize in any particular area, as orcs do with weaponry. Instead, trolls study whatever scientific application seems the most interesting. Some trolls claim the spirits speak to them in dreams, suggesting new ways they can be called upon by technology. Troll inventions include the poison extractor, swampwalker shoes, and dart grenade.\nTauren technology.\n&lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; do not have much of an inclination toward technology; however, some of their greatest inventions includes the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Lift\"&gt;Great Lift&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; and the tri-level city of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. They have the potential to be great inventors, but they don't care for that potential. They want to keep on living the way they've always lived. Science is new to the tauren, many of whom view technology with great curiosity. Once imbued with a basic understanding of scientific principles, tauren engineers understand that the potential applications of technology are limitless. The Great Lift leading to Thunder Bluff is a good example of tauren engineering progress. Tauren tinkers spend a great deal of time building, experimenting and designing, without worrying about failure. Their size and strength allows them to survive catastrophic disasters that would instantly kill a goblin designer. Tauren engineers are unconcerned with the size of their creations. A javelin-throwing contraption might be 10 feet across and weigh 1,000 pounds \u2014 all the designer would care about is that he successfully created a working javelin thrower. Few, if any, functional tauren inventions are small and portable. Among the better known tauren devices are the enemy detector, thunderstomper, and various tech-mods designed to improve tauren totems.\nForsaken technology.\nAmong the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have perhaps the deepest understanding of the workings of science. However, they reject technology as anything more than a curiosity or a simple tool. Creatures of the dark arts, they are more interested in studying and controlling those arts than they are in learning about something that to them remains alien. Still, a few undead delve into the new sciences, employing technology where it serves their own ends. These dabblers create items that employ necromantic power in ways that arcane or divine magic cannot. A perfect example of this is the necromantic amplifier. Like many other Forsaken technologies, it combines science and dark magic into a single package. For this reason, some Forsaken technological items have crafting requirements other than scientific ones. Forsaken inventions include the aura concealment suit, energy polarizer, and the aforementioned necromantic amplifier."}

The archdruid commented that the horn could not pacify the elves trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;Pack Form&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third War.\nAfter his death, it remained on &lt;a href=\"Moonglade%20Isle\"&gt;Moonglade Isle&lt;/a&gt; and was guarded by the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Guardians\"&gt;Primal Guardians&lt;/a&gt;. It was retrieved by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and used to awaken &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and then later used by Malfurion to awaken both the Druids of the Talon and Claw. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the Arch-Druid blew the Horn again, summoning the power of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; to destroy &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe horn made a comeback many years later, when the forces of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; assaulted &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.

Since druids are in tune with nature and represent it, the horn also effectively works as a wake-up call to them.\nAccording to legend, this powerful item had the power to call upon the spirits of all night elves. Although Cenarius normally kept his horn for himself, he loaned it to others on occasion. According to tales, the horn has other powers besides awakening the night elves. A rumor hints that the horn's bearer will gradually be turned into a night elf if he carries it for long, but as only night elves have possessed this item for any length of time, this legend cannot be substantiated.\nWhen Cenarius perished, the location of his magical horn was lost from the ken of the mortal races. Although many have searched for it, none had discovered its location. Rumors suggested that the forest itself claimed this lost artifact for all time, and yet it one day may again appear when the need for it is great enough.\nSource.\nIt was gained by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"The%20Awakening%20of%20Stormrage\"&gt;The Awakening of Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and used to awaken Malfurion. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; uses this in &lt;a href=\"The%20Druids%20Arise\"&gt;The Druids Arise&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brothers%20in%20Blood\"&gt;Brothers in Blood&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20of%20the%20Gods\"&gt;Twilight of the Gods&lt;/a&gt; which are chapters 4, 5, and 7 of the night elf campaign, &lt;a href=\"Eternity%27s%20End%20%28WC3%20campaign%29\"&gt;Eternity's End&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; centaur's most sacred relic and a symbol of the ancient pact between the centaur matriarch &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt;. It can only be blown with &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;'s blessing. The Horn is guarded by a small &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Teerai&lt;/a&gt; village at the base of the hill, now overrun by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk&lt;/a&gt; settled in the Ohn'ahran Plains during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, they faced hostility from the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, until the centaur's matriarch &lt;a href=\"Teera\"&gt;Teera&lt;/a&gt; and the green dragons' leader &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; allied with each other to destroy hostile &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s that threatened both of their peoples. Teera and Merithra then met upon the hill named Drusahl and made a pact of respect: the green flight and the Maruuk promised to stay out of each other's way but come to the aid of the other when their livelihoods were threatened. The Horn of Drusahl was created to serve as a symbol of the friendship between the Maruuk and the dragons and a physical manifestation of their oath. The spirit of the famous hornsmith &lt;a href=\"Deritetsin%20the%20Carver\"&gt;Deritetsin&lt;/a&gt; claims that it was he who built the Horn using wood the dragons provided from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, while others claim that it was Teera herself who built it.\nBefore the green dragons left the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a ceremony was held at Drusahl. The dragons entrusted the Maruuk with the protection of the Ohn'ahran Plains and told them: \"In times of great strife, blow the Horn, and we will answer.\" The &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; then blessed the Horn, summoning great winds to blow through it. For over ten thousand years, this remained the one and only time the Horn had ever sounded. Over the following millennia, the Horn was protected by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Teerai\"&gt;Clan Teerai&lt;/a&gt;, who built a small village next to the hill.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the awakening of the Dragon Isles, the green dragons beseeched &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; to honor her ancestors' pact and aid them against the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt;. Sarest agreed to blow the Horn of Drusahl and answer the dragons' call for an alliance, if Ohn'ahra willed it. This became more urgent after &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; allied with the Primalists and declared war on the other clans. Knowing that she could not win the war without the dragons' aid, the Khanam Matra ordered &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Clan Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; to find Ohn'ahra and ask for her blessing so that she could blow the Horn and summon the dragons.\nHowever, Ohn'ahra was instead captured by the Primalist leader &lt;a href=\"Koroleth\"&gt;Koroleth&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly after, Balakar led a Nokhud warband to attack the Horn and sack the village at the base of the hill. Sarest assumed that Balakar intended to destroy the Horn to prevent her from summoning the dragons, and went with the &lt;a href=\"khansguard\"&gt;khansguard&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to confront him. They retook the village from the Nokhud and rescued the surviving Teerai, but Balakar and Koroleth then enacted their plan: Koroleth forced Ohn'ahra to bless Balakar, allowing him to blow the Horn and lure the dragons Merithra, &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Solethus\"&gt;Solethus&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; into a trap. The Nokhud tried to kill Merithra with one of their &lt;a href=\"dragonkiller%20ballista\"&gt;dragonkiller ballista&lt;/a&gt;e, but Solethus absorbed the bolt meant for her and plummeted to the &lt;a href=\"Watering%20Hole%20%28Ohn%27ahran%20Plains%29\"&gt;Watering Hole&lt;/a&gt;. Koroleth then forced Ohn'ahra to teleport her and Balakar away, while Sarest and the adventurer went to help the dragons."}

It is a giant &lt;a href=\"direhorn\"&gt;direhorn&lt;/a&gt; empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Beast%20Ward\"&gt;Zandalari Beast Ward&lt;/a&gt; as an instrument of war, similar to &lt;a href=\"Oondasta\"&gt;Oondasta&lt;/a&gt;. The battle consists of battling the various troll tribes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; as much as the boss.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; brought powerful creatures with them to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; to use as engines of war. Led by the &lt;a href=\"War-God%20Jalak\"&gt;War-God Jalak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dinomancer\"&gt;dinomancer&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Beast%20Ward\"&gt;Zandalari Beast Ward&lt;/a&gt; use ancient tribal magics to strengthen the great beasts and command obedience. The horns of Horridon, the fabled mount of Jalak himself, can tear through the stone walls of a keep as a blade cuts silk.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Trolls love dinosaurs, so it\u2019s only fitting that the most advanced and powerful troll tribe should have the largest and most powerful dinosaurs. The overall structure of this encounter recalls past fights like &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Deathwhisper\"&gt;Lady Deathwhisper&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"M%27uru%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;M\u2019uru&lt;/a&gt;, where players must keep up with waves of lesser (but still threatening) minions while managing the boss, before turning their attention directly to him in the later stages of the fight.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Farraki\"&gt;Farraki&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"War-God%20Jalak\"&gt;War-God Jalak&lt;/a&gt; will first call upon the aid of the Farraki tribe.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar-God Jalak will call upon the Gurubashi tribe to enter the arena second.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar-God Jalak will call upon the Drakkari tribe to enter the arena third.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar-God Jalak will call upon the Amani tribe to enter the arena last.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar-God Jalak and his faithful Zandalari Dinomancers will come to the aid of Horridon during the battle.\n&lt;a href=\"War-God%20Jalak\"&gt;War-God Jalak&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter all four tribes have been called, or when Horridon has been damaged below 30% health, War-God Jalak himself will enter the arena.\nStrategy.\nThe battle with Horridon is mostly of an &lt;a href=\"Add%20fight\"&gt;Add fight&lt;/a&gt;. Horridon's health is too high to hope to kill normally and beat the enrage timer. Thus, Horridon must be forced into the walls of the arena, which will give him a stacking damage debuff which will allow the raid to gradually bring his health down.\nThe raid must battle the four troll tribes who enter the arena after the previous one has been defeated. First the Farraki sand trolls enter, then the Gurubashi jungle trolls, followed by the Drakkari frost/undead trolls, and finally the Amani forest trolls. After battling a given tribe for a minute, a Zandalari Dinomancer will enter the arena and attempt to heal Horridon, which should be interrupted. At half health, the dinomancer will shapeshift into a devilsaur, dropping an Orb of Control. Any player can take up the orb, immediately forcing Horridon into the gate spawning the trolls, stopping the adds from that tribe from spawning and giving Horridon the Cracked Shell debuff, plus stunning him for 10 seconds. After dps'ing Horridon a bit more, the raid should move to the next door and be ready.\nHorridon\nHorridon will periodically cast Double Swipe, using his horns and his tail to sweep anyone directly in front or behind him. Melee dps should use general \"Dragon\" rules and stay to his side. He will also charge random raid members and follow up with another Double Swipe. Because of this, ranged should be ready to move quickly when Horridon charges them. The tanks should be fine switching after every destroyed door to keep the Triple Puncture stacks low, but some may want to switch sooner depending on gear level. \nThe Tribes\nThe Farraki are generally considered the easiest of the four tribes. Skirmishers are easily dps'ed down. The basilisks should be interrupted/stunned whenever they attempt to cast their stone gaze. Frarraki Wastewalkers are the most dangerous as they shoot Blazing Sunlight, a magic DOT, at several members of the raid at a time and should be given priority behind the Dinomancer. \nThe Amani Bloodlords, similar to their &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;namesake&lt;/a&gt;, charge and cut random raid members, applying a bleed. The Venom Priests have priority for their Venom Bolt Volleys stack and can create serious raid damage if left uninterrupted. Living Poison pools should be stayed away from. \nThe Drakkari are challenging as their forces include both powerful warlords and undead &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knights&lt;/a&gt;. The Drakkari Frozen Warlords hit hard with Mortal Strike and create Frozen Orbs similar to Frost Mages which should be avoided. Risen Drakkari place a stacking Deadly Plague on whomever they attack, which should be dispelled. The Frozen Warlords. \nThe Amani bring a large threat in the form of their Zandalari Warbears/Beast Shamans. The bears have powerful melee attacks and the shamans wield powerful elemental spells including Chain Lightning and Lightning Totems. The Amani Flamecaster's fire spells and the Beast Shaman's Chain Lightning spells can be reflected at their casters. \nPhase 2\nAfter Horridon has been hit with 4 stacks of Cracked Shell, the DPS should clean up any remaining adds and go to town on Horridon until &lt;a href=\"War-God%20Jalak\"&gt;War-God Jalak&lt;/a&gt; enters the Arena, after which the raid should switch to him. If Jalak is not killed fast enough, his Bestial Cry buff will eventually allow him to kill the tanks. Now is the time to use Bloodlust and any other cooldowns available. Once Jalak is dead, Horridon will gain a minor increase in damage and should be finished off quickly. \nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The duel is to the death.\nDescription.\nTal'ashar is known to be practiced among the aristocracy of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, generally in response to a perceived slight or for competitive reasons. The challenge may be issued over a particular prize, such as a title, with the winner claiming all. Either participant in the rite may choose to present a champion to fight in their place, representing them during the duel. Presumably, all forms of weapons and fighting styles are permitted for the duel, with few actual rules being applied to the fight itself.\nHistory.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; raged and the city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; was rocked first by &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;a demonic invasion&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;a large-scale rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, unrest among the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; populace began to grow. Nightborne nobles subsequently vied among themselves for an opening as an advisor to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, ruler of Suramar. The noblewoman &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, secretly in league with the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; rebels, attempted to gain the position to further the cause of the rebellion. With the aid of her allies, Ly'leth succeeded in gaining the required support and ousting the stiff competition.\nAs the ceremony to award the title began within the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Order\"&gt;Sanctum of Order&lt;/a&gt;, with the Grand Magistrix herself in attendance, a rival claimant in the form of &lt;a href=\"Coryn\"&gt;Coryn Stelleris&lt;/a&gt; leaped onto Ly'leth's platform and suddenly challenged her to Tal'ashar in front of those in attendance for the title. With no other choice, Ly'leth accepted, although she chose to name a champion to act in her stead. This champion, a disguised agent of the Nightfallen, clashed with Coryn Stelleris atop the Sanctum of Order. Eventually, Ly'leth's champion prevailed, slaying Coryn and securing the title for Lady Lunastre.\nOrigins.\nThe origins of Tal'ashar are unclear but the ritual may predate the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; race, being inherited from the even older &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;. If so, this would make Tal'ashar many thousands of years old. No evidence for any such ritual is evident in modern &lt;a href=\"kaldorei\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; society, however, indicating that Tal'ashar is either a nightborne invention, or that it fell out of use among the night elves following the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nRegardless of whether it was referred to by the same name, it is highly likely the ancient kaldorei maintained a similar type of rite. Much of the aristocratic intrigue and powermongering that seems to lead to this ritual was directly inherited from that which notoriously existed in the Kaldorei Empire."}

But the Auchenai have an ally that Teron'gor did not expect. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Sunsworn\"&gt;Sunsworn&lt;/a&gt; felt the demonic presence and have flocked to Auchindoun's aid, and will call upon players to help turn the tide\u2014but will they be enough?\nGeography.\nThe zone has a palette of oranges, golds, and greens that make it incredibly vibrant. Talador is home to the heart of draenei civilization: the sprawling trade hub of Shattrath, the massive mausoleum that is Auchindoun, the iconic city of Tuurem, the mythical Telmor, and so many others. Many creatures that call this great forest home have adapted unique hunting techniques to survive. The devious stalker is able to change its skin coloration to camouflage it, allowing it to ambush prey or escape predators unseen. Mighty teroclaws, flying beasts that use their strong beaks to sever both flesh and bone, rule the skies here rather than the rylaks found in many of Draenor's other locales. Moths are drawn to the plentiful water sources, and have developed the ability to channel the abundant magic energy in the air around them into condensed blasts. Those same water sources are home to all sorts of electric eels, poison frogs, and even mighty riverbeasts. Some caves are home to ferocious territorial spiders that few dare disturb \u2014 their venom is said to be able to alter both the body and mind. Tigers prowl the lower mountain ridges, hungry for their next kill.\nMany &lt;a href=\"olemba%20tree\"&gt;olemba tree&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in the region.\nQuests.\nAlliance.\nChapter 2: The Plight of the Arakkoa.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Wrynn\"&gt;Fort Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; up and running, the champion learned form &lt;a href=\"Kalaam\"&gt;Kalaam&lt;/a&gt; that the nearby draenei village of &lt;a href=\"Aruuna\"&gt;Aruuna&lt;/a&gt; is being decimated by an attack of the arakkoa. The champion sets out to investigate and meets &lt;a href=\"Crystal-Shaper%20Barum\"&gt;Crystal-Shaper Barum&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins, who asks the champion to retrieve some of his and his daughter Melani's belongings and clear the way so that they may escape. The champion also discovers &lt;a href=\"Raksi\"&gt;Raksi&lt;/a&gt; in the ruins, who asks the champion to kill the leader of the Arakkoan force &lt;a href=\"Sun-Sage%20Kairyx\"&gt;Sun-Sage Kairyx&lt;/a&gt;. When the champion attacked Kairyx, he made known their reasons for being in Aruuna--the draenei discovered an artifact, some kind of prism--in a nearby mine.\nAfter Kairyx was slain, Raksi asked the champion to investigate the alleged artifact. When the champion found the prism, Raksi revealed herself to actually be &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt; and knocked the champion out. The champion came to in &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Refuge\"&gt;Terokkar Refuge&lt;/a&gt; surrounded by arakkoa. Iskar apologizes for his deception, but claims it was necessary to ensure the champion would fight against Kairyx. Iskar explains that he and the others of the village--the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;--are arakkoa who are unable to fly and were cast down by the leading faction of arakkoa: the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to burning Aruuna for its alleged artifact, the Adherents are also destroying the nearby Outcast village of &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Shadar\"&gt;Veil Shadar&lt;/a&gt;. Iskar and the others ask the champion to push back the Adherent advance and kill their commander &lt;a href=\"Wing-Guard%20Kuuan\"&gt;Wing-Guard Kuuan&lt;/a&gt;. After the champion does so, the Outcasts make it clear they have greater designs for revenge against the Adherents.\nAs they are returning to Fort Wrynn, the champion sees that Barum and his daughter Melani escaped safely to &lt;a href=\"Anchorite%27s%20Sojourn\"&gt;Anchorite's Sojourn&lt;/a&gt;.\nChapter 4: Auchindoun.\nAfter returning from &lt;a href=\"Xandros\"&gt;Xandros&lt;/a&gt;, the champions found &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; gone and a trail of corpses leading to the entrance to Auchindoun. &lt;a href=\"Soulbinder%20Tuulani\"&gt;Soulbinder Tuulani&lt;/a&gt; and the regrouped with the champions and pressed into Auchindoun to look for them. After finding the gates mysteriously sealed, Tuulani disabled the locks and the champions proceeded to the Western Transept where &lt;a href=\"Soulbinder%20Nyami\"&gt;Soulbinder Nyami&lt;/a&gt; revealed that she was in league with Gul'dan and was behind the warlocks' plans in Auchindoun.\nNyami ordered &lt;a href=\"Vigilant%20Kaathar\"&gt;Vigilant Kaathar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"vigilant\"&gt;vigilant&lt;/a&gt; which still trusted her, to attack and kill the champions. After Kaathar was defeated, the champions found that there were many draenei that were following Nyami under Gul'dan's orders and fought through waves of draenei vindicators to confront Nyami herself near Auchindoun's entrance. Nyami was defeated, but ominously told the champions that they were too late as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had already arrived.\nAfter defeating a small army of demons, the champions confronted and defeated a harbinger of the Legion, the &lt;a href=\"overfiend\"&gt;overfiend&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azzakel\"&gt;Azzakel&lt;/a&gt; in the Eastern Transept. With the Legion's advance force routed, the champions defeated the warlocks protecting Teron'gor in the Congregation of Souls and then confronted Teron'gor directly. In defeat, Teron'gor attempted to consume even more souls to prevent his death and seemed to become overcome with the power of Auchindoun and fell off the edge of the platform, disappearing.\nVignettes.\nContinuing the tradition started on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, Talador has a huge number of &lt;a href=\"vignette\"&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt;s, which are one-time events like killing rare mobs, looting treasure chests, or completing scripted events. Nearly all of the vignettes reward &lt;a href=\"Garrison%20Resources\"&gt;Garrison Resources&lt;/a&gt; in addition to an uncommon or rare-quality item.\nResources.\nA rare lily grows in the waters of Talador. &lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemists&lt;/a&gt; say it is many times more efficient than &lt;a href=\"frostweed\"&gt;frostweed&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

She is a priestess of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;. She later forms &lt;a href=\"Talanji%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Talanji's Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, a united group of Zandalari and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Trolls\"&gt;Darkspear Trolls&lt;/a&gt; who combat the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike her father, Talanji does not think the old ways are always best and believes that the Zandalari must adapt if they are to survive in a changing world. While her father's advisers were wary of making an alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji was a staunch supporter of the Zandalari and Horde uniting to face their common enemies. \nFollowing her father's death during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji succeeds him as Queen of Zandalar. Following the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; as the Zandalari representative.\nAs of the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Shadows%20Rising\"&gt;Shadows Rising&lt;/a&gt;\", she was stated to be 18 years old, making her 25 years old in .\nBackground.\nAs a little girl, she was best friends with &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt;, then known as Parri, the daughter of &lt;a href=\"Yazma\"&gt;Yazma&lt;/a&gt;, with the two getting into all sorts of mischief together, and the pair had a steadfast loyalty to one another. This loyalty was so great that when Yazma betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; by siding with &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, Apari remained by Talanji's side. After hearing of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Rise%20of%20the%20Zandalari%20trailer\"&gt;defiance to Zul's call&lt;/a&gt; to unite the troll tribes, she took to admiring the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"chieftain\"&gt;chieftain&lt;/a&gt;.\nYears later, now an adult, Talanji left &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; to negotiate with the Horde because the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt; was not doing its duty to protect the kingdom and the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt; threat was increasing, though she told her father that she was simply going to go exploring. En route to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, she and &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; ended up being captured by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde sent a strike team, including &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;, to infiltrate &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt; to free Zul and Talanji. When they were cornered in the Harbor, Talanji summoned Rezan to clear a path for them. Afterward, she returned to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; with the Horde and Zul. Talanji explained that her father's advisers all plot against both him and the Horde, and that if the Horde wants the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt;, they would need to aid the Zandalari in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;.\nExpedition to Nazmir.\nAgainst her father's better judgment, Talanji led an &lt;a href=\"Talanji%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;expedition&lt;/a&gt; into the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s that assaulted &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. She received the aid of &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a contingent of his scouts and warriors. Upon arrival at the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Darkness%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Heart of Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji and the speaker of the horde see the true power of the blood trolls. They escaped the stampede of the blood trolls and joined up with Rokhan and the Darkspear at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jan%20Ruins\"&gt;Zul'jan Ruins&lt;/a&gt;. There, she scryed the locations of the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; within Nazmir - &lt;a href=\"Torga\"&gt;Torga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; - to seek their aid in battle. Her expedition also recruited numerous &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s to their cause after saving Torga's corpse from being corrupted by G'huun's herald, &lt;a href=\"Jungo\"&gt;Jungo&lt;/a&gt;. Although Hir'eek and Torga fell, the remaining Loa agreed to help her and her forces.\nAfter a Horde adventurer reactivated the dormant &lt;a href=\"Titan%20Keeper%20Hezrel\"&gt;Titan Keeper Hezrel&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji learned of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; contained beneath Nazmir, &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, and the threat that it posed if released.\nLater on, Talanji personally went with the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to do battle with the blood trolls' leader, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ma%27da%20Ateena\"&gt;Grand Ma'da Ateena&lt;/a&gt;, their combined efforts leading to the matriarch's demise. She then ordered the &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; to fire upon the reawakened &lt;a href=\"Taloc\"&gt;Taloc&lt;/a&gt;, causing it to fall deep within the depths of &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;. Her mission accomplished, she returned to Zuldazar.\nAt some point, Talanji participated in a meeting with Rokhan and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Dreven\"&gt;Blood Prince Dreven&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Zo%27bal%20Ruins\"&gt;Zo'bal Ruins&lt;/a&gt; about the status of the Alliance and Horde in the region. She wondered why &lt;a href=\"Ranger%20Captain%20Areiel\"&gt;Ranger Captain Areiel&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;-reinforced Necropolis did not come. After Dreven left, she expressed distrust for the &lt;a href=\"san%27layn\"&gt;san'layn&lt;/a&gt; and returned to Zuldazar.\nZandalar Forever.\nAs Zul's treachery was revealed during the &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar%20storyline\"&gt;Zuldazar storyline&lt;/a&gt;, he launched a full invasion on &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. Weakened and saddened by the loss of &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;, the horrors of war began to set in for Talanji. Rastakhan, wanting to protect his family and kingdom, made a bargain with Bwonsamdi for the power to defeat Zul, in exchange for binding the souls of his bloodline to the Death Loa forever. Talanji felt that something was off, but her father assured her that he had taken care of everything.\nAs Zul's army of blood trolls, traitorous &lt;a href=\"Atal%27zul\"&gt;Atal'zul&lt;/a&gt; fanatics, &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; allies, and &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; advanced upon the city, Talanji rallied the civilians to take arms against the invaders in &lt;a href=\"the%20Zocalo\"&gt;the Zocalo&lt;/a&gt;. Although the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, Zul's armies were routed and Zul himself killed with the aid of the remaining Zandalari loa.\nA Warchief's legacy.\nRokhan received word that the mad &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; had returned from the dead with an army of undead trolls, having somehow escaped Bwonsamdi's grasp. After aiding the Darkspears on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; requested that &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s ashes be placed in &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt;, the resting place of Zandalari kings and mighty troll leaders. Princess Talanji accepted and guided Gadrin and the Horde Speaker to the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Road\"&gt;Golden Road&lt;/a&gt; of Atal'dazar. There, Gadrin reviewed his old pupil's many achievements and great deeds, Talanji admitting she had previously heard of Vol'jin and admired his deeds for some time.\nHowever, it turned out that the urn did not contain the warchief's soul, nor did Bwonsamdi know anything about where it might be. Thus, on the Death Loa's orders, Talanji, Gadrin, and Rokhan held a s\u00e9ance to discover what they could about Vol'jin's whereabouts. With the presence of his old teacher and friend, Vol'jin appeared, not to reveal what happened to him, but to say that the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; were in turmoil: G'huun's influence was spreading without the Grand Seal, and trolls of the past and present alike cried out for justice against the Blood God. The time to end G'huun was nigh and Vol'jin requested they use &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;his glaive&lt;/a&gt; to stab G'huun's corpse to draw his blood and show all of Zandalar that the old god is dead. Talanji then accompanied a team of Horde adventurers into the &lt;a href=\"Underrot\"&gt;Underrot&lt;/a&gt; and Uldir to defeat G'huun (The Alliance was instead joined by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;.)\nAfter the deed was done, Vol'jin encouraged the Speaker to walk with Talanji as they presented their victory to the Zandalari people. While Talanji was initially hesitant, Vol'jin assured her that none of this would have been possible without her initiative, wisdom, and courage. As the princess gives an impassioned speech about Zandalar's victory over the old god's forces, Vol'jin claims that she is now the true leader of the Zandalari.\nTides of Vengeance.\nAfter receiving word that the Alliance had mounted an attack through &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji conferred with her father about how to deal with this new threat. They determined that while Rastakhan would defend the city, Talanji herself would lead the armies of Zandalari against the Alliance. To that end she enlisted the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; with rallying the Zandalari. As the Zandalari clashed against the Alliance at the Blood Gate, she gave the order to rescue Rokhan who had been captured by &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Telaamon\"&gt;Blademaster Telaamon&lt;/a&gt;. With the Alliance defeated at the Blood Gate, Talanji gave the order for the combined Zandalari and Horde armies to push into Nazmir. To her surprise, a thick fog penetrated the region which prevented the two armies from finding the Alliance.\nAfter the reunited &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;Gob Squad&lt;/a&gt; rebuilt the &lt;a href=\"A.F.M.O.D.\"&gt;A.F.M.O.D.&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji empowered it with the powers of &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt; and fought to retake the Zul'jan Ruins. With Zul'jan secured, Talanji, Rokhan, and the Speaker headed towards &lt;a href=\"Zalamar\"&gt;Zalamar&lt;/a&gt; to do battle against the Alliance. She gave the order for the Alliance forces within the village to be wiped out in order to find the source of the fog and the Alliance fleet. Following the death of Blademaster Telaamon, Talanji led the army to the coast of Nazmir where to her surprise discovered that the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt; last seen in her father's vault. Realizing that the Alliance must have taken it, Talanji sought to disperse the fog and retrieve the scepter. However, she discovered that the Alliance had attuned the fog to the artifact and thus with no other options left to her, Talanji destroyed the scepter. Following the destruction of the Abyssal Scepter, Talanji and her allies learned that Telaamon and his forces were bait to lure them away from Dazar'alor in order to weaken the city's defenses.\nRealizing that the city was in danger, the combined Zandalari and Horde army rushed back to defend the city, with Talanji among them. Amidst the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;fighting&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji discovered that her best friend Apari was trapped under a broken pillar. Worried for her father, Talanji made the decision to rush on ahead towards him while promising to send aid to her old friend. Talanji subsequently discovered her dying father who with his last breaths apologized to his daughter before he siphoned the power of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; into her. Bwonsamdi himself then appeared before Talanji who demanded to know what he had done to her, unaware of the pact her father made that bound his bloodline to the loa of graves. In response, Bwonsamdi merely revealed that her father never told her about their bargain. When asked by her guards about what to do about the fleeing Alliance, she turned towards Bwonsamdi, who with his gesture encouraged Talanji to order the Horde to go after the Alliance.\nDuring her father's funeral, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; told Talanji that he understood the pain of losing a father and let her know that if there was anything he could do for her, she shouldn't hesitate to ask. At the same Nathanos encouraged her to channel her grief into vengeance against the Alliance. With Zandalari navy in ruins she wondered if the Horde would abandon the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; but was reassured by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde would not turn their back on their allies. The resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; made Talanji uneasy as it reminded her of what &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; did to her beloved &lt;a href=\"Rezan\"&gt;Rezan&lt;/a&gt;. While convinced that the Alliance must be brought to justice for her father's death, Talanji was determined to not let rage blind her or make her forgot the honor of the Zandalari.\nWhen Baine wished to speak to &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; once more, Talanji performed a seance to call on his spirit. With all that Sylvanas had done to strain the Horde's unity, Baine had to know who the voice that spoke to Vol'jin telling him to make her warchief really was. But Vol'jin's memory had been muddled by death, denied for him by shadows that he knew were coming for his friends. Spirits of the dead attacked the seance, and Vol'jin realized Baine's question was a good one if someone was trying to have him killed for asking it. At Vol'jin's request, they traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and called on his spirit there to shed some light on the mystery. As they searched, more spirits attacked them, and Vol'jin realized that that day on the Shore, something wasn't right with the way the demons' blades slipped past his guard as if the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; had forsaken him. Even now he still could not hear their voices, and no matter how much he called to Bwonsamdi, the loa of death was not answering. He realized that something had been helping the Legion that day to ensure that Vol'jin died.\nVol'jin, Talanji, and Baine traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; revealed that he had not been ignoring Vol'jin's previous cries for aid; rather, he had not heard them at all. They confronted Bwonsamdi to ask him if he was the one who had told the shadow hunter to make Sylvanas the warchief, which Bwonsamdi denied. Even as much as Bwonsamdi was all for war and death, Sylvanas took things too far, and besides that Sylvanas kept the souls of what she killed as undead instead of releasing them for Bwonsamdi to claim. Troubled by their words, Bwonsamdi agreed to help them find out who had really told Vol'jin to put Sylvanas in charge.\nBwonsamdi opened a &lt;a href=\"%3ADeath%20Gate\"&gt;:Death Gate&lt;/a&gt; to one of his rivals in the ownership of souls: the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Like Bwonsamdi, the Lich King told Vol'jin that he was not responsible and that Sylvanas was upsetting the balance of life and death. Furthermore, the Lich King informed Vol'jin that he had been altered more than he realized and as neither undead nor damned he did not belong in the Frozen Throne. The Lich King sent &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s after them, forcing them to flee through Bwonsamdi's gate. Realizing that Vol'jin's spirit was getting help from some other power, Bwonsamdi also sent them to speak to the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;. Eyir informed the group that Vol'jin had been \"touched by the hand of valor\" and become something beyond even her power to forge, but whoever it was that had aided him was was not the same person who had told him to make Sylvanas warchief. Back at the Necropolis, Bwonsamdi mused that while Eyir and the Lich King were not his only rivals they were the ones he thought most likely to be behind it. He urged Vol'jin to search not the living world but the Shadowlands for his answers. Vol'jin agreed to return to the Other Side, with the promise that if he found anything he would send word.\nQueen of Zandalar.\nSometime after the death of her father, Talanji created a new Zanchuli Council consisting of &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jo%27nok%2C%20Bulwark%20of%20Torcali\"&gt;Jo'nok, Bulwark of Torcali&lt;/a&gt; (replacing Vol'kaal), &lt;a href=\"High%20Prelate%20Rata\"&gt;High Prelate Rata&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rakera\"&gt;General Rakera&lt;/a&gt; (replacing Jakra'zet), and &lt;a href=\"Lashk\"&gt;Lashk&lt;/a&gt;, the first &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt; to sit on the Council. As she prepared to undergo the rite of queens and kings, she called for &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; to stand by her side. However, before Talanji could begin the sacred ritual, dissidents led by &lt;a href=\"Samara\"&gt;the White Widow&lt;/a&gt; rose up in protest of a priest of Bwonsamdi becoming their queen. In response, Talanji and her allies dealt with the protests by making the dissenters see reason and allowed them to bend the knee, however not all chose to accept and instead fought to the death for their opinions.\nWith the fighting quelled, Talanji preceded with the ritual of queens and kings. As she received the blessings of the Zanchuli Council, she, the speaker, and the Council were attacked Samara, the White Widow herself. Amidst the fighting, Talanji offered Samara the chance to surrender, but she refused and was slain. With blessings of the Zanchuli Council, and the enemy dead, Talanji moved forward to face the judgment of the loa. During the trial, &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt; tested how far Talanji would go to sacrifice for her people and her commitment to defend the weak, &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt; addressed the importance of the pack and its allies, specifically mentioning &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;, and even the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt; tested her commitment. All that remained was &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, and the loa of graves offered Talanji a chance to be freed of the pact by giving him the head of Sylvanas Windrunner. Surprised and stunned by this offer, Talanji, moved by her personal sense of honor, rejected betraying the Horde in such a manner and decided to remain beholden to her father's bargain with Bwonsamdi. The death loa merely remarked that it was a shame and gave her his blessing.\nHaving passed the trials, Talanji was declared the Queen of Zandalari. Recognizing that the Horde sacrificed for the Zandalari and vice versa, Talanji declared that only a pledge of loyalty would honor that commitment. Thus, the Zandalari joined the Horde, as its equals. As part of the Horde, Talanji selected &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worthy champions&lt;/a&gt; to represent the might of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. After they proved the might of the Zandalari, Talanji called them to return &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; where she blessed them with the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Zandalari\"&gt;Heritage of the Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, encouraged them to wear it with pride, and declared them among the greatest champions of the Zandalari.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt; was arrested and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Zelling&lt;/a&gt; was killed for their parts in freeing &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; from Horde captivity, Talanji felt that Baine should have been given a chance to face his accusers and answer for his supposed crime. She thanked the Horde and Sylvanas for their help but did not plan to follow the warchief blindly.\nAfter Talanji was informed of &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, she remarked that Zandalar was still reeling from G'huun and that the awakening of another Old God was troubling news. Believing that the &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;Gift of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; would consume the Speaker's soul, Talanji directed them to go to the Altar of Akunda in the Terrace of the Chosen in order to for them to be cleansed of N'Zoth's gift. She further instructed the Speaker to gather their allies in order to take back the relics used to free and empower Xal'atath before they could be used against the Horde.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; called their &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji was the only Horde leader not to pick a side and the armies of the Zandalari Empire neither aided Saurfang's revolutionaries nor &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Sylvanas's loyalists&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadows Rising.\nThough not a member of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, she accepted an invitation to attend a meeting. After the late arrival, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; explained how she was confident that &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; could have intervened on their behalf if they were intercepted at sea by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Talanji cut in that &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; could to do nothing for them. The queen of Zandalar had not forgotten that it was &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; that led the Alliance against her people in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, subsequently blaming her for Rastakhan's death, and thus objected to peace with Jaina. Sensing her hostility, &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; was quick to remind her that she had to accept that Derek was one of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and that the Forsaken were the Horde.\nHowever, Talanji was unmoved and declared that the Zandalari were Horde as well. She then called on the Horde to respond to the Zandalari wounds and was distressed at only receiving support from &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; and the . The subsequent friction in the meeting forced &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to call the meeting adjourned, where soon afterwards Talanji was the target of a failed assassination that was foiled by &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; guiding &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; into saving her, something the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; later admitted to Talanji. Disheartened by the council's response and disturbed by the assassination attempt, Talanji returned to &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde Council still worried about her. Desiring her friendship, the Council decided that they wouldn't give up and empowered Zekhan, still grieving the loss of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her. Thus, Zekhan's arrived to Dazar'alor as the Horde &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt;. He arrived just when Talanji was hearing her subjects' pleas, such as allowing &lt;a href=\"Bezime\"&gt;Bezime&lt;/a&gt;'s daughter &lt;a href=\"Nav%27rae\"&gt;Nav'rae&lt;/a&gt; to wed &lt;a href=\"Khila\"&gt;Khila&lt;/a&gt;. Upon seeing Zekhan, Talanji declared that they could have sent worse, noting privately to herself that they could have Thrall, whom she might never trust for his stubborn loyalty to Jaina. Though tempted to send Zekhan away, Talanji decided to give him a chance which proved beneficial when he later aided her against a second assassination attempt by a war band of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Empire\"&gt;Heart of the Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Talanji had a nightmare about being devoured by &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;, she called out for Bwonsamdi as she awoke and the loa responded to the summons. When Talanji revealed her nightmare to him, he deduced that she only experienced because of her guilt and warned her that something had to do done soon. When a vexed Talanji wondered how the Widow's Bite grew in strength so quickly and asked what they could to stop them, Bwonsamdi remarked that they were afraid of him controlling her, and they feared what his queen, a queen of death, might become. When Talanji shouted back that she wasn't his queen, the loa told her to tell them that. He then revealed that due to burning his shrines, breaking the magic that protects them, and killing priests, they have weakened him. He further enlightened her that due to her father's deal, binding them together, she weakened as well.\nWhen Talanji asked him what to do, Bwonsamdi remarked that she already knew what to do, making her remember that she could call upon the Horde for aid. Though angered by working with the Horde for working with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji saw it as the only way forward but declared that if she was to abandon her pride to the Horde then Bwonsamdi shall abandon their pact. However, Bwonsamdi remarked that while it could be done, she would regret it as losing the loyalty of a god would have drawbacks. Calling her a reckless child, Bwonsamdi told Talanji that she was lucky that he was the loa he was working and not another like &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt;. Once more remarking that she would regret, Bwonsamdi consented to deal that as long as she protected his shrines and kept them safe, then when he was strong again their pact would no more. However, he warned that she might not like what it means to be all alone.\nAfter Zekhan reported the second assassination on Talanji to the Horde Council, Rokhan personally arrived to Dazar'alor in order to help Talanji against the Widow's Bite. Rokhan and Zekhan then tried to get Talanji to call on the Horde for support, but the young queen refused. When &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; was captured by the Zandalari, the spymaster was thrown into a cell within &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. When he requested an audience with Queen Talanji, he was ignored as she was focused on combating the Widow's Bite unaware that Shaw had discovered that the rebels were working with &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, she was caught off-guard by the arrival of Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; who revealed that they had uncovered that the Widow's Bite were working together with the Sylvanas loyalists. This motivated Talanji to call her forces for direct battle against the threat by ordering them into &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; as well call on the Horde for aid.\nDuring the subsequent skirmish between the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; forces and their enemies, Zekhan became mortally wounded after saving children that were to be sacrificed. The young troll then fell into &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, but was yanked from it and placed back into his body. When Zekhan described what he experienced, an outraged Talanji demanded to know how such a hero could suffer that fate. It was then that Bwonsamdi told them about the Maw, how everyone was going there now, and it was taking all he had left just to keep as many &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s away from there that he could.\nUpon learning that her old friend &lt;a href=\"Apari\"&gt;Apari&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the Widow's Bite, Talanji felt that she had failed so many, only for Bwonsamdi to remark that there was still time to protect them. In this moment of doubt and fear, Talanji asked Bwonsamdi to let her speak to her father, only for the loa of graves to deny her this telling that she needed to find her won strength, her own way. Admitting that it was strange coming from him, Bwonsamdi told her that there was always hope, as death brings life, with the great wheel turning slowly and as bodies decay new life springs from it.\nTalanji grew strength from Bwonsamdi's words and rallied her forces together, which soon bolstered by the Horde. While heading towards &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; to aid the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; in battle, the Horde forces were approached by &lt;a href=\"Tayo\"&gt;Tayo&lt;/a&gt;, the former lieutenant of the Widow's Bite who had grown increasingly disgusted with Apari's tactics, especially those against children. At first, the wary Talanji summoned a crackling bolt of death magic, ready to retaliate, however, Tayo defected to the Horde, with Thrall later noting that her aid proved instrumental in saving them from Blightcaller's traps, and during the fighting itself Tayo and Talanji killed Apari. Though Nathanos managed to escape the battlefield, the Horde was successful in preventing Bwonsamdi's death.\nIn the aftermath of their victory, Talanji celebrated with the rest of the Horde and was warmly welcomed to the Horde Council. She freed Shaw from his cell under the condition that he abide by Thrall's request to deliver the captured &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; to the Alliance, and allowed Tayo to rejoin the Zandalari Empire. At Tayo's request, Talanji allowed her to serve as the Zandalari ambassador to the Horde. She personally came to say farewell to Zekhan and informed him that when Zandalar was strong, she would personally come to Orgrimmar to visit him. She was then invited by Thrall to join the hunt for Sylvanas Windrunner when she was ready.\nFollowing the Horde's departure from Dazar'alor, Talanji was approached by Bwonsamdi, who had come to honor his pact with her, only for the queen to decide to remain bond to him. However, she remarked that while he would still be the loa of kings, all of the loa are crucial to their survival. Due to being restored to power and being grateful to her, Bwonsamdi spared enough power to allow Talanji to reunite with her father. Rastakhan then informed his daughter that he was proud of the queen she had become. As Bwonsamdi took him back under his care, he informed Talanji that she must remember that she is the queen &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; deserves and to be brave.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nTalanji, with &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; serving as her plus one, was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;. During the ceremony &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; stood with them, and during the reception she spoke with &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;.\nApperance.\nTalanji is a tall troll with grayish-white skin, with bright blue eyes and fangs protruding from her mouth.As a priestess and member of the royal family of Zandalar she wears a long dress with white, yellow, dark purple and violet colors, golden hats with feathers on the sides and a gold and white headdress adorned with feathers and fangs on her head.\nAbilities.\nAs a priestess Talanji has access to divine magic due to her connection with the loa, especially with the Loa of kings Rezan and the Loa of death Bwonsamdi, being able to cast multiple spells such as creating shields and controlling the wind.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nNazmir.\nWe must be wary.

Aided by her fellow Zandalari and backed by &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"shadow%20hunter\"&gt;shadow hunter&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a contingent of his scouts and warriors, Talanji's newly created expedition ventured into the swamps of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;. At Rokhan's direction, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jan%20Ruins\"&gt;Zul'jan Ruins&lt;/a&gt; was converted into the expedition's main outpost. After discovering that the blood trolls sought to unleash &lt;a href=\"Taloc\"&gt;Taloc&lt;/a&gt; on Zuldazar, Talanji and Rokhan sought to enlist the aid of the loa to aid them in the battle against the blood trolls, unaware that &lt;a href=\"Torga\"&gt;Torga&lt;/a&gt; had been killed, &lt;a href=\"Krag%27wa\"&gt;Krag'wa&lt;/a&gt; was under assault by the blood trolls, and &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Hir'eek&lt;/a&gt; corrupted into serving &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs they sought the aid of &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s would encounter his worshiper, &lt;a href=\"Hanzabu\"&gt;Hanzabu&lt;/a&gt;, who brought them to the &lt;a href=\"Necropolis%20%28Nazmir%29\"&gt;Necropolis&lt;/a&gt; to meet with him. After tasking the adventurer with cleansing his temple of the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; who had abandoned Bwonsamdi for G'huun, Bwonsamdi agreed to pledge his powers to the fight against the blood trolls in exchange for one million &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s. The ritual to finalize their contract was interrupted by the blood trolls and their matriarch who were successfully fought off. For being attacked in his own temple, Bwonsamdi declared that the blood trolls would be mighty sorry. Thus the expedition gained the loa of death as their ally. The expedition also recruited numerous &lt;a href=\"tortollan\"&gt;tortollan&lt;/a&gt;s to their cause after saving Torga's corpse from being corrupted by G'huun's &lt;a href=\"herald\"&gt;herald&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jungo\"&gt;Jungo&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Hir'eek was killed, Krag'wa would be liberated from the blood troll assault, and the loa unleash his fury on them. With their new allies and Horde &lt;a href=\"Gob%20Squad\"&gt;reinforcements&lt;/a&gt;, Talanji's expedition launched an assault on the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Nazman\"&gt;blood troll capital&lt;/a&gt; that saw to the death of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ma%27da%20Ateena\"&gt;Grand Ma'da Ateena&lt;/a&gt;, the matriarch of the blood trolls, and Taloc being blasted into &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt; itself."}

He then personally rescued Genn himself from a similar fate, humbling the Gilnean king after his close encounter with death, and beginning a friendship between the two of them.\nDragonflight.\nAs of , he is now the Captain of The Moonlit Rose, ferrying between the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nGossip.\nGreetings, friend. I am Talar Oaktalon. It has been many years since my first voyage to Gilneas. That was a different time for both of our people. A different world, even. To think now, after all the suffering both kaldorei and Gilneans have endured, we can make this return journey with no trepidation but merely... tranquil purpose. &lt;Talar inhales deeply before exhaling with a smile.&gt; Welcome aboard the Moonlit Rose."}

Some talbuks fled Argus with the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; aboard the \"&lt;a href=\"Genedar\"&gt;Genedar&lt;/a&gt;\". On &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; (later &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;), a world the \"Genedar\" crashed on, the alien species thrived, becoming a viable food source for the native predators and a part of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish culture. Talbuks live primarily in the plains of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; but could also be found in before its corruption. They usually congregate underneath trees, but some groups of them are seen wandering with their respective patriarchs. The talbuks are diurnal creatures. During winter nights, they dig hollows in the snow in which to curl up together as a cluster in order to preserve heat.\nTalbuks are a type of wild, stag-like creatures, and a favored food of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Moongraze%20Stag\"&gt;Moongraze Stag&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Moongraze%20Buck\"&gt;Bucks&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; reminded the draenei of the talbuks.\nThere is also a herd of talbuks living in the &lt;a href=\"Stormspire\"&gt;Stormspire&lt;/a&gt;'s Eco-Dome. Talbuk does are non-aggressive beasts that alert surrounding males when attacked, while the decidedly more aggressive sires use their large hooves to stun attackers. When weakened, these talbuks can be tagged for &lt;a href=\"Aurine%20Moonblaze\"&gt;Aurine Moonblaze&lt;/a&gt;, a druid sent by the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the Ethereal technology's effects on wildlife. \nOne breed of talbuks is known for its twelve prongs that are sharp and dangerous. They were hunted for the orcish &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt; ritual. Most talbuks are peaceful creatures that will only attack when they are defending their herd. Despite their docile nature, talbuks have been known to gore seasoned warriors to death when threatened.\nTalbuks became sickly and corrupt as a result of Draenor's fel corruption and subsequent transformation into Outland.\nThey grow their horns to full size at an early age.\nHaving had to adapt to the new landscape of the ravaged planet they inhabit, the talbuks of Argus have evolved chitinous plates. The surviving &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; use them as mounts.\nAs a mount.\nThey are also a special &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt; available for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players exalted with the &lt;a href=\"Kurenai\"&gt;Kurenai&lt;/a&gt; faction and to &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; players exalted with the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; faction. The faction mounts are available in White, Tan, Silver, and Cobalt, with each color being available as a Riding Talbuk and War (armored) Talbuk.\nThere are also Dark Riding and Dark War Talbuks from the &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; merchants which cost &lt;a href=\"Halaa%20Battle%20Token\"&gt;Halaa Battle Token&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Halaa%20Research%20Token\"&gt;Halaa Research Token&lt;/a&gt;s to purchase.\nAlong with a new talbuk model, a variety of new talbuk mounts was introduced in the \"\" expansion, obtainable through a variety of methods.\nAs a companion pet.\n&lt;a href=\"Young%20Talbuk\"&gt;Young Talbuk&lt;/a&gt; has a chance to drop from &lt;a href=\"Traveler%27s%20Pet%20Supplies\"&gt;Traveler's Pet Supplies&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a hunter pet.\nTalbuks are tamable since &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;. As hunter pets, they are classified as &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; hunters start with an Argussian talbuk pet."}

Talents may be passive bonuses or active abilities. Each class has its own selection, with 21 talents split over 7 tiers. Talents are limited by level, with a new tier becoming available each 5-10 levels for all classes. Talents are class-specific, and a majority of choices depend on &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;. Talents offer a further level of customization beyond class and specialization selection, and can be changed very easily and cheaply.\nFull listings of the talents available to each class can be found on that class's abilities page, e.g.: &lt;a href=\"Priest%20abilities\"&gt;Priest abilities&lt;/a&gt;.\nTalents can be swapped at any time while in a &lt;a href=\"rest\"&gt;rest&lt;/a&gt;ed area, or for a short time after queuing into an instanced dungeon, raid, or PvP content. &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20the%20Clear%20Mind\"&gt;Tome of the Clear Mind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20the%20Tranquil%20Mind\"&gt;Tome of the Tranquil Mind&lt;/a&gt; is required in other situations; &lt;a href=\"Codex%20of%20the%20Clear%20Mind\"&gt;Codex of the Clear Mind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Codex%20of%20the%20Tranquil%20Mind\"&gt;Codex of the Tranquil Mind&lt;/a&gt; can be used in group settings.\nGaining talents.\nTalents are split over 6 tiers, with 3 talents on each.

The prime form of character augmentation and customisation in World of Warcraft, talents were the predecessors of &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s, predating the introduction of fixed specializations by many years. Originally a complex and intricate system of possible combinations, since &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; talents have been reduced and simplified, with many of their earlier functions being split off into other mechanisms.

While the current system features a fraction of the number of talents previously known, a large amount of talents have been converted into specialization-specific or class-wide abilities, with many key abilities having started life in the higher tiers of a class's pre-historic talent trees.\nPet talent points.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;s enjoyed &lt;a href=\"hunter%20talents\"&gt;their own talent system&lt;/a&gt;, featuring trees in which hunters could spend each pet's talent points. The pet talent system was removed with \"Mists of Pandaria\", with many talents removed, and the rest converted into specialization-specific &lt;a href=\"pet%20abilities\"&gt;pet abilities&lt;/a&gt;."}

Active and passive talents were arranged in three separate 'trees', with access to progressively \"higher\" or \"deeper\" tiers of talents granted by spending sufficient talent points in that tree. Talent trees were the predecessors to class &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s, predating the introduction of actual specializations by many years, with a player's choice of talents often determining which &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;combat role&lt;/a&gt; they were fit to perform. Talent trees acted to limit access to talents by the character's level; by where they had chosen to place their previous talent points; and later by specialization. \nTalent trees created a focused, limiting relationship with talents, with some of the most powerful talents placed deep within their trees, meaning only players who chose to spend the vast majority of their points in that tree were able to acquire them. Conversely, some talents that were useful to players of all kinds were made available on the lower tiers. This can be seen to have forced players to focus on their chosen priorities, with every choice of talent affecting all future options, and every unlocked tier in one tree meaning a lost tier of talents in another. Some talents also required the choice of specific talents earlier in the tree, and most talents had multiple ranks, with players often having to spend 5 points in a talent to gain its total effect. The majority of all talents were passive, with the few active talents in each tree usually powerful and desirable abilities.\nBecause talent choice was therefore cumulative and limiting, the term 'talent build' or simply 'build' was used to describe the total combination and emphasis of a character's talent choices (and to a lesser degree other enhancements). A player's spread of points across their trees was expressed numerically, such as (10/0/61) for a tanking warrior specced deep into the Protection tree, or (0/37/34) for a PvP druid balancing healing with survival. Players could choose to spec deep into a certain tree, focusing on improving their abilities in that particular area; or to balance that focus with varying amounts of talents from other trees, perhaps gaining crucial secondary-role abilities and avoiding over-specializing. Some players chose to create true hybrid builds, such as mages combining Frost and Fire talents. With a maximum of 71 talent points in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and more than 80 talents for each class, the many ranks available for most talents presented some classes with more than 230 possible places to spend their points, and myriad ways of building their character's spec. Placement of talent points within each tree's 11 tiers was a substantially complex matter, with numerous online calculators and recommended builds, and constant debate over the best combinations. \nA common approach was for players to spend enough points in a tree to reach the top talent, usually an extremely powerful ability that was therefore only available to players who had specialized fully in that tree, before spending their remaining points in the often more desirable talents of another tree. Many talents were considered to be 'filler' talents, granting little benefit but being placed in such a position that taking them was required in order to gain access to higher tiers or other particularly desirable talents. Choice of talents was often focused upon access to certain key abilities, with builds designed to hit these talents while spending as little as possible on less desirable options. Once these key points were decided upon, choice of build often became a matter of which of the less desirable options were preferred (or at least which were the least useless), since a certain number of them had to be chosen.\nWith the introduction of &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.0.1\"&gt;Patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, the talent trees were for the first time locked, with initially only the tree corresponding to a character's chosen specialization being available for selection. The trees were also simplified, with many talents removed or reduced in number of ranks, and the total number of talent points reduced to 41. By spending 31 points in their 'primary tree' players were able to unlock their other trees, and could then spend their remaining 10 points as they wished. However, because of the progressive nature of the trees, this limited players to relatively insignificant talents from their 'secondary trees', with players having enough points to access the first tier of both of their secondary trees, but the second tier of only one of their secondary trees. This was intended, serving to allow Blizzard to focus on creating three separate and succinct specs for each class, with the aim of improving balance and deepening and refining the character and playstyle of each spec, and was also argued by some to make the previously overly-complex talent trees far easier for new players to get to grips with.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; talent trees were removed entirely, with the number of talents vastly reduced and placed in six tiers of three talents each. Access to talents was no longer limited by specialization, although since many talents had been changed into specialization-specific abilities, arguably this was of less significance than it might have seemed. \nWith &lt;a href=\"Dragonflight\"&gt;Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, talent trees were re-introduced.\nTrivia.\nWhile the direction of progression on talent trees was perfectly clear - beginning at the top and progressing \"deeper\" into the tree - many have remarked on the possibility for confusion, with \"higher\" tiers in fact displayed progressively \"lower\" in the display, and the talents at the \"top\" of the tree being found at the \"bottom\" of the screen. Since the form of the 'talent tree' analogy is in fact the reverse of that found in real trees, it has been jokingly suggested that \"talent roots\" may actually be a more accurate term. "}

By \"World of Warcraft\"'s &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;second expansion&lt;/a&gt;, max-level characters had 71 talent points to spend, with 11 tiers in each tree and more than 80 talents for each class. The many ranks available for most talents presented some classes with more than 230 possible places to spend their points, and myriad ways of building their character's spec.\nTalent trees created a focused, limiting relationship with talents, with some of the most powerful talents placed deep within their trees, meaning only players who chose to spend the vast majority of their points in that tree were able to acquire them. Conversely, some talents that were useful to players of all kinds were made available on the lower tiers. This can be seen to have forced players to focus on their chosen priorities, with every choice of talent affecting all future options, and every unlocked tier in one tree meaning a lost tier of talents in another. Some talents also required the choice of specific talents earlier in the tree. \nBecause talent choice was therefore cumulative and limiting, the term 'talent build' or simply 'build' was used to describe the total combination and emphasis of a character's talent choices (and to a lesser degree other enhancements). A player's spread of points across their trees was expressed numerically, such as (10/0/61) for a tanking warrior specced deep into the Protection tree, or (0/37/34) for a PvP druid balancing healing with survival. Players could choose to spec deep into a certain tree, focusing on improving their abilities in that particular area; or to balance that focus with varying amounts of talents from other trees, perhaps gaining crucial secondary-role abilities and avoiding over-specializing. Some players chose to create true hybrid builds, such as mages combining Frost and Fire talents. With a maximum of 71 talent points in \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", choice of talents held a significant amount of complexity, with numerous online calculators and recommended builds, and constant debate over the best combinations. \nA common approach was for players to spend enough points in a tree to reach the top talent, usually an extremely powerful ability that was therefore only available to players who specialized fully in that tree, before spending their remaining points in the often more desirable talents of another tree. Many talents were considered to be 'filler' talents, granting little benefit but being placed in such a position that taking them was required in order to gain access to higher tiers or other particularly desirable talents. Choice of talents was often focused upon access to certain key abilities, with builds designed to hit these talents while spending as few points as possible on less desirable options. Once these key points were decided upon, choice of build often became a matter of which of the less desirable options were preferred (or at least which were the least useless), since a certain number of them had to be chosen.\nA player's selection of talents was originally also far more binding and difficult to reverse than it is in the game today. Talents could only be reset by visiting a &lt;a href=\"class%20trainer\"&gt;class trainer&lt;/a&gt;, and the amount of gold required to do so was substantial, and rose with each reset. Players wishing to change spec, such as a DPS-oriented warrior wishing to tank in a dungeon, would have to spend time and money seeking the services of a trainer, making participating in low-level dungeons far more difficult, while even max-level players who often played in different &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;s had to spend substantial amounts of money switching between different talent builds. Players therefore often chose their talents with far more permanence; players wishing to participate in PvP as they levelled, or wishing to run dungeons as healers while still being capable of dealing a reasonable amount of damage, would have to make numerous compromises in their builds, with respeccing both a costly and time-consuming act. For this reason &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Talent%20Specialization\"&gt;Dual Talent Specialization&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, for the then princely sum of , making it possible for the first time to switch between two sets of talents. \n\"Cataclysm\".\nWith &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s were introduced, creating three fixed specs for each class with a pre-determined combat role. Talents continued to be significant choices, but were no longer so critically responsible for determining the player's capabilities. Dozens of talents were removed, and others saw their number of ranks reduced. The number of talent points was reduced accordingly from 71 to 41. \nWith the introduction of specializations, talent trees were for the first time locked, with initially only the tree corresponding to a character's chosen specialization being available for selection. By spending 31 points in their 'primary tree' players were able to unlock their other trees, and could then spend any remaining points as they wished. However, because of the progressive nature of the trees, this limited players to relatively insignificant talents from their 'secondary trees', with players having enough points to access the first tier of both of their secondary trees, but the second tier of only one of their secondary trees. This was intended, serving to allow Blizzard to focus on creating three separate and succinct specs for each class, with the aim of improving balance and deepening and refining the character and playstyle of each spec, and was also argued by some to make the previously overly-complex talent trees far easier for new players to get to grips with.\nThese changes resulted in a far smaller degree of choice in talent selection, with each max-level spec capable of a relatively small number of possible builds. While players were still free to spend their last 10 points in any tree, some players bemoaned the loss of true hybrid specs from the game, with many previous combinations now made impossible. Additionally, while talents remained the source of many of players' most powerful abilities, due to the far more limited and rigid nature of the \"Cataclysm\" talent trees, the total number of possible builds at max-level was greatly reduced, in turn reducing the importance of players' talent selections. As later described by Blizzard in the run-up to \"Mists of Pandaria\", the \"Cataclysm\" model made players' choices far less significant, because once the most important talents had been secured, the question of where to spend their remaining points had relatively little impact on their character. In this way, the \"Cataclysm\" model moved players closer to a \"cookie-cutter\" situation, with relatively little talent variation seen between most characters of a given spec. \n\"Cataclysm\" also saw the level requirement of &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Talent%20Specialization\"&gt;Dual Talent Specialization&lt;/a&gt; reduced from 40 to 30, and its price reduced from to a mere , which, coupled with the relative devaluation of gold following the launch of the new expansion, saw the option available to players far earlier in their playing careers. With such a low price, there was little reason for any player of sufficient level not to have purchased the specialization, greatly increasing the numbers of players capable of switching between specs at a moment's notice, especially at lower levels.\n\"Mists of Pandaria\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" saw the largest changes yet to the talent system. Talent trees were removed, with the number of talents vastly reduced and placed in six tiers of three talents each. Talent points were removed entirely, with players instead free to choose a single talent from each tier, and choices in one tier no longer affecting choices in any other, removing most of the strategy from talent selection. Access to talents was also no longer limited by specialization, although since many talents had been changed into specialization-specific abilities, arguably this was of less significance than it might have seemed. In effect, talents live on in the form of the active and passive abilities unique to characters of a given spec, the only difference being that the player need not spend points to acquire them. \nWith talents changed into something more similar to glyphs, \"Mists of Pandaria\" also made it possible for players to remove their own talent selections using items such as &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20the%20Clear%20Mind\"&gt;Tome of the Clear Mind&lt;/a&gt;. For the first time players were able to adjust their own talents on the move, even mid-instance, rather than having to traipse back to their class trainers. As well as facilitating experimentation and variation, this change was also promoted as allowing for a far greater degree of versatility, with players able to change talents in order to meet the demands of a specific encounter, such as facing a particular boss, or catering to the strengths of the opposing team in arena and PvP.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"beta\"&gt;beta&lt;/a&gt; test and early months of \"Mists of Pandaria\", these changes sparked much controversy and debate among players, with numerous threads devoted to the subject on the official forums. Many players felt that the new system stripped them of much of their choice, replacing dozens of talents with only a few, and forced them to choose between talents that were often considered equally undesirable. Some also considered the changes to the talent system to be a further simplification and dumbing-down of the game. Others argued that the new system in fact increased choice; while the previous system had presented dozens of talents to choose from, in practice most end-game players chose very similar builds, with little if any room for customisation. Additionally, what differences were to be found were largely limited to where to place the last few points, and these choices were often considered to make little difference to the player's abilities. In contrast, it was argued, the new system offered players far more choice, and far more significant choices, with most talents representing substantial differences to the player's abilities and playstyle, in spite of the apparent lack of options.\n\"Warlords of Draenor\".\n\"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" largely continued to use talents in the model of \"Mists of Pandaria\", with some specific refinements. The most significant systematic change was that some talent rows now dynamically changed based on the player's current specialization. For example, the second slot of the mage level 75 row contained &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Magic\"&gt;Unstable Magic&lt;/a&gt; for all specializations, but the first and third slots contained &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Tempest\"&gt;Nether Tempest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Supernova\"&gt;Supernova&lt;/a&gt; for Arcane, &lt;a href=\"Living%20Bomb\"&gt;Living Bomb&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blast%20Wave\"&gt;Blast Wave&lt;/a&gt; for Fire, and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Bomb%20%28mage%20talent%29\"&gt;Frost Bomb (mage talent)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Nova\"&gt;Ice Nova&lt;/a&gt; for Frost. While \"Mists of Pandaria\" had a number of talents (such as &lt;a href=\"Incarnation\"&gt;Incarnation&lt;/a&gt;) which changed function depending on the player's selected specialization, in \"Warlords of Draenor\" the ability on the talent row actually changed to a different ability when the player changed specialization. \nThis change made it easier to diversify talents without burdening tooltips, but also made it harder for players to inspect talents for alternate specs. For the first time it was not possible to view each specialization's talents without going to the trouble of learning the spec, making the use of online talent calculators and listings more useful than before.\nWith the level cap raised to 100, \"Warlords\" also introduced a seventh tier of talents, raising the new number of talents available to each spec to 21. However, total number of talents per class varied, with classes such as &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; having only one set of 21 talents for the entire class, while &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s featured several spec-specific options, for a total of 33 talents. Most classes had between 21 and 26 talents.\n\"Dragonflight\".\nWhile \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\", \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", and \"&lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;\" retained the MoP talent system with small tweaks from expansion to expansion, \"&lt;a href=\"Dragonflight\"&gt;Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;\" would introduce a new talent system similar that of the original 2004-2010 system, but with some modernization. According to &lt;a href=\"Ion%20Hazzikostas\"&gt;Ion Hazzikostas&lt;/a&gt;, this system was largely inspired by seeing a new generation of players using traditional talent trees in \"&lt;a href=\"Classic\"&gt;Classic&lt;/a&gt;\" and realizing some things that the development team \u201ckind of lost\u201d.\nWhile the traditional one point per level system remains, there are now two trees: one for your class as a whole (containing utility and general use spells), and one for your chosen spec (which contains the bulk of your throughput options), with available points alternating between the two each level. This opens up far more possible builds than the previous system, but not as many as the original iteration of the talent system.\nPerspective.\nSuccessive expansions have seen talents evolve into something quite different from their original incarnation, with &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s now chosen outright, and most former talents now abilities learnt automatically by players of the corresponding spec. Character customisation as a whole has become far simpler over the years, with changes to the talent system the prime method through which this has been achieved. Though undoubtedly far less important now than in their original form, much of the power of talents to determine the strengths, capabilities and role of a character has not been removed, but rather passed on in the form of specialization. Previously a term used to refer to a player's talent choices, specialization is now the prime method of customising a character after choice of class itself, and has taken on the mantle of much of the power and importance of talent selection."}

Of all WoW fanfiction, Tales of the Past has arguably the most complex storyline and the greatest tie-in to &lt;a href=\"lore\"&gt;lore&lt;/a&gt;. It is also possibly the largest scale machinima movie ever created using recordings from World of Warcraft - with multiple large battle-scenes involving thousands of players participating. It is worth noting that - whist &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; are all present in the trilogy - the movies were filmed before the release of \"\".\nThe series was preceded by a film named \"&lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Eden%20Aurorae\"&gt;Eden Aurorae&lt;/a&gt; Guild Movie\", which was a self-promotion movie for the guild Eden Aurorae. After receiving feedback Maquan started working on the \"Tales of the Past\" trilogy. Maquans own words about the series:\nSynopsis.\nThe story is set after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; in an era of \"relative peace\" and follows the path of Yimo (a gnome mage and officer of Eden Aurorae) and Blazer (rogue in TotP II but later a paladin in TotP III - member of Eden Aurorae &amp; Yimo's student) as they attempt to reunite the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in peace. The Eden Aurorae guild's original aim is to fulfill an oath to kill &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this oath has never been affected by the squabble between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &amp; the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; - but this changes when the guild is forced to aid the Alliance in a battle against the Horde to repay an old favor.\nThe battle is but the beginning of a new wave of tic-tack-toe attacks on both sides. The long feud threatens to escalate as the two sides prepare for one final battle - one that will shatter any hopes of a peace treaty and plunge the world of Azeroth into war - threatening to kill millions. As Yimo and Blazer rush to prevent the battle: &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, has his own plans. \nLucking in the shadows lay one of the greatest threats of all that will call upon Yimo, Blazer and heros, old and new, to rise to the occasion; for the willing adventurers to travel deeper into the unknown; for the world to bear more tragic loses; and - ultimately - the united force of both the Alliance and the Horde to save the world of Azeroth...before it's too late.\nTotP main characters.\n/ Eden Aurorae\n/ The Ancients\n Alliance\n Horde\n Scourge\n Other\nTales of the Past I.\nTales of the Past I (TotP I) is the first movie of the series and was first released on the 2nd of November 2005. As such, it lacks many of the features found in later movies\u2014especially to do with the script and the lack of voiceovers. But despite this, it was one of the greatest movies of its time with one of the biggest battle scenes at its time.\nStoryline.\nThe movie starts in the Broken Back Inn in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; where a group of adventurers is gathered drinking beer. One of the dwarfs begins telling a tale told to him by his grandfather\u2014a story that took place many years ago:\nThe story begins in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; where Yimo, a gnome mage and officer of Eden Aurorae guild, is talking with Simon, a noble of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and an old ally from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The nobles of Stormwind are currently in charge along with the five-year-old king: &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Eden%20Aurorae\"&gt;Eden Aurorae&lt;/a&gt; guild is a group of Alliance adventurers brought together by an oath to defeat &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;\u2014an occurrence that is attempt once a year. The nobles of Stormwind force Yimo and &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Eden%20Aurorae\"&gt;Eden Aurorae&lt;/a&gt; to join with Conrad Schultz, an overzealous &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; officer aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and his 'defense' against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to repay an old favor. After much debating and thought, Yimo is forced to reluctantly agree to the demands and the members of Eden Aurorae are gathered.\nThe Eden Aurorae members meet up with Conrad Schultz and his Alliance army. On route to fight the Horde army, Schultz orders an attack on a defenseless village\u2014which Yimo protests against. However, Yimo is ignored by Schultz and the attack begins. All the Horde\u2014men, women, and children\u2014are killed. Later Schultz hears reports from Alliance scouts that the Horde army is building up in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; and quickly orders his army to head towards them.\nOn arrival, the Horde army is being led by Warchief Gorbag; with his brother Swoog as second in command. The Alliance and Horde armies line up and the commanders on both sides address their troops before proceeding into the mid-ground. There, Gorbag talks with Schultz\u2014remembering him from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and how he has changed since then. He suggests, instead of a full battle that would result in much bloodshed, to settle things in the way of a duel. Schultz agrees and the duel starts. During the duel, Schultz then surrenders to Gorbag\u2014but as Gorbag heads back to his troop, he kills him yelling 'Only a fool trusts in honor!'. Swoog rushs to Gorbag whose dying words are orders to Swoog to begin the attack on the Alliance. Swoog relives memories of their childhood before killing Schultz. The Horde army then charges towards the Alliance army and a full battle ensues.\nBy the end of the battle, the Horde have won and many Alliance soldiers have perished\u2014although only a few Eden Aurorae members actually lost their lives. Swoog debates with the leaders of the other clans and agrees to let the Eden Aurorae go\u2014believing as his brother did that Schultz had changed. He suggested that maybe something had infected the nobles of Stormwind and permits the Eden Aurorae to investigate further. Knowing that this would bring 'dishonor with their fraction', he offers the shelter of his own clan as well as the help from 'The Ancients' guild. However, Swoog warns that some of the other clans will not believe in the 'infection' and thus will begin launching their own attacks. \nFor the next three years, massive attacks are launched on all the major cities of the Alliance. Despite constant appeals by Swoog, it seems like an impossible task to convince the warchief to stop. Rumors begin circulating that Morbid of the Iron Edge clan is gathering the Horde clans together for an even greater attack\u2014one that will shatter any hope of a peace treaty. The Eden Aurorae have little time to reveal the truth before another full-scale war.\nTales of the Past II.\nTales of the Past II (TotP II) is the second movie of the series and was first released on the 16th of June 2006. The film, with a total run time of 41 minutes, it was arguably one of the best and largest scale machinima movie from World of Warcraft at the time. Production of the movie took place over approximately six months to complete and included more than 1000 extras in the form of other World of Warcraft players providing support for epic battle scenes.\nStoryline.\nTotP II occurs four years after the events of TotP I. During those four years, continuous attacks and counter-attacks by the Horde and Alliance have taken place\u2014lead on the Horde side by Morbid of the Iron Edge clan. Any peace treaty has been rejected by the Alliance, namely the nobles of Stormwind. Due to their actions in the battle covered in TotP I, the &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Eden%20Aurorae\"&gt;Eden Aurorae&lt;/a&gt; guild has been thrown out of Stormwind as traitors\u2014therefore the guild is unable to gain any information as to any infection or corruption within Stormwind. To make matters worse, the Horde and the Alliance are preparing for one final battle\u2014one that will shatter any chance of future peace and will lead to another full-scale war.\nYimo and Blazer, a human rogue, take the opportunity to sneak into Stormwind during a celebration party for a recent Alliance victory against the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. In Stormwind, they meet up with Thainor, a human warlock living in the underground of Stormwind. He tells them about Diary of Conrad Schultz, which may contain the clues to the corruption within Conrad Schultz and the rest of Alliance that could prevent the upcoming war. After successfully retrieving the book, they teleport out to their camp in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;\u2014but accidentally end up at the tower of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; instead.\nAt Karazhan, Yimo and Blazer face an ambush from undead members of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; army. Blazer is quickly &lt;a href=\"polymorph\"&gt;polymorph&lt;/a&gt; leaving just Yimo to fight an undead mage. A long fight scene occurs and Yimo eventually wins\u2014although the fight drains much of his strength and giving him a sense of 'emptiness'. Luckily, as more undead Scourge arrive, members of a group of warriors known as 'The Ancient' save the heroes and transport them back to the safety of their camp. \nInitially, no one can understand the strange language written in the Diary of Conrad Schultz\u2014but upon the suggestion of Jubai, an officer of The Ancient, the heroes travel to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to seek the wisest Tauren Druid: &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Gwaar\"&gt;Gwaar&lt;/a&gt;. Accompanied by two Tauren companions\u2014&lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Ball\"&gt;Ball&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Xconzoa\"&gt;Xconzoa&lt;/a&gt;\u2014Yimo and Blazer travel to the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Colossals\"&gt;Twin Colossals&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to find Gwaar. Gwaar informs Yimo that the diary is not written by Conrad Schultz\u2014but is in fact a ritual summoning of some sort\u2014mentioning a place called &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; in southern &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; multiple times. He also hands to Yimo an Orb of Vision\u2014a rare artifact that will store the memories of its carrier. Along the way to Darkwhisper Gorge, the heroes set up camp for the night during which Yimo is visited by the &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, in his dream. Arthas reveals the true purpose of giving the book to Yimo and sending him on this adventure\u2014to drain his purity, his soul, to fill in the missing piece of the book so that he, the Lich King, may use it. He also reveals that there never was any corruption\u2014just the evil in all souls of all the races in Azeroth.\nBlazer, Ball &amp; Xconzoa awake to find Yimo missing. When they follow Yimo's trail to Darkwhisper Gorge, they are confronted by the Scourge army lead by Arthas himself. Blazer leaves Ball &amp; Xconzoa, on their insistence, to save Yimo from a Scourge patrol. Yimo refuses his friend's help and gives him the book and the orb\u2014mentioning how he cannot live and asks Blazer to 'stop them' (referring to the Alliance and the Horde) and to 'stop him' (referring to Arthas) before teleporting Blazer to safety.\nMeanwhile, the armies of the Alliance and the Horde gather near Ironforge for the final battle\u2014the battle that would end all hopes of peace between the two factions. &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Mon%C3%B3ri\"&gt;Mon\u00f3ri&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf officer, tries to reason with &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Serphentos\"&gt;Serphentos&lt;/a&gt;, leader of Ironforge\u2014however Serphentos has no sympathy and wants revenge for his murdered family, the pain they cause. He addresses his Alliance army:\n\" 'Today...Were not only here to defend the mighty capital of Ironforge, were not only here to show the world what the Alliance is made of\u2014No! Today we shall claim our revenge for those who have fallen...And I'll tell you...Do not fear death...For your name shall live in eternity! So I'll ask you...Will you...Follow me...Into legend?! Then follow me!' \"\nAt the same time, the Horde general addresses his troops:\n\" 'Fellow warriors! For too long; we have been slaves to the false treaties of the Alliance! For too long; have our blades thirsted, for revenge! I have held the innocent children...Dying...In my arms, and I shall accept it no more! No! Today will be the day...When we end...This insolence! And bring justice...Back...To the Horde!' \"\nAs the fighting ensues, a Horde hunter unleashes a dragon upon the battle. Mon\u00f3ri quickly heads over to deal with the Horde hunter whist her archers deal with the dragon. Blazer arrives mid-battle and runs, with the Orb of Vision, into the dragon's flame\u2014breaking the orb and spilling Yimo's memories into those around the orb for miles and revealing the Lich King's plan. In the coming days, a memorial service is held for Yimo back in Winterspring, attended by all parties: Eden Aurorae, The Ancients, Alliance, Horde. During the service, Blazer makes a pledge to retrieve Yimo's soul \u2013 stating he\u2019ll do 'whatever it takes'.\nThe scene then moves onto Blazer filling Gwaar upon the events. The Horde and the Alliance are now united against the Lich King, the Eden Aurorae guild has been reinstated into the Alliance and has been given the task of finding a way to defeat Arthas. Blazer asks Gwaar about how to kill someone who is invincible. Gwaar answers by asking Blazer if he has heard of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014sparking everyone else around them to laugh. However, Blazer replies simply with 'Tell me.'\nSoundtrack.\nBelow is the list of music used in TotP II, found from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.edenaurorae.com\"&gt;www.edenaurorae.com&lt;/a&gt;:\nTales of the Past III.\nTales of the Past III (TotP III) is the third and final installment of the series and was first released on the 12th of December 2007. A trailer was released eight months after the first release of TotP II on 12th February 2007\u2014marking the start of filming. Just under an hour and a half long, it is a full feature-length movie. It involved 75 pages of script and took eight months alone to plan.\nTales of the Past III out of the series has the links to lore. The presence of Mograine, Arthas, The Ashbringer, and even a Naaru make for a rich and enjoyable experience. The movie is masterfully devised in such a way to leave the ending open for other opportunists to expand on the story. The film is filled with all kinds of scenes, beautiful, intense, sad, happy, and everything in between. It is an absolute must-see for anyone, even, for that matter, people who don't play World of Warcraft.\nStoryline.\nThe hour of judgment has come. The time for all to show their valor, and their courage... or their weakness.\nWithin Orgrimmar, many orcs publicly announce that the pending negotiations with the Alliance are worthless, that the Humans will betray them once again. Thrall himself believes they will take too much time. While Saurfang does all in his not-inconsiderable power to quell such uprisings, these sentiments seem to be shared by many. Their fortunes change, however, when a lone Mok'Nathal appears at the gates, and Rexxar is ordered to watch the Alliance and determine what they are doing in the war against the Scourge.\nMeanwhile, within the Alliance, discord is ever-present. Mon\u00f3ri and Serphentos do all in their power to help smooth relations between the Alliance and the Horde, but in addition to their angry followers, their own prejudices present a barrier as well. Only the theft of an important artifact, and a mage's quest to recover it, can convince the Alliance that this is necessary.\nAnd while the war rages on Azeroth and Kalimdor, Blazer follows the trail of the Ashbringer, and it's wielder, the dreaded Death Knight, Mograine himself. From Azeroth, to Northrend, to lands unreachable by normal means, Blazer's trail follows, and unless his enemy can help him... he will fall to the darkness that took Arthas.\nSoundtrack.\nBelow is the list of music used in TotP III:\nContradictions to lore.\nDespite the fact that TotP III features numerous tie-ins to the game plot, it also has a lot of contradictions:\nSpeculation.\nThere is a likely theory that makes sense of the presence of a &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the film. It's plausible that that was \"not\", in fact, intended to be a naaru, but merely a representation of the unbound &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, who's character model is absent from the World of Warcraft image files. It makes sense that the Lich King, unwilling to suffer utter defeat, would return to once again merge with &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, returning &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; to him and following with the quote: \"We... had... a... deal...\".\nFalch never elaborated on this, so it is a mere speculation, but after all, it's the closest he could have come to representing the Lich King using WoW models only, and it's much more fitting to the storyline than a sudden, unexplained appearance of a naaru.\nUnfortunate this \"theory\" falls apart due to the fact that Arthas and the Lich King are now fused as a single entity, as they were at the end of the . However, in the book , it would appear that Ner'zhul and the prince are not as fused as it would seem, as three parts of Lich King battle for presidence, a boy, a man, and an orc. Although the period in which the movie was set is several years before the book, it does show that the two souls in the Lich King are not fused entirely. Again, the appearance of a Naaru suggesting that it would willingly assist the Lich King would be extremely unlikely considering the lore of the Naaru in the Warcraft Universe.\nMartin Falch eventually commented on the Naaru at the end:\nReception.\nThe movie was a great success on www.WarCraftMovies.com with an average rating of 5 out of 5 and almost 200.000 downloads the first three days (1xRecommended + 2xPlatinum). The seeding of the satisfied downloaders on .Torrent made it clear that the movie was a success. Today the movie has more than 1.8 million downloads on WCM, making it the most downloaded movie on the site. Additionally, many fan-made music-videos, trailers etc can be found on youtube."}

The core purpose of their guild is to slay this entity who has caused them all grief. They return to him every year in hopes to slay him, but have yet to succeed. All that is known of this enemy is that he lives in the core of the world, where they fight him. In the beginning of Tales of the Past 2, it is revealed that this enemy is &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nEden Aurorae seemed to have owed Stormwind a \"favor\", forcing them into a war against the Horde. Main members of the guild suspected that there was corruption amongst the Stormwind nobles, and aimed to find out what was causing it.\nAt the Barrens, the leader of the advancing Alliance army, Conrad Schultz, was challenged to a duel by the Horde army's leader, Warchief Gorbag. Gorbag overpowered him, and Schultz begged for mercy. As Gorbag is walking away, Schultz hits him in his back with a fatal blow. This causes the Horde army, now led by Gorbag's brother Swoog, to begin their attack. The Alliance army falls quickly, with Eden Aurorae suffering very small losses. After the battle, Swoog learns of their mission, and sets them free. Understanding that this will also bring them shame amongst the Alliance, Swoog gives the guild shelter. Swoog also gives them the aid of a Horde guild called the Ancient, who will help them on their quest.\nThe other clans, however, do not believe the guild's story. They begin to amass armies and, years later, attack several different Alliance cities. Rumours, though, tell that Morbid of the Iron Edge clan is building up an army for a final blow to the Alliance. Eden Aurorae, with this knowledge, know that they must reveal the truth of this deceit before the armies kill each other.\nInformation reaches Eden Aurorae that Stormwind is holding a city-wide celebration over the victory of Horde forces in Searing Gorge. With the city distracted, the guild sends Yimo and Blazer into the city to meet up with &lt;a href=\"Tales%20of%20the%20Past/Thainor\"&gt;Thainor&lt;/a&gt;, someone on the inside who would be able to help the guild find out the source of the corruption.\nThainor tells them the location of the diary of Conrad Schultz, which should be able to explain some things. It is located in a tower of the Stormwind Keep, where Blazer and Yimo are found out. They steal the diary and teleport out of the city.\nWithout revealing to much spoilers, the story later becomes more focused on the quest of Blazer and Yimo, rather than the guild as a whole."}

Talgath's role was to help Kil'jaeden corrupt the native populaces of different worlds. He brought down countless civilizations, and he knew how to tempt mortal hearts. Sometimes he found heroic champions who could be turned, but very often he found willing minds among those who live on a world's fringes. Talgath was an opponent the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; encountered on numerous occasions.\nHistory.\nRise of the Horde.\nTalgath was an old friend of &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20to%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Council to the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;. He was among &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who gathered in &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; told them about &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. During this he watched &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and Velen who were off to the side, only occasionally glancing at Kil'jaeden. Velen entrusted Talgath to gather &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; who were wary of Sargeras and his tantalizing offer. Among the eredar he was to gather, Velen specifically asked Talgath to bring &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Nuuri\"&gt;Velen's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rakeesh\"&gt;family&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%27s%20End\"&gt;highest mountain&lt;/a&gt; of the land. Unfortunately, Talgath was himself seduced by those very promises and betrayed Velen and his cohorts to Kil'jaeden. &lt;a href=\"Hatuun\"&gt;Hatuun&lt;/a&gt;, another one of the Council to the Triumvirate, fought Talgath off when he came after Velen. In spite of this, the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; managed to spirit Velen and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; away, bringing the Deceiver's wrath upon Talgath.\nBut Kil'jaeden was merciful and placed Talgath in charge of finding the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. For a long time, Talgath remained unsuccessful in his search \u2014 he found countless worlds that had been touched by the draenei, but they had always escaped before the Burning Legion arrived. He eventually succeeded and located them on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and Kil'jaeden ordered Talgath to spy on the new world. He completed the task and discovered a race called &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, observing them for some times until being witness to &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;'s new relationship. Following this, Kil'jaeden assumed full command of the operation and Talgath was reassigned.\nThe Dreadblades.\nTalgath stumbled upon an effective method of corruption: find the selfish, the greedy, and the ruthless, and make them compete for power. Not only would he learn which among them were the strongest, but the \"winners\" would struggle so hard to obtain their prize that they would be unwilling to question its true cost until it was too late. &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s must have immediately seemed vulnerable to this tactic. They raided one another in search of treasure, giving little thought to the risks they would undertake. The choice to create a &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadblades\"&gt;pair of nimble cutlasses&lt;/a&gt;, the sort of weapons favored on the high seas, meant Talgath saw great potential in corrupting pirates to the Burning Legion's cause.\nThe weapons first showed up on Azeroth a few decades ago. Several &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; ships reported that they had escaped a band of pirates whose leader carried glowing blades oozing black smoke, and soon it became clear that those ships were the lucky ones. A newly empowered crew of pirates was preying on Alliance vessels, and when the raiders captured a ship, they left no survivors. Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; led the search for the rogues, and after weeks of hunting, his small fleet cornered their ship a few miles off the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;' shores. The pirate crew seemed to be possessed, barely human, but after a coordinated cannon barrage, Proudmoore sent their vessel, the \"&lt;a href=\"Bellwether\"&gt;Bellwether&lt;/a&gt;\", to the bottom of the ocean. The admiral sailed away, believing he had killed them all. In truth, one had survived. The single person who swam away from the sunken \"Bellwether\" was a teenage boy, a young pirate recruit who had seen his crew descend into corruption and madness firsthand. He took the weapons and the treasure back to his crew's old lair and buried them deep underneath an isolated island. He believed the riches were cursed, and so he left them behind. The weapons would remain buried for years.\nIt took the upheaval of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; to unearth the cutlasses again. A ship carrying some &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, a small but dangerous pirate crew, took shelter near a patch of tiny islands as the seas heaved to and fro. After the initial elemental unrest passed, their leader, Admiral &lt;a href=\"Eliza%20Goreblade\"&gt;Eliza Goreblade&lt;/a&gt;, noticed that rogue waves had revealed something beneath the sand. When they looked closer, they found a cache of gold, jewels, and old weapons. It was the last stash of the \"Bellwether\", a windfall nobody knew had been missing. The buccaneers gleefully took it all. Admiral Goreblade reserved a pair of gleaming cutlasses for herself, the only weapons in the cache that hadn't become rusted and worn over time. Unfortunately, that decision led her crew to ruin.\nShortly before the Burning Legion's third invasion, Admiral Goreblade finally discovered the true power behind her weapons. Talgath revealed himself and told her that she had only tasted a meaningless drop of the Burning Legion's strength. If she aided the demons in the coming war, he promised that she would ascend to immortality and find out what might the Legion could truly bestow. The admiral agreed immediately. She made a pact, giving the souls of all her crew to Talgath's tender care.\nGoreblade's buccaneers became an unseen, deadly menace on the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Seas&lt;/a&gt;. Talgath had seen what attracting too much attention would do, so he encouraged Admiral Goreblade to attack only isolated ships and make certain they did not escape. For several years, the pirate crew did exactly what they were told. They killed without mercy, and the power of the cutlasses grew ever stronger. When other Bloodsail Buccaneers learned how deep into insanity this crew had fallen, they tried to intervene. Goreblade's pirates survived the counterattack and managed to steal the Bloodsail Buccaneers' most prized ship, the \"&lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Veil\"&gt;Crimson Veil&lt;/a&gt;\", for themselves.\nSoon, some crew members began to change. Their forms withered and faded, and only their skeletons remained.\nAn image of Talgath appears commanding Eliza to kill a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; seeking the Dreadblades.\nTalgath was defeated through means unknown and his spirit was sent back into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nArgus.\nTalgath regenerated after being sent to the Nether. He outlived his master Kil'jaeden, who had died to the forces of Azeroth within the Twisting Nether, ending his life for good. When Velen traveled to the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; seeking the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Crown of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;, Talgath's &lt;a href=\"Talgathi\"&gt;Talgathi&lt;/a&gt; forces arrived to stop him from retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt;, Kil'jaeden's piece of the crown. Talgath himself appeared at &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Kil'jaeden's Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, the very place where he first heard of Sargeras. He commented on how unlike Velen it is for the Prophet to stand his ground, but that it was a welcome change of pace. Velen attempted to reach a peaceful solution and told Talgath to stand down, but Talgath refused.\nDuring the battle, Talgath taunted Velen, telling him how his departure wounded Kil'jaeden and how cold Velen had been leaving his &lt;a href=\"Nuuri\"&gt;wife&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rakeesh\"&gt;son&lt;/a&gt; behind. When Talgath was about to lose he attempted to flee, but Velen bound him with chains of light. Velen once more tried to get Talgath to help them find the Crest of Knowledge, but Talgath responded, in an attempt at a parting shot, that they were too late, and not even the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; could escape \"the temple,\" unwittingly giving away the Crest's location as the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Velen killed his former friend with a burst of holy magic."}

They have devised a way to make use of the bears so that they may serve some purpose \u2014 they use the living bears at their &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; farm as living egg feeders. The spiders lay their eggs in the bear flesh and the eggs thrive off of the meat and blood of the beasts. Infested cubs still listen for the telltale buzzing of bees even though they can no longer taste honey.\nThough bears normally appear to be solitary, the &lt;a href=\"Shardtooth%20Bear\"&gt;Shardtooth bears&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; hunt in packs to bring down &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"owlbear\"&gt;owlbear&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe fearsome &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Dancing%20Bear\"&gt;Darkmoon dancing bears&lt;/a&gt; have a habit of suddenly breaking out into dance amid battle, much to the annoyance of their riders. The &lt;a href=\"Reins%20of%20the%20Armored%20Brown%20Bear\"&gt;armored brown bear&lt;/a&gt;'s swiftness is enhanced by its heavy armor, imbued with magic from &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; magi. The bears of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; are prized for their hardiness, loyalty, and combat prowess. Their time among the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; does little to curb their ferocity.\nThe &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;frost vrykul&lt;/a&gt; believe that wearing a necklace of polar bear claws will grant them otherworldly strength. The &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir\"&gt;Hyldnir&lt;/a&gt; ride arctic warbears in their &lt;a href=\"Hyldsmeet\"&gt;Hyldsmeet&lt;/a&gt; competition, but they don't give out a warbear to just anyone. The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; decorate the ferocious &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Battle%20Bear\"&gt;Amani battle bears&lt;/a&gt; in magic amulets and ceremonial masks as a way to venerate the bear god &lt;a href=\"Nalorakk\"&gt;Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rare &lt;a href=\"Baby%20Blizzard%20Bear\"&gt;baby blizzard bear&lt;/a&gt; is bred for its small size and perpetually youthful appearance. The fur of the &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; bears owes to the almost perpetual gloom they live in, and their vision in the darkness is uncanny. The bear cubs of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; suffered much during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. On the bright side, the devastation also led to their newfound love of heights and daredevil stunts.\nBiology.\nA bear's meat, including the snout, are suitable for consumption. It's even a delicacy to the &lt;a href=\"frostsaber\"&gt;frostsaber&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nA bear's tongue is surprisingly very toxic, which may be the reason it finds use in many &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; potions. Their brain is used in a powerful serum to help feral &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; return to their &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; form, their hide is used in &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; funeral rites, and to fashion armor, their heart can be combined with &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt; blood to form a deadly poison, their claws make for a great &lt;a href=\"spirit\"&gt;spirit&lt;/a&gt;-warding &lt;a href=\"totem\"&gt;totem&lt;/a&gt; when combined with a spider's eyes, and their musk is a popular fragrance among &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; nobles.\nIn Warcraft III.\n&lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Claw%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Druid of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; unit transforms into a bear."}

The first two bosses you defeat each add 5 minutes to the timer. The third boss does not add any time to the timer. You must defeat each boss before the timer runs out in order to save each scout. \nIf you succeed in defeating all four animal bosses in 25 minutes, Kasha will blast open several vases and the last one contains &lt;a href=\"Kasha%27s%20Bag\"&gt;Kasha's Bag&lt;/a&gt;. Inside this bag is a single &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Battle%20Bear\"&gt;Amani Battle Bear&lt;/a&gt;. If you are in a PUG &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt; need.\nThe traditional boss kill order is &lt;a href=\"Akil%27zon\"&gt;Akil'zon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nalorakk\"&gt;Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jan%27alai\"&gt;Jan'alai&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Halazzi\"&gt;Halazzi&lt;/a&gt;. Some groups succeed with Halazzi, Akil'zon, Nalorakk, Jan'ali, but that's mostly a gear check to make mediocre PUGs fail early and relax afterward.\nScouts that have been rescued do not need to be released from their cages right away. Players can wait until after they have defeated &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Daakara&lt;/a&gt; and backtrack to release the scouts and collect the treasure. As of Patch 4.2.0 there is a bug where scout loot will wait for rolls by players who have left the instance to time out before actually rolling and distributing the loot.\nSolo at 90 and higher.\nYou may want to solo this one - it's a fun challenge solo, even for the casual player - but also there's only one bear mount available per run.\nIf you want this mount and are not familiar with this instance:\nKnow your route..\nYou can try for this every day, so don't be annoyed if you miss the time limit and have to try again tomorrow. \nTips At 85.\nDo not hesitate. Do not discuss. Do not mark something for another player. They will mark it themselves if it is important. If you are going to CC, do it as soon as you are in range of the mob. As soon as the party is assembled begin killing.\nDo not die. Resurrecting and recovering health and mana wastes time. If you can't drop aggro, avoid pulling aggro.\nSkip the patrolling trolls.\nOn the gauntlet leading to Akil'zon target the &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Wind%20Walker\"&gt;Amani'shi Wind Walker&lt;/a&gt;s for death because they cast &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt;. The most powerful teams can pull all the Wind Walker/Protector pairs and the &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Tempest\"&gt;Amani'shi Tempest&lt;/a&gt; in a single stampeding charge and then AoE them down, although countering the chain heals of four Wind Walkers (via interrupts or insane DPS) is daunting.\nThe trash leading to Nalorakk almost always has an \"initial charge\" where they are immune to &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20control\"&gt;Crowd control&lt;/a&gt;. Learn where the end of the charge is, and CC afterward (if at all). &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Medicine%20Man\"&gt;Amani'shi Medicine Man&lt;/a&gt; is a popular CC target due to his healing and immunity totems. &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Axe%20Thrower\"&gt;Amani'shi Axe Thrower&lt;/a&gt; is the second most dangerous because of his axe stun. &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Tribesman\"&gt;Amani'shi Tribesman&lt;/a&gt; is a low priority target and is least likely to be targeted by DPS (and therefore most likely to stay crowd controlled).\nThe trash leading to Jan'ali has &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Scout\"&gt;Amani'shi Scout&lt;/a&gt;s who must be slaughtered before they can run to a drum and summon a pair of &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Reinforcement\"&gt;Amani'shi Reinforcement&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Flame%20Caster\"&gt;Amani'shi Flame Caster&lt;/a&gt;s have a firebolt volley and are the primary CC candidate. &lt;a href=\"Amani%27shi%20Guardian\"&gt;Amani'shi Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s are melee and are often rooted. When the party reaches a trash pack the CC should happen immediately and the Scout should be blasted. Time wasted using &lt;a href=\"Raid%20target%20icons\"&gt;Raid target icons&lt;/a&gt; to mark CC or wait for the tank to charge in lowers your chance of rescuing the next scout. Be on the look-out for patrolling scouts. They can aggro and summon reinforcements, delaying your team.\nSkip the patrolling trolls.\nMuch of the trash near Halazzi can be skipped. Use &lt;a href=\"Path%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Path of Frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Water%20Walking\"&gt;Water Walking&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Water%20Walking\"&gt;Elixir of Water Walking&lt;/a&gt;, or just swim to skip the troll/crocodile patrol. Powerful teams can pull multiple lynx ambush packs and AoE them down.\nIf the timer runs out while you are in combat with the boss, the un-rescued scouts are burned and you fail the achievement."}

The model used by the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Reaver%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Fel Reaver&lt;/a&gt; which patrols &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; (others seem unaffected) was accidentally replaced with a black bear. The hilarity which ensued until the next patch was epic in proportions. The screen still rumbled as it approached, and it still sounded like a giant train, as well as retaining the power to annihilate anyone in 1-2 swings, but... it just looked so cuddly! Bear puns ran rampant and Hellfire Peninsula's general channel verged on total collapse!\nPoetry.\n\"Even before the change the Reaver was a menace to unwary players, but this has added a new level of terror to an already overwhelming foe. Formerly, the Fel Reaver, being a good five stories tall, was visible from a fair distance away and easily avoidable to anyone aware of the danger. Now, however, the first warning of its presence is the terrible rumbling of its footsteps and the tortured metallic scream which precedes it. Many heroes have fallen to this new menace, frozen in panic as they try to determine which way to flee. Truly, our greatest enemy is upon us.\"\nCreation.\nDuring the 2021 &lt;a href=\"BlizzConline\"&gt;BlizzConline&lt;/a&gt; World of Warcraft Cooking Workshop, level designer &lt;a href=\"Sarah%20Boulian%20Verrall\"&gt;Sarah Boulian Verrall&lt;/a&gt; revealed that she and an unnamed male level designer had been learning about spawning creatures, not realizing that the changes they had played around with would go live into the PTR. The model change was an accident, and they somehow disabled the fel reaver proximity alert. The male designer then placed \"several\" Bear Reavers around the zone."}

The encounter is won when either gladiator is dead, so focus on Argh, since he has far less health than Raaaargh.\nStart by jumping up to one one of the trampolines at the edges, then face the middle trampoline and let it Bounce you in that direction. Don't jump manually -- the trampoline must do it to trigger the spell. Bounce again to the third trampoline, then turn and bounce up to Argh's platform to land a Critical Bounce on him for +300% damage. Keep attacking until Argh Slaps you off, so get back to the trampolines to repeat.\nRaaaargh should keep running around on the ground, but try to ignore him as best as possible.\nArgh has just shy of 2.7 million health, so he requires just more than 22,700 DPS to beat the enrage timer.\nTrivia.\n\"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" is the name of a popular bawdy song frequently referenced in Westeros (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/item%3D97979%23comments%3Aid%3D1842778\"&gt;lyrics here&lt;/a&gt;), the continent where most of the projected heptalogy A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.

It was covered in shimmering blue-black scales which were impenetrable like armor. Its head was framed by barbed fins and possessed elongated, toothy jaws, as well as a blowhole through which it blew sprays of water and which stuck out from its head like a volcano-shaped carbuncle. Its huge, forward-facing eyes resembled those of a &lt;a href=\"seagull\"&gt;seagull&lt;/a&gt;, red-rimmed and yellow, but with vertical slits for pupils. Its body ended in a tapered, finned, &lt;a href=\"eel\"&gt;eel&lt;/a&gt;-like tail. Taruka noted that after she'd killed it, the creature floated much higher on the surface than a normal dead fish, leading her to conclude that it had a lot of air inside its body.\nDeath.\nThe old fisher &lt;a href=\"Harooka\"&gt;Harooka&lt;/a&gt; told Taruka not to sail through Lyquokk Strait on her way to &lt;a href=\"Kamagua\"&gt;Kamagua&lt;/a&gt;, saying \"There is death there. Avoid it\". However, Taruka became suspicious that the other fishers were trying to keep her away from a prime fishing spot and thus headed into the strait on the day of her voyage. When she was about halfway up the strait, she saw the beast's shadow approach and only just managed to get her father's spear free before the creature moved under her boat and lifted it out of the water. The boat capsized, but she jumped up and grabbed onto the creature's scales. When the monster dived headfirst into the water again, she slid down its back towards its neck and managed to plunge the spear into its eye and brain, killing it.\nThe creature disappeared in the deep, its dive already in motion, depositing Taruka in the water. She found and climbed onto her upturned boat and was at a loss for what to do until the beast's corpse bobbed back up to the surface. Taruka realized that the creature's buoyancy meant that it could work as a makeshift vessel. She tied her boat to the creature's tail, stepped the mast in its blowhole, fastened the forestay to its upper jaw (which she noted resembled a ship's bowsprit) and wound the backstay around the tail. The butt of her spear, which was still lodged in the creature's head, function as a peg for one of the shrouds, and she pried up loose scales to turn them into cleats for the other shrouds. When she hoisted the mainsail of her new vessel, she found that it did move with the wind (albeit slowly) and that it could be roughly steered by carefully trimming the sail and moving her old boat from one side of the tail to another. The dead beast attracted many scavengers, and Taruka used her net to catch enough fish to keep her fed on the three-day voyage north to Kamagua, where she entered the harbor in triumph as all the other tuskarr gathered to witness her strange vessel/catch. She singled out the catch master &lt;a href=\"Kattik%20Sharktasted\"&gt;Kattik&lt;/a&gt; in the crowd and jovially asked him how many knots her latest catch was worth."}

These lone wandering forest dwellers come from all backgrounds and cultures, seeking the essence of combat through the mimicry of wild beasts.\nAmong the most gifted &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, there are those who have from birth felt a profound bond with the creatures of the wild. These beast masters are drawn to the perilous primal world, invigorated by its dangerous and untamed nature. Primitive landscape becomes home. Ferocious predator becomes kin. Whether in the thrill of the hunt or the heat of battle, beast masters call forth a litany of vicious animals to overwhelm prey and gnaw at their enemies' will.\nA good portion of the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; are beastmasters; because of their ancestry, they are seen as outcasts among &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s, and aside from other Mok'Nathal, are only accepted by a few sympathizers. They find comfort in the friendly beasts of the wild and the isolation from the hostility of civilization in the wilds.\nThere are also &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;frost vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; beastmasters. Many of the &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord\"&gt;Thunderlord&lt;/a&gt;s were also beastmasters.\nA number of orcish beastmasters of the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; died when they attempted to trap &lt;a href=\"Thok%20the%20Bloodthirsty\"&gt;Thok the Bloodthirsty&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nBeast masters are noble savages, wandering the woods and communing with nature. The beastmaster is more at home with wild animals than sapient beings, able to call upon the forces of nature to help him. Most beastmasters are &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt;, but a few work solely for the Horde. They are usually from the Horde or night elves.\nThe beastmaster is a wilderness warrior who has developed an uncanny rapport with animals. Though truly fearsome in battle, the beastmaster can be quite gentle when dealing with creatures of the wild. A beastmaster typically travels with one or more animal companions who show incredible loyalty to their humanoid friend. Though a beastmaster prefers to spend his time in the wild with his animal companions, he is not averse to venturing into civilized lands when the need arises. As long as animals may be found where he travels, the beastmaster is at home.\nA beastmaster can use body language, vocalizations, and demeanor to improve the attitude of an animal (such as a bear or a giant lizard). The beastmaster may comprehend and communicate with animals and magical beasts.\nThe beastmaster can grow claws and fangs or horns. In time they grow even longer and wicked than before.\nAccording to Brann Bronzebeard, Rexxar is not only a beastmaster, he is an &lt;a href=\"epic%20beastmaster\"&gt;epic beastmaster&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotable.\nOthers: Mag Bearmaul, Gorsh Talonfang, Maxx Rocmane, Gaz Boartusk, Mok Rocksnout, Gish Eagle Eye.\nNote: Many of these names come from random beastmasters in The Frozen Throne. However, the names are referenced in \"Horde Player's Guide\"."}

{"id": "314030", "revid": "34702620", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=314030", "title": "Beastmaster (Warcraft III)", "text": "A warrior Hero, able to call forth the creatures of the forest to serve him. These lone wandering forest dwellers come from all backgrounds and cultures, seeking the essence of combat through the mimicry of wild beasts. Attacks land units.\nHero names.\nMag Bearmaul, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Bearclaw\"&gt;Tagar Bearclaw&lt;/a&gt;, Gorsh Talonfang, Maxx Rocmane, Gaz Boartusk, Mok Rocksnout, Gish Eagle Eye.\nInformation.\nThe Beastmaster is the master of Summonable units. The Beastmaster can have multiple summonables of each type at once. The Beastmaster is cool because he can have a Bear, Quilbeast, and Hawk at the same time (making him the Beastmaster!). The Beastmaster's ultimate ability summons a stampede of exploding lizards!\nAll of his summonables require a lot of mana to cast, so it\u2019s important to choose the creature that suits your race and army well. Early on, the Bear seems like the best unit. He has a lot of hit points and good damage. However, if you look in the long run, all three of them are powerful in their own way. The Bear gains a lot of hit points at higher levels and deals pretty good damage, plus he can move around well with Blink. Take Bear if you want an early edge in units, for example if you are playing Night Elf and need an extra tank unit on your front line. The Quilbeast is a damage maven; it deals the best damage at level three because of his growth and because of Frenzy. Take Quilbeast if you find yourself up against air units or against other units weak to piercing. The Hawk may seem weak at first (sort of a poor version of Priestess of the Moon\u2019s Scout), but eventually you can use its fast speed and good damage to hassle or finish off enemy units. Select Hawk if you are good enough to be able to manage him and micromanage him while managing other things. His speed is 350, which is faster than all Heroes except Heroes with boots or with speed auras. Use this speed to finish off nearly dead units. At 35 damage per second, the Spirit Hawk has just enough punch to finish off a fleeing hero or force the hero to waste a town portal scroll or potion. His ultimate, Stampede, deals a large and mostly mindless amount of damage. Its area is like a very wide version of Tauren Chieftain\u2019s Shockwave.\nThe Beastmaster is most useful in smaller games such as 1 vs. 1 and 2 vs. 2 where his Summonables can contribute more.\nTo play the Beastmaster effectively you need to invest more in getting Mana back. This can take the form of Mana Potions and/or Clarity potions at player-built shops. There are other methods for regaining Mana in the game that you can also use.\nSpells and abilities.\nSummon uilbeast.\nQuilbeasts have a ranged attack so you can use them against air units or other enemy units that are weak to piercing attacks.\nThe most important thing to remember about the Summon Quilbeast spell is that its Cooldown is only 20 seconds and the Quilbeasts last for 70 seconds. Most players underestimate high level Quilbeasts, so you will be able to summon three or even four of them in a row and deal huge damage without the opponent making an effort to stop you. Quilbeast groups deal massive damage to air, Huntresses, casters or even normal melee units thanks to their splash damage.\nSummon Hak.\nThe hawk has Truesight and can get Invisibility at level 3. The hawk is especially useful for scouting the enemy.\nLevel 2 and 3 hawks are also very good for finishing off units and heroes as well as distracting other players by attacking their peons.\nSampede (Ultimate).\nThis ability certainly turns heads. Don't anger the Thunder Lizards!\nThis spell must be maintained to get the full effect. If the Beastmaster moves, the spell will cancel and will not do its full damage. Force the Beastmaster to move from his location. This will stop the Stampede."}
