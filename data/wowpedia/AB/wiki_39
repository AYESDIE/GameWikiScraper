The removal of threat as a nail-biting concern (after the first few seconds of the fight) meant that tanks' most common life/death decisions were about when to spend (relatively-) long-cooldown defensive abilities.\nIn contrast, active mitigation gives tanks abilities that are used frequently, but affect their long-term survival in borderline fights. A skilled tank is the one who continuously makes choices that reduce the amount of damage they take, or reduce the amount of mana healers spend upon them and the raid. Unskilled tanks given the same abilities will use them at the \"wrong\" time, or at suboptimal moments that place a larger load on the healers and the rest of the raid, and can lead to a wipe on progression content.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s were the inspiration/laboratory for active mitigation through their &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt; ability which included a healing component whose exact mechanics rewarded tanks who could time their usage against incoming damage. This decision-making happens regularly as the tank is in combat and tanks can distinguish themselves by using this ability more skilfully than others.\nWith \"Mists of Pandaria\" the various tanks gained short-cooldown abilities that embody active mitigation. Tanks who use these abilities optimally will be able to overcome challenges that would defeat a less skilled tank.\nDesign (Legion).\nLegion continues the active mitigation model from \"Mists of Pandaria\", but the term \"Active Mitigation\" is now differentiated from the broader active mitigation model.\nThe term \"Active Mitigation\" now refers to a single, specific ability that a Tank must use as a counter to specific Boss abilities. These Boss abilities are designated as Mitigation Checks. If a tank fails to use Active Mitigation against a Boss\u2019s Mitigation Check, they will receive an additional negative side effect. Some examples of Mitigation Checks in Legion Dungeons are:\nEvery Tank in Legion has only one ability that counts as \"Active Mitigation\" against Mitigation Checks. \nThere are other \"active abilities\" that \"mitigate\" but they are not considered \"Active Mitigation\" as they do not counter Mitigation Checks. For instance:\n&lt;a href=\"Demon%20hunter\"&gt;Demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nActive abilities that mitigate damage:\nActive Mitigation for Mitigation Checks:\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight\"&gt;Death knight&lt;/a&gt;s.\nActive abilities that mitigate damage:\nActive Mitigation for Mitigation Checks:\n&lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nActive abilities that mitigate damage:\nActive Mitigation for Mitigation Checks:\n&lt;a href=\"Monk\"&gt;Monk&lt;/a&gt;s.\nActive abilities that mitigate damage:\nActive Mitigation for Mitigation Checks:\n&lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nActive abilities that mitigate damage:\nActive Mitigation for Mitigation Checks:\n&lt;a href=\"Warrior\"&gt;Warrior&lt;/a&gt;s.\nActive abilities that mitigate damage:\nActive Mitigation for Mitigation Checks:"}

The merger was finalized on 9 July 2008.

Though Raszageth was sealed away, Neltharion could no longer directly control the dracthyr without the relic and so deemed them a risk. Thus the dracthyr weyrns were ordered to the creches beneath the Forbidden Reach by Neltharion, where they were sealed away by &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; in magical stasis and watched over by his &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.

Over the course of her experiments, she slowly interacted with some dracthyr, slowly coming to realize that the dracthyr were far more valuable with their will free rather than subjugated. When Neltharion became aware of what Adamanthia was doing he issued her a threatening warning to not only cease her experiments but to also have all the dracthyr she released sent back to Aberrus. When Adamanthia saw that Neltharion wanted the dracthyr sent back to Aberrus she refused, stating that there was no need to return them to the lab, this served as the final \"kind\" act of Neltharion, for soon after the last communication between Adamanthia and Neltharion, Adamanthia was believed to have been imprisoned.\nAdamanthia was imprisoned within the High Creche not by the same magic of the blue dragons but this time through power siphoned from the dracthyr in all five creches they were locked away in. The magic sealing Adamanthia away is a form of evoker magic that was once readily used by the dracthyr before their stasis but not made available once they reemerged during the Primalist invasion of the Forbidden Reach.\nSpeculation.\nAdamanthia may have been a trusted confidant of Neltharion given that she is the only known black dragon to have ever operated on the Forbidden Reach."}

He was handsome and smart and Makasa admired him, but she rarely spent time with him.\nAround the Year 28, Adashe became a captain and was presented by the \"&lt;a href=\"Sea%20King\"&gt;Sea King&lt;/a&gt;\" by &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Master%20Seahorn\"&gt;Fleet Master Seahorn&lt;/a&gt; who assigned &lt;a href=\"Joe%20Barker\"&gt;Joe Barker&lt;/a&gt; as his first mate.

Addons vary greatly in scope and size \u2014 they may display information not presented at all by the default UI, add functionality to the default UI (e.g. additional buttons you can press to do things), modify the default UI's appearance (e.g. by changing colors or positions of UI elements) without changing its functionality, or even replace the default UI entirely.\nSome addons are standalone, and are able to run without any additional addons being installed; others can require certain other addons to be installed to work at all, or integrate with other addons to provide additional functionality. Collections of addons that have been put together to form a coherent user interface are sometimes referred to as \"UI\"s.\nWith the release of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.1\"&gt;Patch 3.1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; introduced an official &lt;a href=\"https%3A//eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-user-interface-add-on-development-policy/1642\"&gt;UI Add-On Development Policy&lt;/a&gt; that limits how addon authors can distribute their addons. In particular, addons must be available free of charge, and may not include advertisements or solicit donations in-game.\nTypes of addons.\nThere are several broad categories of functionality provided by addons:\nOf course, there are also many addons that do not fit within any of these categories. You can explore the various available addons by &lt;a href=\"%23External%20links\"&gt;browsing addon sites&lt;/a&gt;.\nInstalling an addon.\nIn general, you can install an addon by extracting its code into the \"World of Warcraft\\Interface\\AddOns\" directory. More specifically, you should:\nLoading out-of-date addons.\nAddOns that have not been updated since the last minor version (i.e. x.y.0) patch of \"World of Warcraft\" will be displayed as \"out of date\" by the World of Warcraft client, and will not be loaded by default. However, because most addons do not actually need to be updated for every minor patch, such addons may still function correctly. \nTo enable loading of addons that appear \"out of date,\" check the \"Load out of date AddOns\" checkbox in the \"AddOn List\" frame accessible by clicking the \"AddOns\" button on the character selection screen. Blizzard automatically clears this checkbox with every client patch, so you may have to re-check it periodically.\nAddOn management apps.\nThese applications generally help to automate updating AddOns as \"World of Warcraft\" gets updated. This can be done manually - without requiring the installation of any executable code - but may be convenient if you have a large number of addons. \nCare should be taken before installing any executable application such as these. Check that you are on the right website (search for it to ensure multiple sources link to the same site) and read reviews left for the application.\nThe following addon hosting sites provide executable applications to help automate these steps:\nTroubleshooting an AddOn.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3\"&gt;Patch 2.3&lt;/a&gt;, if you get a message \"Interface action failed because of an AddOn\", this means that an AddOn interfered with the Blizzard UI in some way. To diagnose this, enter the following into chat \"codice_1\" and restart the game and try to reproduce it. If you reproduce it, you can quit the game and search through the file codice_2 for the word \"codice_3\" and mail the log to the author of the AddOn listed there. Once you have done this you can turn off logging by entering the following into chat \"codice_4\""}

If the player is in a raid a party channel will not exist, but party--specific communication can be maintained by the addon receiving the messages by checking the sender against the party roster.\nSample channel name with raid leader named Tekkub: CommRaTekkub\nPlayer names are unique within a realm, cannot contain spaces, and the name limit is 12 chars, but special characters are allowed. When we strip those characters out, there could be conflicts-- so we're going to use a checksum system here to prevent that. We can use the following function to strip out all special characters:\n function Strip(name)\n return string.gsub(name, \"%W\", \"\")\n end\nThere is a possibility that a channel name could conflict due to this, so addons using this channel should probably verrify that the sender of a message is in the raid or party before the message is parsed, but the checksum system should prevent most of this.\nYou could use the following function to create group names (where CheckSum is defined below):\n function GroupChannelName(name)\n local cs = CheckSum(name)\n name = Strip(name)\n name = string.sub(name, 1, 8)\n return \"CommRa\" .. name .. cs\n end\nA group channel with leader \"Tekkub\" would become \"CommRaTekkub21cdb4\"\nA group channel with leader \"Cl\u00e3dhaire\" would become \"CommRaCldhaire23e70a\"\nA group channel with leader \"Cl\u00e6dhaire\" would become \"CommRaCldhairebc9459\"\nAny addon or library maintaining connection to this channel must handle leadership changes smoothly. It must close connection to the old group channel and open connection to the new channel.\nGuild.\nA guild channel mechanism should be provided. This should not restrict the user to their current guild, as many guilds keep an \"app guild\" or \"alt guild\" wherein the players may need access to communication with the main guild's addon channel. The addon managing this channel should be able to give some sort of indication of the guild channel it is maintaining, so conflicts do not arrise but many guild channels could potentially be opened.\nGuild names have the same issues as playernames for the group channels, plus they can take spaces. So a checksum is used here as well, and all non-alphanumeric chars are stripped from the name. For example:\n\"Khaz Modan Brigade\" would have the channel CommGuKhazModadb3bb5\n\"Khaz Modan Reserve\" would have the channel CommGuKhazModa0e3045\n\"KhazModanBrigade\" would have the channel CommGuKhazModa4209dd\n\"KhazM\u00f8danBrigade\" would have the channel CommGuKhazMdanfa944d\nTo get the guild name checksum, the following method can be used. It makes some concessions to prevent collisions in our specific case, but can be used as a general algorithm as well. In order to keep the channel names as clean as possible for the users, we've capped the checksums to six hex characters. Thanks to Iriel for the suggestion.\n local SOME_PRIME = 16777213\n CheckSum = function(text)\n local counter = 1\n local len = string.len(text)\n for i=1,len do\n counter = counter + string.byte(text, i)*math.pow(31, len- i)\n end\n counter = math.mod(counter, SOME_PRIME)\n return string.format(\"%06x\", counter)\n end\nUsing CheckSum and Strip from above, the following function could be used to get a full channel name from a string:\n function GuildChannelName(name)\n local cs = CheckSum(name)\n name = Strip(name)\n name = string.sub(name, 1, 8)\n return \"CommGu\" .. name .. cs\n end\nChannel Management.\nThere are a few things addons will need to do if they are using a channel:\nGlobal Registrar.\nA simple table could be used to maintain a registrar. Any addon using the comm protocol would look for this table when they need to register into a channel. If it doesn't exist they would create the basic empty table and add themselves in.\nProposed table structure.\n AddonCommRegistrar = {\n -- Stores a list of addons currently using a channel\n -- Note that the indexes here don't have to be strings,\n -- anything can be used as long as it's unique to the addon\n channels = { \n CommGlobal = { \n [\"Sample addon 1\"] = true,\n [\"Sample addon 2\"] = true,\n CommRa = {\n [\"Sample raid addon\"] = true, \n CommGuKhazModa12345678 = {\n [\"Sample guild addon\"] = true, \n },\n -- Flag indicating that a ChatFrame fliter is in place\n filter = true,\n -- GetTime() of the next raid message that can be sent.\n raidThrottle = 453278.329,\n -- GetTime() of the next guild message that can be sent.\n guildThrottle = 483587.467,\n -- GetTime() of the next global message that can be sent.\n globalThrottle = 454643.745,\n -- Name of the leader currently used for the group channel\n -- this is in place so that only one addon performs a channel switch on leadership change\n groupleader = \"Joebob\",\nRegistering a channel.\nWhen registering into a channel, an addon should execute this block of code:\n -- Establish the registrar\n if not AddonCommRegistrar then \n AddonCommRegistrar = {\n channels = {}, \n end\n -- Establish the channel registrar\n if not AddonCommRegistrar.channels[channelname] then \n end\n AddonCommRegistrar.channels[channelname][\"Sample addon\"] = true\n -- Implement a ChatFrame filter for our channel if one does not exist\n if not AddonCommRegistrar.filter then\n -- Hook ChatFrame_OnEvent here\n AddonCommRegistrar.filter = true\n end\n -- Join the channel\n if GetChannelName(channelname) == 0 then\n JoinChannelByName(channename)\n end\nUnregistering a channel.\nWhen an addon is done with a channel it needs to check if anyone else is using it, if noone is it should make sure the channel is departed.\n AddonCommRegistrar.channels[channelname][\"Sample addon\"] = nil\n if not next(AddonCommRegistrar.channels[channelname]) then\n -- Leave the channel\n LeaveChannelByName(channelname)\n end\nLeadership Changes.\nWhen the raid or party leader changes, each addon that uses the CommRa* channel should check to see if the switch has been made yet, if not it should perform the switch. Also it should be noted that leaving a channel has a slight delay, the best solution appears to be to delay 1 second between leaving and joining.\n -- To be performed when the raid leader changes\n if AddonCommRegistrar.groupleader ~= newleadername then\n AddonCommRegistrar.groupleader = newleadername\n LeaveChannelByName(\"CommRa\".. oldleadername)\n -- Delay 1 second, by some means...\n JoinChannelByName(\"CommRa\".. newleadername)\n end\nMessage throttling.\nMessage throttling has it's advantages, but the jury's still out on if the protocol should require throttling or not, further details and discussion can be found at &lt;a href=\"Addon%20Comm%20Throttling\"&gt;Addon Comm Throttling&lt;/a&gt;\nChatframe Filtering.\nHere is a proposed hook for the ChatFrame_OnEvent to block all Comm text from ever appearing in the default UI's chatframes. Note that only the first addon to register should implement this (see sample in &lt;a href=\"Addon_Comm_Protocol%23Registering%20a%20channel\"&gt;Registering a channel&lt;/a&gt;)\n local cf_oe = ChatFrame_OnEvent\n ChatFrame_OnEvent = function(event)\n if event == \"CHAT_MSG_CHANNEL\" then\n local chan = string.lower(arg9)\n for _,str in pairs(filters) do\n if string.find(chan, str) then return end\n end\n end\n cf_oe(event)\n end\nMessage Protocol.\nA standard protocol for messages sent should be used to assure addons do not unintentionally receive other addon's messages. The proposed standard is: \"&lt;Namespace&gt;: &lt;message&gt;\" &lt;Namespace&gt; is some unique token that a develop's addons use. Some devs may choose to share a token across their addons, like \"Tekkub\" or they may make it addon-specific like \"CTRA\". Handling of the &lt;message&gt; portion of the communication is entirely placed upon the receiving addon. This will allow for simple filtering of messages intended for other addons.\nIt is recommended that use of the chars 's' and 'S' in the &lt;Namespace&gt; section of the message be avoided, especially if the addon does not use a sobriety filter. For example, if the addon only communicates numbers the filter would not need to be implemented, it's just a wasted function in this case. Please see &lt;a href=\"Addon%20Comm%20Sobriety%20Filter\"&gt;Addon Comm Sobriety Filter&lt;/a&gt; for possible implementations of this filter."}

As it's tradition with almost all programing languages, it'll be a \"Hello, World!\" AddOn.\nNote: Writing an AddOn is an advanced task. You need to be able to work with your computer. This especially includes:\nPreparation.\nWriting an AddOn requires two pieces of software installed on your computer:\nText Editors.\nA text editor is used to edit plain text files (hence the name). They need to be distinguished from &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_processor\"&gt;word processors&lt;/a&gt;. Word processors allow text formatting (such as making text bold or italics). Thus they don't save plain text files but document files instead. On Windows, \"Notepad\" is a (very limited) text editor, whereas \"Wordpad\" and especially \"Microsoft Word\" are word-processor. You may use \"Notepad\", but you can't use \"Wordpad\" or \"Microsoft Word\".\nThere are dozens of free text editors out there. You will want to use one that has &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting\"&gt;Syntax Highlighting&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some recommendations.\nNote: You can find more lua editors at the &lt;a href=\"Lua%20editors\"&gt;Lua editors overview page&lt;/a&gt;. However, some of them may be more than what we need for this tutorial. So the recommendations above only contain basic editors.\nLocate the AddOns folder.\nAll AddOns lives in a very specific folder called codice_1. This folder is located here:\n %WorldOfWarcraftFolder%\\Interface\\AddOns\nwhere codice_2 is usually the location where World of Warcraft is installed on your computer. In most cases the complete path looks like this:\n\"A note on Windows Vista and later:\" The AddOns folder may be located at the second path on Windows Vista and later (e.g. Windows 7). Basically this happens when the user has no administrator rights.\nThe new AddOn.\nAs described above, all AddOns live in a very specific folder called codice_1. Each AddOn has its own directory under the codice_1 folder.\nNow go ahead and do these steps:\nNote that the only difference in the three file names is the suffix. These denote, in order:\nImportant: The name of your AddOn directory and the name on the codice_12 file must match.\nImportant 2: If you add new files (e.g. lua or xml files) to your AddOn while WoW is running, you need to \"restart\" WoW. It's not sufficient to just reload the UI. Changing existing files, however, just requires a reload of the UI.\nThe next steps are to fill these three text files with some content. This is what the text editor is used for. The content of each file is described in the next sections.\nThe .toc or Table of Contents.\nThis file tells WoW about your AddOn: what files to load and what order to load them in. Later you will want to have a look at the &lt;a href=\"TOC%20format\"&gt;TOC format&lt;/a&gt; page for all of the gory details about what you can put into this file. For now we are just using some basic stuff.\nUsing your trusted text file editor, place the following into the codice_9 file:\n ## Interface: \n ## Title: Hello World!\n ## Notes: My first AddOn\n ## Version: 1.0.0\n HelloWorld.lua\n HelloWorld.xml\nThis content should be pretty self-explanatory (except for the first line; see below):\nSo, starting from the first line we are saying:\nA few notes on the first line:\n ## Interface: \nBy the time you try to follow this tutorial, that value will probably have changed and you will need to put in the current value. If you've got WoW running, you can find out this number by running the following command:\n /run print((select(4, GetBuildInfo())))\nIf not, may look into the .toc files of some other AddOns you've installed or have a look at &lt;a href=\"Getting%20the%20current%20interface%20number\"&gt;Getting the current interface number&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat is this number? It's the user interface (UI) version for the AddOn. For instance, \"\" would correspond to WoW versions (where x is an arbitrary number). This number specifies which version of WoW your AddOn is compatible with; if it does not match the Blizzard UI number, your AddOn will be considered out of date, and will not be loaded unless the user checks the \"Load out of date addons\" checkbox before logging in.\nFor more details on stuff you can put in here, please visit the &lt;a href=\"TOC%20format\"&gt;TOC format&lt;/a&gt; page.\nThe .lua or Lua code file.\nThe codice_13 files are where the main \"what to do\" instructions for the AddOn reside. You will see a variety of terms for this \"what to do\" such as \"logic\", \"executable code\", or simply \"code\" (in most cases). Lua code does its thing in response to something that happens in the game. Things that happen in the game are called \"events\".\nEvents.\nThere are two basic kinds of events. \nThere is a technical difference between the two types of events, and we will discuss that as the tutorial progresses. For more details on the first kind of event see &lt;a href=\"Events%20%28API%29\"&gt;Events (API)&lt;/a&gt; and for the second see &lt;a href=\"Widget%20handlers\"&gt;Widget handlers&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis discussion of events is extremely important because absolutely nothing happens in the game except in response to an event.\nImportant: Should you happen to write a piece of code that runs for an extended time (perhaps forever) absoultely nothing new will happen in the game. The game will freeze, nothing will move anymore, and the user will not be able click anything anymore. That would be classified as \"not good\".\nSo, how do you tell World of Warcraft that you are interested in a particular event? There are two ways: First, you can tell WoW which piece of code to run when a particular event happens. This is called registering your event. Second, you can tell the XML to run a piece of code when a UI Element is manipulated (such as clicking on it or moving your mouse over it). These pieces of code that run in response to events are called \"functions\" (or more precisly \"event handlers\").\nFunctions.\nFunctions are groupings of code that accomplish a specific purpose. On one hand, there are numerous pre-defined functions provided by WoW. They're called \"API functions\" (API = Application Programming Interface). And on the other hand you can make your own user-defined functions. \nWhile there are multiple ways to create functions in Lua, the easiest to understand looks like this:\n [local] function \"function_name\"(&lt;zero or more arguments&gt;)\n -- code\n end\nNote that this only defines the function. The function is not actually run until some other piece of code calls it.\nFor more information on functions, please see the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/manual/5.1/\"&gt;Lua 5.1 Reference Manual&lt;/a&gt; or \n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.lua.org/pil/\"&gt;Programming in Lua (first edition)&lt;/a&gt;. Also see the &lt;a href=\"Lua\"&gt;Lua&lt;/a&gt; page which lists more Lua resources.\nHelloWorld.lua.\nNow to continue with our \"Hello, World\" code example, put the following into your codice_10 file and save it.\n function HelloWorld(self) \n print(\"Hello World!\"); \n end\nYou should understand everything in here by now. This function is named HelloWorld and it has zero arguments. The code part is simply the codice_28 portion. And it ends with codice_26.\nThis is a fine piece of code, but by itself it's useless unless something calls this function. Onward to UI Elements (aka Widgets).\nThe .xml or XML visual elements file.\n\"UI Elements\", or \"Widgets\", are all of the tiny bits of graphics that make up the User Interface. WoW uses XML to layout everything that you see on the screen. Additionally, when things happen (called \"events\", remember?) to the widgets on the screen, event handlers (i.e. functions) can be called to perform whatever action you want. We will see shortly how we tell WoW which widgets we are interested in and which events we want to be handled by which event handler.\nBlizzard XML format declared.\nFor those of you who don't know: XML stands for \"eXtensible Markup Language\" and is a means of tagging content with identifiers.\nWhat identifiers (from here on called \"tags\") exist and how they're organized can be defined in something called an \"XML Schema\". In our case, we want to create XML documents that WoW will understand, so we will use the XML Schema provided by Blizzard for the Wow User Interface.\nWe declare that our document conforms to the Blizzard schema with the following bit of magic:\n &lt;Ui xmlns=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/..\\FrameXML\\UI.xsd\"&gt;\n&lt;/Ui&gt;\nThe exact meaning of all of the above is beyond the scope of this tutorial, although if you are terribly curious you can read &lt;a href=\"https%3A//msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc302166.aspx\"&gt;this Microsoft article on XML namespaces&lt;/a&gt;. For most addon developers it a \"magic formula\" that you always put in every.xml file you will create for the WoW user interface.\nBlizzard defines the UI widget in codice_30. This file can be found at Interface/FrameXML/UI.xsd if you extracted the Blizzard interface, else wowprogramming.com maintains an online copy &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wowprogramming.com/FrameXML/UI.xsd\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"XML%20user%20interface\"&gt;XML user interface&lt;/a&gt; page has a good list under &lt;a href=\"XML%20user%20interface%23Widget%20Elements\"&gt;Widget Elements&lt;/a&gt; which will aid you until we get further along.\nXML Tags.\nThere are a few general notes that you need to know about concerning XML, particularly as it is used by WoW. The generalized format of a \"tag\" is:\n &lt;tagname attribute=\"attribute value\" anotherattribute=\"anotherattribute value\"&gt;&lt;/tagname&gt;\nA tag must have a tagname, and it may have zero or more attributes along with the attributes' associated values in double quotes.\nThe tag is everything between the '&lt;tagname' and the trailing '&gt;'. The tag is closed by an \"end tag\" with the same name as the tag (i.e. '&lt;/tagname&gt;'). Tagnames do not have spaces and are case sensitive. A valid tagname might be 'BackgroundWidgets', whereas 'backgroundwidgets' would not be valid. \nEverything between the tag and the end tag is the \"content\" of the tag. Everything. Even other tags along with their content.\nIn the case where there is no content to a tag, the tag can be shorted to codice_31 instead of codice_32 though both versions are valid. A complete tag with no content looks like:\n &lt;tagname attribute=\"attribute value\" anotherattribute=\"anotherattribute value\"/&gt;\nUsing the above piece of magic as an example, we can see that there is a tag with the name 'Ui' and that it has three attributes (the funny forth line is a part of the third attribute). Content is represented by the space between the end of the tag (the '&gt;' on the fourth line) and the '&lt;/Ui&gt;' end tag.\nHelloWorld.xml.\nNow to continue with our \"Hello, World\" XML example, put the following text in your codice_11:\n &lt;Ui xmlns=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/..\\FrameXML\\UI.xsd\"&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;\nNow before we create the frame for our addon, we have to add a simple line of code that tells the WoW engine where to find our function in our codice_13 file. Notice this is a tag with no content, which gets a '/&gt;' and no end tag. This is because this tag doesn't require any additional content (other than the name of the file).\n &lt;Script File=\"HelloWorld.lua\"/&gt;\nWoW connects everything to a frame, even other frames. So, in order to create something that WoW will interact with,\nwe create a frame:\n &lt;Frame name=\"HelloWorldFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nThe tagname is 'Frame' and we have used the 'name' attribute and given the attribute the value of 'HelloWorldFrame'.\nOur frame tag is included as content to the Ui tag and so goes between the start Ui tag and the end Ui tag. To help keep track of what is surrounding what, we indent the content with respect to the enclosing tags like this:\n &lt;Ui xmlns=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/..\\FrameXML\\UI.xsd\"&gt;\n &lt;Script File=\"HelloWorld.lua\"/&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"HelloWorldFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;\nIt is very important that you do not mix up the various end tags and indenting helps keep things straight. Notice that the 'Frame' and 'Script' tag are completely surrounded by the 'Ui' tag.\nInside the frame, one of the many things we can define are Scripts. Scripts are nothing more than small pieces of Lua code. Where we place the script determines when it will be invoked. Because Scripts live within a Frame we include the 'Scripts' tag inside the 'Frame' tag. Notice the difference, in the 'Scripts' tag, the 's' sets it apart from the 'Script' tag.\n &lt;Frame name=\"HelloWorldFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\nThe various widgets have several Events that can occur and if we want to declare a Widget Handler to process the event we include the event name under the Scripts tag of the widget we are interested in. Not every widget has the same set of events. In this example, we are interested in an event named 'OnLoad'. The OnLoad event happens when the widget is loaded into the UI. For this example, we want the OnLoad event to run the script named HelloWorld. This script was defined in the HelloWorld.lua as a function.\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n HelloWorld(self);\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\nTake a look at the &lt;a href=\"Widget%20handlers\"&gt;Widget handlers&lt;/a&gt; page for a list of widgets and the events you can write widget handlers for.\nThe complete codice_11 file should look like this:\n &lt;Ui xmlns=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://www.blizzard.com/wow/ui/..\\FrameXML\\UI.xsd\"&gt;\n &lt;Script File=\"HelloWorld.lua\"/&gt;\n &lt;Frame name=\"HelloWorldFrame\"&gt;\n &lt;Scripts&gt;\n &lt;OnLoad&gt;\n HelloWorld(self);\n &lt;/OnLoad&gt;\n &lt;/Scripts&gt;\n &lt;/Frame&gt;\n &lt;/Ui&gt;\nThere is an important thing you should note in the code above. The HelloWorld(); is the only piece which is NOT a tag or an attribute. It is important to note that content in a WoW .xml UI document is always a piece of code if it is not another set of tags and their associated attributes. The only valid place for a piece of code is under the tag for an event.\nHaving gotten this far, it is time to run your new AddOn.\nRunning your HelloWorld AddOn.\nYou should now have a folder called \"HelloWorld\" in your \"AddOns\" folders, and in that folder there should be three files named codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11. The contents of these three files should be \"exactly\" as listed above.\nNow start World of Warcraft and log into your account, but don't select your character yet. \nPlease click the red 'AddOns' button on the lower left of the character selection screen to see all of the AddOns WoW has detected. There will be one for every folder in your AddOns directory except for the AddOns starting with \"Blizzard_\".\nYou should see your new HelloWorld in this list. The name should be yellow, and the checkbox to the left should be checked.\nIf the name is Red and you see an Out of date message to the right, you probably didn't change the ## Interface: 40200\nline in your codice_9 (as described &lt;a href=\"%23The%20.toc%20or%20Table%20of%20Contents\"&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;). Please review that section and make the appropriate change. \nI do not recommend running your AddOns with the 'Load out of date AddOns' checkbox checked. That's asking for trouble as an AddOn that attempts to use old UI features can corrupt a new UI. Nearly every patch that changes the UI level has had problems with old AddOns that have not been updated to conform to the new UI standards.\nIf you don't see your new AddOn at all, make sure that you have placed the HelloWorld folder in the right folder (called \"AddOns\") and that the files inside the \"HelloWorld\" folder have the right names and contents.\nA note for windows users: make sure that you don't accidentially save your files as \"HelloWorld.toc.txt\" (instead of \"HelloWorld.toc\") etc. There is an option in windows explorer will hide the codice_40 suffix.\nPlease note the case (upper-case vs. lower-case letters) of the names of your folder and files: While Windows is insensitive to case for folder and file names, the case may be important on a Mac. Also, inside the game itself, World of Warcraft is sensitive to the case for the names of its variables and filenames. Keep the case the same to avoid problems.\nNow, you have a yellow \"HelloWorld!\" AddOn showing up in your AddOn list. Note the ! in the name. The name of the AddOn shown in this list is taken from the ## Title: Hello World! line in the codice_9 file. In the future, we will see how to change colors and languages.\nIf you move your mouse cursor over the HelloWorld name, you should see a tool-tip pop up with two lines in it. The first line is the same as the title, and the second line is taken from the ## Notes: My first AddOn line in the .toc file. This can also be customized for color and language.\nCancel out of the AddOns display and enter the world with any of your characters. Once your character loads, you should see a message in the default chat window that says Hello, World! .\nSuccess!!\nReview.\nYou have created your first AddOn and have successfully run it. Now let's review a bit about what was accomplished.\nThe 'Hello World!' text is taken from the line in the HelloWorld.lua file that reads 'print(\"Hello World!\");'. \nWrapped around that is a function named print which is responsible for displaying the text in the default chat window.\nThe print function is inside a function we created called HelloWorld that had no parameters. Our function will do the same thing every time\nit is called.\nYou should then recall that the name of our function was placed in the HelloWorld.xml file as the action to be taken when the \"Onload\" event\nof the \"Scripts\" tag of the Frame we created. We placed the name of our function in this specific place because we wanted our function to be\nexecuted (run, called, processed) when our Frame was fully loaded.\nWorld of Warcraft knew that it should create our Frame because we placed the name of the .xml file into the .toc file.\nThe .toc file must have the same name as the AddOn's directory and is the first of the files in our AddOn that Blizzard processes.\nInside the .toc file is where we tell World of Warcraft about our AddOn (the ## statements) and what files that need to be loaded.\nEvery line that does not start with a ## is a file to be processed by World of Warcraft.\nThe order that the file names appear is important because World of Warcraft processes the file in order listed.\nKnowing that, we place the .lua file before the .xml file because we want the function HelloWorld declared (or defined) before we try to \ncall it in the .xml file.\nEven though this is a trivial example of an AddOn , important concepts and information have been covered. \nFurther pages in this tutorial will cover other areas and expand upon topics initially presented here.\nPure Lua implementation.\nAlternatively, Hello World can also simply be written without any use of the &lt;a href=\"XML/Frame\"&gt;XML file&lt;/a&gt;\n print(\"Hello World!\")\n local function HelloWorld()\n print(\"Hello World!\")\n end\n HelloWorld()"}

Compared to its opposite, the &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;, add fights tend to involve more mobility and oftentimes call for &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate damage and minimize chaos. There have been many variations of add fights over the years, but the key element of all of these encounters is that adds always have a higher priority than DPSing the main boss. Ignoring adds on an add fight to focus DPS on the boss usually leads to a wipe if the raid is being overrun or if the off-tank is taking too much damage for the healers to keep up. However, it is a judgment call whether it is worth ignoring adds at a certain point of an encounter to speed it along or end it before &lt;a href=\"enrage\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough &lt;a href=\"council\"&gt;council&lt;/a&gt;s also involve multiple targets, add fights differ in an important way. Mobs summoned as \"adds\" tend to possess few abilities, usually featuring only one or two abilities that are relevant to the mechanics of the encounter (&lt;a href=\"Tsulong\"&gt;Tsulong&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Sha\"&gt;Unstable Sha&lt;/a&gt;) or merely being hard-hitting. In contrast, the various members of a council fight are bosses by themselves with multiple mechanics that a raid must remember. An add fight will usually have a single main boss, and depending on the encounter design, the raid may steadily damage the boss over the course of the fight or it may switch to him/her full-time after the \"add phase\" is complete. &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Deathwhisper\"&gt;Lady Deathwhisper&lt;/a&gt; involves a combination of both of these mechanics, and &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Emperor\"&gt;Will of the Emperor&lt;/a&gt; is an add fight with two main targets instead of one. Conversely, &lt;a href=\"Spoils%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Spoils of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; is a pure add fight that does not even have a central boss.\nWhile some players find add fights annoying due to constant switching of targets, certain classes and specs perform exceptionally well on multi-target encounters, especially multi-dotters and anyone with strong AoE or &lt;a href=\"cleave\"&gt;cleave&lt;/a&gt;. While &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt;s tend to be simpler in design, add fights can test the DPS output of a raid if it is struggling to kill adds in a timely manner."}

She then joined the ranks of the Unseen Path at &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; as a champion of the hunter order.\nDragonflight.\nYears later, Addie joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and visited the &lt;a href=\"Timberstep%20Outpost\"&gt;Timberstep Outpost&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;.

For example an addon that only manages a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s does not ever need to be loaded on a non-Hunter. AddonLoader allows the developer to specify certain load conditions for their addons, allowing them to be intelligently loaded on demand.\nDownload.\nAddonLoader can be downloaded at the following locations:\nUsage (as a player).\nSimply having AddonLoader present should cover your needs. There are some options that can be accessed through codice_1 for overriding an addon's load condition.\nUsage (as a developer).\nAddonLoader allows you to specify certain conditions under which your addon will be loaded. It also enables you to run blocks of code without ever having your addon loaded, all by parsing the metadata in your table of contents file. Conditions are completely self-contained and do not interact with one another. Currently there is no way to (for example) specify by using simple metadata that your addon should only load for a certain class that is also over a certain level. You could accomplish this using an execute block instead.\nEnabling AddonLoader.\n ## LoadManagers: AddonLoader\nThis line in your &lt;a href=\"TOC%20format\"&gt;TOC file&lt;/a&gt; tags your addon as LoadOnDemand, and assigns responsibility for loading it to AddonLoader. Warning - if AddonLoader is disabled in the addons panel, your addons will not load at all. If you don't wish to use AddonLoader, you must delete it's folder from the Addons folder.\nSpecial Fields.\n ## X-LoadOn-Events: UNIT_SPELLCAST_START, UNIT_MANA\n ## X-LoadOn-UNIT_SPELLCAST_START: if select(4...) == 'player' then AddonLoader:LoadAddOn('MyAddOn') end \n ## X-LoadOn-UNIT_MANA: if select(4...) == 'player' then AddonLoader:LoadAddOn('MyAddOn') end \nSpecify events to register for. You must specify event reaction code for each event. \n ## X-LoadOn-Hooks: GameTooltip_SetDefaultAnchor, ChatFrame_OnEvent\nSpecify functions that are to be securely hooked. Other than that, works like Events above. \n ## X-LoadOn-Execute: ChatFrame1:AddMessage('MyAddOn is present, but not yet loaded')\nThis code will execute on login regardless of if the addon is loaded or not. Use this if you need to specify complicated loading circumstances like function hooks. Note that toc fields are limited to about 1000 characters, if you must go over that amount, use X-LoadOn-Execute2 etc. Multiples get concatenated together and executed as one. \n ## X-LoadOn-Slash: /myaddon, /myadd\nThis specifies a slash command to register when your addon is not loaded. When the command is used by the player, your addon will be loaded, then the typed command will be issued again, so that options can be accessed if your addon's load condition hasn't yet fired.\nAddonLoader will register three things for each slash command given:\n SLASH_MYADDON1\n SlashCmdList[\"MYADDON\"]\n hash_SlashCmdList[\"/myaddon\"]\n SLASH_MYADD1\n SlashCmdList[\"MYADD\"]\n hash_SlashCmdList[\"/myadd\"]\nWhen your addon loads you should make sure to nil these out before you load your slash commands, otherwise you can run into problems with your slash commands not being used. (If AddonLoader happens to be the agency loading your addon (through a slash command or any other trigger), then it will nil these out for you before loading.)\n ## X-LoadOn-LDB-Launcher: Interface\\AddOns\\myAddon\\icon\n ## X-LoadOn-LDB-Launcher: Interface\\AddOns\\myAddon\\icon myAddonLauncher\nThis works similar to the slash loader, except with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//github.com/tekkub/libdatabroker-1-1/wikis\"&gt;LDB&lt;/a&gt; launchers. AddonLoader will create an LDB launcher for your addon and set its OnClick action to load your addon, then call the new OnClick handler your addon creates. This also means your addon must handle the LDB dataobj carefully, to ensure it is declared correctly for users with and without AddonLoader installed.\n local ldb = LibStub:GetLibrary(\"LibDataBroker-1.1\")\n local dataobj = ldb:GetDataObjectByName(\"myAddonLauncher\") or ldb:NewDataObject(\"myAddonLauncher\", {type = \"launcher\", icon = \"Interface\\\\AddOns\\\\myAddon\\\\icon\"})\n dataobj.OnClick = function(self, button) dosomethingonclick(button) end\nThe second arg is optional, if not present your addon's name will be used for the dataobject name. Also note that texture paths in the TOC use \"\\\" while paths declared in lua must use an escaped \"\\\\\"\n ## X-LoadOn-InterfaceOptions: My Addon\nAddonLoader will add a category to the interface options -&gt; Addons tab. Upon clicking the category your addon will be loaded and the category will be refreshed. The addon loading is responsible for adding a category with the same name registered in the X-LoadOn-InterfaceOptions field.\n -- In case the addon is loaded from another condition, always call the remove interface options\n if AddonLoader and AddonLoader.RemoveInterfaceOptions then\n AddonLoader:RemoveInterfaceOptions(\"My Addon\")\n end\n -- now create our own contents\n local frame = CreateFrame(\"Frame\", nil, UIParent)\n frame:Hide()\n frame.name = \"My Addon\"\n -- fill the frame with options\n InterfaceOptions_AddCategory(frame)\nLoad Conditions.\n ## X-LoadOn-&lt;tag&gt;: &lt;value(s)&gt;"}

If addons do not do this &lt;a href=\"drunk\"&gt;drunk&lt;/a&gt;en players could cause problems. As of 1.12 this is not a problem for messages sent through &lt;a href=\"API%20SendAddonMessage\"&gt;SendAddonMessage&lt;/a&gt;(), but there's still channels where we can't use that API; whispers and worldwide communication being two good examples.\nWhen you are drunk, your text is slurred in two possible ways: \"s\" is changed to \"sh\" and \" ...hic!\" (localized) is added to the end of your message.\nThe internal Blizzard function can be represented as such:\n function Drunkify(text)\n -- turns regular text into drunken, slurred text.\n return string.gsub(text, \"([Ss])\", \"%1h\") .. \" ...hic!\"\n end\n assert(Drunkify(\"I drank seven beers\") == \"I drank sheven beersh ...hic!\")\nHuman Readable.\n\"Note:\" Due to the fact this method increases the size of a message it should only be used for messages which need to remain human readable.\nIn order to prevent this, special care must be taken to make sure that \"sh\"s are turned back into \"s\"s, but without overkill. Also, the \" ...hic!\" must be stripped from the end, paying careful attention to localization.\nHere are two functions to handle this on send and receive:\n\"Note:\" the hidden character can be absolutely any character except \"S\" or \"s\"\n -- Package a message for transmission\n function Encode(text)\n text = string.gsub(text, \"([h\u00b0])\", \"\u00b0%1\") -- encode a hidden character in front of all the \"h\"s and the same hidden character\n return text..\"\u00b0\" -- add the hidden character to the very end.\n end\n -- Clean a received message\n function Decode(text)\n text = string.gsub(text, \"([Ss])h\", \"%1\") -- find \"h\"s added to any \"s\", remove.\n text = string.gsub(text, \"\u00b0([h\u00b0])\", \"%1\") -- remove the hidden character.\n text = string.gsub(text, \"^(.*)\u00b0.-$\", \"%1\") -- make sure there hasn't been further tampering with the msg.\n return text\n end\nBy definition, codice_1, but also codice_2, where codice_3 is Blizzard's internal function.\n -- some tests:\n assert(Decode(Encode(\"It's 58\u00b0 out!\")) == \"It's 58\u00b0 out!\")\n assert(Decode(Encode(\"She sells sea shells by the sea shore\")) == \"She sells sea shells by the sea shore\")\n assert(Decode(Drunkify(Encode(\"She sells sea shells by the sea shore\"))) == \"She sells sea shells by the sea shore\")\nConsistent Message Length.\n\"Note:\" May be preferable to the human readable method because it does not increase the message length.\nAn alternate method is to simply remove the \"S\" and \"s\" characters and replace them with another to prevent the slurring from even happening.\n -- Package a message for transmission\n function Encode(text)\n text = string.gsub(msg, \"s\", \"$\");\n text = string.gsub(msg, \"S\", \"\u00a7\");\n return text;\n end\n -- Clean a received message\n local DrunkSuffix = string.gsub(SLURRED_SPEECH, \"%%s(.+)\", \"%1$\"); -- remove \"%s\" from the localized \" ...hic!\" text;\n function Decode(text)\n text = string.gsub(text, \"%$\", \"s\");\n text = string.gsub(text, \"\u00a7\", \"S\");\n text = string.gsub(text, DrunkSuffix, \"\"); -- likely only needed if decoding an entire message\n return text;\n end\nThis can be faster than the human readable method for two reasons. First the message size is not increased at all unless the player is already drunk and the \" ...hic!\" gets added. Second, the switching of characters from \"s\" to another character can be done before hand by the mod author, the encoding and decoding of the string can be done only to specific pieces of the message on a \"need\" basis (ie: sending player or mob names)."}
{"id": "44933", "revid": "819614", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=44933", "title": "Addon Comm Throttling", "text": "\"This writeup concerns managing total throughput of very large shared channels. It does not touch upon the maximum output rate for a single client. See &lt;a href=\"ChatThrottleLib\"&gt;ChatThrottleLib&lt;/a&gt; for more information on that subject.\"\nMessage throttling is a complicated subject, because you have to limit both incoming and outgoing traffic while only having control of outgoing.\nThe number one goal to keep in mind is that background communications should not affect foreground game play.\nThe maximum incoming rate for chat is as such:\n p * r = T\nWhere codice_1 is the amount of players communicating, codice_2 is the maximum rate, and codice_3 is the total incoming bytes per second.\nThus, looking at the extreme case of 40 raid members:\n 40 * r = T\nand consequently,\n r = T / 40\nSo in picking an arbitrary codice_3 that is sufficient to bear the load but not cause a great impact, codice_3 is 4000, and codice_2 is 100.\nDespite it seeming low, a rate of 100 Bytes / second is not all that far-fetched. If you are transferring critical information, it should be sent in as small packets as possible, possibly with some compression mechanism.\nAlso, for raids, raid leaders have the privilege of 200 Bytes / second, and raid assistants 150 Bytes / second.\nInstead of having guild, global, and raid on the same throttle, it is better to split them up into different throttles, to prevent a large global message from preventing a needed real time raid message.\nGuild throttling.\nUnlike the raid channel, both Guild and Global channels should not be sending real time data back and forth, thus the need for such a high rate is not needed.\nThus, the formula I'll use to calculate the Guild and Global rates is this formula:\n Rp * Rr = Gp * Gr * C\nwhich translates to\n Gr = Rp * Rr / Gp / C\nWhere codice_7 is the likely maximum members in a raid (40),\ncodice_8 is the rate at which the average raid message is traveling (100 B/s),\ncodice_9 is the likely maximum members in a guild,\ncodice_10 is the rate at which the average guild message is traveling,\ncodice_11 is a constant to determine the need of real time messages.\nGuilds have a varying number of members, with the average being around 61 members per guild. Some guilds have a much larger number, though, upwards of 300. The number I will use is &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar_number\"&gt;Dunbar's number&lt;/a&gt;, which is roughly 150. Any guilds with an amount of members over this is unlikely to exist (and unlikely to persist).\nThe need for real time messages is very important in a raid, so I shall choose the arbitrary and simple number 2 to represent C, which means that real time messages are twice as important as normal messages).\nSo the numbers we have are:\nSo\n Gr = Rp * Rr / Gp / C\ntranslates to\n Gr = 40 * 100 / 150 / 2\nso\n Gr = 13.33333333333333 -- and so on\nSo you can send about 13 bytes/second through the guild.\nNote: you could send one giant 250-byte message to the global channel, you merely have to wait 20 seconds before you send your next message. In turn, if you send a 10-byte message, you only have to wait 1 second to send your next message.\nIf you are the guild leader, you should have the privilege of double that rate, at 26.66666 bytes/second.\nGlobal throttling.\nGlobal messages are even more complicated and should be used with greatest care, since there are many players, who all want to get their voice heard.\nI will use the same formula as above to determine the rate.\n Rp * Rr = Tp * Tr * C\nwhich translates to\n Tr = Rp * Rr / Tp / C\nWhere codice_7 is the likely maximum members in a raid (40),\ncodice_8 is the rate at which the average raid message is traveling (100 B/s),\ncodice_18 is the likely maximum members in the global channel,\ncodice_19 is the rate at which the average global message is traveling,\ncodice_11 is a constant to determine the need of real time messages. (2)\nIn a populated realm, the amount of members online on a single faction can reach 4000 (and possibly go beyond), so that shall be the value for codice_18\nSo the numbers we have are:\nSo\n Tr = Rp * Rr / Tp / C\ntranslates to\n Tr = 40 * 100 / 4000 / 2\nso\n Tr = 0.5\nSo you can send 0.5 chars per second through the global channel. This may seem extremely small, but it is necessary.\nNote: you could send one giant 250-char message to the global channel, you merely have to wait 500 seconds before you send your next message. In turn, if you send a 10-char message, you only have to wait 20 seconds to send your next message."}

They are of various races and organizations.\nIn the RPG.\nAdept is a &lt;a href=\"NPC%20class\"&gt;NPC class&lt;/a&gt; detailed in the DMG () and used in both the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;World of Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;. Adepts exist as part of the world of &lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdepts are generally spell casters in training to become members of other more experienced spell caster classes. For example, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;s teach their skills to new adepts. However, this is not always the case as sometimes an adept is a spell caster who specializes in a single school of magic. An arcane adept is a dedicated &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; with a natural predilection for one of the schools of specialization (usually &lt;a href=\"transmutation\"&gt;transmutation&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"evocation\"&gt;evocation&lt;/a&gt;). They become more entrenched in whichever school they prefer.\nHistorically, the earliest account of adepts occurs around the time of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; had gathered her most talented adepts in her jeweled palace, the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;."}

A master of shadowy magic, this wizened trickster has learned how to bend the very elements to his sway.\"\nAbilities.\n&lt;a href=\"Syth%20Shadow%20Elemental\"&gt;Syth Shadow Elemental&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe elementals are immune to their own school of magic. The Shadow Elemental is Immune to shadow-based &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt;, being in its school of magic. Earth, Fire, and Arcane Elementals are fearable. The Shadow Elemental can be feared by a warrior's Intimidating Shout, but not by priest or warlock fear effects.\nStrategy.\nAggressive.\nA completely offensive strategy, by rushing in to DPS him. It can get pretty crazy, and is only suggested if you have good healing for the fight. If done right, you can easily finish him without members dropping below 50% health.\nHave the tank charge in and aggro him in the center of the room. All other party members should bunch up right inside the doorway. When the first wave of adds spawn you should do a Warlock or Priest fear and just keep burning the boss. When second wave comes frost nova, fear, or any kind of mass crowd control. This is a burn fest. Don't worry about burning down the adds as they each have 4k health and make it difficult to keep off the healers.\nConservative.\nA more conservative strategy is to pause to kill each wave of elementals before returning to Syth. This strategy can be less risky for parties where a majority of the characters are not yet level 70, as the accumulation of a dozen elementals may be too much for a lower level party to handle.\nThis strategy appeared to be superior for a group of a 70 Rogue, 66\u201367 2 Paladins, a Warlock, and a Hunter (I forget who was what level exactly besides the Rogue); also for a group of 67 warrior, 68 druid, and three 68 hunters; also for 67 warrior, 68 paladin, 70 balance druid, and two 68 hunters. Details of the strategy are as follows:\nBeing that 100% of the damage in this fight is magical in nature, a mage using Dampen Magic might be a good idea. Potions of Magic Resistance (+50 to all schools) are particularly useful here (but far from needed even on heroic), but note that they will activate your combat potion cooldowns and don't stack with a priest's Shadow Protection or a Paladin's resistance auras.\nWith regard to the order in which the Elementals are to be slain:\nWith a Priest and Paladin, I would advise that Shadow be last to be killed, and that Frost(or Fire) be second to last, since these resistances can be provided by Frost(or Fire) Resistance Aura and Prayer of Shadow Protection. More Generally, just remember to bear in mind the resistances your party can afford.\nAn alternate strategy might be to Kill the shadow elemental first, since reportedly Syth does mostly Shadow damage and the debuff from this elemental could be the most damaging. Furthermore, this is the only elemental immune to fear/banish and the most likely to cause trouble.\n(AoE Strategy) - not recommended due to fears, but feel free to use instant AoEs if they do end up grouped after they come back from the fear, if they're still alive.\nIf you have a mage and a secondary healer then the mage can take the adds using arcane explosion in short order. The mage can mitigate some damage using fire or ice ward, and ice barrier if so spec. The arcane elemental will need to be dealt with separately as it is immune to arcane explosion. \nResistances don't play a major role in this fight.\nHybrid.\nSome groups attempting this may have insufficient healing endurance to pursue the conservative strategy, while also lacking more than one source of AOE fear and/or the strong DPS required to pursue the fully aggressive strategy. For this situation, assuming that at least one AOE fear is available, it is best to kill the first set of summoned elementals, then fear the second set and attempt to burn him down before they recover (while ignoring the third set of summoned elementals entirely).\nHeroic mode.\nThe adds have an aura / AoE that does approx 800 damage of its element per tick as well as stacking a debuff that increases the damage the player takes from their element. The adds seem somewhat fear resistant, though only the shadow elemental is actually immune. \nResistance buffs / totems / auras are very useful. Dampen magic on everyone is recommended since you will be getting up to 4 AoE hits per tick as well as boss spell damage.\nThe boss remains very squishy and does only light damage. Just DPS him down to 80\u201375%, focus the adds one at a time having decided kill order beforehand. Then give yourself a bit of time and get topped off before taking him down to 60\u201350%. Rinse &amp; repeat; however, when the final wave comes at 10%, just finish off the boss quickly and blow fears on the elementals.\nEdit: If you have high DPS group you can also have the tank blow fear and if you have a lock in the group have him fear again and all DPS on the boss."}

Meanwhile the back entrance, &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Pass\"&gt;Darkwhisper Pass&lt;/a&gt;, has become its more common way in.\nIts main entrance from Winterspring has been redecorated to match the Twilight cult's theme and appearance. This area, however, remains empty until players are sent there for quests.\nHistory.\nPost-Third War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; army that attacked &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; fled once &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was killed and took refuged in Darkwhisper Gorge.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Twilight's Hammer managed to take the gorge from the Burning Legion demons by force and have held onto the territory with only one exception, the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Sothann\"&gt;Gates of Sothann&lt;/a&gt;, which was taken by the &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garnoth%2C%20Fist%20of%20the%20Legion\"&gt;Garnoth&lt;/a&gt; and his army.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nDarkwhisper Gorge was previously an area in the far south of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; which consisted of a network of tunnels and chasms. This area was inhabited by &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demons\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; of an approximate five-man difficulty before \"The Burning Crusade\". The demons in this area were important to a number of quests, unlike their &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; counterparts.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game.\nDarkwhisper Gorge is a treacherous cavern that lies along &lt;a href=\"Winterspring%20Valley\"&gt;Winterspring Valley&lt;/a&gt;'s southern slope. Poisonous green vapours bubble out of acid pools deep within the bottom of the gorge. Malevolent sounds echo from a cave at the furthest end of the gorge, leading some &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to believe that &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s may have taken refuge in the toxic depths.\nIn Lands of Mystery.\nDarkwhisper Gorge consists of a series of ravines and canyons atop the mountainous range that borders &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. It is now inhabited by agents of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href=\"pit%20lord\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"felguard\"&gt;felguard&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"doom%20guard\"&gt;doom guard&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s. Thousands of the foul creatures live here, and their leaders are unknown. There are fissures and caves leading deep into the ground, not all of which look natural. It is likely the demons may be tunneling underneath the summit, closer to the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarkwhisper Gorge hides a massive army of demons powerful enough to besiege Mount Hyjal \u2014 but they seem to be waiting for something. If they ever attack Hyjal, the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mazthoril\"&gt;Mazthoril&lt;/a&gt; will be needed to assist the rest of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s at the summit.\nThe recent success of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; town of &lt;a href=\"Everlook\"&gt;Everlook&lt;/a&gt; has brought more adventurers into Winterspring, which the natives hope will aid them in defeating the threat of the demons of Darkwhisper Gorge.\nEventually the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s discovered that the waters of the Well of Eternity were draining: the demons had manage to create an underground tunnel system below the well, and drained the powerful waters into their tunnels to use for their own purposes.

It wasn't always called this way.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; are all descended from night elves, their languages of &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shalassian\"&gt;Shalassian&lt;/a&gt; respectively bear some resemblance to Darnassian. There are, however, strong ideological differences between the night elves and their distant kin. Thus, a linguist must take great care in drawing comparisons between Darnassian and its cousin languages. Night elves tend to consider such comparisons offensive.\nThe hearty &lt;a href=\"frostsaber\"&gt;frostsaber&lt;/a&gt;'s ferocious appetite earned it the nickname \"Dragon Belly\" in the night elf language.\nDarnassian primer (official translations).\n&lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; have internally developed a grammatical template for Darnassian. Here are a few common Darnassian phrases and words, for which the translations have been officially confirmed by Blizzard:\nIn-game parser.\nThis is the list of words created by the in-game language parser for the Darnassian language, which is listed as language number two (word range 101-202) in the Language text file. \nNote: The language algorithm used by the in-game \"translator\" merely makes the words \"look\" like Darnassian. It does not actually use a specific dictionary. Therefore, translated in-game speech isn't true Darnassian.\nRelated languages.\nThe novel \"&lt;a href=\"Cycle%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Cycle of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;\" mentions \"four elven dialects\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; all speak languages derived from Darnassian. The Naga (former &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne elves&lt;/a&gt;), speak the language &lt;a href=\"Nazja\"&gt;Nazja&lt;/a&gt;, which is as corrupted as the creatures who speak it. The language of the high elves, who were exiled from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, changed into what is now known as &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;. It is also the language of the blood elves.\nDarnassian, Thalassian, and Najza seem to have many common phrases, as is evidenced by Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;' use of \"Ishnu'alah\", &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;'s \"Ishnu'dal'dieb\", as well as the names of the different elf subtypes, the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Quel%27dorei\"&gt;Quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sin%27dorei\"&gt;Sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe high elves have very long life spans compared to humans, so Thalassian might be so similar to Darnassian that it would be more correct to call it a dialect, rather than a separate language. However, various sources call them languages, and imply that there would be difficulty in communication between the separate languages.\nIn the RPG.\nBeyond the current spoken version of Darnassian there is one ancient dialect of Darnassian, written in Darnassian runes. However, it is possible that it is the language currently known as &lt;a href=\"Elven%20%28language%29\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; which is also spoken on Mount Hyjal.\nNight elf names.\nNight elf names always have a special meaning. First names derive from an elven word or the name of a famous hero having a totemic or ancestral connection. Surnames are indicative of the family line and often date back millennia.\nSpeculation.\nIt has been pointed out that Darnassian, an old language, shares the same root word with the name of the Night Elven capital, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, a city created relatively recently. Some reasons as to why this may be include: 1) the language was always called Darnassian, and the city was named for the language; 2) there was no name for the language prior to the foundation of the city, and so they bore the same, 3) the name of the language was changed, or 4) \"darnass\" has a translation that is not yet known.\nBased on the primer above, one can draw several conclusions as to the meanings of specific words, suffixes and prefixes in the Darnassian language:"}

Its goal is to infer the rules of &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; grammar from the samples of Darnassian speech given in the games and lore. Many of the early translations, however, were made up by fans when little to no official translations had been published. In the table below, some phrases are listed as \"official translations\", and others are listed as \"fan translations\". \"Official translation\" is self-explanatory, while \"fan translation\" means that the translation has been randomly made up by fans where no official information was given at the time.

However, in times of war, the kaldorei also rely heavily on &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hippogryphs\"&gt;hippogryphs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, and others.\nHistorically, &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;'s army has been based from the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and is most active on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; where it usually acts in a defensive role to protect kaldorei lands. As part of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, however, the Darnassian Army has seen action across Azeroth and beyond, dealing with threats such as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nOverview.\nThe Darnassian Army is mostly made up of &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, supported in battle by other races of the forest, such as &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"treants\"&gt;treants&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keepers of the grove&lt;/a&gt;. In times of need, these natural allies will by rallied and can prove decisive on the battlefield. Many units also consist of kaldorei mounted on various &lt;a href=\"beast\"&gt;beast&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph\"&gt;Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt; are generally used for aerial attacks, while &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s are the preferred ground mount for Darnassian forces. Even the night elves' own ancestors may aid them in war in the form of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, having become one with the forest itself.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s form the bulk of kaldorei soldiers, in recent times they been increasingly joined by other units (male and female) such as &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priestess\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt;es, and small numbers of &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20thrower\"&gt;Glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s are the chief siege weapon of the Darnassian Army, able to hurl massive glaives at targets from a distance.\nThe Darnassian military maintains bases across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, with the largest at &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;Feathermoon Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, and contested sections of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. The army's former headquarters and namesake, the city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, was ultimately destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, when the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; was burned by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond Kalimdor, kaldorei forces also have major presences on the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, among others. As part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; army, they are stationed even more extensively across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond.\nDivisions.\nThe Darnassian Army is made up of numerous subgroups, including:"}

They stood as the only available defenders against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion of the kaldorei homelands during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; army led by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; departed &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; intelligence believed that it was bound for &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. In response, most of the night elf &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Army\"&gt;Sentinel Army&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched on a fleet south, leaving &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; lightly defended. However, the Horde army then derived north. Only the Darnassian City Guard would be immediately available to defend &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and the other regions on the warpath.\nThe Guard mobilized quickly in response to the threat, though they could not prevent the rapid fall of many outposts across Ashenvale. Led by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Captain Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt;, they would gather in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt; and assess the situation. Small reinforcements in the form of Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; were sent from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to meet the defenders there, but discovered Astranaar ruined upon arrival. A trap laid by the night elves there had failed, and the City Guard had been unable to stop the Horde's advance into neighboring &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter dealing the enemy stragglers in Astranaar and honoring the dead there, Captain Summermoon continued on to southern Darkshore, where &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and the rest of the City Guard were engaged in a fierce defensive battle. Malfurion would call together a massive &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt; wall, forming a temporary battle line, while the kaldorei defenders fought to contain Horde breakthroughs.\nOver the following days, the Horde continued to push through Darkshore, past the wisp wall, before being once again halted by the Darnassian defenders at &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt;. The City Guard's numbers remained too few to do anything but hold the invaders in place, and so Malfurion, Delaryn, and some of the Alliance champions returned to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to rally reinforcements. The militia guards at Wildbend River were soon strengthened by more forces from Teldrassil, and most importantly by the recently-returned armies bound for &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeldrassil's defenders would fight desperately to hold the Horde back, but even with the reinforcements it proved ultimately in vain. Outflanked from &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and with the wisp wall crumbling, the night elves would eventually lose &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; and most ground leading to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; while suffering heavy losses. There, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; would order Teldrassil itself to be burned as an example, as Captain Summermoon looked on, close to death.\nThe loss of so many fighters proved a major blow for the night elves as a whole. It is unclear whether the Darnassian City Guard survived the fall of Darkshore and the Burning of Teldrassil; without Darnassus totally destroyed, it is unlikely the organization continued in its previous form. Many of the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Archer\"&gt;Darnassian Archer&lt;/a&gt;s and other units seen forming its ranks, however, would later take part in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; along with other Alliance armies.\nSpeculation.\nThe Darnassian City Guard may be a branch of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Army\"&gt;Sentinel Army&lt;/a&gt;, since their forces include Sentinels."}

{"id": "14056", "revid": "52262261", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14056", "title": "Darnassus", "text": "Darnassus (aka Darnassus City), now known as Remains of Darnassus, was the &lt;a href=\"Capital\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, found in western &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The High Priestess, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, resided in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by other &lt;a href=\"sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and her mate, the Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarnassus was the greatest city of the night elves, housing the leaders of both the druids and the faithful of Elune. It was carefully guarded by Sentinels, ancient protectors, and ancients of war. It was destroyed during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nThe atmosphere inside the city is quiet and tranquil. It does not have the feeling of confinement that one would feel in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, where the buildings are grouped close together. Darnassus is open to the sky, and the graceful bridges spanning the lake around which it is built set the buildings wide apart. The elegant bridges, beautiful groves, and leaf-covered pathways that dot the city\u2019s landscape are testaments to the night elves\u2019 reverence for nature. One of Darnassus\u2019s most notable structures is the stunning Temple of the Moon, the center of worship for High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind and her Sisters of Elune. The prime reason why the city's population is so low is that it is isolated: Teldrassil is a small island away from the main mass of Azeroth, and the only way to gain access from another continent is to fly or sail to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt;, a small settlement at the base of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and from there step into the glowing portal to the city proper. Darnassus is home to night elves of all vocations, and the city has recently opened its doors to human refugees from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; as well. Many of these embattled humans have contracted a strange curse that transforms them into feral wolf-beasts known as worgen. Although they\u2019re usually reclusive, the night elves have allowed these outsiders into Darnassus because they know the perils of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt;' cursed state all too well: it was, in fact, a group of night elf druids that created Azeroth\u2019s first worgen millennia ago. Despite the arrival of these new residents, Darnassus remains a symbol of the night elves\u2019 rich culture and glorious history.\nHistory.\nAfter the Third War.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves had to adjust to their mortal existence. Such an adjustment was far from easy, and there were many night elves who could not adjust to the prospects of aging, disease, and frailty. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world. With &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; missing, &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the leader of those who wished to plant the new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 became the new Archdruid. In no time at all, he and his fellow druids had forged ahead and planted the great tree, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, off the stormy coasts of northern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Under their care, the tree sprouted up above the clouds. Among the twilight boughs of the colossal tree, the wondrous city of Darnassus took root. Darnassus was built to honor the survival of the night elven race.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHigh atop the boughs of the enormous tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; is the wondrous city of Darnassus, the new refuge of the reclusive &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s alike make their homes among the rows of wood-crafted lodges and delicately tended groves. The &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; rises like a shining beacon above the trees, flanked by the colonnaded &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Hall of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, where the vigilant &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; gather to safeguard the land. Ruled by the High Priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, Darnassus stands as a tranquil testament to all that the night elves hold sacred. A city in tune with the rush and flow of nature, Darnassus was built along the shores of a large lake, with elegant bridges spanning its crystalline waters. Elsewhere, the falling leaves of the forest carpet the soft pathways of the city.\nDarnassus is the new capital city of the night elves and after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; they sided with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to repel the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' desecration of their forests. While they still hold a bond with their druid &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;cousins&lt;/a&gt;, they didn't take it lightly when they joined the Horde. The easy way to enter the city is by taking a portal found at &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; and to return to the village you simply take the same one. Most notable people to reside here are &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; where he sends adventurers to do some tasks and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; who is the official leader of their society. The city is an Alliance only territory.\n&lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn%20embassy\"&gt;Argent Dawn embassy&lt;/a&gt; is also located here.\nStormrage.\nRecently, Malfurion returned from the Emerald Dream and helped imprison Fandral, who, as it turned out, had been turned insane by Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; and responsible for the corruption of Teldrassil. Malfurion, druids, and Alexstrasza with Ysera redeemed and blessed the Tree. Archdruid Stormrage now stands in the Temple of the Moon alongside his beloved.\nSeeds of Faith.\nShortly after the Shattering, a memorial service was held there by Tyrande for all those who died in the villages hit by the Cataclysm.\nCataclysm.\nWith &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; refugees coming in from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt; was grown from a seed taken from Gilneas to serve as a home for them.\nWolfheart.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande and Malfurion conducted a summit near Darnassus in order to vote the proud worgen of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance. However, resentment of Gilneas and its ruler, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, runs deep in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. His refusal to forgive Genn for closing his nation off from the rest of the world years ago endangers more than just the summit: it threatens to unravel the Alliance itself. However, Varian's animosity was only one of many unsettling developments in Darnassus. An uneasiness creeps over the once-immortal night elves as the first of them fall victim to the infirmities of age. While they cope with their mortality, tensions flare over the reintroduction of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, formerly the highest caste of night elf nobility, into their society. Many night elves are unable to pardon the Highborne for the destruction unleashed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; millennia ago by their reckless use of magic. When a murdered Highborne was discovered on the outskirts of Darnassus, Malfurion and Tyrande move to stop further bloodshed and unrest by appointing one of the night elves' most cunning and skilled agents to find the killer: the renowned &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev's brother, had also returned and brought his wife with him in an attempt to heal her of her illness. Jarod then cooperated with Maiev in helping her with her case. Meanwhile, Malfurion attempted to mend fences between Varian and Genn. After the battle for Ashenvale was over, the identity of the Highborne murderer was discovered and the Alliance resolved their issues and voted Gilneas back into the Alliance.\nLandfall.\nThanks to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Connelly\"&gt;Agent Connelly&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance found out what the Horde were up to and took the upper hand. Night elf Sentinels located the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Korune\"&gt;hidden crypt&lt;/a&gt;, found and secured the &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Bell\"&gt;Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt; and took it to Darnassus, all thanks to the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Sarannha%20Skyglaive\"&gt;Sarannha Skyglaive&lt;/a&gt;.However, it was all in vain, as a &lt;a href=\"Fanlyr%20Silverthorn\"&gt;sunreaver agent&lt;/a&gt; working for the horde infiltrated the city under the banner of neutrality by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and entered undetected, he located the bell in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and teleported it to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. After learning of the theft, &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; goes to its former location and found specs of magic leading a path to the city's exit. After finding the source, she saw a portal leading to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and it was at this point that she realized that action needs to be taken. Soon after the discovery, the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; began.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, portals were created between Darnassus and &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. The night elven forces arrived to &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt; from the city.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAlliance adventurers swept Darnassus when the fire broke out during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; in order to save remaining civilians. Darnassus was ultimately destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors moved to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where they settled in the area around &lt;a href=\"Olivia%27s%20Pond\"&gt;Olivia's Pond&lt;/a&gt; with injured refugees in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt; and along the canals. Others were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerraces.\nDarnassus is arranged in a few terraces on the north, east and southern sides of a central lake area.\nNotable characters.\nFrom her seat in the Temple of the Moon, the high priestess &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; rules with the support of her fellow &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20moon\"&gt;priestesses of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;. Next to her, her husband Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; presides over his druidic compatriots. Before the Cataclysm, Archdruid Fandral Staghelm led the druids and struggled to control Darnassus. For his corruption of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, he was eventually imprisoned in Moonglade.\nFaction.\nRewards.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the RPG.\nThe city is formidable in spite of the peaceful natures of the night elves. In addition to the night elves, many guests and diplomats from elsewhere reside here, such as groups from the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20Guild\"&gt;Explorers' Guild&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a few representatives of the Horde negotiating peace treaties. The population here is almost entirely elven, and most of the night elves are tolerant of others. However, there is political strife between the druids and priests."}

The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, seeking resources, had sent the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, unaware of the area's inhabitants. The night elves took great offense to the orcish presence in their lands and attacked. While the orcs had some initial victories, that ended when &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; arrived, mistaking the orcs for demons and destroying most of their outposts. In desperation, the Warsong clan once more consumed demon blood, becoming powerful &lt;a href=\"chaos%20orc\"&gt;chaos orc&lt;/a&gt;s and proceeded to kill Cenarius.\nAt the height of this conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and its terrifying &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; assaulted the night elves' lands. Tyrande rallied the night elf defenders and awoke &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to combat the resurgent threat. For the vast majority of the third war, the night elves remained hostile to the allied &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Expedition\"&gt;Alliance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Only during the final battle, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, did the night elves join with the mortal races, standing to defend the world tree. In the end, even this alliance didn't manage to stop the invading demons, but it managed to delay them long enough for Malfurion to complete a magic ritual. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the demonic invasion, was torn apart by thousands of &lt;a href=\"Wisp\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, finally being killed by the world tree itself.\nAlthough victorious, the night elves suffered greatly from the battle with Archimonde at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. Their beloved &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, created and blessed by the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; to grant the night elves immortality, had been sacrificed to elicit a massive blast of energy to slay Archimonde. With Nordrassil's destruction, so went the night elves' sole source of protection from aging, disease, and frailty.\nCreation of Teldrassil.\nOver time, Nordrassil slowly began to heal its wounds, but a number of druids led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; desired to create another World Tree that would restore the night elves' immortality. Malfurion warned against this act of self-interest, but he fell into a coma caused by &lt;a href=\"%3Amorrowgrain\"&gt;:morrowgrain&lt;/a&gt;, his spirit lost within the Dream, Fandral forged ahead with his plans unopposed, becoming the new leader of the druids. Aided by the &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Circle of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; was planted off the stormy coast of northern Kalimdor secretly using a branch from &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;' tree-body, and eventually it towered among the clouds. Within this tree, the night elves founded the great city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; in honor of their survival - and thus formed this new nation in its name. However, the dragon aspects refused to bless this new tree, and Teldressil would soon fell prey to the corruption of both the Burning Legion and the Emerald Nightmare.\nTyrande, however, embraced their new capital which would quickly become the center of kaldorei political, spiritual, and military power in the world. She devoted herself fully to leading her people from Darnassus, promoting her right hand &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; to serve as General of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in her stead.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn Darnassus, Tyrande ruled from the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded by members of the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Warrior's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; would become the main base for the city's &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinel guardians&lt;/a&gt;. The night elves made Darnassus their new capital city, and with Malfurion gone, Tyrande became the sole leader of the night elves, priestesses, Sentinels and Darnassus. Tyrande strived to keep the night elves from reliving the mistakes of the past, but Archdruid Fandral Staghelm's radical beliefs and aggressive demeanor would often lead him and Tyrande to openly quarrel.\nFour years passed since the mortal races banded together and stood united against the might of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the Battle of Mount Hyjal. Though Azeroth was saved, the tenuous pact between the night elves, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; soon evaporated. Since the end of the Third War, the night elves were steadfast members of the Alliance. Not all night elves joined the Alliance, however, with the druids of the neutral &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; settled in the city of &lt;a href=\"Nighthaven\"&gt;Nighthaven&lt;/a&gt;. Though individual druids still have roles in the night elf nation, the druids as an organization remain neutral to this day, even accepting and training members of the Horde.\nCorruption at home.\nOver time, the calm of Teldrassil's enchanted forests would slowly fall into the shadow of a &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;sinister presence&lt;/a&gt;. Crazed &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and fouler beasts began to appear on Teldrassil, occupying all the attention of the ever-vigilant Sentinels and the wise &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. Tyrande became aware of the corruption eating away at the Emerald Dream. When &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; assaulted &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, the High Priestess led a half dozen of her &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Ahn%27Qiraj%29\"&gt;fellow priestesses&lt;/a&gt; to aid the defenders. Tyrande herself took on Eranikus alongside &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the strength of the Nightmare eating away at Eranikus, the light of Elune as channeled through Tyrande was enough to free the \"Tyrant of the Dream\".\nThe Sentinel Army were active dealing with the &lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;spirits&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowsong%20Shrine\"&gt;Shadowsong Shrine&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar against the Horde.\nTensions with the Horde would further demand the presence of the Sentinel Army. The night elves began a massive push to retake the forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. focusing their efforts on ridding the land of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Outriders\"&gt;Warsong Outriders&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. The &lt;a href=\"Silverwing%20Sentinels\"&gt;Silverwing Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; in particular would answer the call, swearing not to rest until every last &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; was defeated and cast out of &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;. To this day, the battle over the area remains fierce. The Sentinels also remained wary of more local threats, such as recent furbolg attacks into Ashenvale.\nAs members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves also began deploying Sentinels to distant lands at this time taking part in multiple international conflicts. Several units were thus present in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; assisting the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;, and Darnassus would once again be fighting in the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Outrunners\"&gt;Alliance Outrunners&lt;/a&gt; were present in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nA &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20spies\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt; of Sentinels was likewise sent to pressure the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, where they established themselves on &lt;a href=\"Shalandis%20Isle\"&gt;Shalandis Isle&lt;/a&gt; with the aim of spying on the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Sentinels stood alongside their &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; brethren during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and were among the first Azerothians to push through the reopened &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. They would take part in the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland%23Prelude\"&gt;Battle for the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, mostly as archers in support of the front line troops, and continued to hold the line as a foothold was established. Later in the campaign, Sentinel units were active in the region of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountain\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where they established the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanaar\"&gt;Sylvanaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft: The Comic.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Lo'Gosh&lt;/a&gt; visited Darnassus to give the &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, they also met Tyrande at the Temple of the Moon and later on at dinner when Lo'Gosh told his story to the priestess. She sensed the dark magic in his amnesia and sent the two friends to seek &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s council in &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke, he sent his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; into all corners of Azeroth. To defeat the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and necropolises, members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and created an artifact of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s Light. Adventurers of the Alliance delivered it to Tyrande to defend the World Tree. Tyrande also added that the elves sensed another World Tree in the domain of the Lich King.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinels were among the multitude of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces that composed the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, many night elf soldiers were by this time members of the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, which spearheaded the Alliance's advance against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. A predominantly Sentinel outpost in the form of &lt;a href=\"Stars%27%20Rest\"&gt;Stars' Rest&lt;/a&gt; was established in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; and served as a base for operations against the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in the area.\n&lt;a href=\"Jaelyne%20Evensong\"&gt;Jaelyne Evensong&lt;/a&gt; led a delegation of Darnassus representatives in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrande was present at the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;Elemental Unrest meeting&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; where she expressed her belief that the earthquakes may have been what brought the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; worsened and druids in the nation of Darnassus started slipping into comas like &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had years ago, their spirits drawn by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; commanded the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to help the citizens of Darnassus, while druids aided by the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, Lord &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, and the Nightmare that he had orchestrated was defeated and most of its' corruption cleansed. In the aftermath, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; blessed Teldrassil, restoring nature's ancient bond with the night elves. Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; got married, now sharing rulership of the night elf nation.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nWhen word reached the night elves of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;'s fate (turning into stone while trying to help heal the land), Tyrande personally came to &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. With Malfurion by her side, she was in attendance during the ceremony honoring Magni. It was during this time that Lady Whisperwind met the &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;young prince of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; for the first time.\nA dozen Sentinels guarding a crop caravan were attacked and killed by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. Blame for the act would, however, be manipulated to fall on the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and their new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Two soldiers arrived in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to report the attack to High King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. These events would result in a meeting between &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt;, and other &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; challenging Garrosh to a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; duel.\nCataclysm.\nThe natural disasters caused by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; took many lives from &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran&lt;/a&gt; and other night elf villages across the nation's territory, including Feralas and the battles against the &lt;a href=\"Hatecrest\"&gt;Hatecrest&lt;/a&gt; naga there. When Tyrande returned to Darnassus, she conducted a memorial service for all those who had fallen from the recent calamitous events.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Sentinels and night elves were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; in search of the &lt;a href=\"Rethiel%20the%20Greenwarden\"&gt;Greenwarden&lt;/a&gt;, where they established &lt;a href=\"Greenwarden%27s%20Grove\"&gt;Greenwarden's Grove&lt;/a&gt;. There they would come into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, though the Sentinels were easily able to hold off the orcs' attacks.\nDealing with Teldrassil's corruption.\nAmong the foremost guardians of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Sentinels were some of the first to respond to emergent threats to the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;corruption&lt;/a&gt; buried deep within the tree itself had begun to emerge and threatened to overtake the region. The Sentinels continued to draw on all available recruits to aid their efforts, especially around the area of &lt;a href=\"Shadowglen\"&gt;Shadowglen&lt;/a&gt;. These forces dealt with many new enemies across Teldrassil, particularly the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Gnarlpine%20tribe\"&gt;Gnarlpine tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s based from &lt;a href=\"Ban%27ethil%20Hollow\"&gt;Ban'ethil Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinel forces were also dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Glade\"&gt;Oracle Glade&lt;/a&gt;, to push back an encroaching colony of &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the corruption afflicting Teldrassil was decisively purged, and the future of the World Tree secured.\nThe Shen'dralar is welcomed.\nA group of &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; known as the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; successfully appealed to &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; to be allowed to make a return to kaldorei society. After the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves had outlawed arcane magic on the pain of death. However, &lt;a href=\"A%20Cautious%20Return\"&gt;some time before the Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; a Highborne archmage named &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; sought an audience with Tyrande and proposed to set aside long-standing differences and to combine resources, skills and numbers to prepare the wider night elven race for the challenges it faces. Despite the doubts of certain &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;s, this proposal was accepted. The Shen'dralar were allowed a cautious return among their kaldorei brethren, with some young night elves being trained by them to become new night elven mages, and, conversely, some of the Highborne taking up the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic arts or being initiated into &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;priesthood&lt;/a&gt;, major societal changes that marked the first steps towards reconciliation between the Highborne and wider night elven society.\nThe Gilnean refugees.\nAfter an outbreak spread the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; uncontrollably across the war-torn nation of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, the Shattering also destroyed the reefs which protected this &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; kingdom from naval attacks, causing the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to launch an &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;. A contingent of Sentinels with heavy siege weaponry accompanied a major fleet that landed at &lt;a href=\"Keel%20Harbor\"&gt;Keel Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, assisting the worgen in acquiring the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, helping them to understand and deal with their transformation and holding back the Forsaken's assault. Together, the Sentinels and Gilneans bought the civilian populace time to evacuate by ship to Teldrassil. After this, the kaldorei integrated the &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Gilnean Worgen&lt;/a&gt; into their culture; granting them asylum within &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; itself, in the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt;, allowing several female worgen warriors to join the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; army and bringing worgen druids into the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrande and Malfurion conducted a summit near Darnassus in order to vote the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance. However, resentment of Gilneas and its ruler, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, ran deep in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. However, Varian's animosity was only one of many unsettling developments in Darnassus. An uneasiness crept over the once-immortal night elves as the first of them fell victim to the infirmities of age. While they coped with their mortality, tensions flared over the reintroduction of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; into their society. Many night elves were unable to pardon the Highborne for the destruction unleashed on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; millennia ago by their reckless use of magic. When a murdered Highborne was discovered on the outskirts of Darnassus, Malfurion and Tyrande moved to stop further bloodshed and unrest by appointing one of the night elves' most cunning and skilled agents to find the killer: the renowned &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev's brother, had also returned and brought his wife with him in an attempt to heal her of her illness. Jarod cooperated with Maiev in helping her with her case. Meanwhile, Malfurion attempted to mend fences between Varian and Genn.\nDrama in Feralas.\nGeneral of the Sentinel Army &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Sardor%20Isle\"&gt;Sardor Isle&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"southern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;southern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was invaded by a &lt;a href=\"Hatecrest\"&gt;Hatecrest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; force led by Lady &lt;a href=\"Szenastra\"&gt;Szenastra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Nelara\"&gt;Nelara&lt;/a&gt; was tasked with the evacuation of the civilians from the stronghold. The naga eventually drove them from the island, while Shandris and a few survivors were rescued by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;. Shandris relocated to the mainland where they built a &lt;a href=\"Feathermoon%20Stronghold\"&gt;new fortress&lt;/a&gt;. The Sentinels remained undeterred, however, and launched a massive effort to push the naga out of their territory. With help from Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, Shandris and her forces were successful in crushing the invaders' ranks and slaying their leader. The new war effort in Feralas at this time would lead to several changes for the Sentinels themselves, such as the addition of the &lt;a href=\"Moonclaw%20Warrior\"&gt;Moonclaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; to their ranks for the first time. General Feathermoon herself would mentor at least three of the worgen to serve as her lieutenants.\nIn other parts of Feralas, the night elves worked against &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; clan, who sought to abuse ancient powers within &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;. To properly wage this campaign, the Sentinels called on their allies from the forests, including local &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s. Their forces rallied, the kaldorei confronted Cho'gall himself in Dire Maul's arena, where they decisively defeated him. This victory would end &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; influence in Dire Maul, and firmly drive the cult from Feralas. Under orders from Feathermoon, Sentinel and Alliance forces would further make war on the &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s in southern Feralas. The gnolls were eventually dealt with, and the Sentinels further rallied the region's &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s for their war effort. Other threats neutralized at this time included the &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt; infesting the &lt;a href=\"Writhing%20Deep\"&gt;Writhing Deep&lt;/a&gt;, and the ogre garrison at the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni%20Outpost\"&gt;Gordunni Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. Sentinels forces would also engage with the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; in and around &lt;a href=\"New%20Thalanaar\"&gt;New Thalanaar&lt;/a&gt; in Feralas's far east. The &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; laid siege to the outpost in an attempt to seize the area, and fighting between them and the kaldorei defenders would spill over into neighboring &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;. This particular conflict would continue for some time, even after the end of the Cataclysm.\nThe Ashenvale war.\nSoon after the evacuation of &lt;a href=\"Gilnean\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20war\"&gt;Ashenvale war&lt;/a&gt; started when &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; began a renewed campaign to conquer &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, launching two separate Horde offensives in the region. Across the zone, Sentinel forces with assistance from the rest of the Alliance worked to halt or turn back the Horde's advance centered on &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, with varying degrees of success. Small-scale skirmishes with the Horde would occur at &lt;a href=\"Bathran%27s%20Haunt\"&gt;Bathran's Haunt&lt;/a&gt; and in the areas surrounding Astranaar. Astranaar itself was also attacked by &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Hellions\"&gt;Hellscream's Hellions&lt;/a&gt; from the air, and the town was subsequently set on fire. Sentinel and Alliance forces were eventually able to control the blaze while using &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s to repel the airborne attackers. Throughout the coming campaign, Astranaar would remain intact as the Sentinels' main base in Ashenvale.\nEarly in the conflict, the fortified position at &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt; was one of the first bases to fall to the Horde, who turned the resident &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s against the sentinel defenders. The surviving forces would regroup at &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt;, as Silverwind became the Horde's launching point for the coming campaign. The Sentinel Army would strike would go on the offensive against the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt; to the east, with the intention of interrupting their logging efforts there. Accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War\"&gt;ancients of War&lt;/a&gt;, the sentinels rampaged through the camp itself, slaying &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Gorthak\"&gt;Overseer Gorthak&lt;/a&gt;, and laid siege to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;. In preparing to try and retake Silverwind Refuge, the night elves based from Stardust Spire chose to deal with the befouled water elementals of &lt;a href=\"Mystral%20Lake\"&gt;Mystral Lake&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, they were able to purge many of the elementals, as well as the corruption's source: &lt;a href=\"Tideress\"&gt;Tideress&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike Astranaar and other outposts, &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt; was also targeted by the Horde. Ground forces accompanied by &lt;a href=\"demolisher\"&gt;demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s battered the small Sentinel garrison commanded by &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Onaeya\"&gt;Sentinel Onaeya&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the odds, the tide was turned by the intervention of Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt;, who led small Sentinel strike teams to effectively cripple the Horde forces and their artillery. Responsible for controlling the surrounding area of the forest, Maestra's Post continued to act as a strategic asset for the kaldorei. The vanguard of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s from the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; made contact with Sentinel troops stationed at &lt;a href=\"Raynewood%20Tower\"&gt;Raynewood Tower&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Raynewood%20Retreat\"&gt;Raynewood Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, another of the night elves' forward outposts. The tower's defenders were aided in their struggle by local &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s. Raynewood would eventually be reinforced with the Forest Heart, allowing the defenders to summon the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Shadumbra\"&gt;Shade of Shadumbra&lt;/a&gt; against their foes. The essence of this great cat was highly effective at tearing through the Warsong ranks, defeating at least 50 of the attackers along with much of their artillery. This marked a major Sentinel victory that decisively preserved Raynewood.\nBy the time &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, the Horde had been fully driven from the Ashenvale forest. After the battle for Ashenvale was over, the identity of the Highborne murderer was discovered to be the traitorous Maeiv. Following Maiev's betrayal, Tyrande appointed Shandris to assist &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; in choosing from among the Sentinels some possible candidates for his new security force. The Alliance resolved their issues and voted Gilneas back into the Alliance.\nThe war reaches Darkshore.\nThough &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had become the co-ruler of the night elves, his &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; remained a neutral organization, intent on restoring balance following the cataclysm. Malfurion himself halted the slow collapse of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, with aid from &lt;a href=\"Thessera\"&gt;Thessera&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aroom\"&gt;Aroom&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Wildkin\"&gt;Wildkin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Brownpaw\"&gt;Elder Brownpaw&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;. Along the coast near &lt;a href=\"Auberdine\"&gt;Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinels mounted on &lt;a href=\"hippogryph\"&gt;hippogryph&lt;/a&gt;s worked to rescue many civilians fleeing the ruined town. Though numerous night elves were rescued, many did not survive the ordeal.\nNight elf territory was one of the main fronts during the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;Jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s joined the Horde and assaulted northern Darkshore. The Sentinels responded by sending a contingent of troops to the north from &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;. The conflict quickly escalated as both sides fought within the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Mathystra\"&gt;Ruins of Mathystra&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, the Sentinel forces attacked the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Shatterspear War Camp&lt;/a&gt; (reinforced by the Horde) in preparation for a full assault on &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The kaldorei were successful in sacking the War Camp, while also slaying much of the Shatterspear leadership. Wasting no time, a Sentinel army suddenly marched on Shatterspear Vale in full force, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s and siege weapons. The attack overwhelmed the troll defenders, who were pushed back into their encampment. There, the invading Sentinels crushed the remaining defenders, while also killing the Shatterspear leader &lt;a href=\"Jor%27kil%20the%20Soulripper\"&gt;Jor'kil the Soulripper&lt;/a&gt;. The decisive victory in Shatterspear Vale ended the troll threat in Darkshore for the foreseeable future, while securing Lor'danel's northern flank. Throughout Darkshore, the Sentinels, serving as the region's local defenders, continued to battle the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cult. As part of this, the ruined town of Auberdine was retaken and the Twilight's Hammer plans in the area dashed. The cult's presence in Darkshore, and the damage caused by their actions, was ultimately contained, though the local population had suffered greatly.\nThe Stonetalon massacre.\nAs the conflict began to spill over into the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinel &lt;a href=\"huntress\"&gt;huntress&lt;/a&gt;es and other Alliance forces struck against Horde elements around the border. Specifically, &lt;a href=\"Krom%27gar%20Incinerator\"&gt;Krom'gar Incinerator&lt;/a&gt;s destroying the local flora were attacked and routed. At Silverwind Refuge, the Sentinels further gathered intelligence on the new Horde weapon known as \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Bomb\"&gt;The Bomb&lt;/a&gt;\", while also dealing with &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Bombgineer%20Sploder\"&gt;Chief Bombgineer Sploder&lt;/a&gt;. A squadron of Sentinel huntresses were sent to scout the Horde's intentions at &lt;a href=\"Windshear%20Hold\"&gt;Windshear Hold&lt;/a&gt;; though many were captured, they would ultimately be freed by Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Point\"&gt;Trueshot Point&lt;/a&gt; would be set up as an extension of &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt; into Stonetalon Mountains. There, Darnassian cannoneers commanded by &lt;a href=\"Kalen%20Trueshot\"&gt;Kalen Trueshot&lt;/a&gt; began using &lt;a href=\"gnomish\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s to strike against Horde air forces in Stonetalon to great effect.\nFighting would prove especially fierce around &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Overlook\"&gt;Thal'darah Overlook&lt;/a&gt;, where Sentinels (along with other Alliance forces) held off a determined Horde siege. In the midst of the battle, the nearby &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt; would be bombed and completely destroyed by the Horde. In the wake of the destruction of Thal'darah Grove, the Sentinel forces at Thal'darah Overlook attempted to punch a hole through the Horde's lines to make contact with the base at &lt;a href=\"Farwatcher%27s%20Glen\"&gt;Farwatcher's Glen&lt;/a&gt;. Using &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s, they were successful in cutting through the sieging force and reaching the glen to the south.\nAway from the conflict with the Horde, at &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinels would find themselves attacked by minions of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s as a wave of corruption swept across the area. Many sentinels were overcome by this malignant force and turned on their sisters as they tried to fight back the tide. Under the direction of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Mistress%20Geleneth\"&gt;Sentinel Mistress Geleneth&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves gradually began to make progress, destroying the invading &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;n'raqi&lt;/a&gt; and laying their corrupted brethren to rest.\nAzshara.\nThe night elves continued to hold a military foothold in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; in the form of &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt;, from which the Sentinels' assault on new settlements of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; in Azshara was held off. While the Sentinels held the front line against orc grunts, Horde &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; would slip through and help undermine the defense from the rear.\nThe second Battle of Hyjal.\nHowever, the biggest contribution for the night elves following the cataclysm was at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; invaded to try and destroy &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Wardens\"&gt;Shadow Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Green Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; united against him, forming the &lt;a href=\"Guardians%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Guardians of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The guardians were successful in fighting off the initial &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; invasion, resurrecting several of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s. When the fire elementals invaded again, aided by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and his newly formed &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Druids of the Flame&lt;/a&gt;, the guardians were not only successful in fighting them off, but even managed to infiltrate the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; and many of his lieutenants, including Staghelm, as well as constructing the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Tree\"&gt;Sentinel Tree&lt;/a&gt; to keep watch over the area.\nTides of War.\n&lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;When the Horde was about to attack Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, Jaina asked Tyrande and Malfurion for warriors and ships. The High Priestess and her husband sent Shandris and a group of &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; to aid the defense effort.\nTyrande and her husband were also willing to help Varian in the counter-attack by sending a few dozen ships.\nMists of Pandaria.\nHigh Priestess Tyrande, having had a vision of some sort of light from the mysterious &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Youth\"&gt;Pools of Youth&lt;/a&gt; created by &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20empire\"&gt;an ancient civilization&lt;/a&gt; in the hidden continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, wondered if these pools could restore kaldorei immortality. She had &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Vaeldrin\"&gt;Lorekeeper Vaeldrin&lt;/a&gt; embark on a quest for the pools, backed by a group of Sentinels led by his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt;. Using a series of ancient magical scrolls, the lorekeeper successfully opened a &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; - these night elves were the first members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to arrive on the continent. In search of the pools, the night elf expedition clashed with the local &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, as well as a similar expeditionary force of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt;. However, the expedition from Darnassus soon found themselves trapped by mogu magic, imprisoned within a magic bubble that slowly drained their life, until &lt;a href=\"Kang%20Bramblestaff\"&gt;Kang Bramblestaff&lt;/a&gt; and an Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; rescued them. Soon thereafter the freed expedition constructed the &lt;a href=\"Incursion\"&gt;Incursion&lt;/a&gt; to continue their search for the pools.\nHowever, once found, it turned out that the pools would not grant immortality freely. Instead, they could only transfer life energies from one person to another. During a battle with the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, Lyalia was captured and killed. With the new knowledge of the nature of the pools' magic, Vaeldrin sacrificed himself to save his daughter. Despite these setbacks, the expedition was not without achievements, helping the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; fight off the &lt;a href=\"Dojani%20clan\"&gt;Dojani&lt;/a&gt; mogu and aiding in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Stoneplow\"&gt;Stoneplow&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, being one of the largest Alliance forces on the continent prior to &lt;a href=\"Landfall\"&gt;Landfall&lt;/a&gt;, Lyalia led the Sentinels to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; where they gained a strong presence at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt;.\nLandfall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; launched , Tyrande and a cadre of Sentinel &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; would be part of the united Alliance war effort in the &lt;a href=\"patch%205.1\"&gt;Landfall&lt;/a&gt; campaign. Based in &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; this invasion force waged a major campaign against the Horde in Krasarang Wilds. While there, she and her rangers begin to pursue a Horde party and eventually find them holed up in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Red%20Crane\"&gt;Temple of the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href=\"A%20Little%20Patience\"&gt;A Little Patience&lt;/a&gt; scenario, Tyrande is urging Varian to take decisive action and charge the temple by force, before the Horde could completely fortify themselves or be rescued by reinforcements. However, Varian decided to take a more cautious approach and was able to lure out the Horde army from the Temple of the Red Crane and decimate them with the Alliance's hidden traps. The victory resulted in the annihilation of the Horde army and its commander with minimal to no casualties for the Alliance. After attaining victory, Tyrande acknowledges the wisdom of Varian's strategy and becomes impressed by his leadership. Tyrande then pledges the night elves' support to Varian's command.\nTyrande is later seen in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Seven%20Stars\"&gt;Shrine of Seven Stars&lt;/a&gt; summit, where Alliance dignitaries and allies discuss the pros and cons of using the &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt;. She was horrified by the Sha's dark power and proposed to destroy them.\nThanks to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Agent%20Connelly\"&gt;Agent Connelly&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance learned of the Horde plans with the powerful mogu artifact called the &lt;a href=\"%3ADivine%20Bell\"&gt;:Divine Bell&lt;/a&gt;. Night elf sentinels located the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Korune\"&gt;hidden crypt&lt;/a&gt;, found and secured the Divine Bell and took it to Darnassus, all thanks to the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Sarannha%20Skyglaive\"&gt;Sarannha Skyglaive&lt;/a&gt;. However, it was all in vain, as a &lt;a href=\"Fanlyr%20Silverthorn\"&gt;sunreaver agent&lt;/a&gt; working for the horde infiltrated the city under the banner of neutrality by the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and entered undetected, he located the bell in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Enclave\"&gt;Cenarion Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and teleported it to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. After learning of the theft, &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; goes to its former location and found specs of magic leading a path to the city's exit. After finding the source, she saw a portal leading to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and it was at this point that she realized that action needs to be taken. Soon after the discovery, the &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; began.\nBack in northern Kalimdor, the nation of Darnassus also participated in the of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, transporting and escorting war resources taken from the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; out of the area.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande had mustered an army of her people in Ashenvale and began a slow march towards &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, picking up siege weapons and more troops on the way. After the Alliance and Horde rebel armada landed at &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande's forces appeared from the west and, using &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s, managed to destroy the front gate of Orgrimmar and prevent a protracted siege from developing. She and her Sentinels then distracted Garrosh's &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; to buy time for the Alliance forces and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; rebels to invade the city.\nWar Crimes.\nTyrande served as the accuser during &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh's&lt;/a&gt; trial in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt;. Her advisor for the trial was &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande displayed scenes from the past to prove the accusations against Garrosh, opposing the defender &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, freed Garrosh and took him with them, the &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; revealed that they never considered executing Garrosh for even a moment and that everyone else was on trial instead.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Sentinel\"&gt;guards&lt;/a&gt; accompanied the Alliance into , guarding &lt;a href=\"Starfall%20Outpost\"&gt;Starfall Outpost&lt;/a&gt;. They also had a small presence in and in &lt;a href=\"Stormshield\"&gt;Stormshield&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;. If chosen, they can also guard the &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall\"&gt;Lunarfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nA contingent of &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt;, was sent by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; to accompany and protect Archmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Cordana was, however, corrupted by and joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s side.\nLegion.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Warrior%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Warrior's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; of Darnassus would be the venue for a garden party hosted by the aristocratic &lt;a href=\"Taylenne%20Sweetsong\"&gt;Taylenne Sweetsong&lt;/a&gt; at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to the many &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20Dignitary\"&gt;dignitaries&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darnassus%20Dilettante\"&gt;dilettantes&lt;/a&gt; in attendance, their host was, in fact, a &lt;a href=\"homunculus\"&gt;homunculus&lt;/a&gt; sent by the Legion to infiltrate night elven society. A &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; working with &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; would ultimately infiltrate the city and assassinate Taylenne, bringing an end to the threat.\nSentinel units gathered in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and accompanied the Alliance forces into the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;first battle&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. They were also present in several areas of the Legion's &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;assaults&lt;/a&gt; across Azeroth where they established &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions%23Randomized%20military%20camps\"&gt;military camps&lt;/a&gt; to protect Alliance assets.\nTyrande attended &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s funeral in the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and assuaged King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s doubts about their success against the Burning Legion. She also approved of Anduin's decision to accept the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; into the Alliance ranks, noting that they will be a powerful weapon in their war against the demons. When &lt;a href=\"Jace%20Darkweaver\"&gt;Jace Darkweaver&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the funeral to inform the assembled leaders that Stormwind's guards have been infiltrated by the Legion, Tyrande realized that &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; had freed the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s from their imprisonment and the situation was even more dire than she realized.\nGeneral &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and several members of the Sentinels joined the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; based in &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and assisted the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s in their campaigns, such as fighting the Legion in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter receiving a vision of Malfurion, Tyrande traveled to &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to find that &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; had returned, corrupted &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, and captured her husband. Angered, Tyrande began to pursue the Nightmare Lord through the forest. In her pursuit, she discovered &lt;a href=\"Elothir\"&gt;Elothir&lt;/a&gt;, one of the three archdruids of Val'sharah, who had fallen to the Nightmare's corruption and dies before her eyes but not before leading her down Malfurion's trail.\nTyrande authorized the release of the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to the druids of the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt;, and sent &lt;a href=\"Valorn%20Stillbough\"&gt;Valorn Stillbough&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; and several of the Sentinels to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nTyrande was also present in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; as part of &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;a royal audience&lt;/a&gt; of Alliance member state leaders, attending the ceremonies hosted by &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to honor Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s for their effort in the battles against the Horde, rewarding them with a &lt;a href=\"%3AGrand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;:Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nInsurrection.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, portals were created between Darnassus and &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; in order for the Sentinels to engage in the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; to support the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; rebels in their war against &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande and her Sentinels arrived in &lt;a href=\"Meredil\"&gt;Meredil&lt;/a&gt;, forming a temporary alliance with the nearby &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, as well as reserving part of her camp for &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her war mages. Despite this temporary alliance, the elven nationalities did not go well together, and on the eve of battle, Tyrande, like Liadrin, was somewhat ashamed to admit that her forces had been exchanging insulting items and verbal harassment with the sin'dorei camp, and had any such items removed before insults turned into violence.\nTyrande promised the nightfallen leader to help defeat the Legion and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;. The Darnassus High Priestess arranged to spread bulletins and posters within Suramar City itself, to tell the residents of the Alliance's arrival and hopefully inspire more to join the rebellion.\nAlong with &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements, the kaldorei laid siege to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, before pushing into the metropolis itself. The Sentinels set up a major camp on the city limits, and after the sin'dorei and shal'dorei had breached the city's center, Tyrande led these kaldorei forces into the city.\nThe combined elven army fought straight to the foot of the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, but the kaldorei, sin'dorei, quel'dorei, and shal'dorei rebels were confronted by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; herself at the Nighthold gate. When she turned to address Tyrande, Elisande claimed that the kaldorei had disgraced their glorious past, hiding in trees and cloaking themselves in \"false piety\", no better than the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s that skulk their forests. Using her great mastery of time magic, Elisande trapped the combined elven army in a time stasis and departed. &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; then worked together with an Alliance adventurer to rescue Tyrande alone from the time bubble, while a Horde adventurer rescued Liadrin. The rest of the army, however, remained frozen in time on the steps before the Nighthold, the battle lost.\nWhen Thalyssra and her advisors relocated to the site of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, which had become unstable without the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, Liadrin and Tyrande observed whether the first arcanist will save it or let it die. After Thalyssra chose to let the Nightwell die, Tyrande was hopeful that the Nightborne would learn to survive without its corrupting powers.\nBefore the Storm.\nAfter being made aware of the dire condition &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; was in, Tyrande Whisperwind and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; met with King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the night elves' progress in healing Azeroth and their investigations about &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion told him that the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; to assess the damage. As they rode through the city of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, Malfurion further elaborated that the druids of &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; were all killed by Sargeras' destruction and Tyrande had sent &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;priestesses of Elune&lt;/a&gt; to help when she got word of their deaths. Although the night elves thought to make &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt;s to heal the wounds of Silithus, their priestesses and druids were unable to finish creating one with the goblins plundering Azerite from the land. The night elves, however, found a vein of Azerite and took some samples to study. Malfurion told Anduin that although he cannot deny the magnificence of Azerite's power, he promised Anduin the night elves will do all within their power to prevent its misuse. Tyrande introduced &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Cordressa%20Briarbow\"&gt;Sentinel Cordressa Briarbow&lt;/a&gt; to Anduin who's unit was providing protection to the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;. Anduin commended Tyrande for her wise initiative and pledged some of his own men to guard further expeditions as well. During their discussion, a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; portalled in to deliver a message from &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. Kalecgos reported &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s visit to him and informed Anduin she will be unavailable for the foreseeable future. Anduin revealed the message spoke of Jaina and all the leaders spoke of their hopes that Jaina will one day return to active duty in their coalition. With their business concluded, Anduin &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;d back to Stormwind.\nIn Silithus, Captain Briarbrow's unit was ultimately killed by the goblins of the Horde.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nAs part of the opening stages of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; readied itself for conquest on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. After being briefed of reports stating that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was deliberating heatedly the conquering of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind and King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; agreed this argument over war strategy indicated that the Horde had weaponized &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; and were planning to secure a monopoly of the mineral in Kalimdor. With the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; diminished from the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves remained the speediest &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; presence in Kalimdor to respond to Horde aggression. Tyrande had begun to secretly amass a night elf army in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to intercept the Horde forces should they march to Silithus. After further reports indicated that &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; had endorsed the Silithus campaign, Tyrande and the other Alliance leaders deliberated on their course of action. Tyrande stated that if the Alliance was in agreement, her army stood ready to deter the Horde's campaign. King Anduin, in the end, gave his endorsement to deploy the night elven troops. While Tyrande was at &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; aiding in the planning for the upcoming war and with the night elf fleet en route to Silithus, the Horde saw an opportunity to attack &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, leaving &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; to hold the line. When word reached Stormwind of the Horde invasion, the Alliance leaders realized that the Horde had deceived them into weakening Ashenvale's defenses. The Alliance leaders coordinated with each other to accommodate as many refugees as possible and to reinforce the Ashenvale warfront. Tyrande planned to fight by Malfurion's side as soon as she could, but she had to tend to the needs of the refugees being evacuated to Stormwind before she could depart to Kalimdor. Though troubled by her people's predicament, she was uplifted by her allies' stalwart commitment to her people's well being. She, in turn, assured her allies that even should her city fall and be held hostage, the Alliance will not become divided. \nWith only the &lt;a href=\"Darnassian%20City%20Guard\"&gt;Darnassian City Guard&lt;/a&gt; to protect many of their holdings, the kaldorei would eventually lose &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, as the invaders pressed on to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. Captain &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; directed the defense of the night elven territories, as the Sentinels worked frantically to slow the Horde. The most concentrated fighting initially occurred in southern and central Darkshore. Though the Sentinels inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy, their numbers were overwhelming. The Sentinel commanders are especially targeted and killed by Horde rogues.\nSometime in the late stages of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion's &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt; wall defense failed and he went off to confront Sylvanas alone. Malfurion sent a missive to Tyrande to tell her of his plan and his farewells. This new information had compelled Tyrande to fight by Malfurion's side despite Anduin's objections. When Anduin realized nothing he could say would dissuade her, he gave Tyrande his &lt;a href=\"%3AHearthstone\"&gt;:Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; that he had attuned to Stormwind and told Tyrande to come back with Malfurion alive, since their people would need their leadership in these troubled times now more than ever. After portalling into Darnassus, Tyrande gave an inspirational speech to improve morale for her people before taking her &lt;a href=\"Tamed%20Hippogryph\"&gt;Hippogryph&lt;/a&gt; to search for Malfurion. Tyrande prayed to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, who shined a shaft of moonlight from the sky to direct her to her beloved. Tyrande arrived to see Malfurion at the mercy of &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. But the old orc had struck Malfurion from behind while he had battled &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, which he found dishonorable, and could not bring himself to kill Malfurion. Tyrande arrived just in time to heal Malfurion's grievous wound and saved him from the brink of death. For sparing her husband's life Tyrande allowed Saurfang to live, and she brought Malfurion to Stormwind with the Hearthstone that Anduin had provided.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Wildbend%20River\"&gt;Wildbend River&lt;/a&gt;, the Darnassian Army was able to temporarily stop the Horde's advance, with both sides drawn into a military stalemate. Meanwhile, the fleet bound for Silithus returned with the majority of the Sentinel Army, further reinforcing the lines. All remaining Sentinel forces in Darnassus were now called on to join the fight. Despite their stalwart defense, the remainder of Darkshore would eventually fall to the Horde when they flanked &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande tasked an Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; with seeing to Darnassus during the Horde occupation, but soon after, the Horde burned &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; down. Tyrande went to the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; to aid in evacuation efforts and witnessed &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and his wife &lt;a href=\"Mia%20Greymane\"&gt;Mia&lt;/a&gt; rescue the last night elven refugee from the burning &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande named the last night elven survivor &lt;a href=\"Finel\"&gt;Finel&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 \"The last\" \u2014 for she was the last kaldorei to escape alive. Tyrande cradled baby Finel close and sang her an elegy.\nDarnassus was completely destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors moved to Stormwind City, where they settled in the area around &lt;a href=\"Olivia%27s%20Pond\"&gt;Olivia's Pond&lt;/a&gt; with injured refugees in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, and along the &lt;a href=\"Canals%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;canals&lt;/a&gt;. Others were evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Lordaeron and aftermath.\nIn a vengeful response to the &lt;a href=\"burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Sentinel units would make up some of the attacking force during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Siege of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe remaining Sentinels in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; were in command of &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Thenysil\"&gt;Sentinel Tara Thenysil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Jalin\"&gt;Huntress Jalin&lt;/a&gt; led her Sentinels against &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt;, attempting to retake it for the Alliance. &lt;a href=\"Big%20Baobob\"&gt;Big Baobob&lt;/a&gt; allied with the Sentinels.\nThe Night Warrior.\nSome time later, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; spoke to Anduin to try and convince him to assault Darkshore and retake it from the Horde, but with the war focused on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;; Anduin did not have the troops to do so. As the three night elves spoke to Anduin, Tyrande went on ahead of the army to try and retake Darkshore herself. At the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;/Darkshore border, Tyrande's ship was attacked by the Horde and she fled north while leaving behind her bow, her mount &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt;'s bridle, and a book about the Night Warrior ritual. The Night Warrior was the incarnation of Elune's wrath. The ritual to become the avatar of the Night Warrior was extremely dangerous, and even witnessing it would put you in danger. Legend said that long ago, the Night Warrior was used by the night elves to carve out their empire. None who have attempted the ritual since then have survived, for Elune's raw power tore them apart.\nTyrande arrived at the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Eye of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and from there to &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; to conduct the ritual. Along the way she lost Ash'alah, who was captured by the Horde. She was trailed by Maiev, Shandris, and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; while Sira scouted the beach. The three found and saved Ash'alah and met with Tyrande at Bashal'aran, where she declared to Elune that, with Elune having stood by and done nothing during the War of the Thorns, Tyrande would continue to serve Elune only if she granted Tyrande justice. Tyrande survived the ritual to become the Night Warrior, the avatar of Elune's fury, and turned her attention toward &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; on the shore. Blaming the Burning of Teldrassil on herself for allowing Saurfang to live, Tyrande swore that the time for mercy was over. Along the way to Nathanos she confronted &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; and his forces, then swiftly killed them and froze Belmont in place with Elune's magic. Malfurion also arrived to fight Nathanos alongside his beloved; however, Tyrande instead told him to wait at the sidelines until she gave the command.\nNathanos and two &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; were attempting to raise not only &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; who had died during the War of the Thorns, but also Sira who Tyrande arrived just barely too late to save from being killed. As she, the adventurer, and eventually Malfurion confronted Nathanos the two Val'kyr succeeded in raising Delaryn and Sira. Despite Tyrande's efforts to convince them not to give in to darkness, they blamed both her and Elune for abandoning them and declared their allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately the Horde got away, but not before Tyrande was able to slay &lt;a href=\"Brynja\"&gt;Brynja&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Val'kyr. Shandris and Maiev arrived and the night elf forces flew back to the Zoram Strand. On the way, Tyrande placed Maiev in charge of the warfront in Darkshore, as despite their checkered history with each other the future of their race was on the line. When Maiev asked where Sira had gone, Tyrande hesitated and then asked to speak with Maiev alone.\nBattle for Darkshore.\nAfter learning of Sira Moonwarden's fate, Maiev led her wardens, kaldorei forces, and the Alliance heroes to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and their Horde allies across northern Darkshore during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde army was led by none other than Sira herself.\nKul Tiras, the Alliance War Campaign, and Nazjatar.\nA group of night elves participated in the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20Assaults\"&gt;Alliance incursions&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;. They came under attack by the Horde.\nOrganization.\nPeople and culture.\nDespite being an ancient people, the kaldorei culture has only changed slightly over the millennia since the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nTheir way of life is still deeply rooted in their connection with nature and &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; the moon goddess. While respecting one another and often working closely together, the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"sentinels\"&gt;sentinels&lt;/a&gt; often prefer to keep separate company. The sentinels are closely related to the nation and its affiliation with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; while the druids of the nation often gather in neutral organizations outside of the nation. The balance of the society's dualistic state is clearly reflected in its co-ruling leadership, Tyrande and Malfurion.\nModern night elf society was founded on the very grounds of protecting nature, signified by their connection to the world tree. The night elven druids also have a close kinship with most of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s, as all known living ancient guardians were last seen on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; the archdruid son of Elune herself is amongst the most ancient allies of the night elves, admired by both the druids and the followers of Elune, and thus the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Cenarius\"&gt;Horn of Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;' power is said to call the spirits of all night elves.\nDarnassian society is heavily tied to their faith in Elune, as well as several other lesser gods. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; carry large political, social and cultural power. The night elves also worship their ancestors. This worship takes the form of offerings, traditionally rice cakes that are blessed in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Temple of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe night elves revere the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Moonsaber\"&gt;moonsabers&lt;/a&gt; because their shimmering coats symbolize the goddess of the moon, Elune, and they once believed that seeing the &lt;a href=\"Striped%20Dawnsaber\"&gt;dawnsaber&lt;/a&gt; breed in the wild was an ill omen. The &lt;a href=\"Hawk%20Owl\"&gt;dark-feathered bird of prey&lt;/a&gt; is often seen as a harbinger of doom amongst the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nPolitical structure.\nThe High Priestess is the leader of the nation.\n&lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Cenarion Circle, resided in the Cenarion Enclave. Fandral believed that the future of the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; demanded more expansionism and military planning. His radical beliefs and aggressive demeanor often led him to quarrel openly with the High Priestess, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;."}

Their services are always available to the highest bidder, employing anyone regardless of their affiliation if they can produce results.\nBackground.\nGreat Wars.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the Steamwheedle Cartel managed to drive out the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s from a small port town inhabited by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s which had been overrun. They claimed control of the immediate area and the shores of the cove for their new center for operations in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Booty Bay.\nDuring the war, the goblins witnessed the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival and the conquest of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. With more conflicts on the horizon, they were determined to profit from it. &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Steamwheedle\"&gt;Trade Prince Steamwheedle&lt;/a&gt; allied his cartel with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde and offered aid in form of new technologies, maps, and other useful information to the orcs for the right price. Orgrim treated his new allies as equals and paid them gold from Stormwind's coffers. The Warchief also hired them to oversee the construction of the Horde's fleet. The cartel also sold them the employs of their &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20alchemist\"&gt;alchemists&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"sapper\"&gt;sapper&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s, also providing the watertight pilot-shacks for use on the enslaved &lt;a href=\"Giant%20turtle%23As%20submarines\"&gt;giant sea turtles&lt;/a&gt;. However, following the war, the Steamwheedle Cartel and other goblins realized that it was much better to remain neutral due to thriving trades.\nApproximately four years after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the goblin city of &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; had already been built in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, as it was visited by &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in various points of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;, notably &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, built zeppelin towers. Operating them and their zeppelins are goblins from the Steamwheedle Cartel as evidenced by the presence of &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Bruiser\"&gt;Steamwheedle Bruiser&lt;/a&gt;s. They, along with the staff, are tagged with the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Orgrimmar faction&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cartel tasked &lt;a href=\"Security%20Chief%20Bilgewhizzle%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Security Chief Bilgewhizzle\u200e&lt;/a&gt; with teaching the &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Southsea pirates&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; a lesson.\nThe goblin &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt; was ferrying men and supplies for the Horde on his zeppelin the \"&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Lug\"&gt;Lady Lug&lt;/a&gt;\" but was later captured by the Alliance. The goblin and the vessel were ultimately freed by the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe goblin &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; appeared to originally be part of the Steamwheedle Cartel, as they once helped their friend &lt;a href=\"Gally%20Lumpstain\"&gt;Gally Lumpstain&lt;/a&gt; to join the cartel in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, although they later join the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the cartel expanded itself and established new towns such as &lt;a href=\"Fuselight\"&gt;Fuselight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bogpaddle\"&gt;Bogpaddle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, and an unnamed goblin resort in the &lt;a href=\"Steam%20Pools\"&gt;Steam Pools&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, the Steamwheedle Cartel maintained its neutrality.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, they had a &lt;a href=\"footbomb\"&gt;footbomb&lt;/a&gt; team called the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Sharks\"&gt;Steamwheedle Sharks&lt;/a&gt;, which were later hired by Gallywix to defend and work in the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Lumber%20Yard\"&gt;Bilgewater Lumber Yard&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nEver looking for new ways to make a profit, the Steamwheedle Cartel has traveled back to the alternate thirty-five years in the past. They make their base at the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Trials%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Ring of Trials&lt;/a&gt; and surrounding parts of , with their main problems being the local &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt;.\nA new group within the Cartel known as the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Preservation%20Society\"&gt;Steamwheedle Preservation Society&lt;/a&gt; focuses on &lt;a href=\"archaeology\"&gt;archaeology&lt;/a&gt; and wishes to bring valuable artifacts and antiquities back from Draenor to Azeroth to sell to the highest bidder. One member of the Society, &lt;a href=\"Bing%20Zapcrackle\"&gt;Bing Zapcrackle&lt;/a&gt;, can be found at &lt;a href=\"Warspear\"&gt;Warspear&lt;/a&gt; on the island of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, where he is arguing with members of the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; over the price of artifacts the Horde wishes to purchase.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;, the Steamwheedle goblins have built two towns: &lt;a href=\"Pinchwhistle%20Gearworks\"&gt;Pinchwhistle Gearworks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pinchwhistle%20Point\"&gt;Pinchwhistle Point&lt;/a&gt;. When Pinchwhistle Point is overwhelmed by invading fungus and its citizens zombified by fungal spores, the goblins of Pinchwhistle Gearworks ask for aid from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to save their brethren.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Burning Legion's invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Steamwheedle Cartel's holdings in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt; came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. During the attack on &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; a group of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet%20Bruiser\"&gt;Ratchet Bruiser&lt;/a&gt;'s were controlled by one of the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; until they were rescued, while others united under Gazlowe to defend the town. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt; was defended by &lt;a href=\"Marin%20Noggenfogger\"&gt;Marin Noggenfogger&lt;/a&gt; and its inhabitants. Both towns were ultimately saved by the combined efforts of the Steamwheedle Cartel, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDespite declaring its neutrality, the Steamwheedle Cartel city of &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; secretly funneled supplies to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were beginning to become suspicious about it, but the Horde was determined to keep their operations a secret.\nDuring the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and his crew of &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe%27s%20Greasemonkeys\"&gt;Greasemonkeys&lt;/a&gt; actively take part in Horde's campaign on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt;, and Gazlowe is referred to as a member of the Horde by his rival &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; was still economically competing with the Steamwheedles.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Gazlowe fully threw his support behind the Horde by becoming the new Trade Prince of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, taking over from &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; who had abandoned the Horde. Steamwheedle Cartel's reaction to Gazlowe's defection is unknown and as is how they intend to handle the void of leadership in Ratchet.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; decided to send &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; to look over the Horde holdings within &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; wrote them a letter as a pass for any goblin they might encounter on their journey. In the letter, he indicated that he \"owns\" whoever read it, their Steamwheedle boss, their Bilgewater cronies, and their shoes, and that the duo can therefore go where they want just like him on his property.\nPlaces under their control.\nThey also control &lt;a href=\"Smokywood%20Pastures\"&gt;Smokywood Pastures&lt;/a&gt;.\nArenas.\nThe Steamwheedle Cartel also ran the &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt;s, with most of the &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s having been &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Adamman%20the%20Trader\"&gt;Adamman&lt;/a&gt; was once a famous arena gladiator until the Cartel caught him rigging fights and took away everything from him.\nReputation.\nIn patch 3.1.0, a new &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt; has been added. &lt;a href=\"Insane%20in%20the%20Membrane\"&gt;Insane in the Membrane&lt;/a&gt; which when with the four Steamwheedle Cartel cities, with &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt;, and with &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; will give the player the title \"\"&lt;name&gt; &lt;a href=\"the%20Insane\"&gt;the Insane&lt;/a&gt;\"\".\nGo and kill the Southsea Swashbucklers, Southsea Pirates, and other related mobs in Tanaris around Lost Rigger Cove (the area to the east of the Caverns of Time). Each mob gives 5 rep with Gadgetzan plus 2.5 rep with each of Booty Bay, Everlook, and Ratchet.\nRebuilding lost reputation.\nEach of these quests gives 500 rep with the Steamwheedle Cartel faction listed next to it and 250 rep with the other Steamwheedle Cartel factions. Each turn in also gives -500 to Bloodsail Buccaneers.\nThese quests do not work once .\nIn the RPG.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, a Horde ambassador met with a &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Steamwheedle\"&gt;single trade prince&lt;/a&gt; and convinced him and his subordinates to join the Horde (while the rest of the goblin race stayed neutral). Years later, some Horde members tried to improve relations with the Steamwheedle Cartel. Perhaps with enough persuasion, the goblins could be convinced to rejoin the Horde for the first time since the Second War. This is unlikely to happen, however, as the trade prince realized his mistake and left the Horde, and the goblin race remembers the mistake and remains neutral to this day.\nThe Steamwheedle Cartel runs &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; has also been said to run Ratchet, possibly in error."}

After waiting days for a Horde rescue party, and becoming convinced that it was not arriving, Koak decided to bring the young hatchling to the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt; after seeing two of their riders in the sky. Koak was convinced to stay and train the young cloud serpent, though Koak's own motivation was to train the hatchling in order to prove himself worthy of being &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nSteel was known to create mischief and was known to enjoy Kao's company. Unbeknownst to the serpent, Koak was struggling between using the Order's methods and what he knew second-hand of the Dragonmaw teaching methods which would soon come to a head. With the Horde descending into &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;civil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; Koak tried to force Steel to obey; an action which deeply hurt Steel before it fled from Koak.\nHaving realized Steel would wander back to the spot it had hatched, the orc, feeling immense guilt for his actions, sought out the cloud serpent he had been taking care of for months in order to apologize. Due to pouring out his heart, Steel regained trust in Koak and allowed him to ride it after Koak used a method shown to him by &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Anli\"&gt;Elder Anli&lt;/a&gt;, near the beginning of their stay with the Order. With this act, Koak officially bestowed the name Steel on the serpent and directed him to journey to the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt;, in order to aid &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt; by joining the Darkspear rebellion against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s True Horde and &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;'s Dragonmaw."}

Best known for their deadly &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s, the Burning Blade fought in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually consumed itself in demonic corruption. The proud blademasters later swore to free themselves and their brethren from demonic control and joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the service of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. Another part of the Burning Blade remained loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, transforming into a diverse and powerful demon-worshiping cult under the rule of the sinister &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. In the modern day, some blademasters continue to serve the New Horde, while the Burning Blade cult remains a significant threat to the Horde throughout &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe modern Burning Blade is heavily divided. Some elements are &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Cult\"&gt;worshippers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, others are &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orcs&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and even fewer remain to honor the pact they made to the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;. By the time of the first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth,&lt;/a&gt; only &lt;a href=\"Arnak%20Fireblade\"&gt;Arnak Fireblade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mordak%20Darkfist\"&gt;Mordak Darkfist&lt;/a&gt; came to represent their people; though they were surprised by the unexpected arrival of &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt;. By virtue of being the eldest blademaster alive, Lantresor has assumed leadership of the clan, but is skeptical of it deserving a future.\nHistory.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, at the very start of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;'s tenure as &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, the minor &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; appeared and started a cult called the Burning Blade. Zmodlor's cultists took over the &lt;a href=\"school\"&gt;school&lt;/a&gt;house of the village &lt;a href=\"Jortas\"&gt;Jortas&lt;/a&gt;, planning to sacrifice its children using a sword covered in oil and set alight as a ritual tool. The cultists wanted to cull souls for their master, but Aegwynn appeared just in time to save the children and neutralize Zmodlor, with the event being her first ever demon banishment.\nLater, on the world of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, some of the orcs who migrated out of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; settled in the mountains and plains of the fertile region of &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, among them a clan also called the Burning Blade. This clan's ancestral home was a settlement known as &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Ruins\"&gt;Hallvalor&lt;/a&gt;, located in eastern &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; near the border with Talador. Hallvalor would later become known as the \"Burning Blade Ruins\". Due to the two clans' close friendship, the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong&lt;/a&gt; orcs allowed the Burning Blade to remain in Nagrand while all of the other clans were forced out.\nRise of the Horde.\nThe Burning Blade joined the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; along with most of the other orcish clans. 2 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; was charged with eliminating the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;high arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; and formed a lightly armored but highly mobile invasion force from the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand&lt;/a&gt;, Burning Blade and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; clans. After dozens of orcs were incinerated by the arakkoa's &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;immense cannon&lt;/a&gt;, Kargath convinced the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Outcast arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; to sneak into Skyreach and sabotage the weapon. The Outcasts were successful, but Kargath and his forces then proceeded to slaughter the Outcasts alongside the high arakkoa, throwing some of the latter into &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde assault led to the destruction of high arakkoan civilization and the near-extinction of the Outcasts.\nThe First and Second War.\nThe Burning Blade accompanied the Horde through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt;, some orcs went mad at the sight of the hostile, alien world of Azeroth, and many joined the Burning Blade that day.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Burning Blade were no longer considered a clan so much as an elemental force of nature. Chaotic, leaderless, and unpredictable, they were a nomadic brotherhood of demented orcs whose only objective was to raze and plunder with no regard for their own safety. They were held in check by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, to be unleashed by the clans in times of urgent duress. The Burning Blade held loyalty to no one and would attack any that they perceived as a threat, even their fellow orcs.\nThe Burning Blade participated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Siege of Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; near the end of the war. During the &lt;a href=\"Destruction%20of%20the%20Dark%20Portal\"&gt;final battle at the Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the clan was routed and ultimately destroyed by troops under the command of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third War.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Burning Blade clan had consumed itself in the throes of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic corruption. With their clan scattered and broken, the proud &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s swore a grim oath to free themselves and their brethren from demonic control once and for all. Under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s command, the blademasters once again joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and served as the young &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;'s personal honor guard.\nCycle of Hatred.\nHowever, other remnants of the Burning Blade remained wholly devoted to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, becoming known as the \"Burning Blade cult\". Some time after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the demon &lt;a href=\"Zmodlor\"&gt;Zmodlor&lt;/a&gt; began recruiting both orcs and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s who were prejudiced against one another into a new incarnation of the Burning Blade. The demon promised to help the orcs destroy their human enemies and vice versa, with the ultimate goal of collecting souls during the battles between Theramore and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;; none of his followers were aware that Zmodlor was also recruiting their enemies. The recruits of the cult included &lt;a href=\"Burx\"&gt;Burx&lt;/a&gt;, one of Warchief Thrall's chief warriors; &lt;a href=\"Kristoff%20%28human%29\"&gt;Kristoff&lt;/a&gt;, the Chamberlain of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;; and &lt;a href=\"Margoz%20%28human%29\"&gt;Margoz&lt;/a&gt;, a Theramore fisherman responsible for recruiting new members and sowing distrust in Theramore. However, Zmodlor's plan was ultimately foiled by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, who confronted the demon and several of his worshipers atop &lt;a href=\"Dreadmist%20Peak\"&gt;Dreadmist Peak&lt;/a&gt; and succeeded in banishing him. Thus, the bloodbath between the humans and orcs was avoided. However, Aegwynn doubted that Zmodlor was solely responsible for the Burning Blade's activities, as she believed that a plan of such complexity was far beyond him.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nA few years later, the Burning Blade was one of many cults and organizations serving as an extension of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;'s will, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Wake\"&gt;Argus Wake&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Blade\"&gt;Searing Blade&lt;/a&gt;. The Burning Blade were secretly led by &lt;a href=\"Neeru%20Fireblade\"&gt;Neeru Fireblade&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; who had infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and who believed himself to have the trust of Thrall. Neeru considered the warchief a fool who believed him to be working hard to cleanse the image of warlocks and prove that they were the warchief's servants. However, unbeknownst to Neeru, Thrall was fully aware of the warlock's true loyalties. Officially, Neeru professed to use his powers as a warlock to thwart demons and claimed that his research in the occult was benign, though not everyone was entirely convinced of this.\nNeeru considered the Searing Blade of &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; to be entirely expendable, save for their leaders &lt;a href=\"Bazzalan\"&gt;Bazzalan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jergosh%20the%20Invoker\"&gt;Jergosh&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, he would constantly send Thrall's underlings to battle the Searing Blade in order to give the impression that he was weeding out evil in Orgrimmar, to kill Thrall's faithful, and to test if the Searing Blade were truly worthy of joining him.\nDurotar and the Barrens.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zureetha%20Fargaze\"&gt;Zureetha Fargaze&lt;/a&gt; discovered the presence of a Burning Blade &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Coven\"&gt;coven&lt;/a&gt; in the valley's northern parts, and sent fledgling orc and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Familiar\"&gt;familiars&lt;/a&gt; spilling from the cave's mouth. Through her divinations, Zureetha discovered an item of power known as the &lt;a href=\"%3ABurning%20Blade%20Medallion\"&gt;:Burning Blade Medallion&lt;/a&gt; deep within the coven, and sent adventurers out once more in order to retrieve the object from &lt;a href=\"Yarrog%20Baneshadow\"&gt;Yarrog Baneshadow&lt;/a&gt;. Once this task was complete, Zureetha sent the adventurers onward to report to &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; and inform him that the Burning Blade had reached the Valley of Trials. Gadrin told the heroes that the Blade were not seen in Sen'jin, but that their evil had taken root on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; off the coast. As the news regarding the cult could spell trouble for everyone, Gadrin eventually directed the adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; to report to &lt;a href=\"Orgnil%20Soulscar\"&gt;Orgnil Soulscar&lt;/a&gt;, an orc responsible for policing Durotar from evils such as the Blade.\nThrough his own investigations, Orgnil had discovered a Burning Blade warlock, &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Darkclaw\"&gt;Fizzle Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;, camped with several cultist minions within &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Ridge\"&gt;Thunder Ridge&lt;/a&gt;. Orgnil ordered adventurers to defeat Fizzle and retrieve his dead claw. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Margoz%20%28orc%29\"&gt;Margoz&lt;/a&gt; reported that &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Rock\"&gt;Skull Rock&lt;/a&gt;, a cave just outside Orgrimmar, sheltered a large band of Burning Blade cultists, and Orgnil sent the adventurers to report to him for advice. Margoz ordered the retrieval of several of the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Collar\"&gt;searing collars&lt;/a&gt; worn by the cultists in Skull Rock, but as divining their origin was beyond his skills as a shaman, he told the heroes to bring the objects to Neeru in Orgrimmar. Neeru told the adventurer that the Burning Blade were a cult that rallied around an item of demonic power known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Demon%20Seed\"&gt;the Demon Seed&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Dreadmist%20Peak\"&gt;Dreadmist Peak&lt;/a&gt;, and directed the hero to his assistant &lt;a href=\"Ak%27Zeloth\"&gt;Ak'Zeloth&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the artifact. Ak'Zeloth considered the request to be strange, but complied with it nonetheless. He told the hero to take one of his &lt;a href=\"Flawed%20Power%20Stone\"&gt;power stones&lt;/a&gt; to the altar of fire atop Dreadmist and use it to disrupt the Demon Seed's connection to the Burning Legion. However, when the hero returned, Ak'Zeloth told them that while they had been victorious, the Seed's destruction had sent waves of power through the ether, and that other beings would wonder why their \"toy\" had been broken.\nWhen a hero defeated the Blade cultist &lt;a href=\"Gazz%27uz\"&gt;Gazz'uz&lt;/a&gt; in Skull Rock, they discovered the &lt;a href=\"%3AEye%20of%20Burning%20Shadow\"&gt;:Eye of Burning Shadow&lt;/a&gt; on the orc's body. Words emanated from the eye into the adventurer's mind, ordering Gazz'uz to report and threatening to incur Neeru's wrath. When the eye was brought to Neeru, the warlock stated that while he was known for hunting down the warchief's enemies, it was strange that he was \"singled out\" by the eye, and stranger still that the Burning Blade cultists from whom the eye had been recovered had a name so close to Fireblade's own. Neeru told the adventurer that he would study the eye and its message, and told the hero that they had done their people a \"great service\".\nAt one point, the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; experienced a rash of animal poisonings and requested aid from the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dendrite%20Starblaze\"&gt;Dendrite Starblaze&lt;/a&gt; concluded that Dreadmist Peak was most likely the primary candidate as to the source of the spread of the poison. He suspected that the peak's watery pools, which influenced the local weather patterns, had become tainted by the Burning Blade. Thus, druid &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were sent to sample water from the pools and deliver it to &lt;a href=\"Tonga%20Runetotem\"&gt;Tonga Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; at the Crossroads. After gathering a number of ingredients, the druids were able to cure a number of &lt;a href=\"gazelle\"&gt;gazelle&lt;/a&gt;s that had grown sickly as a result of the pollution. While the polluted waters of Dreadmist were most likely the primary source of the sickness, Tonga suspected that there was something else at work, and &lt;a href=\"Turak%20Runetotem\"&gt;Turak Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; commented that the matter would warrant some further investigation.\nA Horde-affiliated &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Sarilus%20Foulborne\"&gt;Sarilus Foulborne&lt;/a&gt; was found to be corrupting the &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; from the very top of Dreadmist Peak, and so &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Velene%20Starstrike\"&gt;Sentinel Velene Starstrike&lt;/a&gt; asked Alliance adventurers to bring her his head. Sarilus' connection to the Burning Blade and the Shadow Council are unclear.\nHidden enemies.\nWarchief Thrall believed the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; and the Burning Blade to be the greatest threat to the Horde. After adventurers had reported to Orgnil, Thrall asked the hero to retrieve an insignia from the Blade's lieutenants at Skull Rock, saying that the young champion could go places where the warchief's agents could not and find the \"true head of the beast\". Thrall proceeded to send the hero to speak with Neeru to gauge his reaction to a member of the Blade, as his information could prove valuable in infiltrating the Shadow Council. The warlock, fully convinced that the adventurer was indeed one of his lieutenants, revealed the cult's relation to the Shadow Council and the Searing Blade. Upon hearing of this information, Thrall immediately sent the hero to kill the two Searing Blade leaders &lt;a href=\"Bazzalan\"&gt;Bazzalan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jergosh%20the%20Invoker\"&gt;Jergosh&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. This greatly angered Neeru, and Thrall dispatched the adventurer to hopefully obtain more information from him and possibly even gain the warlock's trust. Unaware that the \"lieutenant\" he was speaking to was the very same one who had defeated the Searing Blade's leaders, Neeru confided that he would do what he could to minimize the damage in Ragefire Chasm and instead have his agents in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; begin work on the Shadow Council's newest agenda. When the hero returned to Thrall one last time, the warchief informed them that he would have his spies investigate this Shadow Council presence in Ashenvale, and that he would call upon the hero again soon. However, he never did.\nDesolace.\nThe Burning Blade were deeply entrenched in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 particularly &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Axe%20Fortress\"&gt;Thunder Axe Fortress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowbreak%20Ravine\"&gt;Shadowbreak Ravine&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and ties were made between them and the local &lt;a href=\"Hatefury\"&gt;Hatefury&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; progressed deeper and deeper into &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, concerns were raised within the Horde that incorrect conclusions could be drawn about the Horde making pacts with the Burning Legion. Warchief Thrall, determined to forge peace between the Alliance and Horde, could not let this happen and so assigned &lt;a href=\"Keldran\"&gt;Keldran&lt;/a&gt; to oversee the removal of Legion forces from Desolace. Keldran, in turn, sent Horde adventurers to report to two of his agents at &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Walker%20Post\"&gt;Ghost Walker Post&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Takata%20Steelblade\"&gt;Takata Steelblade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maurin%20Bonesplitter\"&gt;Maurin Bonesplitter&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which was sent due to his knowledge about the Burning Blade and its warlock ways. Maurin tasked adventurers to capture Burning Blade spirits in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Gem\"&gt;special gem&lt;/a&gt;s while Takata asked them to kill Hatefury satyrs on Thrall's behest. Once both of these tasks were done, adventurers returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to report their success to Keldran.\nWhile adventuring through Desolace, adventurers could discover a patch of &lt;a href=\"Flayed%20Demon%20Skin\"&gt;flayed demon skin&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 scrawled with red markings \u2014 on the body of a Blade cultist. Upon examining the skin, Maurin revealed that the markings were from an old language, remotely similar to &lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt; but with drastic differences, and that the skin represented a contract of some kind, with a symbol at the bottom of the parchment being the signature of a demon named &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Azrethoc\"&gt;Lord Azrethoc&lt;/a&gt;. With the help of a scalp from the Hatefury satyrs and an oracle crystal from the &lt;a href=\"Slitherblade\"&gt;Slitherblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, Maurin cast a spell which conjured images of Azrethoc and his orc servant, &lt;a href=\"Jugkar%20Grim%27rod\"&gt;Jugkar Grim'rod&lt;/a&gt;, who taunted Maurin and invited him to seek them out. Takata Steelblade witnessed the exchange and agreed that the demon lord had to be stopped, especially if he was attempting to gain influence over the Burning Blade. As Takata's duties at Ghost Walker Post kept him from going after the demon himself, the adventurer traveled to &lt;a href=\"Mannoroc%20Coven\"&gt;Mannoroc Coven&lt;/a&gt; themselves to slay Azrethoc and Jugkar.\n&lt;a href=\"Taiga%20Wisemane\"&gt;Taiga Wisemane&lt;/a&gt; asked Horde adventurers to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"%3AHand%20of%20Iruxos\"&gt;:Hand of Iruxos&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact used by the Burning Blade to open demonic portals at Mannoroc Coven. To retrieve the hand, the heroes had to use a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Pick\"&gt;special pick&lt;/a&gt; to chip away at a crystal in Thunder Axe Fortress until a &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Spirit\"&gt;demonic spirit&lt;/a&gt; appeared. After defeating the spirit, the heroes obtained the so-called \"&lt;a href=\"Demon%20Box\"&gt;demon box&lt;/a&gt;\" and brought it to Taiga, who produced the Hand of Iruxos from within the box. Next, Taiga tasked the hero with using the hand to banish the demonic portals at Mannoroc and stem the tide of demons into the world.\nThe Blade forces at Thunder Axe Fortress were rumored to have acquired the &lt;a href=\"Sceptre%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sceptre of Light&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 an object said to be able to sink entire cities under the sea \u2014 from the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Azore%20Aldamort\"&gt;Azore Aldamort&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to retrieve the scepter from a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt; in one of the the fortress's &lt;a href=\"watch%20tower\"&gt;watch tower&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Vahlarriel%20Demonslayer\"&gt;Vahlarriel Demonslayer&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Desolace to discover the whereabouts of &lt;a href=\"Tyranis%20Malem\"&gt;Tyranis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dalinda%20Malem\"&gt;Dalinda Malem&lt;/a&gt;, the missing children of a &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20Malem\"&gt;noble family&lt;/a&gt;, and asked Alliance adventurers for help in finding them. The adventurer eventually discovered Dalinda as a captive of the Burning Blade at Thunder Axe Fortress. She told the hero that she and her brother had been brought to the fortress after the orcs killed their guards and servants, and that she suspected the Burning Blade meant to sacrifice her to their demon masters. However, she also revealed that Tyranis had recently begun craving &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; knowledge and had decided to make the trek to Desolace despite its demon infestation. He had attempted to speak to his captors and apparently attempted to impress them with his arcane knowledge, and Dalinda feared that he would try to learn the Blade's secrets and join their ranks if they allowed it. The adventurer managed to retrieve Tyranis' pendant and escort Dalinda to &lt;a href=\"Nijel%27s%20Point\"&gt;Nijel's Point&lt;/a&gt;, allowing her to return to Darnassus.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nWhen Alliance and Horde forces &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;ventured&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the shattered remnants of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; discovered that the &lt;a href=\"Boulderfist\"&gt;Boulderfist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt; clan had taken up residence in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Ruins\"&gt;ruins&lt;/a&gt; of Hallvalor, the ancestral home of the Burning Blade. Furthermore, they discovered that the Boulderfist were now led by &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt;: a veteran &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt; formerly of the Burning Blade who had ventured through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; years before and served under two &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;s before returning to his homeland.\nCataclysm.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, at least some blademasters remained loyal to the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Ronakada\"&gt;Blademaster Ronakada&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; informs adventurers who approach him that while the blademasters' oath of freeing their people from demonic control has been fulfilled, his own honor remains unsatisfied. Thus, he will continue to fight for the Horde and &lt;a href=\"warrior%20trainers\"&gt;train other warriors to do so&lt;/a&gt; until his death.\nDurotar.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Trials\"&gt;Valley of Trials&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zureetha%20Fargaze\"&gt;Zureetha Fargaze&lt;/a&gt; once more sent Horde adventurers to cleanse the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Coven\"&gt;Burning Blade Coven&lt;/a&gt; of its demonic taint by killing the &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Familiar\"&gt;familiars&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Felstalker%20%28mob%29\"&gt;beasts&lt;/a&gt; prowling the cave and its surroundings and retrieving the &lt;a href=\"%3ABurning%20Blade%20Medallion\"&gt;:Burning Blade Medallion&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Yarrog%20Baneshadow\"&gt;Yarrog Baneshadow&lt;/a&gt;. Fearing that the evil found in the coven was merely the herald of a larger threat, Zureetha once again sent adventurers to report their findings to &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin%20Village\"&gt;Sen'jin Village&lt;/a&gt; and see if the Cult had yet reached the home of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;. This time, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; told the heroes that the Blade was no longer seen in Sen'jin, but that the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; would be vigilant in their efforts to prevent the cultists' return to the area.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgnil%20Soulscar\"&gt;Orgnil Soulscar&lt;/a&gt; informed adventurers that he had been sent to investigate the presence of more Burning Blade agents in Durotar. Interested in what the cult was teaching its neophytes, Orgnil hired heroes to sack the &lt;a href=\"Dustwind%20Cave\"&gt;Dustwind Cave&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 where the Blade trained its new recruits \u2014 and retrieve several &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Spellscroll\"&gt;spellscrolls&lt;/a&gt;. Remarking that the scrolls were not all that different from the spells taught to Horde warlocks, Orgnil stated that the subject merited further investigation and sent the heroes on to &lt;a href=\"Gor%20the%20Enforcer\"&gt;Gor the Enforcer&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, since the Burning Blade stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Rock\"&gt;Skull Rock&lt;/a&gt; sat right next to the &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;docks&lt;/a&gt; Gor had been placed in charge of.\nGor informed the heroes that the flood which occurred during the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; had wiped out one of the few Burning Blade camps that still pockmarked Durotar, as well as drowning the camp's leader, &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%20Darkclaw\"&gt;Fizzle Darkclaw&lt;/a&gt;. Fizzle did, however, possess a &lt;a href=\"Fizzle%27s%20Orb\"&gt;magical orb&lt;/a&gt; the Horde was interested in procuring (though Gor himself did not care to find out why). After retrieving the orb by cutting off Fizzle's hand, the adventurer was sent on to the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Margoz%20%28orc%29\"&gt;Margoz&lt;/a&gt;, who knew more of the Burning Blade's corruption as well as Skull Rock, which sheltered a large band of cultists. Just as he had done before, Margoz ordered the retrieval of several of the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Collar\"&gt;searing collars&lt;/a&gt; worn by the cultists in Skull Rock, but as divining their origin was beyond his skills as a shaman, he told the heroes to bring the objects to &lt;a href=\"Neeru%20Fireblade\"&gt;Neeru Fireblade&lt;/a&gt; in Orgrimmar. Neeru, in turn, told the adventurers that their role in the tale was nearly complete and directed them to his assistant &lt;a href=\"Ak%27Zeloth\"&gt;Ak'Zeloth&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Far%20Watch%20Post\"&gt;Far Watch Post&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Ak'Zeloth told the heroes that the matter was not news to him, and that while he appreciated their efforts, there were more pressing matters to attend than the Burning Blade.\nThe Northern Barrens.\nSome time later, a force of Burning Blade &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;wolfriders&lt;/a&gt; unexpectedly attacked a &lt;a href=\"Whipshank\"&gt;Whipshank&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kodo\"&gt;kodo&lt;/a&gt; caravan moving between &lt;a href=\"Grol%27dom%20Farm\"&gt;Grol'dom Farm&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, but they were fended off by an adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Halga%20Bloodeye\"&gt;Halga Bloodeye&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Halga%27s%20%22Street%20Sweeper%22\"&gt;\"street sweeper\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nElsewhere in the Barrens, the Burning Blade gathered recruits and supplies at a small farm at Dreadmist Peak's northern foot. &lt;a href=\"Brogor\"&gt;Brogor&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to help him keep the vigil against the cult by slaughtering the farm's ranks, while &lt;a href=\"Wenikee%20Boltbucket\"&gt;Wenikee Boltbucket&lt;/a&gt; requested the gathering of &lt;a href=\"Nugget%20Slug\"&gt;nugget slugs&lt;/a&gt; from the farm in order to repair a broken &lt;a href=\"%3ASamophlange\"&gt;:Samophlange&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater still, adventurers returned to the Crossroads and accompanied another kodo caravan, this time to reinforce the &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Ramparts\"&gt;Mor'shan Ramparts&lt;/a&gt; to north. Just as the caravan stopped at &lt;a href=\"Dreadmist%20Camp\"&gt;Dreadmist Camp&lt;/a&gt; to pick up fresh supplies and mounts, however, Burning Blade ambushers appeared and incapacitated the adventurer and the caravan driver, &lt;a href=\"Balgor%20Whipshank\"&gt;Balgor Whipshank&lt;/a&gt;, with nets. Stating that the \"fat\" Balgor would make for a nice sacrifice, the cultists seized both him and the caravan cart before hurrying up the slopes to the top of Dreadmist. Unwilling to forgo the vital military supplies nor allow any harm to come to her little brother, Balgor's sister &lt;a href=\"Nagala%20Whipshank\"&gt;Nagala&lt;/a&gt; immediately told adventurers to rescue Balgor and the captured caravan. At the top of the mountain, the heroes found Balgor unharmed, but the orc told them that he had managed to overhear some of the cultists' plans while they were preparing to ritualistically sacrifice him. According to Balgor, the Blade were planning to use the powerful artifact known as &lt;a href=\"the%20Demon%20Seed\"&gt;the Demon Seed&lt;/a&gt; to launch a full-scale attack on the Horde. While the adventurers obtained the Seed, Balgor managed to make it back down to Dreadmist Camp. When heroes returned to the foot of the mountain and handed the Demon Seed to Nagala, she told them that she would make sure that the artifact was \"taken care of\". Scouts soon reported that the Blade was preparing for another attack. Soon after setting out on the final leg of the journey to Mor'shan, Balgor and the hero were beset by Burning Blade forces mounted on &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt;s alike, but the adventurer once again managed to narrowly fend them off with the \"street sweeper\", ensuring that the caravan reached the ramparts safely.\nOperations in Desolace.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, the two forward posts of &lt;a href=\"Nijel%27s%20Point\"&gt;Nijel's Point&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Furien%27s%20Post\"&gt;Furien's Post&lt;/a&gt; were charged with monitoring any potential threats in the region, to ensure that there were no surprises when the Alliance and Horde launched their Desolace campaigns. However, at one point one of the &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s from the forward posts was caught and sacrificed by the Burning Blade at &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Axe%20Fortress\"&gt;Thunder Axe Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. Shortly afterward, a \"Burning Blade wretch\" by the name of &lt;a href=\"Kohor\"&gt;Kohor&lt;/a&gt; began assaulting the two posts with constant threats and taunts. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Pentigast\"&gt;Captain Pentigast&lt;/a&gt; at Nijel's Point and &lt;a href=\"Sorrem\"&gt;Sorrem&lt;/a&gt; at Furien's Post both ordered Kohor's death, saying that although the cult's days in Desolace were numbered, they would pay handsomely for Kohor to be silenced immediately. Adventurers complied, but upon killing Kohor, the orc yelled that the Burning Blade were nearing completion on summoning a demon that could threaten the entire region. Determining that this matter could not wait for the Alliance and Horde invasion of Desolace, the adventurers scoured Thunder Axe Fortress and discovered a parchment detailing an ancient and powerful summoning ritual. As the ritual was more powerful than any the Blade had previously been known to possess, the adventurers resolved to call forth the demon prematurely in the hopes of averting the crisis. After gathering 100 skulls from around the fortress, the heroes summoned and defeated the weakened &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nazargen\"&gt;Nazargen&lt;/a&gt;, thus diverting what would have been a serious crisis; had the summoning rite been delayed only a little longer, Nazargen would have become far too powerful for the small forces at Nijel's Point and Furien's Post to contend with. Along the way, the adventurers also gathered a number of severed ears from the Burning Blade members at the fortress in order to satisfy Pentigast and Sorrem's disdain for the cult. Upon receiving the ears, Pentigast and Sorrem commented that it was only a shadow of what would soon become of the \"vile cult\".\nDespite earlier attempts to pit the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; tribes of Desolace against one another, efforts by the Alliance and Horde to unite the centaur in order to deal with the threat posed by the Burning Blade clan have met with some success. In southern Desolace, the Burning Blade and their demon masters pushed the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt; centaur out of their &lt;a href=\"Magram%20Village\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt;, renaming it &lt;a href=\"Shok%27Thokar\"&gt;Shok'Thokar&lt;/a&gt;. The Magram, in turn, overran the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20Village\"&gt;home village&lt;/a&gt; of the rivaling &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20clan\"&gt;Kolkar clan&lt;/a&gt;, killing most of the Kolkar and imprisoning the rest. &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Leh%27Prah\"&gt;Khan Leh'Prah&lt;/a&gt;, who had foreseen the demonic attack in his dreams, escaped to &lt;a href=\"Karnum%27s%20Glade\"&gt;Karnum's Glade&lt;/a&gt; to request aid from adventurers and the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;. Through a series of efforts, adventurers were able to convince the &lt;a href=\"khan\"&gt;khan&lt;/a&gt;s of the Magram and &lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20clan\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt; clans to join forces with the Kolkar against their common foe. Ultimately, the three clans met together at Shok'Thokar, fighting side by side to reclaim their ancestral lands from the Burning Blade and their demon masters. The adventurer was charged with leading a small group of centaur forces into battle, riding on the back of a centaur commander. After slaying numerous demons and cultists, the adventurer and the three khans met in &lt;a href=\"Shadowbreak%20Ravine\"&gt;Shadowbreak Ravine&lt;/a&gt; and brought an end to the demons' commander, the &lt;a href=\"annihilan\"&gt;pit lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Agogridon\"&gt;Agogridon&lt;/a&gt;, thus reclaiming Shok'Thokar for the centaur.\nMists of Pandaria.\nWarchief &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; had several blademasters in his service during the &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; campaign, including &lt;a href=\"Ishi\"&gt;Ishi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mazuru\"&gt;Mazuru&lt;/a&gt;, and later the &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Blademaster\"&gt;Blind Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s, though it's unclear whether or not any of these were members of the Burning Blade clan.\nWhen adventurers of the Alliance and New Horde &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;assaulted Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, they found that Garrosh's '&lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;' had executed the warlock trainers in the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, including Neeru Fireblade. After the siege, new warlocks replaced the ones that had been killed, with Neeru being replaced by &lt;a href=\"Arnak%20Fireblade\"&gt;Arnak Fireblade&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the cult appears to be wiped out, the only members left of the Burning Blade are the members in the ranks of the Horde.\nDragonflight.\nDuring the first Azerothian &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, the Burning Blade joined the festivities. They are led by &lt;a href=\"Arnak%20Fireblade\"&gt;Arnak Fireblade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mordak%20Darkfist\"&gt;Mordak Darkfist&lt;/a&gt;, who noted that there were few of their clan that remain loyal to the Horde. They expressed disbelief that the legendary blademaster, &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt;, had arrived at the festival, and wanted the orcish champion to introduce them.\nBy the time of the festival, Lantresor has assumed leadership of the clan by virtue of being the eldest surviving blademaster. Orcish recruits can approach Lantresor and request to join the Burning Blade, only to be rejected as the blademaster was of the opinion that all but a few dishonorable Burning Blade are dead, fel-corrupted, or traitors, both on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. He expressed that the Burning Blade didn't deserve their loyalty and that the clan was accursed and should wither and die.\nBy the end of the festival, Arnak and Mordak were joined by Lantresor at their clan table. For his part, Lantresor has changed his tune slightly. He made note that the two are not blademasters, but warlocks, but did not express any hostility towards them; instead taking note that they may very well be the last kin he has left.\nCulture.\nThe Burning Blade clan valued honor above all else and they were known for their honor in battle.\nThe clan was primarily known for their deadly &lt;a href=\"blademaster\"&gt;blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s. These skilled swordsmen could focus their warrior energies to become living cyclones of rage, spinning their blades faster than the naked eye could see, or channel their potent powers in one focused strike to cause even greater damage. One of the blademasters' more mystical abilities was to create duplicate phantom images of themselves to confuse their enemies, and they were so adept and agile that they could move so quickly they appeared to be invisible to the naked eye. Though they were masters of stealth and guile, the blademasters valued personal honor above all else. Once they had passed their final tests in the &lt;a href=\"Masters%27%20Cavern\"&gt;Masters' Cavern&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Ruins\"&gt;Hallvalor&lt;/a&gt;, blademasters were given the honor of wearing the Burning Blade's banner.\nThe clan was also known for its &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, who primarily focused on &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; fire magic. These \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Flameseer\"&gt;flameseers&lt;/a&gt;\" were known to use summoning components consisting of a powdery material mixed with something that sparkled. The Burning Blade forged a unique relationship with Draenor's ancient elementals and were able to work with iron and flame in ways poorly understood by outsiders. Many legendary Burning Blade weapons owed their existence to a &lt;a href=\"%3AFlamebender%27s%20Tome\"&gt;:Flamebender's Tome&lt;/a&gt;, an iron-bound sheaf of writing apparently passed down through generations. The writing in the tome consisted of both &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; and a runic language seemingly similar to the &lt;a href=\"Ignan\"&gt;Ignan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kalimag\"&gt;Kalimag&lt;/a&gt; dialect spoken by &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA sticky, smelly, and highly flammable substance known as &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Blazegrease\"&gt;blazegrease&lt;/a&gt; was liberally applied to the swords and axes of the Burning Blade clan before battle. Though some warriors chose to ignite their weapons before battle, most let the inevitable contact of blades and armor spark the blazegrease for unpredictable intimidation.\nThe Burning Blade cult, on the other hand, is a foul, demon-worshipping cult that has dedicated itself to demon causes. Though they may not represent the majority of the Horde's beliefs, they are evil to the core, their spirits corrupted, and destruction is the only way to thwart their objectives. &lt;a href=\"Maurin%20Bonesplitter\"&gt;Maurin Bonesplitter&lt;/a&gt; considers the Blade to be weak, their magics pathetic, and their strength feeble, with their only power deriving from those they serve rather than any true understanding of power and knowledge.\nBurning Blade warlocks use high quality &lt;a href=\"Infernal%20Orb\"&gt;infernal orbs&lt;/a&gt;, which they bind &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s into. The cultists in &lt;a href=\"Skull%20Rock\"&gt;Skull Rock&lt;/a&gt; performed vile rituals and burned their own flesh with &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Collar\"&gt;Searing Collar&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Margoz%20%28orc%29\"&gt;Margoz&lt;/a&gt; has theorized that the cultists attuned themselves to demonic power by wearing the collars, but some cultists also covered themselves in &lt;a href=\"felblood\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt; and heard the whispers of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The cultists at &lt;a href=\"Dustwind%20Cave\"&gt;Dustwind Cave&lt;/a&gt; were known to use &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Spellscroll\"&gt;spellscrolls&lt;/a&gt;, consisting of lists of demonic rites written in a deep, red ink. &lt;a href=\"Orgnil%20Soulscar\"&gt;Orgnil Soulscar&lt;/a&gt; noted that the scrolls were not all that different from the spells taught to Horde warlocks. Lieutenants of the cult wore special insignias in the form of small runes.\nThe phrase \"Galtak Ered'nash\" (&lt;a href=\"Eredun\"&gt;Eredun&lt;/a&gt; for \"All hail the Burning Blade\") is used as a greeting among the members of the cult.\nIn Warcraft II.\nChieftain: \"None\"\nClan Colors: \"Orange\"\nBackground: \"The Burning Blade is not a clan as much as it is an elemental force of nature. Chaotic and unpredictable, the Burning Blade is a brotherhood of demented &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s whose only objective is to raze and plunder with no regard for their own safety. This leaderless swarm is held in check by the &lt;a href=\"Ogre\"&gt;Ogre&lt;/a&gt;s - to be unleashed by the clans in times of urgent duress. The Burning Blade holds loyalty to no one and will attack any that they perceive to be a threat - even their fellow Orcs.\"\nDomain: Nomadic\nIn the TCG.\n&lt;a href=\"Jonas%20the%20Red\"&gt;Jonas the Red&lt;/a&gt;, the \"traitor\" version of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jonas%20White\"&gt;Jonas White&lt;/a&gt;, is a member of the Burning Blade. His flavor text is \"This is how the Burning Blade operates.\"\nIn the RPG.\nFirst War.\nAccording some RPG books, the Burning Blade clan fought in the First War.\nIntroduction.\nIn the First and Second Wars, the Burning Blade was less a clan and more a group of (somewhat) organized orcs who had no banner of their own. They were something of a force of nature; these orcs were some of the first to drink the blood of demons, and simply wished to kill everything in sight with no regard for their own lives. The other clans used the ogres to keep the Burning Blade in check, lest this clan turn on the rest of the Horde in their permanent state of aggression. In more recent times, the Burning Blade has grown more organized, and they are definitively anti-Horde. The Burning Blade harbors many of those whom Thrall exiled or otherwise refused to incorporate in his new society, such as warlocks and the worst of murderers. The clan has a leader now; many whisper that he is none other than Neeru Fireblade, a warlock residing within the very halls of Orgrimmar. It is unknown if Thrall is aware of his existence, or if he intentionally keeps the Burning Blade's leader close to watch his actions. The Burning Blade Clan's color is orange.\nOrganization.\nThe Burning Blade is a tightly run organization, with a fear of spies coloring their strict hierarchy. Leaders, one to every pocket of foul sorcerers, call themselves the First, likely harkening back to the First War when they pushed the Horde to demon-tainted victory over the Alliance. The Firsts have direct contact with the demons still on Kalimdor and work to summon more of their infernal allies from the Twisting Nether. They also send out inferiors, to serve as spies among the Horde. Since some goblins have joined the Burning Blade's ranks, it is likely there are spies among the Alliance as well. Their inferiors are split into three other groups, called the Second, the Third, and Nothing. This refers to the Second War, which ended in defeat, and the Third War, in which the Horde did what the Burning Blade considers unthinkable \u2014 joined with the Alliance to defeat the demons. Nothing refers to the current state of truce with the Alliance, defeated demons, and a splintered Burning Blade.\nThe Seconds report directly to the Firsts and know most of the secrets of the cult. Many powerful warlocks hold this rank, likely hoping their mentors kick it one day so that they can take the reins. The Thirds comprise most of the Burning Blade, ambitious and foul orcs who want power and will do anything to get it. Nothings are the initiates, sent on mundane tasks such as hunting, cleaning, cooking, and even serving as bait to snare those who trespass on the Burning Blade's territory.\nTheir stronghold lies in the Thunder Axe Fortress of Desolace, but their foul taint reaches as far as the heights of the mountains of the Barrens and even under Thrall's feet in Orgrimmar. The Burning Blade makes its beds wherever one can find demons. Their main area of influence is the Thunder Axe Fortress in Desolace, and it pulses with arcane energy. Others can be found an area in the hills of Desolace where they attempt to summon more demons. They also show up at the Dreadmist Peak in the Barrens, Skull Rock and Thunder Ridge in Durotar (a location where goblins serve the Burning Blade), and there is even a Burning Blade movement in Orgrimmar itself, in Ragefire Chasm, the cave complex underneath Thrall's city.\nMembership.\nThere are many &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s who are not happy with the current &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The current state of the Horde is a tenuous peace with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and most orcs prefer a life of blood and thunder. However, many of these orcs attack Alliance caravans and travelers without ever leaving the Horde. The orcs who serve the Burning Blade feel that the divine magic &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; encourages is weak, and they long for the rush of demonic power. The Burning Blade is comprised of orcs, mostly &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, who crave more and more power. The organization is aware of its tenuous existence, with both the Alliance troops from Theramore and their former brethren after them, and so they are watchful of Horde spies. \nThe first couple of tests in order to become members of the Burning Blade are mostly arcane spellcasting and pledging oneself to the Burning Legion. The next test involves the drinking of foul demon blood. The final test is the cold-blooded murder of one of the initiates' own people. These initiations take place at the top of &lt;a href=\"Dreadmist%20Peak\"&gt;Dreadmist Peak&lt;/a&gt;. After passing the final test, they travel to &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; for further training. Those that pass the test of consuming demonic blood are told some of the Burning Blade's plans. The Burning Blade is planning on summoning more demons to bolster an army. They have footholds in Desolace. \nThe leaders are all orcs from the old wars, those who actually remember the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and their old homeland. These are orcs who have lived a very long time; the magic sustained them but ravaged their bodies in the process. They are twisted to the core, they are; ancient and evil. They harbor a deep hatred for the Alliance, the Horde and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The leaders do know, however, that they are not immortal, and that the weakened forces of the demons make them vulnerable. They are carefully grooming younger warlocks to take their positions; the initiations that entailed are unknown."}

Though originally believed that the race depicted may be &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, subsequent pictures of Blizzard's mural artwork appear to depict &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;Eredar&lt;/a&gt;. This is a strange revelation, as the Eredar are known to be the most powerful demons in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. We can only speculate on why they would therefore join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; - if indeed they are Eredar Warlocks. There is far too little lore on the Eredar at any rate, and we may yet be surprised. \nA possible explanation for the Eredar could simply be mutual interest. One knows that Kil'Jaeden wants Illidan dead, as do the Night Elves. Since the goal, as of now, for the burning crusade is to defeat Illidan, one can speculate that the Eredar and the Alliance have just teamed up as a means of defeating Illidan.\nAnother popular theory is that the Eredar aren't actually true Eredar. The theory states that the &lt;a href=\"Wisp\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;s who destroyed &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; were affected a great deal by the destruction of the demon lord and the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, enough so that the immense magical energies released resurrected and transformed them into the image of Archimonde. If this is true, it would mean that the Wisps April Fools joke, while still a joke, was actually a hint towards the new race. This is supported by how the Eredar's eye glow like a Night Elf's, as the Wisps are the ghosts of Night Elves.\nOf course, a clear explanation would be that the Draenei in the expansion will look fairly different than the Draenei we have come to know and love. This can be seen in the picture of the Broken One breed of Draenei, who like these screen shots, has tentacles down from his cheeks. The new alliance race would not be the \"Broken Ones\", as the bestiary is for NPC types only, however that does not exclude it from being a separate yet similar-looking race of Draenei. This is analogous to how the Forest Trolls are in the bestiary, yet the Jungle Trolls are a playable race, as they are different yet closely related races.\nIts said that the reason that Blizzard waited so long was to fully update the art, and this theory fits with that explanation as the new art is vastly different from the old art. The new blood elves appear different from the old blood elves, however the changes are not as revolutionary.\nThe Burning Legion is just an alliance of evil, however, so it is also possible that these Eredar want to stop their corrupted brethren and their Burning Crusade, since they are a race just as any other.\nAccording to NY times it turns out that Draenei are a subspecies of Eredar.\nOfficial Blizzard Response.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx%3FFN%3Dwow-general%26amp%3BT%3D8148485%26amp%3BP%3D1\"&gt;Drysc says&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx%3Ffn%3Dwow-general%26amp%3Bt%3D8149506%26amp%3Bp%3D1%26amp%3Btmp%3D1%23post8149506\"&gt;Drysc says&lt;/a&gt;: \n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraftexp1/news.html%3Fsid%3D6146909\"&gt;Tigole Says&lt;/a&gt;: (Jeff Kaplan)\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.aspx%3Ffn%3Dwow-general%26amp%3Bt%3D6437554%26amp%3Bp%3D1%26amp%3Btmp%3D1%23post6437554\"&gt;Eyonix says&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//news.thottbot.com/index.php%3Fsearch%3Dtenfold\"&gt;Caydiem&lt;/a&gt;:\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//news.thottbot.com/index.php%3Fsearch%3DKool-Aid%2520man\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt;: \nNotes on Races.\nThe table below represents the best efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Wowpedia\"&gt;Wowpedia&lt;/a&gt; community to list reasons why a race may or may not be the new &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; Alliance race, but also includes reasons why they may be in a future expansion.

Please notice, that this will be in constantly editing.\nSpecial thanks to and \nRules.\nQ: \"Question\"\nPlease post your questions beneath this horizontal line\nBurning Crusade Q&amp;A.\nQ: Are the answers below based on the Burning Crusade Closed Beta?\nQ: Is it possible to see the new spells and talents yet?\nQ: Will the price on Flying Mounts be high?\nCHANGE: The Flying mount comes in 2 variants, an Epic and Normal. The epic mount costs (with training) around 5000g, the normal mount is around 2-400g.\nQ: Will the price on Epic Flying Mounts be high, then?\nQ: Are all the new zones accessible (as of a particular date)? If not, any idea when they will be?\nQ: I've seen a lot of screenshots of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and heard about the portals linking it to every capital city back in the world of Azeroth. Are the portals in Shattrath some sort of spell, or actual physical portals?\nQ: There is a LOT of open space - literally! - in Outland; has anyone tested what will happen if, for some reason, you somehow ride off the edge of the cliffs, dismount from your flying mount in midair over the void, etc.?\nQ: I've heard Kazzak is being relocated from the Tainted Scar to the Throne of Kil'jaeden (in Hellfire Peninsula). Is he being re-designed to be geared towards a level 70 raid (in terms of challenge and loot)? Is the Throne of Kil'jaeden reachable without a flying mount? And what, if anything, can be found in the Tainted Scar now that Kazzak has left?\nQ: On the subject of Kazzak, how will the Benediction/Anathema quest work since he is being moved to Outland?\nQ: When is the release date?\nQ: Does Blizzard plan on releasing a trial/demo?\nQ: Will there be a new opening cinematic for the burning crusade?\nQ: For those who don't get the expansion, what will happen when they try and walk into the ghostlands or other azeroth based zone introduced in the expansion?\nQ: Will the Dark Portal be open on 1/16/07 or is there some world event that needs to take place first?\nQ: I don't have an &lt;a href=\"account\"&gt;account&lt;/a&gt; in WoW, but I want to play it now, if I copy the WoW from a friend and i buy the WoW BC, will it come with an account? or I have to buy an account for 40$ more?\nQ: What is the maximum limit of skill in professions? 400? Does this go for weapon/defense skills as well?\nQ: Will it be possible to level to 70 immediately following the release (January 16th), even if you do not have the Expansion? Or will the cap be locked at 60 for those with World of Warcraft Classic?\nQ: I've heard that gold won't be worth as much in the Expansion as it is in the current game; is this true? And if so, what will be used as currency?\nQ: Will there be a 1 month free subscription bundled with Burning Crusade retail, just like the originl WOW retail?\nQ: Is there any new honor gear (armor/weapons)? If so, is it possible to save up honor before the expansion comes out and spend it after release on the new stuff? If not, what is honor used for?\nQ: Have there been any invisible walls ou have tun into, blocking entrance into someplaces?\nQ: What happens if you jump off the edge as a ghost/wisp/whatever? I know that in Azeroth/Kalimdor you fall until you get to a pool of water, or below one that is, then you can swim up or swim to an ocean and die there. But since there is no water in every direction... I don't know what will happen.\nQ: Is there any Height limit to how high ou can go on a flying mount?\nQ: In PVP, will the People who own BC have an advantage (ie Skills, Talents and Level) to people who only own WoW Classic or will Blizzard balance it somehow?\nQ: What new battlegrounds are there in the Outland? Will level 68-69 druids be able to use their flight form in the 60-69 bracket in the battlegrounds? (Oh please say yes.) --[Edit] I found my own answer here &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Eye of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; :(\nQ: Will the level 60 raids in existence e.g. Blackwing Lair, Naxxramas, Ahn'Qiraj etc. be given a Heroic difficulty level, so that level 70's who never were 60's or weren't for very long, or people just wanting to do it again, can? I mean it makes sense, easy level 70 content.\nQ: Are there \"Black War\" versions of the new racial mounts available for purchase from the PvP vendors?\nQ: Question When I started paying for two accounts for my daughter and I, I had to go buy a second copy of WoW. Am I going to have to buy 2 copies of Burning Crusades also?\nQ: Will there be anything keeping you from going below the little rock chunks, on top of ones that have nothing on em, on top of the Dark portal, and flying eternally into a direction, until you AFK out?"}

As new bosses get added in content &lt;a href=\"patch\"&gt;patch&lt;/a&gt;es they will be added to this page. These bosses are considered &lt;a href=\"raid%20boss\"&gt;raid boss&lt;/a&gt;es since it takes more than a party of 5 players to down them.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;.\nKarazhan used to be the home of the last &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. After his death the tower was abandoned for a long time. Recently however, the tower came back to life as the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was no doubt attracted by the arcane powers that never left the tower...\n&lt;a href=\"Attumen%20the%20Huntsman\"&gt;Attumen the Huntsman&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttumen is the first boss of Karazhan and seen by many as merely a gear-check. At the beginning you fight only his trusted steed, Midnight, but soon enough Attumen will come to its aid to vanquish the fools who dared to attack the steed of the Huntsman...\n&lt;a href=\"Midnight\"&gt;Midnight&lt;/a&gt;.\nMidnight is Attumen's dreadsteed. In the first part of the encounter you fight against him until his owner comes in his aid. Attumen and Midnight are optional bosses in Karazhan.\n&lt;a href=\"Moroes\"&gt;Moroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring his life, Moroes was &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s personal house servant. He always wore blinds over his eyes to keep the visions away that haunted Medivh's cursed tower. He was killed by his master during the last stages of the latter's madness, only to be resurrected recently by &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;'s new master to host a dinnerparty that seems to last forever...\n&lt;a href=\"Maiden%20of%20Virtue\"&gt;Maiden of Virtue&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Maiden of Virtue is a large &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;-like construct that presumably watches over the purity of the tower. She does not tolerate profane and impure thoughts or actions. Ironically she is positioned at the end of a corridor filled with ladies of the night...\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Curator\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Curator is a large &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Guardian\"&gt;Arcane Guardian&lt;/a&gt; that watches over and protects the Menagerie of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;. Since the Menagerie is for guests of the tower only, you and your party are most unwelcome...\n&lt;a href=\"Terestian%20Illhoof\"&gt;Terestian Illhoof&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Satyr\"&gt;Satyr&lt;/a&gt; demon who has taking his residence in the Master's library. There he and his pet &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s are busy in casting a dark and mysterious ritual...\n&lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Aran\"&gt;Shade of Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn life, &lt;a href=\"Nielas%20Aran\"&gt;Nielas Aran&lt;/a&gt; was the &lt;a href=\"Court%20Conjurer\"&gt;Court Conjurer&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, advisor to the throne, Acolyte of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Order of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, and father of the sorcerer &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. On the eve of Medivh's &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Age of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, Medivh awoke to fevered dreams, and sought his father. Upon merely touching the boy, a backlash of energies poured from the child, putting Medivh into a deep coma and killing Nielas...\nCurrently Nielas' spirit is trapped in the library of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; in the form of the Shade of Aran. How he became trapped here is currently unknown...\n&lt;a href=\"Netherspite\"&gt;Netherspite&lt;/a&gt;.\nA powerful &lt;a href=\"Nether%20dragon\"&gt;Nether Dragon&lt;/a&gt; who roams the upper levels of &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;...\n&lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezaar\"&gt;Prince Malchezaar&lt;/a&gt;.\nLittle is known about Prince Malchezaar except that he is a &lt;a href=\"Man%27ari%20Eredar\"&gt;Man'ari Eredar&lt;/a&gt;, and is possibly a sub-commander of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. His current function is Ruler of Karazhan and thus fulfill whatever demonic plans the Burning Legion has for the tower...\n&lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt;.\nNightbane is a summonable boss in Karazhan. He is a skeletal dragon, transformed from &lt;a href=\"Arcanagos\"&gt;Arcanagos&lt;/a&gt; and formerly of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. One member of your raid needs to complete the &lt;a href=\"Medivh%27s%20Journal%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Medivh's Journal (quest)&lt;/a&gt; questline to summon the boss.\n&lt;a href=\"Tenris%20Mirkblood\"&gt;Tenris Mirkblood&lt;/a&gt;.\nA mysterious agent of the Scourge sent to Karazhan during the second Scourge Invasion. It is rumored that he feasts upon the\nblood of his enemies. He guards the quest target for the quest &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Chamber of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce, the &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Troll\"&gt;forest trolls&lt;/a&gt; controlled a large section of northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; called Zul'Aman. A small region in the northeast of the continent is all that remains after the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; banded together to push back the savage &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The trolls have never been content with the situation, and have never forgiven the humans or elves for the trolls' near genocide. Now that the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; has ravaged much of the continent, the trolls of Zul'Aman have been pressing forward once again to reclaim their former kingdom.\n&lt;a href=\"Nalorakk\"&gt;Nalorakk&lt;/a&gt;.\nNalorakk the Bear Lord comes with two twin bear-pets. Before your raid reaches him you'll have to fight several packs of mobs who storm down towards you. Nalorakk will turn into a large bear when his health runs low. \n&lt;a href=\"Jan%27alai\"&gt;Jan'alai&lt;/a&gt;.\nJan'alai the Dragonhawk Lord is surrounded by &lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk\"&gt;Dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; eggs. Periodically, servants of the Lord will break an egg which brings an add into the fight. Once Jan'alai runs low on health, he'll break all the remaining eggs himself, releasing a swarm of Dragonhawks upon your raid. \n&lt;a href=\"Akil%27zon\"&gt;Akil'zon&lt;/a&gt;.\nAkil'zon the Eagle Lord remains shrouded in mystery...\n&lt;a href=\"Halazzi\"&gt;Halazzi&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalazzi the Lynx Lord remains a mystery so far...\n&lt;a href=\"Hexxlord%20Jin%27Zakk\"&gt;Hexxlord Jin'Zakk&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Hexxlord is the right hand of Zul'jin and is responsible for infusing the four above mentioned champions with primal animal powers. His old and grey looks deceive as he still packs formidable strength. \n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe leader of Zul'Aman and the Amani Trolls. Some confuse him the with troll leader &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Gruul%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Gruul's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nHome of Gruul the Dragonkiller, the merciless &lt;a href=\"Gronn\"&gt;Gronn&lt;/a&gt; overlord, ruler over the ogres of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20King%20Maulgar\"&gt;High King Maulgar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh King Maulgar is the Lord of the Ogre Council of the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge&lt;/a&gt; ogres. He is flanked by the other members of his council.\n&lt;a href=\"Gruul%20the%20Dragonkiller%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Gruul the Dragonkiller&lt;/a&gt;.\nGruul the Dragonkiller is, as his name implies, a famous dragon-slaying &lt;a href=\"Gronn\"&gt;Gronn&lt;/a&gt;. He is the ruler of the ogres of &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge&lt;/a&gt; and the father of the various Gronn that can be found in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Magtheridon's Lair&lt;/a&gt;.\nLocated in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, Magtheridon's Lair is the prison of Magtheridon.\n&lt;a href=\"Magtheridon%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;.\nMagtheridon, the former Lord of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, is a &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Lord\"&gt;Pit Lord&lt;/a&gt; who conquered the ruins of the orcish homeworld following its destruction. His reign was ended by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who took Magtheridon's throne at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; for himself. Deciding that Magtheridon would have a further part to play, Illidan had Magtheridon's body dragged to the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; where he imprisoned the Pit Lord, leaving him at the mercy of the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Serpentshrine%20Cavern\"&gt;Serpentshrine Cavern&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hydross%20the%20Unstable\"&gt;Hydross the Unstable&lt;/a&gt;.\nHydross the Unstable, the Duke of Currents, is a mixed &lt;a href=\"water\"&gt;water&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;. As his name suggests, his unstability makes it unable for him to stay focussed on one element. While fighting him, players will notice him shifting from water to nature and the other way around.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lurker%20Below\"&gt;The Lurker Below&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lurker Below is a beast of a species not often encountered above water. This lurker was most likely captured by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Vashj's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; and put to use as one of the guardians of her lair...\n&lt;a href=\"Leotheras%20the%20Blind\"&gt;Leotheras the Blind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;Blood Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; serves under &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;. His name \"the Blind\" is quite fitting since Demon Hunters blind themselves voluntarily to better see the &lt;a href=\"Demon\"&gt;Demon&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;...\n&lt;a href=\"Fathom-Lord%20Karathress\"&gt;Fathom-Lord Karathress&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot much is known about this &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; Lord. He is flanked by his 3 trusted guards, Sharkkis the &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, Tidalvess the &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; and Caribdis the &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Morogrim%20Tidewalker\"&gt;Morogrim Tidewalker&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe last guardian of &lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, this monstrous &lt;a href=\"Giant\"&gt;Giant&lt;/a&gt; will do everything in his power to prevent you disturbing the Coilfang Matron...\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Vashj&lt;/a&gt; was born a highborne &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt; about 10,000 years ago. She lived in &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, the former capital of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt;. Vashj was fanatically loyal to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and was the second elf to become &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt;, right after the Queen herself.\nThough she prefers combat skills over magic nowadays, she is still a formidable sorceress. Her skills with the bow are rarely matched, only outdone by the &lt;a href=\"Windrunner\"&gt;Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; sisters.\nToday, she is one of the lieutenants of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Lord Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and resides in the &lt;a href=\"Coilfang%20Reservoir\"&gt;Coilfang Reservoir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; where she controls the &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; activities.\n&lt;a href=\"Eye%20%28Tempest%20Keep%29\"&gt;Eye (Tempest Keep)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Eye is the inner castle of the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, currently occupied by &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Al%27ar\"&gt;Al'ar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhether or not Al'ar is a God, divine he is for sure. This fiery bird is the personal mount of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and the first boss encountered in the Prince's lair.\nLike the Phoenix, Al'ar resurrects from the flame when he dies the first time. A most dangerous opponent...\n&lt;a href=\"Void%20Reaver\"&gt;Void Reaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis &lt;a href=\"mechanical\"&gt;mechanical&lt;/a&gt; giant is unlike any other &lt;a href=\"Fel%20reaver\"&gt;Fel Reaver&lt;/a&gt;. Topping them in absolute power, he is one of the personal guardians of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Astromancer%20Solarian\"&gt;High Astromancer Solarian&lt;/a&gt;.\nPresumeably Solarian is the personal sorceress of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. A mix between &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, she casts powerful &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; spells and summons adds to her aid.\nWhen close to death, the High Astromancer transforms herself into a giant armored &lt;a href=\"Voidwalker\"&gt;Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; is the last surviving member of the Sunstrider dynasty, thus making him the heir to the throne of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt;. He chooses to remain Lord instead of King, and was an ally of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a result of Illidan's growing madness, Kael'thas has chosen a new allegiance... He now serves the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and by doing so he betrayed not only his own people, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt;, but also the entire &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn extremely powerful spellcaster and a notable swordsman, Kael'thas is without a doubt one of the most challenging and interesting fights the first expansion has to offer.\n&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuite possibly one of the most epic battles in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history, the outcome of the Battle for Mount Hyjal is now endangered by interference of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Rally an army of heroes and battle one of the most evil &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s ever to set foot on the planet. &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; awaits...\n&lt;a href=\"Rage%20Winterchill%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Rage Winterchill&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the most powerful &lt;a href=\"Lich\"&gt;Lich&lt;/a&gt;es in &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s undead army defending the front lines against the heroes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Anetheron%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Anetheron&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the personal guardsman of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, this immensely powerful &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; is in charge of the demonic basecamp on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. He was one of the Dreadlords assigned to watch over the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and was one of the first Dreadlords to begin to suspect &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; of being a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Kaz%27rogal\"&gt;Kaz'rogal&lt;/a&gt;.\nA powerful &lt;a href=\"Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt; that feeds upon his target's mana. Beware though, once you're out of mana you are of no use to him and he'll make sure to make your death a painful one...\n&lt;a href=\"Azgalor%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormerly the lieutenant of the demon-king &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;, Azgalor took it upon himself to lead the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s ground forces in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s campaign after his former master Mannoroth was killed by &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;.\nArchimonde the Defiler was the left hand of the fallen &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Archimonde was one of the greatest and darkest of the &lt;a href=\"Eredar\"&gt;Eredar&lt;/a&gt;. His ruthless and cunning personality quickly earned him station and power within the Eredar ranks, until finally he was one of the first among them.\nWithout a doubt Archimonde is one of the greatest threats the mortal and immortal races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; have ever faced. Band together with the joint forces of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that Archimonde is slain once and for all...\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Black%20Temple\"&gt;The Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginally known as the Temple of Karabor and a place of worship for the &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt;, the temple has long lost it's purity as &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;Fel Orc&lt;/a&gt;s slaughtered the original inhabitants and performed dark rituals in the sanctum. The Black Temple as it was known since then, changed ownership not so long ago as half-&lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, half-&lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; known as &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; the Deceiver and his forces took over...\n&lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Naj%27entus\"&gt;High Warlord Naj'entus&lt;/a&gt;.\nA powerful &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; warrior sent out by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; to help defend the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Supremus\"&gt;Supremus&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis slow and gigantic &lt;a href=\"abyssal\"&gt;abyssal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; is probably not the most clever amongst &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s ranks, he possesses immense strength and will crush anyone who dares cross his path. In his recklessness, he spawns large patches of blue fire which not only deal damage to mortals, but also to himself...\n&lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;Shade of Akama&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; is a kind but hardened &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; who was once one of the guardians of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Temple of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;. He joined forces with &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, who caused his people great suffering. The Shade of Akama is the dark part of Akama's soul that is bound to Illidan.\nSince Akama plans to help you battle Illidan in order to retake his once beloved Temple, it is your goal to destroy the Shade of Akama before it kills Akama himself...\n&lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; was the leader of the death knights created by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nTeron was trapped in this ethereal form and guarded by &lt;a href=\"Karsius%20the%20Ancient%20Keeper\"&gt;Karsius the Ancient Keeper&lt;/a&gt;. Disguised as an ancient Shadowmoon spirit, he deceives mortals into bringing him his unholy armorpieces back. Once all returned, Teron materialises again into the world and is able to escape his jailor, taking refuge in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and joining &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s forces...\n&lt;a href=\"Gurtogg%20Bloodboil\"&gt;Gurtogg Bloodboil&lt;/a&gt;.\nA seemingly mutated &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;Fel orc&lt;/a&gt; creature that roams the halls of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Reliquary%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Reliquary of Souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nPossibly one of the evil creations of the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20orc\"&gt;Fel Orc&lt;/a&gt;s or a corrupted &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; shrine, the Reliquary of Souls is made up out of 3 essences: Essence of Anger, Essence of Desire and Essence of Grief - each represented by a face.\n&lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt;.\nA &lt;a href=\"Shivarra\"&gt;Shivarra&lt;/a&gt; priestess that resides on one of the temple's many terraces.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Council\"&gt;Illidari Council&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s council of &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Elf\"&gt;Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt;.

His magic addiction made him commit horrible acts against his own people, eventually joining the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and thus earning his nickname \"The Betrayer\".\nAfter defeating and imprisoning &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;, he proclaimed himself Ruler and Lord of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and sealed all portals - except the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; on Outland to stop the reinforcements of the Burning Legion to come through. This way he hopes to avoid capture by &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; whom he also betrayed.\nJoin forces with &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; to put an end to Illidan's reign of terror over the shattered world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;... \nAre you prepared?\n&lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the defeat of Illidan, Kael'thas, now with no master, allied with the Burning Legion and accepted to aid Kil'jaeden to enter in this world. The blood elf prince sent his felblood elves to catch M'uru inside Silvermoon City and use it to amplify the Sunwell's energies.\nNow, a great army of demons invaded the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; and, inside the Sunwell, Kil'jaeden awaits...\n&lt;a href=\"Kalecgos%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;.\nA noble member of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, he has fallen victim to demonic corruption and now guards passage to the Sunwell...\n&lt;a href=\"Sathrovarr%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Sathrovarr the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;.\nA shadowy &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, Sathrovarr is using fel magics to manipulate Kalecgos into serving the Burning Legion.

It is possible that Magistrix Erona may be lying about their nature. Another possibility is that this corruption could be attributed to the blood elves substituting the powering of these crystals with demonic fel energy, which may or may not be a secret kept from civilians, while the crystals themselves were there long before.

It has thrice invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and was only beaten back at a terrible cost. Much of Azeroth's history \u2014 including the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 was due to the Legion's influence. It can be said that the Legion is &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s nemesis, since it caused the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, corrupted the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and sent them to invade Azeroth, created the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and was the source of most of Azeroth's scars. Finally, it should be noted that Azeroth is the only known planet that the Legion has ever failed to conquer.\nHistory.\nGenesis.\nWhen the godlike &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; carried out their mission to bring order to the worlds of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, they soon encountered a deadly threat: the chaotic &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. To combat this foe, the Pantheon sent their greatest champion, the noble &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Though he won victory after victory over the unorganized and incompetent demons, the constant sight of entire civilizations being reduced to ash and their inhabitants warping into horrid aberrations began to fill Sargeras with a great sense of hopelessness, but he nonetheless continued his work.\nWhen it was discovered that the demons Sargeras had defeated simply returned later to torment the physical universe once more in new bodies, the Pantheon sent the titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to aid Sargeras. Together, the two were able to more effectively combat the demonic threat, simultaneously allowing Sargeras to more closely study the nature of the Twisting Nether. By learning how to manipulate Nether energies, the titan champion crafted a prison world known as &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt; to contain the demons he had defeated and prevented them from reforming after death. Soon, Sargeras and Aggramar brought peace to the cosmos and decided to split up to more effectively fight their foe. It was during this time that Sargeras came across a world smothered in &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; energies and infested by horrors known as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. By ruthlessly interrogating a conclave of demonic &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who had come to dwell among the aberrations, Sargeras learned the full plans of the malevolent &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s. By hurling the Old Gods out through the universe, the void lords hoped to corrupt slumbering titan &lt;a href=\"world-soul\"&gt;world-soul&lt;/a&gt;s and transform them into unspeakably dark creatures that would be able to consume all matter and energy in the universe, bringing all of creation under the void lords' will. This horrified Sargeras so much that he instantly killed the nathrezim before cleaving the infested planet in two with his blade.\nWhen he returned to the Pantheon to tell of his discoveries, Sargeras was harshly chastised by his fellow titans. They argued that they would have been able to save the world-soul had Sargeras not acted so rashly. In response, the champion tried to argue that existence itself was flawed and that it had to be purged completely to prevent any chance of the void lords' plans coming to fruition (in his mind, even a lifeless universe was better than one dominated by the Void, for he argued that if life had once taken root in the Great Dark on its own, perhaps it would do so again), but once he realized that the Pantheon would never see things the way he did, Sargeras stormed off into isolation.\nWhile the titans carried on their work, Sargeras meditated in a distant corner of the Great Dark. Fear and doubt led him to the final conclusion that to save the universe, it had to first be purged in fire. Sargeras knew that to accomplish this, he would need an army, and so he returned to the only place where he knew he'd find one: Mardum. The fallen titan tore the prison world asunder, unleashing countless demons and an explosion of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; energy so great that his very form became warped and twisted. The former defender empowered the demons he had unleashed, granting them increased stature or intelligence, and then gave them a simple choice: follow his commands, or be permanently destroyed. It was not a difficult choice.\nWhen the newly-formed Burning Legion set upon its first planet, Sargeras himself killed the &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt; charged with watching over it. Aggramar was the first to learn of the watcher's demise and confronted Sargeras in a duel that ended with both of the titans' blades being broken. Heavily wounded, Aggramar returned to the Pantheon to inform them of Sargeras' betrayal and transformation. Girded for war, the Pantheon met the Legion near a world called &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt;. Though both &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; and Aggramar tried to plead with Sargeras, the former by telling him of a promising world-soul called &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the latter by recounting tales of their glorious battles, the fallen titan was set in his ways. With a single stroke of his shattered blade, Sargeras nearly cleaved Aggramar in half and then launched an apocalyptic battle against the Pantheon, a fight which ended when the corrupted champion unleashed an enormous fel storm that consumed the Pantheon's bodies (though, unbeknownst to the Legion, the titan &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; managed to save the titans' souls from destruction with a final spell). Sargeras declared his Legion victorious and set out to find Azeroth before the void lords did.\nThe battle at Nihilam had shown Sargeras that though his demon servants were ruthless and bloodthirsty, they lacked discipline and strategic thinking. Thus, he decided to recruit the highly intelligent &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt; to his cause. The eredar were ruled by a wise and powerful triumvirate, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;. Though Sargeras managed to convince the former two to serve him, transforming most of Argus' inhabitants into demonic beings, Velen and his followers, known forever after as &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; or \"exiled ones\", escaped under the guidance of the divine &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, the Legion's ranks continued to swell with new races, such as the &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"shivarra\"&gt;shivarra&lt;/a&gt;, and in the coming ages countless worlds were erased from existence by the Legion.\nAt some point, the Burning Legion attacked &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, a realm of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. Though they were repelled, it came at a terrible cost for the armies of the &lt;a href=\"necrolord\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe first invasion.\nMany thousands of years ago (10,000 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;) the Burning Legion became attracted to the world of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; due to the continued experiments on the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; elves. The fallen titan hoped to use the sorcerers and their great magic to expedite the Legion's journey to Azeroth. Without a suitable gateway, he knew that traveling to the world would take ages. Thus, much as he did on Argus, Sargeras reached out to the Highborne and capitalized on their hubris. &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Lord Xavius&lt;/a&gt; was the first of the Highborne to hear Sargeras's call. The power-hungry Xavius quickly brought Sargeras to &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s attention. The fallen titan promised to grand the night elf queen and her servitors unfathomable power, thereby allowing them to remake &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; into a paradise. Sargeras requested only that Azshara and her followers summon his agents into the world of Azeroth so that they could give the Highborne this power.\nEnthralled by Sargeras's might, Azshara and her Highborne used the Well of Eternity's energies to bring the Legion minions into Azeroth. Waves of demonic warriors flooded out from the queen's palace, murdering every night elf in their path save for their Highborne allies. Led by likes of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion stormed across the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; in a tide of death and destruction. Blazing &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s tore through the skies, shattering night elf cities, while thousands of bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; and ravenous &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s reduced Kalimdor's tranquil woods to smothering green embers. War, the likes of which no mortal empire had ever witnessed, had come to Azeroth.\nA &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;night elf resistance force&lt;/a&gt; was formed by a noble named &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; to stand against the Legion's furious onslaught. Among these brave defenders were &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, his sorcerous twin, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, and the beautiful priestess whom both brothers loved dearly, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. Though the resistance initially suffered many defeats against the Legion, the night elves did make gains. Malfurion himself delivered one of the most decisive blows against the Legion and its Highborne allies. From the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, he unleashed his &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic magics upon Xavius, striking him down.\nDespite this setback and the bravery with which the resistance fought, more and more demons spilled into Azeroth through the Highborne's portals. The Legion also bolstered its numbers with a new breed of demons, born from denizens of Azeroth itself. The first of these abominations was Xavius. Sargeras had warped the defeated Highborne's body into a twisted demonic visage of jagged horns and cloven hooves. This new form became known as a &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, and it would mark Xavius as an eternal servant of the Legion. At Sargeras's bidding, he set out to curse of the many his fellow Highborne, transforming them into new satyrs as well.\nAs the Legion's numbers swelled and the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; progressed, Malfurion realized that the night elves could not prevail alone. He convinced Tyrande and Illidan to accompany him to the tranquil &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where they beseeched &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; for aid. The great demigod agreed to rally the mighty &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s against the Legion, but they were unpredictable beings, unaccustomed to fight as one. Thus spurring them into action would take time, a luxury that night elves did not have.\nWhile Cenarius gathered the Wild Gods, Malfurion called on the mighty &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to defend Azeroth. Led by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza the Life-Binder&lt;/a&gt;, the dragons convened at their ancient meeting ground of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; to discuss how to hold back the Legion's invasion. It was during one of these gatherings that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion the Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt; proposed a solution. He convinced his fellow Aspects to sacrifice a portion of their power and infuse it into the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, a singular artifact of his design. The weapon, he claimed, would focus their powers and scour the Legion from the face of Azeroth.\nAmid a furious battle between the Legion and the night elf resistance, the five dragonflights made their final assault against the demons. Working in unison with his comrades Neltharion unleashed the full might of the empowered Dragon Soul and utterly decimated the Legion. Unbeknownst to the other Aspects however Neltharion had fallen prey to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and thus the dragons and night elves were unprepared when Neltharion turned the weapon against them soon after. The betrayal shattered the united of the dragonflights, nearly killing all of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and robbing Azeroth of one its greatest defenders when it needed it most. Neltharion himself would be transformed by the powers of the now christened Demon Soul and take the name &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nDeathwing's betrayal struck a terrible blow to the night elves' morale and, worse, Illidan had mysteriously gone missing. Unbeknownst to the resistance, Illidan had decided to strike out on his own, incensed by remaining in his brother's shadow and that Malfurion had claimed the heart of Tyrande Whisperwind, who both brothers desired. When Illidan confessed his love, Tyrande rejected him, convincing him that she intended to take Malfurion as her mate. In the wake of this bitter rejection, dark thoughts plagued Illidan. Unbeknownst to the sorcerer, the satyr Xavius was subtly twisting his mind and fanning the flames of his despair. With mounting discontent, Illidan left the resistance and joined the Legion and against all odds, secured an audience with Sargeras himself. Blessed by Sargeras with exceptional powers, Illidan would venture and steal the Dragon Soul from Deathwing, delivering it to the Highborne, who planned to use it to open a massive gateway for the Legion within the heart of the Well of Eternity.\nAround this time, the Highborne of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, who had watched as their city was used by the cunning &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; as an experiment in the creation of an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army, responded to an attempt by the Legion to create a second portal in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Using the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, the court of the &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; sealed the tomb, and proceeded to create a massive barrier surrounding the still intact sections of the city, sealing themselves off from the conflict.\nThe Legion delivered many crushing defeats to the night elf resistance, but the resistance refused to give up as it rallied around &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and secured new allies such as &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; dissidents led by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, and at long last the Wild Gods and their forces which emerged to combat the Legion. With their allies in arms, the resistance launched a desperate assault against &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt; itself. The resistance stormed the broken capital and clashed with the Legion's seemingly numberless ranks. The cost was horrific. Thousands upon thousands of demons fell, but so, too, did many of Azeroth's mighty defenders. The Legion's bloodletting warriors even overwhelmed a number of the Wild Gods. One by one, these primordial creatures succumbed to the poisoned black blades and fel powers wielded by the demons. With each death, the forest atop Hyjal shivered, and the winds howled in sorrow.\nAs the titanic battle raged around Azshara's capital city, Malfurion and Tyrande journeyed to the Well of Eternity's shores with a small, elite force. They hoped to reclaim the Dragon Soul and prevent the Legion from using its power. Malfurion and his allies were joined by Illidan, who claimed his allegiance to the Legion had been a ruse to learn of their ways. Although suspicious, Malfurion accepted Illidan's aid, for he had discovered that the Well of Eternity had become a colossal portal - a direct gateway for Sargeras himself to enter Azeroth, as Azshara waited in anticipation for his arrival. As the impossibly huge shadow of the dark titan drew ever closer to the Well's raging surface, the delusional queen had gathered the most powerful of her Highborne followers, linking their magics together in one focused spell to be able to create a gateway large enough for Sargeras to enter.\nRealizing that no standing army, no matter how vast, could withstand the terrible might of Sargeras, Malfurion knew the only hope for victory would be to destroy the Well of Eternity itself. Stealing the Dragon Soul, Malfurion drew upon its power to disrupt the Highborne's carefully crafted spellwork and shattered the connection between the Legion and Azeroth. With their connection broken, Sargeras and most of the Legion's ranks were ripped back into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; by the energies of the collapsing Well of Eternity.\nThe resultant catastrophic explosion shattered the earth and blotted out the skies. This &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; would change the geography of Azeroth forever, and Legion remnants stuck on the planet would eventually rally around &lt;a href=\"Xalan%20the%20Feared\"&gt;Xalan the Feared&lt;/a&gt; and strike against the fledgling new night elf government, but would ultimately be defeated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe hidden threat.\nIn the following millennia, in the growing &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; societies of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, there were legends among the populace of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Days\"&gt;First Days&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s roamed free and great heroes arose to drive them out. Knowing the real truth, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; forbade &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;demonology&lt;/a&gt; - any attempt to summon demons were to be found and stopped at once, often by force. As such demons had a limited public impact on the people of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Seven Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, mostly existing through rumors and folk legends. Most situations involving demon worship ended up taken care of by local authorities, with individuals such as venal farmhands and greedy merchants committing sacrifices and other foul acts in the name of some old demon whose name they couldn't even properly pronounce after hearing their whispers in their sleep. Real ceremonies involving demon summoning and &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; spells did happen, but they were secretly neutralized by the efforts of the Kirin Tor and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Council of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;.\nSargeras' return.\nWithin the icy lands of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Legion agents emerged and began hunting errant &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, feeding on their potent arcane energies. The Guardian &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; discovered and sought the aid of the dragons to combat the threat. Led by &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; the Life-Binder, several of the dragonflights agreed to fight at the Guardian's side. Together, they staged on ambush near the gigantic skeletal remains of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. The demons fell into Aegwynn's trap. As a blizzard tore over the terrain, the Guardian and her winged allies overwhelmed the Legion's minions. Yet neither Aegwynn nor the dragons expected what came next.\nThe skies of Northrend churned and darkened. A monstrous demonic form emerged upon the battlefield: Sargeras, ruler of the Burning Legion. This was only &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;an avatar&lt;/a&gt; of the demon lord, a tiny portion of Sargeras's vast cosmic power. Yet he nonetheless radiated great strength and fury. He unleashed his terrible might on Aegwynn, intending to destroy the Guardian who had thwarted his agents for so long. Aegwynn did not hesitate to fight back. She summoned her powers and brought them to bear against Sargeras. The battle that followed was the most difficult Aegwynn had ever fought. In the shadow of Galakrond's gargantuan remains, Sargeras and the Guardian called down the fury of the heavens. Their attacks tore the darkened skies asunder and scarred the icy crusts of Northrend. A storm of magic engulfed the region and held even the mighty dragons at bay. With a final relentless flurry of spellwork, Aegwynn defeated her foe. Though drained from the effort, she was victorious.\nOr so it seemed, for when Aegwynn struck Sargeras down, he had transferred his spirit into her weakened body. There, a silver of Sargeras's undying malevolence would remain, lurking within the depths of her soul. Unaware of the dark presence hidden deep within her, Aegwynn gathered the Avatar and &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;sealed&lt;/a&gt; it away in the hopes that his remains would lie undisturbed until the end of time.\nThe second invasion.\nFor years, since their defeat at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion had watched and waited for the moment to be right for a second attempt to conquer Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; was given orders to plan the second invasion of Azeroth and was unwilling to take any chances on the Legion's success. He decided that a new force would be necessary in order to weaken the defenses of Azeroth before the Legion's main invasion force arrived.\nThe doom of Draenor.\nFor millennia, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s scouts searched the Nether for the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, finding and destroying the worlds they had settled on, but they always managed to escape. Then, one day, Kil'jaeden's favored servant, &lt;a href=\"Talgath\"&gt;Talgath&lt;/a&gt;, stumbled upon a world that showed signs of the draenei's magic. Though they initially assumed it was just another one of the planets the draenei briefly stopped upon, further investigations quickly discovered that the draenei had actually settled there, even going so far as to give it an eredun name: &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, meaning \"Exiles' Refuge\". There also resided a race of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic beings called &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. Intrigued by their potential, Kil'jaeden realized that they were exactly what he was looking for and thus sought an agent of the orcish race to follow his will. Though Kil'jaeden found many suitable candidates, none held as much potential as &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\nGul'dan was born crippled, weak and deformed, which made him a target for constant mockery and abuse ever since his childhood. He knew that he was meant for more than his clan would ever allow of him, and he hated them for it. He used the hate and bitterness he felt as a way to keep going. One day, the other clan members grew so tired of the runt's refusal to accept his place in the clan that they beat him repeatedly in an attempt to rid themselves of him once and for all. As the chieftain was about to beat him again, the elderly shaman of the clan stopped him, saying that he had tried and failed to help Gul'dan find his place in the clan. Laying a hand on Gul'dan's shoulder, the elder said, not unkindly, that there was nothing more he could do for him, but that he had always believed there was greatness within him. He then advised the runt to seek out the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt;, for perhaps there he would find his destiny. At first Gul'dan eventually followed the advice, only to be rejected by the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;furies&lt;/a&gt; who sensed the darkness and fury within his heart. It was at his lowest that Kil'jaeden spoke to Gul'dan, promising power and godhood in exchange for Gul'dan helping the Burning Legion turn the orcs as a weapon to destroy the draenei.\nGul'dan quickly agreed, for he only held disdain for his people. Kil'jaeden instructed his new servant in the ways of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. The demon lord knew that these energies would physically change the orc or even draw the draenei's attention, so he took steps to hide Gul'dan new abilities. Kil'jaeden taught the orc how to mask his powers, and he ordered him to use fel magic only when absolutely necessary. Gul'dan took to the volatile power faster than expected, reveling in the destructive might at his fingertips.\nKnowing that Gul'dan couldn't serve as the figure they needed to forged the orc clans into an army, Kil'jaeden ordered Gul'dan to ally with someone who could inspire or lead the orc race. After destroying his former clan (in order to ensure that no one knew his past) Gul'dan would join the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;, which was under the rule of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. In time, Gul'dan would earn Ner'zhul's trust and became the elder's shamanic apprentice. Under the guise of the orcs' sacred ancestors, Kil'jaeden tricked the shamans of each clan\u2014including their most respected leader, the elder shaman Ner'zhul\u2014into thinking that the draenei were plotting against the orcs. Soon, the clans began to launch successful skirmishes and raids against the draenei, believing it to be their ancestors' will that they be exterminated. However, plans faltered when Ner'zhul traveled to &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, was shown the truth about his new patron, and attempted to undo his actions. Kil'jaeden, however, was already aware of Ner'zhul's actions and stripped the elderly shaman of his power, and Gul'dan taught his &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; magics to other orcs, creating the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to secretly rule over them. Eventually, as the &lt;a href=\"elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental spirit&lt;/a&gt;s refused to grant their powers to the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, these demonic powers would overtake the orcs.\nAfter proving the orcs' ability to fight the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;'s blood was given to the orcs to drink, and they degraded into a horrible bloodlust. As both a test of his new minions and as a revenge to his wayward brethren, Kil'jaeden ordered Gul'dan to finish the slaughter of the draenei in one climactic battle at &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was a brutal massacre, with much of Shattrath being destroyed. To all appearances, Kil'jaeden's pawns had finally triumphed over the draenei. Kil'jaeden was relatively pleased with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction of the draenei, as was Sargeras who viewed the Horde as the perfect army to weaken Azeroth and thus ordered Kil'jaeden to cut all communication with them. Sargeras wanted the orcs to be so desperate that they would anything to survive, even if that meant journeying to another world.\n&lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; wars &lt;a href=\"ADP\"&gt;ADP&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s attempted to invade &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; twice through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. However, the natives of the planet formed together into an &lt;a href=\"alliance\"&gt;alliance&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, fought back with unexpected determination, and casualties were high on both sides. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had defeated the orcs and their homeworld of Draenor was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s attempt to escape into another dimension. The remaining orcs were rounded up and placed in various &lt;a href=\"internment%20camp\"&gt;internment camp&lt;/a&gt;s by the Alliance.\nAfter the defeat of the orcs, Kil'jaeden determined to create a new force, one that would succeed where the orcs had failed. To this end, he captured &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; and remade him as the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Trapping his essence in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, a large block of ice, Kil'jaeden hurled the Lich King to Azeroth, where he crashed on the frozen continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. The Lich King's new mission was to prepare Azeroth for subjugation through the release of a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was born.\n&lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere the orcs had failed the Scourge succeeded impressively. Within months the Eastern Kingdoms were in disarray. Each soldier or townsfolk who fell to the Scourge was reborn as an undead minion of the Lich King. Finally, the time for the Legion's return was nigh.\nServants of the Scourge were able to summon &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; himself to lead the assault... with him came the demons of the Legion. The second invasion had truly begun. The forces of the Legion swept across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and soon reached the shores of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, home of their old enemy, the night elves.\nThe Legion chose as its main goal the consumption of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, which granted immortality to the night elves, and to seize the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to form a powerful gateway for the Legion. At the final hour, an alliance of humans, orcs, and night elves fought desperately to hold back &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and the legion while Malfurion Stormrage performed a desperate druidic ritual upon the World Tree itself. Finally, Malfurion gave the signal that he was ready and the Legion was allowed to reach their goal...the World Tree stood exposed to Archimonde. As the demon embraced the tree and began to feed upon its magics, Malfurion's spell took hold. The World Tree released all of its energy into Archimonde at once, destroying both the World Tree and the demon. The ensuing explosion destroyed the tree and laid waste to Hyjal Summit. The Legion had been defeated once again but at the cost of the night elves' immortality.\nWith Archimonde finally defeated, Kil'jaeden assumed complete control of the Legion.\nAftermath of the Third War.\nAn army of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; arose, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Garithos\"&gt;Lord Garithos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance resistance fought back against the Scourge and the Burning Legion. They managed to retake &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and fought against the undead in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nKalimdor.\nThe Majority Satyr groups are still loyal to the Burning Legion and have stayed on Kalimdor waiting for the return of their dark masters. The remains of the Legion itself can be found in the region of Felwood where demons of all varieties can be found, including a few corrupted species such as furbolgs. The Legion also has many still loyal orcish warlocks of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; hiding in Durotar and even &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nLordaeron.\nAlthough the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; suffered a great loss with the blood elves, they continued fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. However, they were not a serious threat to the Burning Legion. Rather, the dreadlords &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; who were in charge of the Scourge were impatient for orders from &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and ensured that the Scourge was ready for action, ignorant of the death of their leader. Soon after, &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; returned to Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. He told the undead leaders that the city was now his and that he wouldn't require the dreadlords' services to watch over it. When Balnazzar retorted that the Scourge belonged to the Legion, Arthas replied that their masters had been defeated and that the Burning Legion was \"undone.\" He then tried to slaughter the dreadlords but they managed to escape and warn Arthas of their inevitable retribution. Later, the dreadlords found out that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was weakening, and together with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; planned to overthrow Arthas.\nLuckily for the Scourge, Arthas escaped the Capital City and Sylvanas's assassination attempt was thwarted by Kel'thuzad. Soon after Varimathras invited Sylvanas to join the dreadlord's new order, Sylvanas however had no intention of losing her freedom again denied the offer and knew it was only a moment of time before she would be attacked. Using her sister &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s Sylvanas possessed &lt;a href=\"Blackthorn\"&gt;Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Snarlmane\"&gt;Snarlmane&lt;/a&gt;, and possibly the &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Puddle%20Lord\"&gt;Murloc Puddle Lord&lt;/a&gt; to bloster her forces and not only did she destroy the attacking undead, she even \"turned\" Varimathras to her side. Soon after the future &lt;a href=\"forsaken\"&gt;forsaken&lt;/a&gt; killed Detheroc and acquired an ally in the freed &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe banshee and her forces laid &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Power%20in%20Lordaeron\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; to Balnazzar's base, which he had fortified within the city ruins. Balnazzar then found himself attacked from both sides by Sylvanas and Garithos. Though he was armed with demons and had made many threats, Balnazzar's forces were defeated.\nSylvanas, Varimathras, and Garithos approached Balnazzar. Sylvanas ordered Varimathras to kill his brother as a testament of his loyalty to her. Varimathras was reluctant. Killing another &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; was forbidden but Sylvanas was adamant. Balnazzar was sure that Varimathras would never take that final step. He was wrong. Varimathras then killed Garithos on Sylvanas' orders.\nWith all their enemies dead, Sylvanas made a proclamation to Varimathras. They would rule the Plaguelands as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and would stake out their own destiny, where none would get in their way.\nAlthough Balnazzar succumbed to Sylvanas's forces, he had not been destroyed. He used the last of his power to flee into the Plaguelands. Later, Balnazzar killed and possessed &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;'s body and began using the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;.\nOutland.\n&lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; still ruled Outland after the Legion's defeat, but, with the help of the escaped &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; stormed his citadel and claimed Outland for his own. Although the pit lord was chained and his forces are now part of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt;, there are still numerous Legion strongholds over the planet and the &lt;a href=\"Cabal\"&gt;Cabal&lt;/a&gt;, cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;, are trying to provide an advantage to their demon masters. The draenei are resisting the Legion, even a group led by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; had to join Illidan to defeat Magtheridon.\nStormwind.\nThe Burning Legion in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt; were under the command of &lt;a href=\"Kazzak%20the%20Supreme\"&gt;Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Razelikh%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Razelikh the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; the Burning Legion bolstered its ranks with &lt;a href=\"Grol%20the%20Destroyer\"&gt;Grol the Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20tribe\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sevine\"&gt;Lady Sevine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Allistarj\"&gt;Archmage Allistarj&lt;/a&gt;. This sect of the Legion also includes &lt;a href=\"Ilifar\"&gt;Ilifar&lt;/a&gt;, the only known &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; who sided with the Legion.\nAttempted invasion.\nThrough the Dark Portal.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan's&lt;/a&gt; failure to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; sent forces to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; to destroy him. However, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt; proved to be equally as powerful and the Legion has so far been unable to gain revenge. Kil'jaeden thus decided to trick the people of Azeroth into getting rid of Illidan in his stead. Led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;, the Legion opened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; again and sent troops into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; managed to hold the area surrounding the portal until reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; arrived. After that, the Azerothian resistance pressed on and managed to drive the demons back into &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; where they fought at &lt;a href=\"The%20Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;The Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt;. Kil'jaeden's plan worked, and the Alliance and Horde would eventually kill Illidan for him.\nThe Alliance and Horde got to the middle of &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, where the Horde established &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; and the initial Expeditionary Force of the Alliance reinforced &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;. However, a &lt;a href=\"Pit%20Commander\"&gt;Pit Commander&lt;/a&gt; and more Legion forces blocked the reinforcements of both factions, and they stood together to fight in &lt;a href=\"The%20Stair%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;The Stair of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; for a long time. &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20General%20Orion\"&gt;Lieutenant General Orion&lt;/a&gt; sent an Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; for reinforcements of &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt;; after the notice &lt;a href=\"General%20Krakork\"&gt;General Krakork&lt;/a&gt; sent out what forces he could. The Legion stationed &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlords&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Felspark%20Ravine\"&gt;Felspark Ravine&lt;/a&gt;, but the Alliance and Horde defeated them, their &lt;a href=\"imp\"&gt;imp&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"infernal\"&gt;infernal&lt;/a&gt;s. The Alliance and Horde finally managed to destroy the portals, defeating the Legion's forces by ground and by air. Although the Burning Legion continued to produce &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;s in , the Alliance and Horde detected this and sent adventurers that defeated this force and destroyed the fel reavers. After the defeat of the fel reavers they aimed at &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; with fel cannons, but both Alliance and Horde destroyed the cannons. The final Legion's base, commanded by &lt;a href=\"Warbringer%20Arix%27Amal\"&gt;Warbringer Arix'Amal&lt;/a&gt;, still housed warp-portals from which they were drawing reinforcements, but the Alliance located the base and both Alliance and Horde sent adventurers which destroyed the portals and defeated the Legion in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;.\nActivities in Outland.\n&lt;a href=\"Doom%20Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Doom Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt; was the commander of the Burning Legion in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;; he resided in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;. Although the Burning Legion in Hellfire Peninsula was defeated, there was a presence through all other zones of Outland with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Zangarmarsh\"&gt;Zangarmarsh&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; was still active; there were many cultists, who were part of a branch called the &lt;a href=\"Cabal\"&gt;Cabal&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; the Legion had accomplished several things:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Netherstorm\"&gt;Netherstorm&lt;/a&gt; the main activities were of the blood elves allied with the Legion, the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, with mainly the forces outside of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; and other groups inside of it. The demons in the zone were led by the &lt;a href=\"man%27ari%20eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Socrethar\"&gt;Socrethar&lt;/a&gt; and did several things:\nFury of The Sunwell.\nKil'jaeden was not finished yet, however, for he had found a new pawn to manipulate in &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. After his defeat at Tempest Keep, and still blinded by his lust for power, Kael became an all too willing participant in the Burning Legion's next attempt to invade and conquer Azeroth. Kil'jaeden restored Kael'thas' health and power through demonic means and empowered many of his followers will fel energy. Kael'thas sent his new &lt;a href=\"Felblood%20elf\"&gt;Felblood elves&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, where they captured &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt; from Kael's own people and took him to the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Kael'thas also discovered that the energies of the Sunwell still existed, in the form of the human girl &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt;, and she was imprisoned and taken to the Sunwell, with Kael hoping to use her energies to reignite the Sunwell, to both bring his new master Kil'jaeden into Azeroth, and to supply himself with a new font of limitless power. However, with the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and mortal &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth, Kael'thas was killed once and for all in the &lt;a href=\"Magister%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Magister's Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, and Kil'jaeden's plans to enter Azeroth were foiled. Anveena sacrificed herself to weaken Kil'jaeden so that the mortal heroes battling him could finally defeat him and send him back through the Sunwell. After the battle at the Sunwell, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; used what was left of M'uru's \"body\" to reignite the Sunwell, saving the blood elves from their addiction to demonic power and allowing them to continue to use the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe royal coup.\nIn the wake of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; plotted his way into controlling a substantial part of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; faction, using them and his chief underling, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, to launch a surprise assault upon the combatants at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. This ambush resulted in the deaths of hundreds of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; soldiers, including famed Alliance hero &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;. At the same time, Burning Legion forces under the command of Varimathras successfully took control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and nearly killed &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;The Dark Lady&lt;/a&gt; herself.\nHe was eventually faced and defeated by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas, and adventurers during &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, after which he was not seen again. During the battle, Varimathras made reference to \"years of planning\" (attempting to undermine Sylvanas) and the voice of an unseen \"Master\" was heard berating Varimathras for his failure to prevent the Horde party from reaching the throne room, after which point Varimathras entered the fray himself \u2014 where he was defeated.\nWhile the Burning Legion was tactically successful in rekindling Alliance-Horde tensions, it ultimately failed in its strategic goal of re-summoning yet another Legion invasion. It remains unknown who the unseen \"Master\" was, but is &lt;a href=\"Sargeras%23Master%3F\"&gt;presumably Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nBy the time of the Cataclysm, the Burning Legion's command structure was mostly wiped out, with only a few survivors and their masters' whereabouts unknown. The Burning Legion may have still been a devastating threat to the universe, however, though it had a weaker hold on Azeroth. With the devastation caused by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20Cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer Cult&lt;/a&gt; were able to successfully take &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; from the Burning Legion. Despite this defeat the Legion was able to keep their holdouts in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. Despite Balnazzar's defeat and the collapse of the Scarlet Crusade in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the legion was able to keep a hold on the city through Balnazzar's new &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; army, which consisted of Scarlet Crusaders who were in a state of &lt;a href=\"undeath\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. The Scarlets at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; had also fallen to this fate, securing the town for the Legion.\nHowever, the denizens of Azeroth did not allow the Legion to keep these areas in peace. In &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; aided &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Leh%27Prah\"&gt;Khan Leh'Prah&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar%20clan\"&gt;Kolkar clan&lt;/a&gt; in his quest to unite the centaur (Kolkar, &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20clan\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt;) and successfully launched an assault on &lt;a href=\"Shok%27Thokar\"&gt;Shok'Thokar&lt;/a&gt;. In Felwood, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Circle\"&gt;Emerald Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; launched their own assaults on the Legion holdouts in the area. In the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, both the Horde and the Alliance secured the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Forest\"&gt;Tainted Forest&lt;/a&gt; to end the Legion's hold on the region. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; sent adventurers into both Tyr's Hand and Stratholme and claimed them for the Crusade.\nWhile the legion tried to hold on to its bastions of power on Azeroth, they were able to launch an assault to reclaim &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; that allowed them to reacquire the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Sothann\"&gt;Gates of Sothann&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\nFor over 20 years, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xaraax\"&gt;Highlord Xaraax&lt;/a&gt; plotted to destroy &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Darkstorm\"&gt;Darkstorm&lt;/a&gt;, a dark force that could unmake the world, destroying every living soul. An unknown &lt;a href=\"Voice%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; shielded the world, the Darkstorm unable to come. The naaru was protected by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Seven%20Suns\"&gt;Order of the Seven Suns&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Greydon%20Thorne\"&gt;Greydon Thorne&lt;/a&gt;, with his brother, &lt;a href=\"Malus\"&gt;Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;. Xaraax eventually managed to convince Silverlaine to join him. When Silverlaine returned to the order, he destroyed the naaru, the impact also destroying the &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Blade\"&gt;Diamond Blade&lt;/a&gt;, its shards blasting across Azeroth. Due to the fact that the shards were infused with the naaru's essence, the Darkstorm couldn't come to Azeroth. Turning once more to Silverlaine, now known as Malus, Xaraax commanded him to find all the shards and bring the weapon so he could finally kill the naaru.\nMalus led his &lt;a href=\"Hidden\"&gt;Hidden&lt;/a&gt; to search for Greydon, who was on the same mission. Eventually, the mission passed on his son &lt;a href=\"Aramar%20Thorne\"&gt;Aramar&lt;/a&gt; and then on &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt; who managed to find all the parts and reforge the battle. Intending to rescue the Thornes from Xaraax's &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;citadel&lt;/a&gt;, Makasa gathered an army of &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s, and other individuals to assault the citadel which contained a host of demons and arakkoa. Fighting their way through the enemy lines, Xaraax took hold of the Diamond Blade when Makasa and her allies made it to the top of the demonic stronghold. When the nathrezim began corrupting it, Malus, who had been deemed unuseful, took the Highlord's former &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; sword and impaled him on it and tossed him to the Darkstorm. The fel corrupted Malus, and the threat of the Darkstorm remained, forcing Makasa's friends and former Hidden to continue fighting against the citadel's demons and Malus. Ultimately, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, and the great number of Thorne's friends bested Malus, and Makasa ended his life. With his death, the Darkstorm evaporated, and the majority of demons was defeated by the Azerothian force while other fled from the citadel.\nMists of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the Horde and Alliance would have to unite to fight a greater foe that will come from beyond Azeroth. The image that he displayed while saying this shows Azeroth under bombardment by balls of green and yellow fire. This threat was confirmed to be the Burning Legion during the &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt; portion of &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Blessings\"&gt;Celestial Blessings&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairozdormu&lt;/a&gt; opened a gateway to an alternate dimension at the time of corruption of the orcs on its version of Draenor, intending on rallying them before they were swayed, &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; took notice of it and went directly to in order to corrupt the orcs into the Legion's service, not bothering with using as a public figure like in the main timeline. However, due to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh's&lt;/a&gt; interference with the timeline, and the orcs didn't accept Gul'dan's offer. Insulted by Grommash, &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; attacked him, but the orcs were prepared for him, and they fired their cannons at Mannoroth. Before he could regain his poise, Grommash lunged at him and buried &lt;a href=\"Gorehowl\"&gt;Gorehowl&lt;/a&gt; deep into his skull, effectively killing Mannoroth. Gul'dan, and the , were captured by Grommash's &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and used to power the Dark Portal to take them to Prime Azeroth. Under &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership, the Alliance and the Horde successfully repelled the invasion, destroyed the Dark Portal, and freed Gul'dan and his lackeys.\nWith Kil'jaeden's failure to corrupt the orcs, &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; took full control of the Legion's operations on the alternate Draenor. As a result, the demons were less behind-the-scenes and more direct in corrupting the residents.\n&lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Othaar\"&gt;Exarch Othaar&lt;/a&gt; was one of those that had been lured by the demons to help in Draenor's destruction. Believing that was leading their people to their doom, and promised by the Legion with great power, he swore fealty to them and transformed into the man'ari eredar, Socrethar, adopting a leadership role within the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;. He later led the Legion's attack on and succeeded in taking over the draenei capital. Later on, with the help of the Alliance and Horde, Socrethar was killed and Shattrath was liberated.\nGul'dan, on the other hand, had been looking for ways to empower himself and the Legion. He sent &lt;a href=\"Teron%27gor\"&gt;Teron'gor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; gather all the draenei's souls to be used to empower the demons, and sent to to subjugate the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt;, . Both of them betrayed Gul'dan and used the respective energies they were sent to gather to empower themselves. Thanks to adventurers employed by Khadgar, both were stopped and killed before they could wreak havoc.\nGul'dan later traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; to find a frustrated and brooding &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Iskar&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan offered him a cure for the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, and power beyond reckoning. Frustrated over his failure to fully restore , the Curse of Sethe, and his ever-growing thirst for vengeance, Iskar gladly accepted Gul'dan's offer and became the first of the fel arakkoa. He later persuaded more cursed arakkoa to accept Gul'dan's offer and they swore fealty to the Legion. The cult also joined Iskar's arakkoa.\nLater on, the Iron Horde went into disarray due to their losses to the Alliance and Horde, causing many of the clans to leave Grommash. Gul'dan appeared to Grommash and taunted him for his constant defeats against the Alliance and Horde, and again offered him the Blood of Mannoroth. Grommash refused and attacked Gul'dan, but was easily repelled with Gul'dan's magic. , on the other hand, gladly accepted his offer and became a fel orc. The rest of the Iron Horde followed suit, and Gul'dan effectively took control of them, turning &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; into the Legion's base of operations.\nNot deterred by this, the Horde and Alliance respectively established the bases of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27mar\"&gt;Vol'mar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Lion's Watch&lt;/a&gt; and quickly took to battle against the Legion and their allies. Adventurers would ultimately storm itself in a final effort to stop them, wiping out the enemy leadership including Mannoroth and Archimonde. With Archimonde's death Draenor was declared free, though Gul'dan escaped by being sent through the Dark Portal by the Defiler in his last moments.\nThe third invasion.\nThe third invasion began when the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was reopened by Gul'dan, and the demons of the Burning Legion poured into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt;, a horrific nexus of magic. Their full, terrifying might was fixed on summoning &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Titan\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth\u2014and they had already located the key to his return. This was the largest demonic invasion of Azeroth in the world's history.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt; attacked areas such as &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;. Azeroth's defenders rallied to repel the various assaults.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; was the source of this invasion, where the armies of Azeroth defeated the initial thrust of the invasion. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, however, culminated in the Legion overrunning Azeroth's defenders and forcing them to withdraw. Many of the greatest heroes in Azeroth, such as &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, fell in battle before the Legion or were mortally wounded. Some escaped, others went missing or were captured, but many more died upon the Broken Shore.\nIn addition to directly attacking the planet, the Legion used more subtle means to try and subvert the defenders through their &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; agents. The newly-crowned &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; captured an assassin, in disguise as a Stormwindian soldier, that then tried to convince the king that he was weak and that his kingdom needed to align with them. Another appeared to the desperate &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt; in the guise of his old master, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. In search of knowledge Medivh may have kept that could help, Khadgar was tempted by the demon to accept the power that \"Medivh\" had supposedly stored away in a tome to empower another &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, something the former apprentice admittedly desired that could make the Legion fear him. Khadgar recognized it was a trap to corrupt him and destroyed the tome. Both agents were destroyed and sent back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nDiscovering that the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; can be used to seal the Legion's gateway into Azeroth and to preventing another invasion, adventurers were quick to seek them out. However, this task was far from easy as agents of the Legion such as &lt;a href=\"God-King%20Skovald\"&gt;God-King Skovald&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, as well as other forces led by &lt;a href=\"Dargrul\"&gt;Dargrul&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, sought the Pillars for their own. Furthermore, in order to acquire the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt;, the class orders and the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen\"&gt;Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; worked together to strike at the Grand Magistrix and her &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, who had sided with the Legion, believing its victory to be inevitable.\nUltimately, the Pillars of Creation were acquired by Azeroth's heroes, who then moved to &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;assault the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and, after securing the foothold of &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; quickly set about engaging the Legion throughout the zone, securing further gains against &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s forces. The mortals' primary goal remained the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, the focal point of the Burning Legion's invasion, where they sought to sever the Legion's link to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter securing the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt;, the lower parts of the Tomb of Sargeras were breached by Azeroth's defenders and they defeated the dark horrors within including the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;fallen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Avatar of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the Avatar's defeat, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; led the charge against Kil'jaeden, who was ultimately killed inside the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s death, his &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;command ship&lt;/a&gt; began to crash toward Argus. Illidan used the &lt;a href=\"%3ASargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;:Sargerite Keystone&lt;/a&gt; to open a rift between Argus and Azeroth, allowing &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to teleport them safely to &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;. Facing the imminent threat of the Legion's full might appearing in the skies above the world, the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; gathered within the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" where they boarded the new ship \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" in order to take the fight to Argus itself, joining with the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;. The assault on Argus ended with Sargeras himself imprisoned, and with the Legion's leadership having already been killed, the Legion has effectively become a nonentity and their Burning Crusade brought to an end.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nOn , after &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28Hellfire%20Citadel%20tactics%29\"&gt;fall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; worked together for years to drive the Burning Legion forces.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, at least &lt;a href=\"Syrawon%20the%20Dominus\"&gt;one demon&lt;/a&gt; was tracked by the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim were revealed to have seemingly discarded the Legion or whatever remained of it, with &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; going as far as to declare that the Legion was a pawn used by them for their true master: &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, pockets of demons remained active on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. On &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt;, the nathrezim &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Banehollow\"&gt;Lord Banehollow&lt;/a&gt; and his demonic followers lured new warlocks to his side for years, in order to obtain their souls at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms%20%28Burning%20Steppes%29\"&gt;Altar of Storms&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, until he was defeated by adventuring &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Hel%27nurath\"&gt;Lord Hel'nurath&lt;/a&gt; and his minions resurged in the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hold\"&gt;Shadow Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaedenar\"&gt;Jaedenar&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, where they captured and corrupted &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s, until they were defeated by a group of night elves led by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argussian%20Reach\"&gt;Argussian Reach&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Hatuun\"&gt;Chieftain Hatuun&lt;/a&gt; continued to battle the remnants of the Legion in their quest to reclaim their homeworld. Meanwhile, following the Legion's defeat during the third invasion, the &lt;a href=\"man%27ari\"&gt;man'ari&lt;/a&gt; had grown desperate and either isolated themselves or created cults awaiting the return of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. In the midst of this situation, a group of man'ari led by &lt;a href=\"Arzal%27kal\"&gt;Arzal'kal&lt;/a&gt;, seeking redemption for the atrocities they committed over millennia, aided the &lt;a href=\"Krokul\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; in repentance for their deeds. In time, Arzal'kal met &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; and helped retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Star\"&gt;Brilliant Star&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Nalridun\"&gt;Speaker Nalridun&lt;/a&gt; and his cultists. In recognition of their deeds, the Prophet allowed them to join the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, a position Arzal'kal accepted by reclaiming his original name: Arzaal.\nDuring their fight against the man'ari cultists, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s could find &lt;a href=\"Half-Completed%20Invasion%20Plans\"&gt;invasion plans&lt;/a&gt;, although incomplete, these plans mentioned a new Legion invasion of an unknown distant world.\nNotable members.\nThe majority of the Legion ruling hierarchy has been either defeated on Azeroth or permanently destroyed in the Twisting Nether.\nNon-sapient species.\nThe Burning Legion races consist mainly of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s, but other non-demonic species serve them as well.\nOrganization.\nHierarchy.\nSargeras is the leader of the Burning Legion. If missing, Kil'jaeden runs things in his stead. Eredar serve as the Legion's overlords and strategists. &lt;a href=\"Pit%20lord\"&gt;Pit lord&lt;/a&gt;s serve as generals and ground commanders. &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; are a step below pit lords. &lt;a href=\"Doomguard\"&gt;Doomguard&lt;/a&gt; are four steps below nathrezim, serving as marines, captains, military leaders, and so on. &lt;a href=\"Terrorguard\"&gt;Terrorguard&lt;/a&gt;s are close in rank and role to doomguard. &lt;a href=\"Felguard\"&gt;Felguard&lt;/a&gt; serve as rank and file soldiers. The most powerful Burning Legion soldiers often carry an emblem of their rank and status within the demon army.\nNumbers.\nThe number of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;s is virtually infinite. Though estimed in the millions they are able to reform in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; again and again. However not all demons are part of the Buring Legion. During the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; gathered at least one million demons. &lt;a href=\"Wendy%20Breezy\"&gt;Wendy Breezy&lt;/a&gt; estimated them to number in the millions.\nStrongholds.\nDemons generally come from hundreds of worlds, but only some are known:\nThe Legion also previously held but lost many locations, such as:\nDemonic buildings range from commandeered local structures to &lt;a href=\"forge%20site\"&gt;forge site&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Structures\"&gt;mobile constructions&lt;/a&gt; rising from summoned meteors. These buildings are militaristic in nature, powered by &lt;a href=\"soul%20engine\"&gt;soul engine&lt;/a&gt;s and defended by &lt;a href=\"Spire%20of%20woe\"&gt;spires of woe&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nCurrent status.\nWith Sargeras imprisoned, Kil'jaeden and Archimonde dead, and some of the nathrezim returning to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, it is likely the surviving lords of the Legion will battle among themselves for supremacy to become Sargeras's successor. Other demon lords may even defect from the Legion and craft their own organizations."}

(See &lt;a href=\"Culling%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Culling the Wild&lt;/a&gt;.)\nWhile one will eventually discover that the Burning Legion is also on the plateaus of &lt;a href=\"Ogri%27la\"&gt;Ogri'la&lt;/a&gt;, the Burning Legion presence at is the only one accessible without a flying mount.\nPart 1: Who was that masked man?\nYou take the mask to &lt;a href=\"O%27Mally%20Zapnabber\"&gt;O'Mally Zapnabber&lt;/a&gt;, a gnome in &lt;a href=\"Ruuan%20Weald\"&gt;Ruuan Weald&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href=\"Damaged%20Mask\"&gt;Damaged Mask&lt;/a&gt;) O'Mally manages to fix it, and tells you it is a\n&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; communication device, and suggests you take it to\n&lt;a href=\"Wildlord%20Antelarion\"&gt;Wildlord Antelarion&lt;/a&gt;. (&lt;a href=\"Mystery%20Mask\"&gt;Mystery Mask&lt;/a&gt;)\nThe Wildlord recognizes it as a ! With this, you could sow chaos in ! He asks you to infiltrate the camp, get to the communicator, and see what you can convince the demon on the far end of. Say, a revolt or something... {&lt;a href=\"Felsworn%20Gas%20Mask\"&gt;Felsworn Gas Mask&lt;/a&gt;)\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Communicator\"&gt;Legion Communicator&lt;/a&gt; in , you talk to *something* on the other end. (Isn't it great that your face is hidden by the mask?) Fortunately, the demon on the other end is distracted by your tale of revolt. So guess what? You get to slaughter indiscriminately, and on their own orders! (&lt;a href=\"Deceive%20thy%20Enemy\"&gt;Deceive thy Enemy&lt;/a&gt;)\nYou \"put down the revolt\" and get back to the demonic answering service. Only then does it occur to them that they HAD someone here who should be doing the talking: &lt;a href=\"Doomcryer\"&gt;Doomcryer&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Doomcryer\"&gt;Doomcryer&lt;/a&gt; did nothing to stop the \"revolt\" (a true statement), and had a history of undermining authority, they want her done in. And guess who gets to do it! She has a security system, though, that requires 5 keys being turned, one for each Legion Obelisk. Do that, and she gets summoned.\nYou collect the keys, summon Doomcryer, and (between you and your allies) defeat her.\nYou return to &lt;a href=\"Wildlord%20Antelarion\"&gt;Wildlord Antelarion&lt;/a&gt; to report your success.\nPart 2: Death's Door.\nThe reward for a job well done is another job, of course. Forge Camp: Anger was a threat, yes. But a bigger threat is the legion camp at &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Door\"&gt;Death's Door&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wildlord sends you there with a flare to summon the &lt;a href=\"Evergrove%20Druid\"&gt;Evergrove Druid&lt;/a&gt;, the Cenarion agent on site. (&lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Door\"&gt;Death's Door&lt;/a&gt;)\nThe Evergrove Druid is quite happy to see you, as the situation is getting out of control. You need to destroy the two warp gates that are bringing more of the Burning Legion through. But to do that, you first have to grab some of their ammunition. (&lt;a href=\"Harvesting%20the%20Fel%20Ammunition\"&gt;Harvesting the Fel Ammunition&lt;/a&gt;)\nThe Evergrove Druid is able to enchant the ammunition (by \"Naturalizing\" it, potent against unnatural forces) and sends you and the &lt;a href=\"Naturalized%20%20Ammunition\"&gt;Naturalized Ammunition&lt;/a&gt; to take control of the camp's Fel Cannons to destroy the gates.\nIt takes a few shots from each cannon to destroy each gate. While you were at it, the gates started spewing kamikazi imps, and turn the cannon on them as well.\nTwo demolished gates (and a lot of fun) later, you report back to the druid. (&lt;a href=\"Fire%20At%20Will%21\"&gt;Fire At Will!&lt;/a&gt;)\nYou've destroyed the gates, but the person who maintained the portal ritual is still around: &lt;a href=\"Baelmon%20the%20Hound-Master\"&gt;Baelmon the Hound-Master&lt;/a&gt;. The Evergrove Druid recognizes that you won't be able to defeat him alone, so he loans you an &lt;a href=\"Evergrove%20Wand\"&gt;Evergrove Wand&lt;/a&gt;, that will summon allies for the fight.\nYou manage to defeat Baelmon, and return to &lt;a href=\"Wildlord%20Antelarion\"&gt;Wildlord Antelarion&lt;/a&gt; to report success. Oh, and to turn in the &lt;a href=\"Evergrove%20Wand\"&gt;Evergrove Wand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druid%20Signal\"&gt;Druid Signal&lt;/a&gt;.\nCongratulations! You've a hero of Evergrove!\n... and are rewarded accordingly.

But the Alliance\u00a0\u2013 not to mention some friendly &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and certain members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\u00a0\u2013 will not allow them to succeed.\nHistory.\nAs part of the northern &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountain Range&lt;/a&gt;, this valley was presumably similar to it a long time ago, and it used to be controlled by the human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, more particularly by the ancestors of the human &lt;a href=\"Morgan\"&gt;Morgan&lt;/a&gt;. Some 200 years before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; opened, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; earned the region its present name in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarves had established their new home there after their clan was exiled from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. They practiced sorcery that eventually destroyed them and the entire northern extent of the mountain range. In an effort to summon elemental minions to aid his people in a war with the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; inadvertently awoke Firelord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, who was previously banished by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. The Firelord's arrival melted several mountains in this range and forged a great volcano in the blast's epicenter. The landscape has remained scarred ever since.\nAfter the destruction, the land north of the Blackrock mountain ridge came to be known as the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, and to the south the Burning Steppes.\nOrcs came there during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, maintaining settlements around and within the volcano, the climate being something of their liking. After the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; conquered Blackrock Spire, they used it as a base of operations until the late days of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; invaded the Burning Steppes and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;besieged Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; slew the human hero &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; by the foot of the volcano near the war's end, though Lothar's death turned the tide and spurred the Alliance on to crush the failing Horde.\nThe orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; later returned to the region.\nThe area was &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20Invasion\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; twice by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the years leading to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, with the undead amassing mostly in the western and eastern parts of the area.\nGetting there.\nThe area can be reached from &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, through the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;; a passage from &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and a highway leading from the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nLacking the grace and beauty of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;'s peaks, the Burning Steppes' mountains show the force of the energy that twisted them. The very rock melted when the volcano was formed, and lava changed the surrounding areas forever. The Blackrock Mountain is awe-inspiring in its sheer mass and the obvious devastation it's brought, while the rest of the land attempts to recover from the damage done by the summoning of the Firelord, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, in which the mountain was birthed.\nOn the western end of the ridge that divides the steppes from the Searing Gorge sits the impossibly high Blackrock Mountain, an active volcano birthed over 200 years ago. The steppes are mostly under the control of the Black Dragons and their Blackrock orc allies. In the midst of the barren steppes stand the Thorium Brotherhood's town of &lt;a href=\"Chiselgrip\"&gt;Chiselgrip&lt;/a&gt;. To the north lay the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Ruins of Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron clan's old capital city, as well as &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Crest\"&gt;Flame Crest&lt;/a&gt;, a small outpost maintained by the Horde. In the southeast, the Alliance clings to the scarred ruins of the town now known as &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Morgan's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are no instanced dungeons in the Burning Steppes themselves, but the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; zone offers quite a few high-level dungeons.\nQuests.\nThe main storyline deals with halting the orcish Blackrock army amassing in the steppes to storm Redridge. Adventurers start at &lt;a href=\"Flamestar%20Post\"&gt;Flamestar Post&lt;/a&gt; (picking up an optional breadcrumb quest from their major city or in &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;). Eventually, the quests take you to &lt;a href=\"Chiselgrip\"&gt;Chiselgrip&lt;/a&gt; and further east.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Burning Steppes is a shattered region located between &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; home of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. The only accessible passage between them is through the foul &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; volcano and the Burning Steppes. The highway is thus well-traveled, but still dangerous. Passing over rugged foothills and mountains, the road is frequented by enough travelers to be safe, but beasts will sense when you leave the road and pounce on you instantly.\nWhile many use the Burning Steppes as a thoroughfare, it is populated by one of the few successful &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish settlements in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. These orcs do not honor &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s truce with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, instead following the barbaric practices of the orcs from before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. Yet, one cannot blame their hatred of the Alliance, as &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; parties hunt them frequently. If you delve deeper into the region, you can find &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s and the vicious dwarves the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany people in Khaz Modan and Stormwind will pay adventurers to hunt the monsters in the hills, either for pelts, meat or to protect the road. Those braver or stupider may even explore the depths of Blackrock Spire.\nThis rugged region is full of craggy foothills, scattered boulders, and wide-open ashy plains. Rivers of lava rive a charred earth landscape. Smoke from the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; constantly hangs in the air, staining the sky a red hue. &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; stands proud and defiant in the mountains as an orc stronghold from the Second War. Black dragons and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists under Nefarian hold the spire's upper levels, while hostile &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; dwell in the depths. The Molten Span, a massive stone edifice in the north, bridges a river of fire and leads to Khaz Modan. The surrounding countryside is home to Blackrock orcs and Fire-Gut ogres, all brutal castoffs from the Second War.\nHistory.\nThese steppes were formerly part of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; before the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; came here after their exile. They established a colony called &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurisan&lt;/a&gt;, but were not smart enough to keep it safe. Their &lt;a href=\"thane\"&gt;thane&lt;/a&gt;, a mad sorcerer known as &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurisan&lt;/a&gt;, summoned the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; to aid them in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;war against&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros' arrival melted several mountains in this range and forged a great volcano known as &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; in the blast's epicenter. Tales circulate of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; living as puppets to Ragnaros, who dwells under the volcano.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s also came here after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and maintain settlements around and within the volcano, the climate being to their liking as it seems. The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; conquered Blackrock Spire and used it as a base of operations during the campaign against &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in the Second War. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Warchief Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; slew the human hero &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; by the foot of the volcano at the war's end, though Lothar's death turned the tide and spurred the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on to crush the failing Horde.\nPeople and culture.\nThe casual (and lucky) traveler between Khaz Modan and Azeroth is unlikely to see any of the Burning Steppes' inhabitants. Still, orcs maintain a lasting settlement around the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire%20Foothills\"&gt;Blackrock Spire Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, staying hidden from the road but always keeping watch for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; attacks. These orcs are more typical of those during the First and Second wars. Bloodthirsty and savage, they mine the mountains around Blackrock Spire for metals with which to make weapons and armor. Some of their &lt;a href=\"Dire%20wolf\"&gt;dire wolves&lt;/a&gt; have seemingly escape and now inhabit the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Elwynn%20Mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt; north of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragons&lt;/a&gt; are elusive, and one who wishes to avoid getting torn apart does not approach without considerable firepower. They will attack solitary travelers for the sport of it and consider anyone approaching their &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;usurped fortress&lt;/a&gt; free game.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Ogg%27ora\"&gt;Chief Ogg'ora&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Firegut\"&gt;Fire-Gut&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s from the south study &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, but their massive bodies still allow them to excel in combat. Give an ogre sorcerer a club and she's still likely to bash out the brains of the strongest dwarven fighter. This violent race is dedicated solely to claiming the Burning Steppes as ogre territory. The Alliance\u00a0\u2013 not to mention the orcs, the Dark Iron dwarves and the dragon folk\u00a0\u2013 will not let this happen, as they refuse to lose the only passage to the north.\nGeography.\nLacking the grace and beauty of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;'s peaks, the Burning Steppes' mountains show the force of the energy that twisted them. The very rock melted when the volcano was formed, and lava changed the surrounding areas forever. The Blackrock Spire is awe-inspiring in its sheer mass and obvious devastation, while the rest of the land visibly attempts to recover from the damage done by the rebirth of the fire elemental king, Ragnaros.\nWith the volcanic activity and lava flow, the weather is in a perpetual state of hot and dry. This is perhaps the most arduous leg of the journey from Khaz Modan to Azeroth.\nNorth of the Burning Steppes is located the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt; and between them, there is the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; volcano. South of the Steppes are the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;."}

The highway is thus well traveled, but still very dangerous. Now virtually abandoned by the Kingdom of Stormwind, the Burning Steppes is controlled by minions of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and agents of the firelord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis rugged region is full of craggy foothills, scattered boulders and warring factions. Rivers of lava dot the landscape, as well as charred earth and burning ruins. The sky is a red hue here, due to sporadic eruptions from Blackrock Mountain. Blackrock Spire, an orc stronghold in the Second War, stands proud and defiant among the mountains. Dark Iron dwarves control the fortress\u2019s deeps, though rumor has it that Ragnaros the Fire Lord still broods in the shadows. Black dragons under Nefarion hold the spire\u2019s upper levels, and the two groups battle constantly for supremacy.

Deeper into the region, ogres, dragons, and the Dark Iron clan of dwarves can be found. With the volcanic activity and lava flow, the weather is perpetually hot and dry.\nThe Burning Steppes are located north of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and south of the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;. It is dominated by &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; in the northwestern area. It is a central location housing the black dragonflight and various creatures. It also has quite a few high-level instances. It is recommended that characters be at least level 55, as the creatures are some of the most powerful in the game.\nThe Blackrock orcs maintain a lasting settlement around the volcano known as Blackrock Stronghold, staying hidden from the road but always keeping watch for Alliance attacks. These orcs are more typical of the type of the First and Second wars rather than the current &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Bloodthirsty and savage, they mine the mountains around Blackrock Spire for metals with which to make weapons and armor.

They established a colony called &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, but their sorcery turned out to be their undoing. Their thane, a mad sorcerer named &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, tried to summon elemental minions to aid him against the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, but instead he summoned the elemental fire lord &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;. Ragnaros\u2019 arrival melted several mountains in this range and forged a great volcano in the blast\u2019s epicenter. Now, the remaining Dark Irons live as puppets to Ragnaros and his fire elementals, who dwells under &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Orcs\"&gt;Orcs&lt;/a&gt; also came here after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and maintain settlements around and within the volcano, the climate being to their liking. The Horde conquered Blackrock Spire and used it as a base of operations during the campaign against Lordaeron in the Second War.

The Blackrock Spire is awe-inspiring in its sheer mass and obvious devastation, while the rest of the land visibly attempts to recover from the damage done by the summoning of the Firelord, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the northwest of the Burning Steppes sits the impossibly high Blackrock Mountain. It is a volcano that is still active over 500 years after its birth at the summoning of Ragnaros. The Burning Steppes are mostly under the control of the Black Dragons and their Blackrock Orc allies. In the midst of the barren Steppes are the Ruins of Thaurissan, the ancient Dark Iron capital that was destroyed in the summoning of Ragnaros. In the southeast, the Alliance has developed the outpost known as &lt;a href=\"Morgan%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Morgan's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;. \nThere are no instanced dungeons in the Burning Steppes themselves; however, &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; to the north houses quite a few high level dungeons. There are no PvP battlegrounds in this zone. Several &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt; can be found here.\nNotable Characters.\nThe Burning Steppes are home to several characters of note. At Morgan's Vigil, &lt;a href=\"Marshal%20Maxwell\"&gt;Marshal Maxwell&lt;/a&gt; seeks aid in locating a high-ranking officer of Stormwind. At Flame Crest, &lt;a href=\"Mathredis%20Firestar\"&gt;Mathredis Firestar&lt;/a&gt; attempts to feed his tainted addiction to magic by offering enchantments in return for powerful arcane components. And at Slither Rock, the vicious &lt;a href=\"Cyrus%20Therepentous\"&gt;Cyrus Therepentous&lt;/a&gt; sends bold adventurers into the Blackrock Depths in search of the essence of fire."}

{"id": "562737", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=562737", "title": "Burning of Quel'Thalas", "text": "The burning of Quel'Thalas was the attack on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; made by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; in order to secure the help of their &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; allies. Initially, the Horde was capable of pushing the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; all the way back to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, where a barrier was erected to halt their advance. The Horde eventually retreated from Quel'Thalas, finding the invasion futile for their purposes, and headed towards &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, giving the elves the opportunity to push back and reclaim their lands.\nBackground.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Battle of Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; broke out and the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; was ignited, the grand commander of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; armies &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; sent a request to &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;, requesting that the elves repay the debt they owed the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; bloodline back in the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;. Being the last descendant of Arathor, only Lothar could make such a request. Believing that the orcs were not a threat to &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, Anasterian only sent a token regiment of elven soldiers. &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;Ranger-Captain&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; would later follow up with a squad of &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, believing that the orcs are a much greater threat than the high elves predict them to be.\nIn truth, &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; had no intention of invading Quel'Thalas. His goal was the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, as he believed that with its fall, the Alliance would fall apart. Before the war broke out, Doomhammer had encountered the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt; that lived nearby, and they bonded over their shared hatred of the Alliance. Doomhammer offered them a place in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but the Amani trolls would not join until their chieftain &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; was freed from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Upon his liberation, the trolls would be more than happy to bolster the Horde's ranks and provide them with their expertise of this unfamiliar land.\nTowards the end of the Battle for Hillsbrad Foothills, Doomhammer personally led a raiding party to Durnholde and &lt;a href=\"Rescue%20of%20Zul%27jin\"&gt;liberated Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;, repeating his offer to the chieftain. Zul'jin initially balked at the proposal, claiming that the Amani trolls would not be slaves for anyone. Doomhammer explained that that was never his intention and that he wanted the trolls and the orcs to be equals in the Horde. Zul'jin was intrigued, but would only accept such an offer if the Horde helped him destroy the kingdom of his nemeses, the high elves of Quel'Thalas.\nThe invasion of Quel'Thalas.\n&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; saw no harm in such a proposal, and began moving his army through the mountains into the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; with the help of the newly-recruited &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; guides, and then into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Upon reaching the borders of the elven kingdom, Doomhammer's casters found themselves weakened: his &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%23Creations%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; and Amani &lt;a href=\"Witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctors&lt;/a&gt; were unable to use their magic inside elven borders. &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; found out that this was because the elves had a magical barrier that dampened their enemies' spellcasting powers, called &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt;, and that the source of this barrier was mystic &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s. Upon destroying enough runestones, the Horde continued its march into Quel'Thalas, using the enslaved &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; to burn elf and tree alike. The dragons took no pleasure in this act and wept tears for every living thing they burned, but given the enslavement of their &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;aspect&lt;/a&gt;, they had no choice but to obey.\n&lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; quickly made his way to &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, where his return invigorated the trolls there. He promised them that the time for revenge had come, and that the elves would surely fall this time around. The &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, with boosted morale, stormed out of their city and joined the Horde, their brutality and numbers never before seen by the elves.\nSoon enough, the combined Horde and Amani forces made their way to the capital, &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;. Before they could properly invade it, the elves erected a barrier that kept all attacks at bay. With the city safely shielded, they could discuss their options. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; quickly assumed control of half of the Alliance army and made his way to Quel'Thalas, while &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, after reuniting with her sister, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General\"&gt;Ranger-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her second-in-command, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, made for Silvermoon to urge &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; to pledge his forces to the Alliance; he needed little convincing in light of the Amani trolls' resurgent attacks. In the meantime, Doomhammer had begun a full-on siege of the city, attempting to break the magical barrier with whatever weapons he had at his disposal.\nAs &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt; was burning because of the Horde's actions, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; tried to suppress the fires by summoning a vast storm, which stretched across the entire battlefront and exhausted his entire magic supply. The weather made the fighting soggy and miserable, but only managed to put out the fires for a time, as the red dragons' waves of flame were so hot that under their breath trees blackened in an instant, crumbling to ash despite being soaked minutes before. As the Alliance's forces temporarily retreated, Gul'dan intended to use the power of the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt; to break through Ban'dinoriel's protection. As the Altars were crafted from the elves' own &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, which were originally powered by the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; thought to use that link in reverse, sending his own magic into their power source and either destroying it or wresting it away from them.\nDoomhammer eventually grew disinterested with the siege of Silvermoon, seeing its futility to the Horde, and withdrew the majority of his army, but leaving the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; clans behind to help the Amani with the siege. The Amani trolls refused to break the siege, claiming Doomhammer did not deliver his part of the bargain.\nAt some point after the beginning of the invasion of Quel'Thalas, a small band of orcs broke off from the main invading force and &lt;a href=\"Razing%20of%20Blackwood\"&gt;burned&lt;/a&gt; the human community of &lt;a href=\"Blackwood\"&gt;Blackwood&lt;/a&gt; to the ground, killing all of its inhabitants in spite of the valorous defense marshaled by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Garithos\"&gt;Baron Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. His son &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar&lt;/a&gt; was then among the human &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s who were fighting to defend the high elven homelands, and he blamed the Thalassian people for his family's death.\nAftermath.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde's&lt;/a&gt; failure to break through the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; barrier essentially sealed their failure in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; was quickly fed up with the siege and began marching west, towards &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron's&lt;/a&gt; capital. He was forced to depart with the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani trolls&lt;/a&gt;, who, full of vengeance and on the cusp of victory, refused to break the siege. &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; promised Doomhammer that he would join him in Lordaeron after Silvermoon was destroyed, but that would never come to pass.\nDoomhammer was frustrated by the trolls' stubbornness, he needed their expertise now more than ever. &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; sensed his fear and frustration and used this opportunity to take the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver clan&lt;/a&gt;, on the promise of having found a key to breaking the Silvermoon siege, to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. This was a ruse, as Gul'dan had planned to abandon the Horde long ago and simply seized the opportunity as it presented itself.\nUsing the power of the &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s, Gul'dan and &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; were able to reshape the stones they captured into &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Altars of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, and used the powers of the altars to empower regular &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s to become &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20mage\"&gt;ogre magi&lt;/a&gt;. The ogres' arcane prowess was crucial in the campaign in Quel'Thalas and a welcome boon to the Horde. In addition, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; were finally able to subdue the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; they enslaved, and their true power showed during Quel'Thalas, Doomhammer was eager to test his new weapons on the Alliance, knowing that in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; both forces were evenly matched, he felt the Horde was at an advantage now.\nThe siege of Silvermoon would eventually be lifted when Doomhammer ordered the clans left behind in Quel'Thalas to regroup to besiege &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;. Only the Dragonmaw clan would arrive, informing Doomhammer that Gul'dan and Cho'gall had betrayed him and abandoned the Horde. The Amani trolls would be unable to hold the siege as the elves began to retaliate. After several costly battles, Quel'Thalas would be restored and the Amani forced back into &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Zul'jin himself was cornered and apprehended by &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, but the rangers had hoped to keep him alive and drag him to Silvermoon to answer for his crimes rather than execute him immediately. This proved short-sighted, as an Amani war-band raided the elves' camp and caused enough havoc for their captured leader to flee. &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; would withdraw from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; after the war, accusing them of abandoning Quel'Thalas, a controversial stance among &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; even today."}

You will need both of these items to complete your mission.\nShould you be attacked by any unusually hostile parrots, use your E.C.A.C.!\nDescription.\nI don't mean to scare you, &lt;name&gt;, but the last five &lt;a href=\"Thief\"&gt;thieves&lt;/a&gt; I sent to steal the southsea treasure came back to me in pieces.\nSouth along the coast you'll find &lt;a href=\"Tide%20Razor\"&gt;Tide Razor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;southsea freebooter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;. Nestled in the hold is the payoff - the southsea treasure. On the second level of that ship is the &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;'s den, a place where they train all of their thieves.\nBoard that ship, steal the treasure, and bring it back to me. Use the pirate's den if you need to practice your thievery, but be careful!\nProgress.\nWell, at least you still have all of your body parts. Did you find the treasure?\nCompletion.\nIncredible! Improbable! Simply amazing! You've got talent, &lt;name&gt;. Either that or you're the luckiest &lt;gender&gt; alive!\nHere's your cut of the action. I'm sure you would make better use of this stuff than I could.\nNotes.\nLockpicking.\nThis rogues' quest chain gives rogues an opportunity to increase their lock picking skill. There is a practice room on the first floor down on the ship that has a half dozen &lt;a href=\"Buccaneer%27s%20Strongbox\"&gt;quickly respawning locked boxes&lt;/a&gt; to pick. You can stand and pick in rotation. The boxes have no contents, just allow skill ups. The difficulty goes green around 75, and they yield skill ups less often, but you can keep going to at least 100 if you are at least level 20 and are persistent (your character's lockpicking skill is limited to 5 \u00d7 character level). \nThe boxes are still green at 100, but skill up rarely if at all (a recent WoWHead post claims skill ups to 105, however my attempt past 100 failed to get a skill up in 20 to 30 attempts). There is a much easier way. Down one more floor is the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jewel%20of%20the%20Southsea\"&gt;target chest of the quest&lt;/a&gt;. While you are on this quest this chest can be repeatedly picked for skill ups above 100. Opening the chest spawns , but Polly is safely behind a staircase and does not fly toward you (that was my experience, but if you stand off to the side, you may be too exposed and open to immediate attack.)\nThe chest has no loot and does not drop the &lt;a href=\"Southsea%20Treasure\"&gt;Southsea Treasure&lt;/a&gt;; Polly does. You still need to pick the chest to spawn Polly. Polly is a skull level mob until you use the &lt;a href=\"E.C.A.C.\"&gt;E.C.A.C.&lt;/a&gt;, then Polly becomes a normal mob and can be defeated, and drops the treasure item you need.\nIf you failed to pick up an E.C.A.C. prior to spawning Polly, you typically cannot kill Polly by yourself at the levels for whom the quest is designed, but as long as you stay behind the staircase and Polly does not fly at you, you can hearth out safely, get an E.C.A.C. and return. \nAfter the quest (or before), you can still pick the boxes and the final chest for skill-ups. Alliance characters can also use these boxes and the chest. The chest will not show the gear icon for picking it, instead you will have to click your lock pick icon, then click the chest with the highlighted hand cursor to pick it. \nAlternately, Horde can delay killing Polly and completing the quest to keep picking the final chest just by clicking it. This will make using it for skill-ups less trouble and you will quickly outgrow it and be able to complete the quest.\nThistle Tea recipe.\nThe reward item is a cooking recipe that teaches rogues how to brew &lt;a href=\"Thistle%20Tea\"&gt;Thistle Tea&lt;/a&gt;, which is an energy potion for rogues. It works instantly like a potion, and shares potion cooldown. You only have to have &lt;a href=\"cooking\"&gt;cooking&lt;/a&gt; to make it, not &lt;a href=\"alchemy\"&gt;alchemy&lt;/a&gt;, so any rogue can train to use it. This is the only energy potion in the game, and one of a very few energy restorative items. Rogues will want this item, so this quest is a must-do.\nE.C.A.C..\nWhile you are on the quest, Wrenix's Gizmotronic Apparatus will give you as many E.C.A.C.s as you request, but you can carry only one at a time; in effect, it will only give you one at a time. You only need one to do the quest, but if you need a replacement, it is readily available. \nJust before you turn in the quest, you can get another E.C.A.C. to replace the one you used.
