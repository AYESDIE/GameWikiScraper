Many &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s joined willingly, while others were forced.\nPrelude.\nThe roots of the war dated back thirty years in the past, with a promise of a union between the two factions. Orcs of the Mag'har and draenei of &lt;a href=\"Karabor\"&gt;Karabor&lt;/a&gt; would work together to bring the remaining forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; down. Orc and draenei lived and worked alongside each other for years, to the point that Yrel and Grommash refer to each other as old friends. During these times, and decided to bear a child together and had a daughter who they named &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;. Geya'rah fondly remembers this period, referring to them as good times.\nBut eventually the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; arrived, and without any &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s left to fight the draenei became fixated on the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. The naaru ordered them to spread the Light whether the orcs were willing or not. This was all possible thanks to the call of the , who told Yrel to unite Draenor and bring order to the universe. It was this event that led to the war between the two races.\nThe war.\nThroughout the land, many orcs began to call upon the powers of the Light and many joined the draenei's side. 's &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Hellscream\"&gt;own son&lt;/a&gt; would fall in-line to their call. However, there were those who resisted the call and that is when the war officially began. With Yrel at the helm, they would march across Draenor with much of the land slowly falling to their side. The orcs who did not join their cause were killed on the spot.\nAt some point, Durotan fell in battle and his mate, Draka, took command of a garrison in .\nWith many seeing where the war was going, the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s themselves embraced the Light, with a descendant of of the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%20clan\"&gt;Kor'gall clan&lt;/a&gt; receiving yellow glowing eyes and agreeing to join their cause.\nThe two would find a short stalemate in &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; where the Lightbound refused to attack &lt;a href=\"Hellsreach%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellsreach Citadel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAssistance from the Horde.\nIn the present of the main timeline of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; was able to recover a fragment of the &lt;a href=\"%3AVision%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt;. He reminded &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; that the Mag'har from alternate Draenor had pledged to help the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in their time of need, suggesting that they recruit the Mag'har to bolster their ranks. Sylvanas agreed and sent Eitrigg and an adventurer to the race that knew about time travel, chronomancy, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;.\nEitrigg went to talk with &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Telemancer%20Oculeth\"&gt;Chief Telemancer Oculeth&lt;/a&gt; and asked him if he knew how to reconcile their Azeroth with the alternate Draenor. Disappointed, Oculeth informed the two that much of their knowledge about time magic had been lost with &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s death, but that he might be able to help if Eitrigg and the adventurer were to restore the fragment to its original state. The adventurer spoke to &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, who helped them to do so. With the Vision of Time restored, the adventurer returned to Eitrigg and Oculeth with the artifact, allowing Oculeth to send Eitrigg and the adventurer back to Draenor.\nArrival to an old new world.\nEitrigg and the adventurer arrived in alternate modern &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt;, decades after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of being greeted with respect, the two were stopped by several &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20Outrider\"&gt;Mag'har Outrider&lt;/a&gt;s. Immediately thinking of them as either allies of the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; or of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; due to Eitrigg's green skin, the two are bound and taken to their leader, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo prove their allegiance, Geya'rah asked the two to identify three orc banners of the past; Eitrigg correctly identified them, impressing , the leader of the Mag'har. Grommash then realized that Eitrigg came from the main timeline's Azeroth.\nEitrigg explained his plea to Grommash, but Geya'rah refused due to the Lightbound threat. Instead of refusing as well, Grommash asked Geya'rah to go with the two in order ease her mind.\nOgre uprising.\nTo bring the outsiders to Geya'rah's side, Grommash asked her to go with them and crush an ogre rebellion led by &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%2C%20Greatson%20of%20Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt;. The three rode off to &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Arena\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt;, where an ogre greets them and tells them where to find Korgall, saying that the other ogres don't want any trouble.\nKilling some defectors along the way, they made their way to the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kor%27gall\"&gt;Throne of Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt;, where they found the ogre in his lair. When asked why he started an uprising, Kor'gall explained that he didn't believe that Geya'rah could keep his people safe. When given the choice to stand down, Kor'gall refused and attacked the three with a &lt;a href=\"Lightbound%20Warpriest\"&gt;Lightbound Warpriest&lt;/a&gt; at his side, ultimately resulting in Kor'gall's death.\nWith the enemy down, rushed in to inform the three that the Lightbound under the command of an Exarch were attacking &lt;a href=\"Beastwatch\"&gt;Beastwatch&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lines of Beastwatch.\nThe three immediately rushed to Beastwatch. Along the way, Geya'rah told the two about who the Lightbound were and what happened after the fall of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. The group would find the two forces holding the line against one another. Geya'rah and her companions then charged in and tried to change the tide of the battle, pushing the draenei back for a short time.\nThe place eventually fell when Yrel brought her forces to the heart of the Mag'har, Hellsreach Citadel.\nBattle at Evermorn Hold.\nAlthough they dealt as much damage as they could, no side seems to give any ground. Eventually, a light appeared at &lt;a href=\"Evermorn%20Hold\"&gt;Evermorn Hold&lt;/a&gt;, causing the three to rush there in order to see what was happening. They saw a naaru in the sky who froze the Mag'har on the spot. It is at this point where Exarch Orelis entered the fray. Refusing his order to surrender, Exarch Orelis fought the three and after losing his &lt;a href=\"warframe\"&gt;warframe&lt;/a&gt;, he was killed by their hands. This victory would be short-lived as Yrel came in with her army.\nVictory for the Light.\nYrel sent in all of her armies to bring down Hellscream's Mag'har. As things looked grim for the Mag'har, Hellscream ordered Geya'rah to return to Azeroth with a large chunk of the Mag'har's army. To make sure that Geya'rah's army escapes, they asked Lantresor to bring as many orcs as he could to the front lines and asked the adventurer to use a turret to slow down the forces below. The plan worked, with Geya'rah's army escaping with the adventurer and Eitrigg while Hellscream and Lantresor held the line, refusing to surrender to Yrel and choosing to instead die a glorious death like true orcs. What happened after this is unknown, but Geya'rah swore to rebuild what was once lost and pledged her forces to the Horde.\nAfter the Mag'har arrived on Azeroth, &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt; that also arrived fled into the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"goren\"&gt;goren&lt;/a&gt; into southern &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;."}

For the first time in Azeroth's history, the elements worked together against a common enemy. However the Black Empire, through sheer numbers, would ultimately win the war and enslave the elemental lords and their armies.\nSome time after, the titan &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; would discover Azeroth and, horrified by the presence of the Old Gods, and unwilling to leave the nascent titan to be corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;, the Pantheon vowed to save Azeroth before it was too late.\nThe war.\nUnwilling to take action directly due to their colossal forms and risk of damaging the world-soul, the Pantheon created an enormous army from the crust of Azeroth itself, called the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the Old Gods called forth the Elemental armies into battle. With the Elemental Lords and their minions besetting the titan-forged from all sides, the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s decided to divide and conquer them.\nThough the elementals were defeated, the Keepers knew it was only a matter of time before they reformed, and so Ra used &lt;a href=\"The%20Fist%20of%20Ra-den\"&gt;The Fist of Ra-den&lt;/a&gt; to forge the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, a prison to which he would bind all the elementals they defeated. The titan-forged then decided to focus on the monstrous Old Gods. &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, however, was more powerful than they had expected and, concerned that the Old God would overwhelm their servants, the titans decided to take direct action. &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; reached out and violently tore Y'Shaarj from the crust of the world. Though Y'Shaarj was dead, the titans had discovered that the Old God had buried himself too deeply into Azeroth, as they beheld the life energies of the world-soul erupting from the newly created scar within Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; thus suggested to try and imprison them, rather than risk damaging Azeroth further. &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was the first Old God to be locked up deep beneath the earth, followed by &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt; who was imprisoned near what would later become &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;. The cunning &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; however, the most powerful of the remaining Old Gods, unleashed the mighty &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi generals, whose mere appearance whipped the remnant Black Empire forces into a frenzy, upon their enemies. Odyn commanded Loken to use a spell to trick the Black Empire armies into seeing one another, and even Yogg-Saron, as their enemy. With the Black Empire warring against itself, the titan-forged were able to pierce through the confused mass and imprison Yogg-Saron in the far north of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, near what would later become &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nWith the Black Empire defeated, a tentative peace settled on Azeroth. The Keepers would urgently craft magic wards around the gaping wound left behind by &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; to stanch the lifeblood of the nascent titan. Eventually, the seeping energies would calm and settle into a lake of arcane energy that would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhen Aman'thul destroyed Y'Shaarj, its remains fell back on the land that would one day become known as &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. Highkeeper Ra discovered them, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, and sealed them inside the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to study them in order to learn the nature of the Old Gods.\nThe titan-forged races were tasked with shaping &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, while Freya began to seed life. Over time, plants, trees, all sorts of creatures of every kind began to thrive on the primordial continent. As twilight fell on the final day of their labors, the Titans and their followers named the continent &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, \"Land of Eternal Starlight\"."}

{"id": "35947", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=35947", "title": "Remulos", "text": "Keeper Remulos is a &lt;a href=\"keeper%20of%20the%20grove\"&gt;keeper of the grove&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quest%20giver\"&gt;quest giver&lt;/a&gt; located at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Shrine of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. He is one of the sons of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;. In the absence of his father and archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, Remulos served as leader of Moonglade's branch of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; in the years prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. He led the battle against the corrupted green dragon &lt;a href=\"Eranikus%2C%20Tyrant%20of%20the%20Dream\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt; and participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;.\nRemulos is described as being immortal.\nBiography.\nThe Sons of Cenarius.\nRemulos was born the son of &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; and brother of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt;. Remulos was strong and beautiful, while Zaetar was very cunning and slight of build. While both were respected equally, Zaetar never felt as if he could compare to the glory and attention he thought Remulos had, and when Remulos' own children\u2014&lt;a href=\"Celebras\"&gt;Celebras&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt; sisters\u2014were born, a jealous Zaetar set out to outdo his brother. When Zaetar fell in love with &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Princess Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, Remulos knew that their union was cursed and tried to stop his brother, but Zaetar refused to listen.\nThe Idol of Remulos.\nRemulos crafted a druidic &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;idol&lt;/a&gt; given to &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll Bearmantle&lt;/a&gt; which was corrupted by the pit lord &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle for Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The corrupted idol seemed to be a big source of corruption and had noticeable influence in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, although it was finally cleansed by Broll himself and put to custody by Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLike &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, he has produced many children, including &lt;a href=\"Celebras\"&gt;Celebras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cavindra\"&gt;Cavindra&lt;/a&gt; and several other &lt;a href=\"dryads\"&gt;dryads&lt;/a&gt;. He resembles his father, having the lower body of a stag, the upper body of a night elf sporting antlers, and a long wooden talon for one hand. Remulos maintains the Moonglade, the sacred center of all &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic studies. He is also an important member of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, but has found himself increasingly in conflict with the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. Against Staghelm's wishes, Remulos welcomed the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; into the Cenarion Circle and taught them many closely guarded secrets. Remulos also vehemently opposed the creation of a new &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, seeing it as nothing more than a selfish gesture by the night elves eager to reclaim their immortality. As such, tensions between the two remained.\nAfter the spirit of Zaetar was freed, Remulos learned it from the adventurers that Zaetar sent to him. Remulos was relieved to learn that.\nDuring the events of the opening of Ahn'Qiraj, Keeper Remulos opened a portal into the heart of the Dream over Lake Elune'ara, from which Eranikus emerged. Eranikus, still under the control of the Old Gods, demanded the body of Malfurion Stormrage. The mortal champions and allies were asked to defend Keeper Remulos from dozens of &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Phantasm\"&gt;Nightmare Phantasm&lt;/a&gt;s, that had accompanied the fallen green to the mortal plane, until the arrival of High Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind. As the phantasms were defeated, Eranikus landed himself and attacked the son of Cenarius. Eventually, Tyrande arrived with a half-dozen Priestesses of the Moon. Together they channel the powers of Elune in a prayer to redeem the cursed dragon.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s approached Remulos by the advent while saving &lt;a href=\"Crusader%20Bridenbrad\"&gt;Crusader Bridenbrad&lt;/a&gt;. Remulos granted them entry into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar and unrest.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Fandral\"&gt;Fandral&lt;/a&gt; and many other druids came into Moonglade, and Remulos asked Fandral whether the Idol of Remulos has not been used and Fandral responded that not, though it was a lie. At the moment when Ysera was taken by the Nightmare, Remulos mysteriously vanished. He was in the heart of the Nightmare, where he learned the fate of Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt;'s axe, and that the Nightmare Lord is Xavius. Corrupted, he returned to Darnassus and told everything to Malfurion. Eventually, they together ventured into the Nightmare and he turned on Malfurion, because Xavius used him as a pawn to lure Malfurion into a trap. He was eventually defeated and was cleansed of his corruption.\nAfter the War was over, he was one of many who witnessed the marriage of Tyrande and Malfurion.\nSome time later, Remulos refused to allow meeting of &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elerethe%20Renferal\"&gt;Elerethe Renferal&lt;/a&gt; in the Moonglade, as he apparently did not usually get involved in the factions' political affairs, so the meeting had to take place in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was willing to allow a second meeting in Moonglade if the first one went well. However, as the meeting failed due to the Twilight's Hammer, it is unlikely that a second meeting ever occurred.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion learned about a new pact between the Nightmare and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. As Malfurion rushed to Val'sharah, Remulos thanked the adventurer and gifted them with a &lt;a href=\"Grove%20Warden\"&gt;Grove Warden&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nThe Cenarion Circle planned to move the bulk of its forces to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient forest where Cenarius taught Malfurion, in order to combat the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt;, Remulos, and a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;druid hero&lt;/a&gt; opened a portal to the Emerald Dream at the &lt;a href=\"Stormrage%20Barrow%20Dens\"&gt;Stormrage Barrow Dens&lt;/a&gt;, allowing their forces to move swiftly over vast distances. Remulos then led the brief battle against the Nightmare in that section of the Dream, pushing it back.\nIn Val'sharah, Remulos was held captive by rabid &lt;a href=\"wildkin\"&gt;wildkin&lt;/a&gt; before being freed by an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Guviena%20Bladesong\"&gt;Guviena Bladesong&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Remulos and the druids call upon &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. The white stag reveals that his mind has grown clouded. When he sensed the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Shaladrassil\"&gt;Shaladrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Malorne ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare's&lt;/a&gt; source. But when he reached the &lt;a href=\"Rift%20of%20Aln\"&gt;Rift of Aln&lt;/a&gt;, he saw the Nightmare's true strength, that it will fester and grow like a disease until it engulfs all of Azeroth. With Malorne trapped and no longer able to see the way back into the Dream, Remulos resolves to open the sealed portal to the Rift of Aln at the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dreamway\"&gt;Emerald Dreamway&lt;/a&gt; and save his grandfather.\nWithin the Emerald Nightmare, Malorne has become trapped in a &lt;a href=\"Malorne%27s%20Nightmare\"&gt;recreation of his darkest nightmare&lt;/a&gt;: his death at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The druids enter the Nightmare and help the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;s to fight off the demons, culminating in aiding Malorne against a figment of Archimonde himself. After being freed from the Nightmare, Malorne travels to the &lt;a href=\"Dreamgrove\"&gt;Dreamgrove&lt;/a&gt; and grants the grove's Archdruid his blessing and the duty of using Malorne's power to serve and protect the wilds. Afterward, Remulos pledges himself to the Archdruid of the Dreamgrove to serve and protect the wilds. \nBattle for Azeroth.\nWhile on an &lt;a href=\"Island%20expedition\"&gt;Island expedition&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Verdant%20Wilds\"&gt;Verdant Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, an adventurer clashed with several &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt; and other unusually aggressive children of Cenarius while searching for &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Bringing a &lt;a href=\"Strangling%20Root\"&gt;Strangling Root&lt;/a&gt; to Remulos, he shared that some keepers of the grove were more fanatic about maintaining the balance of nature than others, attacking mortals on sight due to seeing them as a threat to nature. Remulos apologized that he did not have the influence to keep them from acting aggressively and gave the adventurer some Azerite his &lt;a href=\"fawn\"&gt;fawn&lt;/a&gt;s found for their time.\nIn the RPG.\nRemulos was &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;'s chief advisor and, a thousand years ago, he helped forge the Cenarion Circle by teaching men to become druids. Perhaps the most powerful druid in the world, the other members of the group hold Remulos in great reverence."}

After years of wandering and experimentation, he was able to develop four perfect brews that appealed to each of his other senses. However, the combination of the separate elements into a perfect unifying \"one brew\" that would appeal to all four senses at the same time eluded him. For a lifetime more he wandered on, until, at the end of his long life, he found to secret to binding all of his sensory beers into one master recipe, the \"&lt;a href=\"%3AFour%20Senses%20Brew\"&gt;:Four Senses Brew&lt;/a&gt;\", which was considered the most magnificent discovery of his generation. Sadly, the recipe was lost to time, because Ren Yun's handwriting was pretty much illegible.\nRen Yun made use of several &lt;a href=\"Walking%20Cane\"&gt;walking canes&lt;/a&gt;.

Manipulated by &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; through the possessed corpse of &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, and jealous of the attention given to his brother &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, Renault accepted the offer of the Grand Crusader and led his father into an ambush before murdering him with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs promised, Renault became the Scarlet Commander of the Scarlet Monastery, however, he was later beheaded by Alexandros' vengeful spirit when his brother brought the Ashbringer during their last meeting.\nBiography.\nThe Ashbringer.\nRenault Mograine was the older son of Highlord &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 also known as the Ashbringer because of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt; he wielded against the undead. When the first hint of the &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt; started to spread around &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, he lived in a farmhouse in &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; with his father and brother (his mother, &lt;a href=\"Elena%20Mograine\"&gt;Elena&lt;/a&gt; died due to post-partum complications when his younger brother, &lt;a href=\"Darion\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt;, was born). With Renault, Darion secretly attended their father's meeting with the members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at the inn of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, where they learned about the situation in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the growing number of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and witnessed the purification of what would later become the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. Along with his brother, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; at a relatively young age soon after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Grand Crusader &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; (the mortal form of the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;) had struck a deal with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; (the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; who served as the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; overlord in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;) to kill Alexandros; Dathrohan/Balnazzar would be in a position to take over the Crusade and Kel'Thuzad would be rid of a great threat to his hold in Lordaeron. To that end, Dathrohan recruited young Renault by promising him great power and prestige in his Crusade if he could kill his father.\nUnder the pretext that Darion had been kidnapped by the undead, Renault sent Mograine and his adviser &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; to near the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the primary fortress of the Scourge in Lordaeron \u2014 where they were to be ambushed. Fairbanks fell relatively early on, but Mograine was able to destroy wave after wave of the Scourge attackers. Mograine weakened during the long battle, however, and dropped his sword to the ground; this was the opportunity Renault had waited for. Coming from behind his father, the boy picked up Ashbringer and ran it through Mograine's heart, killing the Highlord and fouling the blade... thus dooming both to the service of Kel'Thuzad.\nAs promised, Renault was promoted to Scarlet Commander and sent to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Monastery&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; as commander of operations. His treachery would not be forgotten, though, by the now-death knight Highlord Mograine. His brother Darion and a small contingent from the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; entered into the necropolis &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the corrupted Highlord, unaware that the elder Mograine's spirit still resided in his weapon. Darion took the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer\"&gt;fouled blade&lt;/a&gt; and traveled to the Scarlet Monastery to see Renault. Renault flew into a rage upon seeing the blade in his brother's hands and began beating Darion. However, Highlord Mograine was to have his revenge...\nChained to the blade, &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer/Scarlet%20Monastery%20Event\"&gt;Alexandros's corrupted spirit&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the chapel and confronted his horrified son for his treachery. Alexandros then lashed out, killing the Scarlet Commander instantly. Thus, as had happened in the reverse, Renault Mograine was killed by his own father, an act of revenge that would not be forgotten by any who witnessed it that day.\nIn World of Warcraft.\n\"The following section was retconned by the comic and no longer refers to the current lore.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Raleigh%20the%20Devout\"&gt;Raleigh the Devout&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; instructs Alliance players to kill Mograine as part of &lt;a href=\"In%20the%20Name%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;In the Name of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Bragor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Bragor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; instructs Horde players to kill him to fulfill &lt;a href=\"Into%20The%20Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Into The Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. However, these attempts to end the Commander's life seem to have failed, as he is in the end slain by his own father's spirit as part of the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer/Scarlet%20Monastery%20Event\"&gt;Corrupted Ashbringer event&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nRenault Mograine can be found as a young boy in Southshore in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, accessible via the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nAlthough long dead, when &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Whitemane\"&gt;High Inquisitor Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; died, her dying words were of him.\nLegion.\nBefore his execution, &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; managed to give one last testimony on &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s last fight with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; against the Scourge and Renault's betrayal. This testimony was later written in the &lt;a href=\"Libram%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Libram of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; to know the truth about the death of Highlord Mograine and the crimes of his son.\nShadowlands.\nAlexandros and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; encounter Renault in a vision at the Scroll of Remembrance in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;. Alexandros comments on how his betrayal haunts him even in death, and wonders if the pain would be best forgotten or better serve as a source of strength.\nQuotes.\nOld Hillsbrad Foothills.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Old Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, you are able to see younger versions of &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;, Renault Mograine, and &lt;a href=\"James%20Vishas\"&gt;Little Jimmy Vishas&lt;/a&gt; playing around and capturing a critter next to them (a frog)."}

As many classes will wish to spend as little time as possible within range of the warrior's attacks, together with &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20Throw\"&gt;Heroic Throw&lt;/a&gt;, this is one of the only ways for a warrior to deal damage to a target once they have left melee range. \nThe damage from Rend will occasionally finish off an opponent who would otherwise have escaped, or even ensure their demise after you have perished. As a DoT, its frequent ticks interrupt attempts at bandaging, and as a &lt;a href=\"bleed\"&gt;bleed&lt;/a&gt; effect, there are very few abilities that can remove it before its time. In PvE, when mobs at low health flee, Rend's ticks and final burst can potentially finish them off, preventing them from aggroing other mobs."}

He was removed with the instance revamp in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"After the Horde was defeated in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Rend Blackhand, son of the first &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt;, brought the remnants of his clan to Blackrock Spire and fought the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; for possession of the stronghold. Rend allied his orcs with &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and the black dragonflight, who routed the dwarves and expelled them from Blackrock's upper reaches.\"\nAbilities.\nStage One: Gyth.\nThe Warchief mounts a deadly chromatic drake and assaults the Blackrock Stadium.\nStage Two: The False Warchief.\nWhen Gyth reaches 25% remaining health, Warchief Rend Blackhand dismounts and joins the fight.\nStrategies.\nThis encounter is pretty simple, once several waves of enemies are taken out (Either 1 Elite chromatic dragonkin and an orc handler or 2 dragonkin; and 3 chromatic whelps) he will come through the gate to face you. It is important to note throughout this fight that a multitude of orcs spawn at the top of the arena. They will remain there until the event is completed.\nThis fight can be done simply: Everyone DPS Gyth (His mount) until Rend falls off, then another Tank keeps Rend busy while everyone finishes Gyth off, from there it is an easy matter of DPSing the crap out of Rend until he falls. 2 warriors, 2 Rogues, 2 mages, a Priest, a Warlock, and 2 of any other class can bring him down without even coming close to any deaths.\nNote that if anyone has the &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Seal of Ascension&lt;/a&gt; (UBRS key), by equipping it and Using it he can summon a giant spectral dragon (&lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz%20the%20Red\"&gt;Vaelastrasz the Red&lt;/a&gt;, whom you will later fight in Blackwing Lair), who will heal everyone for five thousand as well as damage Rend. Nefarius will eventually banish him, however timely use of the UBRS key can ensure victory. Summoning Vaelastrasz when Rend falls off &lt;a href=\"Gyth\"&gt;Gyth&lt;/a&gt; triggers him to attack Rend, while using it any any time beforehand only causes him to heal the raid. The ring is on a 3 minute cooldown, and this is shared with any other raid member who holds a Seal of Ascension. Equipping the ring will also randomly provide a +100 Resistance buff to any school of magic that Gyth uses.\nFor mages, warlocks, hunters, and other classes with (temporary) pets, it is important that you do not put them on aggressive mode, since they might aggro the spectators on top of the ledge with ranged attacks. This is especially important to mages using Mirror Image: since there is no pet bar for the mage to control the images, they will attack the nearest hostile target in range should they still be up after Rend's and Gyth's deaths (namely, the spectators). A mage soloing this event should either DPS Rend and Gyth slowly to ensure the images despawn before the end of the fight, or not cast it at all."}

The orcs here were originally not as powerful as their counterparts to the northwest, but their strength has increased dramatically since &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s return.\nThe Blackrock orcs have since established a firmer hold here with a larger camp, towers, and &lt;a href=\"elite%20mob\"&gt;elite mob&lt;/a&gt;s.

(The tree stump in the screenshot at right is the same one seen in the above shot of the tower.) Flying by and around the east half of the zone after completing the quest caused a reaction of constantly striking an invisible ceiling every two seconds while in the air. Flying through where the interiors of the two buildings were could easily dismount a player and leave them to fall into the crater. While some of the previous fixtures can be seen from a certain distance, as of patch 4.0.6 the situation has been vastly improved.\nPrior to the Cataclysm, a &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Servant%20of%20Azora\"&gt;Captured Servant of Azora&lt;/a&gt; in one of the valley's camps offered specialist &lt;a href=\"tailoring\"&gt;tailoring&lt;/a&gt; supplies to adventurers who could reach him. He seems to have disappeared since then.

Her martial skill was such that she was able to instruct others. She quite happily used violence and murder against non-humans. During a raid, she killed the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Rinn%20Firecaster\"&gt;Rinn Firecaster&lt;/a&gt; and the forsaken &lt;a href=\"Jillian%20Grell\"&gt;Jillian Grell&lt;/a&gt;. Her nephew &lt;a href=\"Stefan\"&gt;Stefan&lt;/a&gt; questioned his aunt's and the Crusade's motives. Eventually, their deaths set a series of events in motion, resulting in the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Barnabas%20Grell\"&gt;Barnabas Grell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reynah%20Firecaster\"&gt;Reynah Firecaster&lt;/a&gt; to the glades, who wanted revenge on her for killing their relatives. Around that time Renee was practicing with Stefan who once again questioned the Crusade's mission. Renee became enraged and overpowered him, but stopped her sword right beside his neck. Her angry expression became a smile and she assured him that their cause is righteous. Moments later, Barnabas and Reynah found her camp and captured Renee. As the two were arguing who will deliver the final blow to her, Stefan and some other members of the crusade paralyzed the blood elf and the forsaken, freed Renee and took the two back to Scarlet camp. Renee eventually learned from them that they came here to avenge the death of their family - Rinn and Jillian. When the two asked why she killed them, she responded that it was the right thing to do as this land belongs to humans. Though they tried to attack the Crusade, The Crusaders managed to kill them, but moments later the forsaken led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; arrived, slaughtering them all, including Stefan, and raising Renee as one of the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, in death, she employs none of these skills and instead became an innkeeper, a profession that cares for others and provides shelter and sustenance to those that need it. This is in line with her stance that the senseless violence and extremes of the Scarlet Crusade only causes more violence, destruction and death. This caused her own demise, and she spends time trying to convince other &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Scarlet%20Zealot\"&gt;Scarlet Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; to turn away from the organization. She has tried many times to do so, and while she expects that she will have to keep trying, she is determined to share her story for as long as it takes.\nRenee could have likely become a commander in the Forsaken military if she wished. But having rejected the violence and death-dealing of the warrior, she chose to deal out life and comfort as an innkeeper.\nShe retold her story to a &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Mountaineer\"&gt;Captured Mountaineer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Scarlet%20Zealot\"&gt;Captured Scarlet Zealot&lt;/a&gt;. After she was done, she told the zealot that she will get him some fresh pumpkin and left.\nQuotes.\nRest your weary bones for a spell.\n&lt;br&gt;"}

It is automatically learned for Discipline and Holy priests.\nRenew is a &lt;a href=\"Heal%20over%20Time\"&gt;Heal over Time&lt;/a&gt; (HoT) spell that heals the target for a reasonable amount over 15 seconds. Multiple priests can place Renew on a single target, and a single priest can place Renew on multiple targets. \nNotes.\nInitially, the healing from Renew ticks every 3 seconds, but &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; will shorten the gap between haste ticks. By hitting 12.5% haste, Renew will gain a 5th tick over its uptime. Crossing this threshold will dramatically increase the healing done by Renew, and is often referred to the \"renew haste softcap\". By hitting 37.5% haste, a 6th tick will be added. It is possible to obtain extra ticks for every 25% of additional haste from that point on, but largely only via stacking multiple temporary haste buffs. Renew's speed, output and efficiency are increased by 25% for each tick added, allowing high-haste periods to transform the spell from a slow and often inefficient heal to a potent and extremely efficient spammable HoT. Renew cannot tick faster than every 1 sec. \nTicks from Renew can crit. The crit for each tick is calculated individually based on the crit levels of the priest at the time the spell was cast.\nAs of \"Dragonflight\", Renew can be applied automatically with the following talents:\nTips.\nRenew is generally one of the most efficient healing options, and has the bonus of being instant cast. Its main down-side is its slow and relatively insubstantial healing. Using Renew pre-emptively or on non-critical targets is a good way to make the most of its efficient healing, as well as insuring them (in a small way) against incoming damage. However, Renew's efficiency and desirability is significantly determined by the priest's &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt;.\nRenew has advantages besides its efficiency. As an instant heal it can be useful in PvP when interrupts would prevent a cast-time heal. It can be cast while running and can be placed on multiple targets very quickly. As an &lt;a href=\"HoT\"&gt;HoT&lt;/a&gt; it is also a useful way of insuring against &lt;a href=\"silence%20effect\"&gt;silence effect&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;s. Renew can be used whenever incoming damage is slow enough to allow for its use, saving mana otherwise spent on more expensive heals. On the downside, as a magical buff, Renew has the disadvantage of being &lt;a href=\"dispel\"&gt;dispel&lt;/a&gt;lable.\nThe concept of putting Renew up on as many targets as possible is known as \"renew blanketing\", which is a very potent form of healing, but also very tough on the manapool."}

His membership in the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League%23In%20Hearthstone\"&gt;League of Explorers&lt;/a&gt; is currently on probation. Reno is quite the dashing adventurer, as he's sure to inform you, but sometimes he gets a little confused about the difference between treasure hunter and archeologist. While his fingers can be a little sticky, Reno's heart is in the right place. He's out to prove that he deserves his place in the League of Explorers. He accompanies the player through the Temple of Orsis, the first wing of the adventure. The first boss encounter, &lt;a href=\"Zinaar\"&gt;Zinaar&lt;/a&gt;, is caused by Reno not being able to resist the temptation of rubbing a magical lamp. Reno claims that he once infiltrated the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; in disguise and that he once snuck through the &lt;a href=\"Lyceum\"&gt;Lyceum&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt; to acquire something. Reno hates snakes.

In this incarnation, he is a legendary &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; card known as ; since Reno's class is based on whatever amazing artifact he has found and is currently using, he takes the role of a mage when wielding a magical \"Gatling wand\". His flavor text reads: \"All his life, Reno Jackson was only a gatling wand away from becoming the greatest and most terrifying mage who ever existed.\"\nDuring the final boss fight against in the \"\" adventure, Reno is revealed to actually be a young &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; named . Reno himself was unaware of this fact, having been delivered to an orphanage as an egg, though he always suspected there was \"something different\" about him due to his love for treasure and magic tricks. After the boss fight, Renogos reverts to his human form and loses all memory of his true identity.

Each level of Renown grants a reward with the associated faction, such as cosmetic equipment, pets, mounts, titles, or unlocking new quest chains.\n\"Shadowlands\".\nRenown as a concept was introduced in \"\", where the four &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s (the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;Kyrian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolords&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20Fae%20Covenant\"&gt;Night Fae&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr&lt;/a&gt;) track their own Renown in single steps up to 40. Initially, players were limited to one covenant, but as the expansion progressed, some restrictions were removed as additional Renown levels were added up to the cap of 80.\nRenown was gained in the form of an &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Renown\"&gt;Emblem of Renown&lt;/a&gt; at a rate of two or three per week during the level-up campaign: two from weekly quests and one from the weekly campaign quest. Alts, or players who were behind the cap, could catch up to the cap much more quickly with additional sources dropping renown, such as callings, PvP, raid bosses, and bonus rewards from campaign quests.\n\"Dragonflight\".\nIn \"\", the Renown system was iterated from the \"Shadowlands\" version. Players were immediately able to join all four of the Major Factions (&lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Iskaara%20Tuskarr\"&gt;Iskaara Tuskarr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt;) concurrently and could work on their Renown in parallel.\nUnlike in Shadowlands, a point of Renown is gained by earning 2,500 points of reputation standing with the associated faction. That reputation comes from weekly and daily quests, in-game events, and other sources.\nAfter reaching the last renown for each faction, the user will be able to continue earning more reputation up to 7,500 for the \"Maximum Renown\" reward. This functions similar to the &lt;a href=\"paragon%20reputation\"&gt;paragon reputation&lt;/a&gt; system."}

It's effectively a reputation, in single steps from 1 to 80.

After that, players will be able to gain two Renown a week going forward.\nFor alts, or for players who have fallen behind and/or switched covenants, additional sources will provide Renown to help catch them up to the cap. Covenant Callings will frequently grant Renown, for instance.\nIn patch 9.1, if players are caught up on Renown, they will only be able to acquire two or three a week.

Rensar was aware of the Legion's return for the lands were threatened by them. Taking up the weapons of old was the direction the druid adventurer would have to take, and the Archdruid would provide with any assistance he could.\nTo obtain the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20Ashamane\"&gt;Fangs of Ashamane&lt;/a&gt;, Rensar directed the druid adventurer to the shrine of the fallen wild god. Taking his signet to &lt;a href=\"Delandros%20Shimmermoon\"&gt;Delandros Shimmermoon&lt;/a&gt; at the shrine, would tell them that help was on the way.\nFinding the &lt;a href=\"Claws%20of%20Ursoc\"&gt;Claws of Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; was no small feat. After the death of the wild god himself during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the druids hid the claws so it would not be used for evil. &lt;a href=\"Lea%20Stonepaw\"&gt;Lea Stonepaw&lt;/a&gt; now led the expedition to find the claws, and Rensar directed the druid adventurer to &lt;a href=\"Tel%27Andu%20Barrow%20Den\"&gt;Tel'Andu Barrow Den&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter successfully obtaining the artifact, Rensar admitted that he had doubts to seeing the druid adventurer having an artifact in their possession. He rarely is proven wrong, but in this scenario he was glad that he was. Rensar directed the druid adventurer to Malfurion to be recognized.\nAfter planting a Lasher Seed, the &lt;a href=\"Malevolent%20Lasher\"&gt;Malevolent Lasher&lt;/a&gt; attempted to retreat but was stopped by the archdruid. Reporting that the situation was dire, Rensar meditated on the matter of taking care of the Nightmare.\nHe was later part of the druids that communed with &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt; beneath Nordrassil.\nRensar was one of the order hall champions who met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;.\nGreathoof provided as much assistance as he could for &lt;a href=\"Thisalee%20Crow\"&gt;Thisalee Crow&lt;/a&gt;'s situation on &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Rensar carried the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; if the player was not a druid, representing the Cenarion Circle."}

They referred to it as their artifact.\nWhen Revil, &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brink%20Spannercrank\"&gt;Brink Spannercrank&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; got to &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, the priest found the cloak. It shielded him from &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic in the tower. When Brink saw Revil wearing the cloak, he hoped the priest would donate it to him. Revil refused, however, and as he was fighting the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Riders\"&gt;Dark Riders&lt;/a&gt;, the cloak granted Revil a blessed vision of their true form and history - cursed human merchants. As they continued searching the tower, Revil and Brink found another room with artifacts. Suddenly a blast from &lt;a href=\"the%20Curator\"&gt;the Curator&lt;/a&gt; knocked Revil, but the cloak protected him from the impact. Brink quickly used an amulet to rewind &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;, sending the Curator, Dark Riders, and the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Watch\"&gt;Night Watch&lt;/a&gt;ers back in time, while the Cloak again worked its magic and protected Revil and Brink from the amulet's spell. Brink again inquired if he should take the cloak to armory, to which Revil agreed, but only after they were done with Karazhan.\nThe two then continued to &lt;a href=\"Opera%20Hall\"&gt;Opera Hall&lt;/a&gt; to find Karlain and &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt; facing twisted visions of Karlain's and &lt;a href=\"Aredhel\"&gt;Aredhel&lt;/a&gt;'s past. Revil proceeded to placed the cloak on Mardigan, and the feral worgen saw the true course of the events in the vision, after which Revil took the cloak back. The group then teleported out of Karazhan, and Revil removed it and handled it to Brink. When the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; asked if he felt corrupted or any effects since he removed it, the priest responded that he felt that a higher purpose was working through him, and that he delivered the cloak where it was intended. As the three parted ways, Brink gave the cloak back to Revil as it was where it was actually intended.\nYears later, Revil came back to Karazhan, now inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and returned the cloak after availing himself of its protection as he hunted the Dark Riders.\nSpeculation.\nThe reason why Revil did not return it to Benedictus or the church but to Karazhan was likely his betrayal as the Twilight Father."}

{"id": "703901", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=703901", "title": "Slixi Boompowder", "text": "Slixi Boompowder is a &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; who invented &lt;a href=\"tossaway\"&gt;tossaway&lt;/a&gt;s, a means of protection from the &lt;a href=\"Uninvited%20Guest\"&gt;Uninvited Guest&lt;/a&gt;, after her husband, the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trade%20prince\"&gt;trade prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Klaxz%20Boompowder\"&gt;Klaxz Boompowder&lt;/a&gt;, fell victim to the creature. She has green eyes and her hair is arranged in ratty teal braids.\nBiography.\nSlixi used to mock Klaxz's search for &lt;a href=\"Galleon%20%28coin%29\"&gt;galleons&lt;/a&gt; until he returned from the &lt;a href=\"South%20Seas\"&gt;South Sea&lt;/a&gt; with six of the legendary coins.\nThe following year, Slixi and Klaxz attended the funeral of the trade prince &lt;a href=\"Rikter%20Hogsnozzle\"&gt;Rikter Hogsnozzle&lt;/a&gt;. She was concerned about the impression she made at the event, telling Klaxz that he'd be sleeping in the bathtub if he embarrassed her by refusing to carry Hogsnozzle's coffin. Unbeknownst to Klaxz, his behavior at the funeral attracted the attention of an invisible creature that would later be called the &lt;a href=\"Uninvited%20Guest\"&gt;Uninvited Guest&lt;/a&gt;, which followed him home and began consuming his thoughts of greed. Over the following days, Klaxz started acting strange by forgiving debts, offering discounts, and giving away his and Slixi's valuables. Slixi suspected another trade prince had arranged for a spell to be put on her husband and sent the &lt;a href=\"bruiser\"&gt;bruiser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bang\"&gt;Bang&lt;/a&gt; and cartel spies on a fact-finding mission. The next day, when Klaxz approached their personal vault, Slixi knocked him out with a frying pan and buried his stash of real galleons in the woods to prevent him from giving them away. Bang returned to Slixi with nothing more concrete than a tale about an invisible creature that fed on souls and could only be seen under a full moon. That night, Slixi became even more furious at Klaxz when he refused to eat and suggested that they should share their food with others instead.\nOver the following days, Klaxz's affliction worsened and Slixi tried to watch him to prevent him from plundering the rest of their items. However, when she turned her back, he managed to slip out to the market to hand away all of their jewelry. Slixi confronted him, but he merely said that he was freeing them from the prison of their greed. Days later, Slixi arrived home to find their house completely empty and Klaxz missing. She subsequently found him wandering on the outskirts of town. After she failed to convince him to return home, he walked off into the sunset, never to be seen by his wife again.\nSlixi returned to the house and, for the first time, felt the Uninvited Guest's presence in the form of an icy sensation moving up her neck. She fled into the moonlit woods to dig up the galleons, now the last thing she owned. As she ran with the coins, she tripped and dropped them, only to subsequently notice that her invisible pursuer had stopped to count them. She collected the closest galleons and backed away past a patch of moonlight until she felt pinpricks moving up her spine and realized her mistake. She tossed the last galleons behind her and caught a glimpse of the Uninvited in the moonlight before running away. She managed to escape, possibly because she no longer had anything the Uninvited could feed on\u2014neither money nor an ounce of greed.\nSlixi settled in a tiny cottage and did what goblins do best. She tinkered and invented something of value: &lt;a href=\"tossaway\"&gt;tossaway&lt;/a&gt;s, painted-gold coins that looked exactly like galleons. As the tale of Klaxz's fate spread, everyone who heard it rushed to the market to buy tossaways from his clever widow. Slixi is apparently still alive; years after the events with Klaxz, an old woman described as having \"ratty teal braids\" just like Slixi's warned a group of children about the Uninvited using a nursery rhyme, and some say that one can hear an old woman's voice recite the rhyme on quiet nights: \"In dark of night and bright of day, / Keep in your hand a tossaway. / Guard your fortune, mind your greed, / Or else the Uninvited Guest will feed.\""}

It comprises of guard towers and searchlights, and there are also plague tanks present as well. &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt; resides and oversees here.\nHistory.\nBefore the town was taken, some of the former human residents of Hillsbrad Fields fled to escape the fighting. Many of the farmers and residents of Hillsbrad fled. Some attempted to venture east to &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. They never made it. Slaughtered before they reached &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Some traveled west into &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, to take refuge on &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon further investigation of the area, it is discovered that the Sludge Fields was built over Hillsbrad Fields after the Forsaken War Machine was able to conquer the area. The humans that stayed to defend the town and survived the onslaught were taken as prisoners of war and were forced by the Forsaken to work the fields under horrible conditions growing mushrooms to be used in toxins. Many human workers began to disappear over time and reports of ghouls moving about the camp began to circulate.\nUnder Warden Stillwater, the former humans of Hillsbrad Fields were being used in experiments for the Forsaken to create a new breed of loyal zombie-like slaves. These experiments weren't limited to just the humans, but other Forsaken as well. The punishment for experimenting on other Forsaken would be \"&lt;a href=\"Forsaken%23True%20death\"&gt;true death&lt;/a&gt;\" which is why Warden Stillwater wanted to do everything in his power to destroy the evidence that the experiments were even performed at the Sludge Fields.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion Invasions&lt;/a&gt;, it was attacked by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s but defended by adventurers.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, untold numbers of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; were raised here and marched against Gilneas. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; champions were sent to an assault to crush Warden Stillwater's seat of power. &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; champions encountered &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; at the Sludge Fields, where he led a Gilnean army against Hillsbrad.\nNotes.\nAfter completing the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Blight%20Upon%20the%20Land\"&gt;A Blight Upon the Land&lt;/a&gt;, Stillwater and his followers, having been killed, now appear on the ground dead along with his creations which have been dead since &lt;a href=\"Burnside%20Must%20Fall\"&gt;Burnside Must Fall&lt;/a&gt;."}

Now they exist as tortured masses of semi-sapient goo. No one knows what their motivations are or if there is any specific ecology behind their existence. They are noted to be native to Kalimdor.\nKnown types.\nThe following is a list of oozes that are called sludges, but it is unclear whether they are considered sludge beasts given the fact that they don't have the tentacles of the sludge beasts. However in \"Battle for Azeroth\", oozes with tentacles are present on &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon Island&lt;/a&gt; and are listed below as well.\nIn the RPG.\nSludges originate from the deep places of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. These strange creatures share an elemental heritage but have been corrupted by the powers of chaos. Now they exist as tortured masses of semi-sapient goo. No one knows where their motivations are or if there is any specific ecology behind their existence. They are most commonly found in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nUntil recently, sludges were only encountered in uncivilized areas. Now, however, sightings of sludges are being reported in the cities of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. They have been seeping up from the wet places of the cities, emerging from civilization's waste to strike unwary victims before sinking into the earth once more. Many strike from surprise that waste is allowed to gather or where stagnant water is allowed to loosen the earth. Whether this new aggression is part of some master plan of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; or other force, the result of being driven from their traditional haunts by some more fearsome creature, a conscious decision on the part of the sludges or an accident is unknown. Sludge minions measure up to 8 feet in diameter while flingers and monstrosities reach up to 16 and 32 feet in diameter, respectively. Sludges attack any creatures they encounter.\nBiology.\nThey have no perceptible shape. It looks like nothing more than a gigantic pile of animated muck. They lash out with pseudopods, attempting to dispatch prey for later digestion. It secretes an enzyme that slows the reflexes of the target. The sludge's entire body is a primitive sensory organ that can ascertain prey by scent and vibration within 60 feet."}

He is a massive &lt;a href=\"biggun\"&gt;biggun&lt;/a&gt; with what appears to be a crude crown and massive grave (possible a &lt;a href=\"Sinstone\"&gt;Sinstone&lt;/a&gt;) on its back, ordered by &lt;a href=\"Denathrius\"&gt;Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; to block the raid from reaching Castle Nathria's upper reaches. Sludgefist can initially be seen napping in the unreachable part of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Council of Blood&lt;/a&gt;'s arena.\nSludgefist is the third-to-last boss in the instance, only available after all other bosses besides the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Legion%20Generals\"&gt;Stone Legion Generals&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt; to be defeated. This boss is a single-phase &lt;a href=\"gear%20check\"&gt;gear check&lt;/a&gt; for the raid's last 2 bosses, requiring relatively little in terms of tactics, but requiring high dps and healing to survive. It also requires careful movement due to the Chain Links.\nAdventure Journal.\n\"Sludgefist was born in the muddy fountain beneath Castle Nathria and now wanders the halls as he awaits orders from Sire Denathrius. His massive footsteps reverberate throughout the castle, announcing his arrival from several rooms away.\"\nStrategy.\nGeneral abilities.\nThis fight requires 2 tanks who need to stand close together to absorb the boss' Giant Fists attacks, which cleave to the nearest target. &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; should be saved for when the boss runs into a pillar and gains a temporary damage-taken debuff, maximizing damage. When to use it is up to the raid, as the boss fight is on a strict timer. Using it on the first pillar ensures that everyone will be alive and have all their cooldowns up. Using it on the last pillar helps the healers deal with the high incoming raid damage from the four Crumbling Foundation stacks.\nAside from the tanks, everyone in the raid needs to deal with the Chain Links. At the start of the fight, as well as roughly every minute afterward, the boss will apply Chain Links which bind together 2 raid members. The ability favors tying players with specific roles together. Ergo, ranged players get chained to other ranged, and melee gets chained to other melee. After a 6-second grace period, the ability comes online. Following this, if either player moves more than 12 yards apart, both players will receive lethal damage and be stunned for 6 seconds. Immuning out of this ability is ill-advised as it will not only kill the other player, but also stun the immune player, causing them to lose 6 seconds of DPS uptime. Split the raid into 2 groups with 1 player having a raid symbol on them to help guide the group and keep them together as they avoid the boss' abilities. For high-mobility classes like &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, it may be advisable to remove abilities like &lt;a href=\"Roll%20%28monk%20ability%29\"&gt;Roll (monk ability)&lt;/a&gt; from your action bar to avoid accidentally using them.\nPlayers will also have to deal with Falling Rubble. Random non-tank players will be targeted Falling Rubble, which causes a 6-yard area of damage under them. Ranged DPS should try to stay out of high-traffic areas to bait the abilities into places people aren't likely to be stepping during the fight.\nFinally, Destructive Stomp will create a large circle around the boss which will kill anyone within. To ensure everyone with chains stays together, people should move out of the ability together as a group directly away from the boss, rather than to the left or right.\nPillars and positioning.\nThe boss arena contains 4 pillars. These pillars are vital to the encounter, since having the boss run into them with his Hateful Gaze will give him a huge temporary damage-taken debuff, which is necessary to completing the fight. The boss will periodically cast Destructive Stomp, causing a huge circle around him that will kill anyone within, as well as destroying any nearby pillars. Due to this, the boss must always be positioned far enough away from the pillars so he does not threaten them, but close enough that the tanks will be able to run to them for the Hateful Gaze.\nWhen the boss reaches 100% energy, he will cast Hateful Gaze, targeting the closest tank, and after 6 seconds, begin charging towards that tank's current position. The boss will keep charging until he hits something, killing anyone in the way. If Sludgefist hits a pillar, he will be stunned for 12 seconds and take additional damage. If he hits a wall, the raid dies to lethal damage from Collapsing Foundation. Consequently, the raid is on a hard time limit to finish the battle before his 5th Hateful Gaze, when there are no pillars and will inevitable hit the wall and collapse the room. Healers should also coordinate healing cooldowns around the destruction of each pillar, since when the boss destroys one, it will cause Destructive Impact, hitting the group with strong physical damage. It will also leave the raid with a stack of Crumbling Foundation, which does stacking physical damage over time and adds up with each pillar. After 2 pillars, Destructive Impact may kill someone in combination with Crumbling Foundation's DOT, so use cooldowns usely.\nThe order in which the raid destroys the pillars typically does not matter too much. Some prefer to go clockwise around the room, while others prefer to destroy the first two pillars at the front of the room, then the other two at the back of the room. The reasoning for the latter choice is the Falling Rubble. Spending more time on one side of the room keeps all the Falling Rubble circles in the side where they will not need to go to at all for the last two pillars, keeping the opposite side completely clean for the second half of the fight.\nOverall, this fight requires strong tanks to survive the Giant Fists strikes and react fast to the Hateful Gazes, high dps to beat the enrage, and strong healing survive the "}

Following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Talithar and his wife, &lt;a href=\"Vyrin%20Swiftwind\"&gt;Vyrin Swiftwind&lt;/a&gt;, became estranged: Talithar opted to heed the teachings of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; in the name of his people's well-being, while Vyrin chose to retain her integrity. Their wedding rings remained in Talithar's possession, who never stopped loving his wife despite their parting; Vyrin, in turn, retained a longing for her husband, though also anger at what he had chosen to do.\nTalithar went on to serve the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, eventually coming to staff the warship \"&lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Fist\"&gt;Warchief's Fist&lt;/a&gt;\". There, he met &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, though the two did not get off to the best start. Talithar was later ordered to guard a captured dwarf from &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Baenan\"&gt;Baenan&lt;/a&gt;, who stumbled upon that Talithar somehow knew Vyrin. Vyrin had eventually moved to &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Lodge\"&gt;Farstrider Lodge&lt;/a&gt; and befriended Baenan and his sister &lt;a href=\"Trialin\"&gt;Trialin&lt;/a&gt;, often speaking about high elf/blood elf relations and her unnamed husband. Baenan spitefully told him that Vyrin hated the blood elves and all they stood for. Enraged, Talithar physically threatened Baenan with a ferocity that astounded even the dwarf, though relented and broke down into tears, throwing the rings at the dwarf's feet and revealing that he was Vyrin's husband.\nLater, Chen returned to break the dwarf out of his captivity, and Talithar did not attempt to intervene. Baenar apologized for what he had said and informed him that Vyrin still misses him dearly. Talithar asked the dwarf to give the rings back to his wife and tell her that he had never stopped loving her. Baenan promised to do so.\nTalithar reappeared to assist Chen and Baenan in their escape from the warship, and was confronted by &lt;a href=\"Karrig\"&gt;Karrig&lt;/a&gt;, furious that Talithar had betrayed his duty. Talithar reiterated his proud loyalty to the Horde, though also said that the Horde does not claim all of it. He detonated all the gunpowder ammunition for the ship's cannons in the munitions hold with his fire-based magic, giving Chen and Baenan a chance to flee in the ensuing chaos. Talithar is presumed dead in the explosion's aftermath.\nBaenan, having survived his ordeal and returned to safety (with the Swiftwinds' rings intact), resolved also to inform Vyrin that her husband died a hero."}

A &lt;a href=\"Hornstrider\"&gt;horned breed&lt;/a&gt; of tallstriders lives on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, mainly found in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost species are to &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, but a few are .\nBackground.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Halga%20Bloodeye\"&gt;Halga Bloodeye&lt;/a&gt;, tallstriders are gamey, flightless birds with thick skulls. Their brains are no larger than an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; woman's knuckle, and they are too dim to get out of the way of moving carts. She suspects that the &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; often intentionally frighten flocks of them into the path of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; caravans just prior to an ambush. A tallstrider's speed on open ground is unrivaled, so predators rely on stealth and pack tactics when hunting them.\nIn the RPG.\nTallstriders are large, flightless birds of prey that look to kill anything they can outrun or overpower. They have a pair of muscular legs, and their vestigial wings flutter as they walk. Their thick hairless necks swing about a head ending in a heavy, sharp beak as they hunts for prey. Renowned for their speed, tallstriders are difficult to shake for those trying to flee them. They resemble 6-foot tall ostriches with strong, thick necks and heavy, sharp beaks. Tallstriders are common in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Young heroes in these regions hunt these beasts in tests of honor and valor. Tales tell of heroes who attempt to tame tallstriders as mounts or beasts of burden, but these tales are typically humorous ones. If it is possible to domesticate the flightless birds, no one has claimed success at the task.\nTallstriders are tenacious pack hunters. A tallstrider\u2019s main mode of attack is with its beak and talons. It will smash its beak down upon a victim with ruthless efficiency. Tallstriders hunt instinctively in packs. Tallstriders attempt to isolate single members of a pack of prey and run them down. When facing stronger prey, they harry a single victim if possible until, after hours of running, the quarry is most likely exhausted and weak. Tallstriders will attack prey - which includes anything larger than a field mouse - on sight, always fighting to the death. They leap at their opponents while slashing with their claws and stabbing with their beak. If hungry, tallstriders will attack until they or their prey are dead."}

The player must travel to the Sylvan Falls and speak to Aviana while mounted on one of the falcosaur mounts (&lt;a href=\"Predatory%20Bloodgazer\"&gt;Predatory Bloodgazer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brilliant%20Direbeak\"&gt;Brilliant Direbeak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Viridian%20Sharptalon\"&gt;Viridian Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Snowfeather%20Hunter\"&gt;Snowfeather Hunter&lt;/a&gt;), which will cause her to accuse the adventurer of murdering her children, ignoring their excuse of trying to control their population as she is a guardian of nature, who knows better about such matters than a mortal. However, upon reflecting on the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to help the falcosaur hatchling and its matriarch, in addition to believing them not to have killed her children out of malice, she will offer them a chance to serve as her vengeance against those who defy her. Exhausting all of Aviana's dialog will enable the faction itself on the character.\nReputation.\nReputation with Talon's Vengeance is gained by killing other players while under the effects of an &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Talon\"&gt;Ivory Talon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ivory%20Feather\"&gt;Ivory Feather&lt;/a&gt;. The player will automatically receive an Ivory Talon upon exhausting Aviana's dialog, but they can buy additional ones from &lt;a href=\"Trinket%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Trinket&lt;/a&gt; in case they somehow lose it, while the Ivory Feather can be purchased from Trinket at Honored reputation.\nWhile under the effects of the Ivory Talon or Feather, the player will become hostile to all other players regardless of faction (similar to the &lt;a href=\"Censer%20of%20Eternal%20Agony\"&gt;Censer of Eternal Agony&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;). Killing an enemy player will award you with a &lt;a href=\"Mark%20of%20Prey\"&gt;Mark of Prey&lt;/a&gt;, which can be consumed to grant 100 reputation with Talon's Vengeance. A total of 420 Marks of Prey will be required to reach Exalted reputation without rep-boosting buffs. The Ivory Talon can only be used in falcosaur or PvP &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt;s, while the Ivory Feather can only be used at &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;, limiting obtaining Marks of Prey to these specific locations.\nUnlike other Broken Isles factions, Talon's Vengeance has no emissary, nor any associated world quests. Additionally, while a &lt;a href=\"Demon%27s%20Soulstone\"&gt;Demon's Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; can be used to increase reputation with every other \"Legion\" faction, you will not receive Talon's Vengeance reputation from them."}

Although a charismatic leader at the beginning, Ikiss has since descended into madness.\nHe now openly proclaims that he is &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; reborn and expects the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; to bow down to him as their ruler.\nHistory.\nIkiss was once a respected sage of the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, but he began to research the truth behind Terokk's downfall, which had been covered up by the Adherents. One day Ikiss sought out the Outcast sage &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt; to receive a scroll from him, one detailing the true history of Terokk and the arakkoa and not the lies from the Adherents, but he was found by Adherent soldiers and captured. Before he was taken, Ikiss ranted and raved to an arakkoa named &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;Viryx&lt;/a&gt; that it was all a lie. \nIkiss was banished by the Adherents and thrown into the pools at the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, mutating him and transforming him into a broken, flightless arakkoa. After his fall, Ikiss became completely obsessed with Terokk and thought himself to be Terokk's reincarnation. For a time he and his followers worshiped &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, whose power was able to dominate the raven god &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually they turned to the &lt;a href=\"Summoned%20Old%20God\"&gt;Summoned Old God&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome years later, Ikiss and the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt; misinterpreted the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;'s summoning as the arrival of their Old God master on the planet. Taking his followers, Ikiss led them to a wing of Auchindoun that they named the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;Sethekk Halls&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Talon King Ikiss was the charismatic spiritual leader of the daring group of arakkoa which left their home in the Terokkar forest in search of a \"promised god.\" He had received dreams of this god as he slept and knew that revelation lay within the crumbling halls of Auchindoun. Ikiss was driven insane by the visions and now declares himself to be Terokk reborn a divine hero from arakkoa myth.\"\nStrategy.\nIkiss has low armor and his &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; attacks are fairly weak and can generally be healed through without any difficulty. He has three abilities that make the fight more than a typical &lt;a href=\"Boss%23Tank%20and%20Spank\"&gt;Tank and Spank&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn a typical battle, your tank will run in and aggro Ikiss, pulling him next to a pillar. Ranged DPS and healers should position themselves near other pillars. Ikiss will soon cast his initial Arcane Bolt volley. Once sufficient threat has been established by the tank, DPS can begin. If possible, dispel polymorphs quickly. Watch for his blink and the AoE animation; as soon as this is seen, all characters must quickly run around a pillar near them, to a location where line of sight on Ikiss is broken. After the very noticeable blast, the tank should immediately move to re-establish aggro if another character has gained it. Another volley and polymorph will soon follow. Repeat until Ikiss is dead.\nMelee classes seem to be most prone to dying in this strategy, as they usually have the farthest to run when Ikiss begins his AoE; if your party includes several (or is otherwise unable to survive long enough to kill Ikiss using the above strategy) Arcane Resistance gear or Arcane Protection consumables may help.\nGenerally, the most difficult part of the Ikiss fight is learning to notice his AoE animation. Once everyone knows what to look for and is able to quickly move to avoid it, the fight becomes trivial. The only difficulty then comes from DPS not waiting until aggro is re-established after the blast, and pulling Ikiss off the tank and dying.\nOther effective strategies include using the stairs to the entrance/exit of the instance to break line of sight, having rogues use &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the AoE blast entirely, and having healers equip PvP trinkets to dispel polymorph or using a &lt;a href=\"Grounding%20Totem\"&gt;Grounding Totem&lt;/a&gt; to avoid it. The volley may only be cast when there is at least one person out of melee range of Ikiss; moving everyone close to him may stop him from casting it, but can also make detecting his blink much more difficult. On the other hand, if entire groups knows well how blink/AoE animation sequence looks like or watches his emotes closely, staying together may actually help people to react on his preparations faster, as they won't have to check where exactly Ikiss blinked this time to decide where to run, because when everyone stay together Ikiss would practically blink to same place he was standing before casting his AOE.\nPicking one pillar in advance for the whole party to hide behind can be very helpful to the healer. Additionally, using a ping-pong strategy each time Ikiss uses his AOE, will make it easier for the tank to re-establish aggro. After running behind a pillar, simply wait for Ikiss to come to you after his AOE (as opposed to running back out into the middle). This strategy works especially well in Heroic mode, since Ikiss will also cast &lt;a href=\"slow\"&gt;slow&lt;/a&gt; on the party.\n\"Paladin Note: If your tank is an Alliance Paladin Tank, using &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Seal of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; after getting initial aggro can help getting aggro after the blinks as it does &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT&lt;/a&gt; Holy damage.\"\nAt all times it is possible to reset this encounter by having your party members run out of his room to the middle of the chamber before his. Arcane Volley can still hit you, but as long as the primary aggro target is out of his room, he will reset.\nAlternate strategy.\nMany groups have trouble getting behind the pillars quickly enough. An easier method for handling the AoE, especially for melee-heavy groups, is to have the tank pull Ikiss to the hallway from which you entered and tank him right outside it, off to one side, in the room before Ikiss's chamber. When he blinks to begin his AoE, the party runs inside the hallway to either side of the doorway, and thus out of line of sight for the AoE. After the cast, Ikiss will run to the tank, and the tank moves him back to one side of the door. (Alternately, the tank can pull him to one side of the hallway, and the party run to either side of the door in the room before Ikiss's chamber. This tactic gives the party a significantly shorter distance to run to get out of Ikiss's range.\n\"Note: The tank must be careful not to pull Ikiss too far into the other room, or it will reset the encounter.\"\nHeroic mode.\nTalon King Ikiss is somewhat more difficult now on Heroic Difficulty because he now will sheep the tank at random. When this happens, it is likely to cause a wipe because he will immediately aggro on the healer. Druid tanks are immune to his polymorph, and thus have a large advantage here. Healers could try to survive (paladin bubble, priest fade).\nHis damage output is about doubled on plate (1600\u20132000 a hit on a decently geared warrior) and all of his abilities have had their damage significantly upped. His arcane volley now hits for between 2000 and 4000 and he uses it fairly often, so it is advisable to bring arcane protection potions and/or two or three pieces of arcane resist gear to counter that. His blink/arcane explosion mechanics are the same \u2014 avoidable by line of sight, provided you have no lag problems. He is still very squishy, so concentrated damage can burn him down rather quickly.\nAnother problem in the fight is his arcane volley, so the healer has to be prepared to keep everyone close to topped off or they may end up dying from one of those. &lt;a href=\"Healthstones\"&gt;Healthstones&lt;/a&gt; and potions are invaluable in this fight at keeping people topped off, but the arcane resist makes it easier.\nAs of 2.1.0, he randomly casts &lt;a href=\"Slow\"&gt;Slow&lt;/a&gt; on the party, which lasts for around 10 seconds; this can be devastating before the arcane explosion. If a priest is healing, it's possible for the priest to mass dispel the group, so they have just enough time to run around the pillars. This can only be pulled off if the group is in the center, and everyone is paying attention to the Raid Warnings put up.\nAnother technique for heroic mode.\nOne technique that has been proven to work involves placement of the two carpets in the hall. As you first enter the hall there is a green carpet at your feet. There is another carpet to your left, between the two pillars.\nIf the tank can keep Ikiss in the center until the blink, the rest of the party should stay on the carpet. Immediately following the blink, the tank should run directly to the other carpet, and the other four should run around the pillar to that same carpet. Do not heal or cast until the tank picks up aggro again. Repeat this procedure, alternating carpets."}

Ikiss is obsessed with the ancient arakkoa king , and has gone as far as to give himself the title of Talon King and claim that he is Terokk reborn.\nHistory.\nIkiss was once a respected sage of the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;, but he began to research the truth behind Terokk's downfall, which had been covered up by the Adherents. One day Ikiss sought out the Outcast sage &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt; to receive a scroll from him, one detailing the true history of Terokk and the arakkoa and not the lies from the Adherents, but he was found by Adherent soldiers and captured. Before he was taken, Ikiss ranted and raved to an arakkoa named &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;Viryx&lt;/a&gt; that it was all a lie.\nIkiss was banished by the Adherents and thrown into the pools at the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, mutating him and transforming him into a broken, flightless arakkoa. After his fall, Ikiss became completely obsessed with Terokk and thought himself to be Terokk's reincarnation. A cult known as the Sethekk grew up around him and the worship of Sethe. In his insanity, Ikiss collected many relics belonging to Terokk, including a heavy bangle he had once worn that had been crafted by his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Lithic\"&gt;Lithic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Sethekk were attempting to summon the great &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt; god from the darkness, in order to bind him to Sethe's will so that he may cast a shadow across the world. Anzu's spirit in the darkness is called upon by the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;, and he orders the death of Ikiss before his cult can succeed in calling his physical body back to Draenor."}

Talonclaw's wielders have fought alongside many guardian animal spirits, also known as &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, to defend the world of Azeroth and its wildlife in particular. Over the millennia, these Ancients have bestowed their blessings on the weapon, imbuing it with a portion of their power.\"\n&lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;, was once saved from &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s by &lt;a href=\"Moren%20Highmountain\"&gt;Moren Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. In thanks, Ohn'ahra infused a portion of her power into Moren's spear, gifting it with magical abilities. Moren carved Ohn'ahra's name into his spear in honor, and his people would take to calling it the Eagle Spear. To commemorate other heroes he encountered, enemies he bested, and events he witnessed, Moren carved their names onto the Eagle Spear. As the spear was passed down to his descendants, they too carried on this tradition. In this way, the spear has become a living history of the Highmountain tribe. Moren's granddaughter, &lt;a href=\"Eruna%20Highmountain\"&gt;Eruna Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, received a blessing on the Eagle Spear from the bear Wild God &lt;a href=\"Ursoc\"&gt;Ursoc&lt;/a&gt; after fighting alongside him against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. The Eagle Spear was used by &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; during the War of the Ancients, and before &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt; succumbed to demonic corruption he blessed it as well. After Huln's life was saved by &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, he promised to carve Jarod's name on it in honor.\nIt is apparent that with the blessings of no less than three Wild Gods, the Eagle Spear also became known as the Spear of the Wild Gods, although nowhere is it stated that this was ever used as an official name.\nAt the final battle for the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Zin-Azshari\"&gt;Zin-Azshari&lt;/a&gt;, Huln grievously wounded a doomlord named &lt;a href=\"Xyburn\"&gt;Xyburn&lt;/a&gt; by taking out the demon's left eye, forever earning himself, his species and the Eagle Spear Xyburn's enmity.\nTwo of Huln's descendants, twin sisters &lt;a href=\"Arien%20Highmountain\"&gt;Arien Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, the Protector of the Mountain who had bestowed the name \"Talonclaw\" to the Eagle Spear, and Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Gardrel%20Highmountain\"&gt;Gardrel Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, led the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to a mountain nearby &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;. On approaching the summit, Arien noticed Talonclaw begin to glow. Holding it up to the sky, all were amazed as a cascade of golden energy poured from the spearhead and took the shape of a great eagle. The twins realized that Ohn'ahra herself had just blessed the site, and the newly sacred area was renamed to \"Talon Peak\". After the Highmountain helped to build &lt;a href=\"Trueshot%20Lodge\"&gt;Trueshot Lodge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Three%20Talon\"&gt;Three Talon&lt;/a&gt; towers, Arien herself eventually joined the organization.\nGenerations later in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Dorro%20Highmountain\"&gt;Dorro Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; lost Talonclaw and his life in battle to a fierce &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;, a magically corrupted monstrosity called &lt;a href=\"Dakarr\"&gt;Dakarr&lt;/a&gt; that had been hunting the tauren.

She was larger than most proto-dragons, with only &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; and a few others being bigger. Talonixa was commanding and cunning, and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; did not trust her.\nHer mate, &lt;a href=\"Zorix\"&gt;Zorix&lt;/a&gt;, was a victim of Galakrond, and Talonixa became the alpha of the proto-dragons and quickly encouraged the other proto-dragons to destroy Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"Not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;. She was noticed to have given &lt;a href=\"Coros\"&gt;Coros&lt;/a&gt;, Malygos's rival, favor as evidenced by her allowing him to hunt with her and Coros appeared to have some sway over her, as evidenced by him convincing her to allow Ysera to speak her belief of peace with Galakrond with the other dragons. Vehemently disagreeing with Ysera upon the idea of peace, Talonixa was able to quickly rally the majority of the proto-dragons to her side.\nThe two would come into conflict when it was discovered that those proto-dragons bitten by the not-living would become like Galakrond. After a moment of hostility Talonixa appeared to agree with Ysera to spare the bitten dragons under the condition that they would be quarantined for the safety of the others. To Ysera's shock Talonixa quickly collapsed the canyon the bitten were directed into which eventually killed all the bitten trapped inside. \nDespite receiving news of Coros's betrayal to and death by Galakrond Talonixa did not hesitate to carry out her planned attack against Galakrond. After hearing Galakrond roar but seeing him not appear caused Talonixa to boast her belief of the great behemoth being too afraid to face her and the rest of the proto-dragons. Before the proto-dragon army engaged their enemy in battle Malygos devised a plan in which the army would fly higher in the air where Galakrond could not fly. Quickly informing Talonixa of his plan Malygos was relieved to note that she was considering it. However, hearing his sigh, Talonixa took it as sign of Malygos's satisfaction of her bowing to his wisdom and engaged Malygos in battle. While &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; and Neltharion were quick to help Malygos, Talonixa was helped by her two lieutenants. Despite Nozdormu encouraging a retreat, Neltharion openly called for Malygos to fight Talonixa and became the new alpha -- an action which enraged Talonixa and brought more of her followers to join her, which caused the trio to flee high into the air.\nHighly arrogant and prideful Talonixa was caught by surprise by an attack by the not-living and did not hesitate to claim Malygos's plan in destroying them as her own, and even attacked him when he tried to protest her claim. Upon Galakrond joining the battle, Talonixa was quick to lead her followers into battle. Becoming consumed with utter madness Talonixa, rather than attempt to flee Galakrond's mist attack, instead flew further into it in order to attack her foe. This ultimately proved to be her undoing as Galakrond bit into her as she turned to flee. Fighting against her inevitable death, Talonixa tried in vain to free herself before Galakrond chomped down and split her in half."}

Together with their king, they would eventually build the refuge city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; to protect the unwanted children of &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt; tore at Terokk's mind and brought him to the brink of insanity, and he resorted to increasingly desperate and brutal methods in his search for a cure. When he began sacrificing his own followers, the talonpriests, hoping to rejuvenate their fading king, sorrowfully sealed him away in the realm of shadows where Anzu had once hidden. Whenever new dissenters and heretics were cast out and cursed into Outcasts, the talonpriests welcomed them into their society. Slowly, the Outcasts grew in number, until their population rivaled that of the high arakkoa.\nBelieving they have been abandoned by the sun, cursed arakkoa prefer to hide in the forests or beneath awnings during daylight hours. Talonpriests take this a step further and never show their faces to the sun, wearing ritual masks that act as a focus for their communes with Anzu.\nAlternate Draenor.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, Talonpriests live among the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; in secret, guarding the rites of the Talon King's return.\nThe remaining talonpriests allied with the Outcasts and summoned the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Terokk\"&gt;Shade of Terokk&lt;/a&gt; into the world. &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest%20Ishaal%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Talonpriest Ishaal&lt;/a&gt; then joined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"follower\"&gt;follower&lt;/a&gt;."}

Alongside &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herrick\"&gt;Herrick&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rellian\"&gt;Rellian&lt;/a&gt;, Talthressar hunted &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the disaster in which &lt;a href=\"Kurdran\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt; was captured, Talthressar played a key role in proposing the construction of &lt;a href=\"Allerian%20Stronghold\"&gt;Allerian Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; and had the location marked. He proclaimed the founding of the keep as a symbol of the alliance between high elves, humans, and dwarves, and to mark the sacrifices of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Grizzik\"&gt;Grizzik&lt;/a&gt; was captured shortly after, as he had been following the expedition. He promised to guide the Alliance into Auchindoun, where Ner'zhul was hiding. There they encountered one of the last &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nemuraan\"&gt;Nemuraan&lt;/a&gt;. Nemuraan assisted Talthressar, Danath, and Rellian by allowing them to use seldom traveled passages, and he invoked the ghosts of dead draenei to assist the Alliance in their ambush against the orcs and their new allies, the Cabal of &lt;a href=\"Vorpil\"&gt;Vorpil&lt;/a&gt;. Talthressar fought valiantly, and helped rescue &lt;a href=\"Kurdran\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt is unknown what happened to him since the events in which Ner'zhul opened the various portals, but Captain &lt;a href=\"Auric%20Sunchaser\"&gt;Auric Sunchaser&lt;/a&gt; now leads Allerian Stronghold. Auric is presumably his successor.\nPersonality.\nTalthressar was a lethal ally, revealing a preference for duty over morality. His was a perspective keen on calculated justice of a more subtle sort. He occasionally disagreed with Danath, and even after an argument, Danath would be unsure if Talthressar's trademark tone was either sarcastic or honest but Danath liked him for it. It was Talthressar's pride and passion which stood out when the time was right. He bore hatred against the Horde due to the attack on Quel'Thalas. Like Alleria, he seeks some matter of closure for all that has transpired. He was also a strong believer in the Alliance and spoke of the combined strength of human, dwarf, and elf."}

Starting from a safe room at the end of a long north-south hallway, adventurers will give the word to Taoshi, who will open the door, consuming the key. A five-minute timer is started and the adventurer is on his or her own to steal from Mogu Treasure Chests, dodge lightning blasts and statues' overhand strikes, while finding switches to open locked doors.\nStage guide.\nStage 1: Speak to Taoshi.\nYou will only have a limited amount of time to gather as much treasure as you can. Speak to Taoshi when you're ready to begin.\nFrom the initial spawn position in the scenario, head north to speak with &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt;, by the door. Feel free to stop with &lt;a href=\"Supplier%20Bao\"&gt;Supplier Bao&lt;/a&gt; for any last-minute repairs or supplies:\nWhen ready, Taoshi will start the event:\nFinal Stage: Reach the Exit.\nGrab as much treasure as you can and reach the exit before the timer expires.\nAll along the path are red &lt;a href=\"Mogu%20Treasure%20Chest\"&gt;Mogu Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt;s along the walls. They have each and may also contain:\nThere are also &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Treasure%20Chest\"&gt;Golden Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt;s which have roughly and possibly:\nFirst room.\nThe door opens into a pathway leading north. There are one-time-use green runes on the ground that provide a run speed boost for a few seconds. Lightning walls occasionally pop up and will slow anyone who steps through them:\nMogu statues will do their typical 90-degree-arc overhand smash:\nAt the north end of the room is a locked door. Immediately to the left of the steps leading up to the locked door is a lever that will open it. Taking any damage will interrupt the cast to flip the lever, so make sure there are no &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Weaver\"&gt;Ashen Weaver&lt;/a&gt;s around, who also have a rooting ability:\nSecond room.\nNorth of the locked door are a number of trap tiles. Use the cloud tiles (or the crates) to jump up to the sides and loot the treasure chests and also to get past the fire/lightning tiles in the room. After that room is an open area that turns right, filled with more trap tiles, red runes, and the occasional &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Arcweaver%20%28Troves%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King%29\"&gt;Zandalari Arcweaver&lt;/a&gt;, who has the following abilities:\nThe second locked door is in this room, and the lever to open it is north of the door.\nThird room.\nAnother trap room leads in to the third area. This room adds &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Watcher%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Stone Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s and a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Sentry\"&gt;Stone Sentry&lt;/a&gt; to the mix.\nThe sleeping Stone Watcher quilen have the following abilities:\nThe patrolling Stone Sentry has the following abilities:\nThe locked door is on the southern path, but the lever to open it is on the stairs leading to the blocked-off door on the northern path.

There are also plenty of locked &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen%27s%20Burial%20Trove\"&gt;Lei Shen's Burial Trove&lt;/a&gt;s, which require a &lt;a href=\"Burial%20Trove%20Key\"&gt;Burial Trove Key&lt;/a&gt; to open.

The True Believer allows cultists to keep abreast of the latest signs of the apocalypse, and whatever else they consider news. The True Believer is encoded with a fiendishly difficult cipher. The only written key to the cipher, is the so-called &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Lexicon\"&gt;Twilight Lexicon&lt;/a&gt;, which is split into three parts, each heavily guarded. The text that has been translated contains only the apocalyptic predictions of fanatical cultists.\nText.\nA (most likely) complete list of True Believer texts:\nFor immediate dissemination to all Twilight's Hammer members.\nThe search for the traitor, Ortell, is progressing at a most satisfactory pace.

Praise to the Twilight\u2019s Hammer!\nState of the Cult, Volume 233\nOpportunity knocks yet again, my brothers and sisters! The Cenarion Circle, a vile cult of nature lovers, now sends agents against us. They want to stop us from summoning red luring stones.

They are devoted to the conquest of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish supremacy, and as such there are very few other races in it. It is the main antagonistic faction of the &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.3.0\"&gt;final&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;story arc&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\". After their &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;defeat&lt;/a&gt; in Orgrimmar, they were led by &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and entered an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Kairoz\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; in order to free Garrosh from custody (or rather buy time in order to transport him to of the past). Many later joined the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; formed by .\nHistory.\nOrigins.\n&lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; has frequently advocated that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; takes what it needs, even if they need to wage war against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to do so. Although Garrosh's disregard for a more diplomatic approach is applauded by many of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, who view his uncompromising attitude in regards to securing his people a future to be inspiring, his warmongering has tested the bonds of the other Horde leaders \u2014 especially when it comes at the expense of the other Horde races. Ever since Garrosh was named &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde's unity has gradually begun to fracture.\nThe True Horde has its very beginnings linked to two incidents: &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s death at the hands of Garrosh, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s subsequent threat of assassination towards the new, barbaric Warchief. Although &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt; managed to hold the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; together and lead it through &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;the Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a number of altercations with his fellow Horde leaders \u2014 including the above-mentioned incidents as well as an argument with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; over her use of the &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 bred tension amongst the Horde ranks. After the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh turned his attention towards claiming total dominion of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; for the Horde and towards demoralizing the Alliance. He chose to use a &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt;, an invention of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; who served under &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, to obliterate &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. The march on Theramore was fraught with the Horde leaders discussing their skepticism of Garrosh's harsh and brutal methods, which the Warchief responded by accusing them of approaching treason. Those within the Horde who expressed disapproval of Garrosh's leadership were met with assassination or violence by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Garrosh's bodyguard, &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;. The destruction of Theramore, long considered semi-neutral territory, horrified &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and Vol'jin. The attack had the opposite effect Garrosh had hoped for, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; devoted themselves completely to war with the Horde.\nLater on during the Horde's campaign across the newly revealed continent of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh showed increasing signs of megalomania and recklessness. His particular fascination with using the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; flesh-shaping techniques to create monstrous super soldiers proved to be the last straw for Vol'jin, who denounced Garrosh's intentions and was subsequently forced to fake his death after an assassination attempt by one of Garrosh's loyalists. Garrosh took the opportunity to move against the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; and place it under strict martial law to oppress the trolls and to prevent an uprising. Vol'jin returned from hiding and with help from &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, pushed the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; out of the Echo Isles. At this point, Vol'jin declared open rebellion against the brutal dictator, though much of this internal strife became of decreased importance when the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt; began his own campaign of conquest once again.\nAfter the Thunder King's death, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; began in earnest and many dissatisfied Horde leaders joined it. and Alliance adventurers also covertly aided the Darkspear Rebellion to further weaken Garrosh's forces for the Alliance's planned assault on &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Due to their combined efforts, the Darkspear Rebellion managed to wrest control of &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; from Garrosh's Kor'kron. The True Horde made preparations of their own and secretly started hatching &lt;a href=\"proto-drake\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt; eggs, proliferating weapons, and dealing with &lt;a href=\"dark%20shaman\"&gt;dark shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism. All evidence found by Vol'jin's spies pointed to Garrosh planning some sort of invasion and also searching for some sort of artifact in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen even &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; joined the Darkspear Rebellion due to Garrosh's refusal to pay them for excavating the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh re-organized his orc forces into the True Horde and began the final phase of his plans.\nGarrosh and his forces later went to the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. At the Vale, Garrosh fought &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; and used the energy of the Vale's pools to revive the Old God's heart. Once the revitalized Heart of Y'Shaarj was his to utilize, Garrosh planned to use it as his ultimate weapon against his enemies.\nWith the power of Y'Shaarj, the True Horde began a genocidal campaign to conquer Azeroth, subjugate all non-orcish life, and brutally crush all who oppose them.\nSome time prior to the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; the True Horde was bolstered by the &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20the%20Klaxxi\"&gt;Paragons of the Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; followers, due to Garrosh reviving the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt; and following the will of their &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; master.\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nWith both the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; preparing to strike at Orgrimmar, the True Horde rallied to defend Orgrimmar by having forces present outside the gates and throughout the city itself. Orgrimmar was placed under martial law and any civilian dissent was met with violence by the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore at some point prior to the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the True Horde under orders of Warchief Hellscream culled nearly every &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; trainer from the city for consorting with demons. With Orgrimmar seemingly secured from all inner threats, the True Horde prepared themselves for battle against the joint Alliance and Horde (the latter under the name 'Darkspear Rebellion') attack. However, despite their best efforts the True Horde suffered heavy casualties and lost many of its leaders; such as &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;General Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Helix Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt;, and their &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; forces \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Paragons%20of%20the%20Klaxxi\"&gt;Paragons&lt;/a&gt; included. Ultimately, the True Horde was defeated, and &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was captured and given to &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; custody so that he could be put on trial in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the True Horde suffered a major defeat, members of the organization such as &lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; and her remaining &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; were able to escape.\nThe Untamed Valley.\nWhile the True Horde was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, remnants of the True Horde were still at large such as &lt;a href=\"Mashok\"&gt;Mashok&lt;/a&gt; and his group of Kor'kron Dark Shaman, who sought to use the elements of Pandaria to strike at the Alliance and Horde. However Mashok and his forces eventually engaged &lt;a href=\"Lyalia\"&gt;Lyalia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, and a group of &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; in battle, and most of them would be slain. Mashok, however, was spared in the interests of justice and was taken into the custody of the Alliance at &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt;.\nWar Crimes.\nMeanwhile with Garrosh remanded at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; and being put on trial, Zaela would serve as the leader of the free True Horde remnants, of whom her Dragonmaw clan consisted the bulk of and were in hiding within the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. While licking their wounds, a message from a &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; would send Zaela to recruit others loyal to the True Horde such as the orc &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; and the blood elf &lt;a href=\"Thalen%20Songweaver\"&gt;Thalen Songweaver&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after, Zaela and her forces launched an attack on &lt;a href=\"Westguard%20Keep\"&gt;Westguard Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where they freed the goblin &lt;a href=\"Harrowmeiser\"&gt;Harrowmeiser&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently hired the services of the &lt;a href=\"Northsea%20Freebooters\"&gt;Northsea Freebooters&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder Zaela's commands, the True Horde and their pirate allies journeyed to Pandaria with the goal of causing a distraction to last long enough for &lt;a href=\"Kairozdormu\"&gt;Kairoz&lt;/a&gt; to free Garrosh and escape. At some point prior to the attack on the Temple, Zaela had allied her forces with the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who aided in the attack on the temple; during which Thalen dropped &lt;a href=\"Mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana grenades&lt;/a&gt; across the battlefield while Harrowmeiser piloted &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Lug\"&gt;the zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; carrying Shokia. When Zaela discovers that Garrosh was able to escape thanks to Kairoz, she calls for the True Horde to retreat from the battle and abandoned her pirate allies to their fate.\nWarlords of Draenor.\n&lt;a href=\"Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; remained a warlord of the Dragonmaw clan in Blackrock Spire and was joined by the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion force. In the Mountain, they intended to unleash a weapon of mass destruction capable of destroying &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and large swaths of land surrounding Blackrock Mountain.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackfuse%20Company\"&gt;Blackfuse Company&lt;/a&gt; became a main supplier of technology for the Iron Horde, led by &lt;a href=\"Pauli%20Rocketspark\"&gt;Pauli Rocketspark&lt;/a&gt;, who replaced &lt;a href=\"Helix%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Helix Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt; after his death. The company is responsible for the creation of nearly the entirety of the Iron Horde's infrastructure and advanced siege weapons they are using.\nUltimately Zaela, Pauli Rocketspark, and their followers were slain by Alliance and Horde champions during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was also slain by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; during a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;.\nLeadership.\n&lt;a href=\"Mokvar\"&gt;Mokvar&lt;/a&gt; collected money from Orgrimmar's banks.\nOrganization.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the True Horde is almost purely orcish as they believe exclusively in orcish supremacy and the subjugation or annihilation of all 'lesser' races. They're extremely brutal and militaristic, being almost entirely composed of military and are hostile to anyone who's not an orc. Despite this, they have a significant amount of goblins in their ranks, who invent and operate the various war machines of the True Horde. They will always fight to the bitter end, and every soldier is expected to die on the battlefield if they have to \u2014 something they consider to be honorable. In addition, they are completely merciless, willing to execute innocents if they refuse to help them. Furthermore, they show no mercy to their captives. &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Citizen\"&gt;Theramore Citizen&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Headhunter\"&gt;Darkspear Headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s can be found tied to posts and used as target practice for their archers. They also take pleasure in tormenting their captives as caged Theramore citizens would be used to fight to the death and goblins in the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House%20%28Valley%20of%20Strength%29\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; would dance for the orcs' amusement. However, they expressly forbid the use of &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; magic and drinking demon blood, practices that led to the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. By the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, the True Horde has lynched most of the warlocks in Orgrimmar.\nThe True Horde is of the view that they should simply take what they want by force; a view that extends to even the dragonflights. This view also extends to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Shaman\"&gt;Dark Shaman&lt;/a&gt;, an organization from &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt; that Garrosh incorporated into the True Horde to bolster his caster forces. These Dark Shaman dress in warlock-style garb and force the elements to serve them, creating twisted versions of the elements in the forms of ash, smog, slime, and rust. Garrosh wasn't also afraid of using the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; arts to his advantage, and so several &lt;a href=\"arcweaver\"&gt;arcweaver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s were among the ranks of his followers.\nThe True Horde's central power source is the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the last fragment of the deceased Old God. As a result, the True Horde are indirect servants of the Old Gods, and possessing the Heart of one was enough motivation for the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; to join the organization as well. As the oldest and most powerful warriors of the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; empire, the Klaxxi give a significant advantage to the True Horde. With the powers of an Old God at their command, the True Horde could have become nigh unstoppable.\nTechnology.\nDevised by perhaps one the last few remaining goblins in the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Siegecrafter%20Blackfuse\"&gt;Siegecrafter Helix Blackfuse&lt;/a&gt;, the technology of the True Horde is some of the most terrifying to appear on Azeroth. It consists of massive iron siege weapons such as the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Iron Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt;, special &lt;a href=\"bombling\"&gt;crawler mines&lt;/a&gt;, and a weapon of mass destruction known as the &lt;a href=\"iron%20star\"&gt;iron star&lt;/a&gt;; a massive rolling bomb that crushes and burns anything in its path before exploding with enough force to wipe out whole squadrons. The True Horde also uses salvaged technology from the mogu and mantid empires, such as the mogu's &lt;a href=\"terracotta%20warrior\"&gt;terracotta soldiers&lt;/a&gt; or the mantid's sticky bombs."}

Rarely, they can be found as an alternative to a &lt;a href=\"Thorium\"&gt;Thorium&lt;/a&gt; vein.\nAs an ingredient.\nTruesilver Ore is smelted into Truesilver Bars at a &lt;a href=\"forge\"&gt;forge&lt;/a&gt;, requiring a Classic mining skill of 165 or more. Truesilver Ore cannot be prospected.\nBackground.\nFound anywhere silver can be mined, truesilver is also called \"perfect silver\" or \"puresilver.\" Veins of this rare material are almost unknown. When found, truesilver deposits are usually situated deep within an exceptionally dense collection of ordinary silver. The substance can be immediately indentified by its azure color, in striking contrast to the duller ore around it.\nLike &lt;a href=\"lightforge%20iron\"&gt;lightforge iron&lt;/a&gt;, truesilver must be smelted in such a way that all impurities are removed. However, the material is much more forgiving. Still, there are additional difficulties inherent in using truesilver. Once it cools, it solidifies permanently and cannot be re-used. Attempts to reheat it simply turn it into a liquid state similar to that of mercury-and it never solidifies again. Thus, items forged of truesilver must be completed the first time. Thus, while truesilver is the most common of the rare materials, it is the most frustrating to work with. The floors of blacksmith shops across Azeroth are littered with truesilver junk.\nOnce forged, truesilver resembles ordinary silver except for a faint azure sheen. Truesilver possesses an unnatural attunement to the arcane. Weapons made of truesilver have an almost supernatural ability to slip through magical defenses. Armor made of truesilver increase the chances of the wearer casting a successful spell. Truesilver items must be magic; the fluid nature of the metal requires an enchantment of some sort to stabilize it."}

There have been times when I have turned to him rather than going to dictionary.com or other such sites to find definitions.\" \u2014&lt;a href=\"Drokthul\"&gt;Drokthul&lt;/a&gt;\nA memorable end.\nOn May 13th 2007, after a series of postings in the &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; class forums, Tseric posted the following about his job, the challenges he deals with and his relationship with the community. The thread was deleted shortly after. A full archive of all his responses can be found on &lt;a href=\"BlueTracker\"&gt;BlueTracker&lt;/a&gt;. A couple of posts in particular were held to be particularly insightful:\nWhen you can understand how a group of belligerent and angry posters can drive away people from this game with an uncrafted and improvisational campaign of misery and spin-doctoring, then perhaps, you can understand the decisions I make. Until you face mobs of psychology, you will not see my side.\nUntil you see some bright-eyed player coming onto the forums wanting to know what they should spec as this class, and see them shat on and driven away by petty and selfish people who are simply leveraging for game buffs, you will not understand. \nYou will not understand until you have to see it daily, for years...\nUntil you understand that many people will trod over you to get where they're going, or to get what they want.\nUntil you understand that so many people will agree, completely, 100% with a loud, vulgar and assertive individual, not because he is right, but because he is making a stand against \"the Man\"; to take no critical thought in what they say, but simply to hop on board.\nUntil you actually try to acknowledge those who do not speak on the forums, for whatever reason they have, you will not understand.\nIf you think an archaic business formula like \"the customer is always right\" works, you fail to understand customers, not a customer. It is a collective. No one person, even myself, is truly above the whole.\nI simply have the unfortunate quality of being easily singled out.\nCan't help it.\nPosting impassionately, they say you don't care.\nPosting nothing, they say you ignore.\nPosting with passion, you incite trolls.\nPosting fluff, you say nonsense.\nPost with what facts you have, they whittle down with rationale.\nThere is no win.\nThere is only slow degradation.\nTake note. It is the first and only time you'll see someone in my position make that position.\nYou can be me when I'm gone.\nFinal post.\nTseric's last documented post was at 02:30:57 AM PDT on May 13th 2007. His post was in response to a &lt;a href=\"Skinning_a_bear_should_aggro_every_bears\"&gt;Skinning a bear&lt;/a&gt;-like thread, in which the original poster stated the following:\nKilling a Tseric should aggro every Tserics in a 40 yd radius. It makes sense, you are actually killing their best friend.\nTseric's response to this thread, which would become his final post as a CM on the World of Warcraft official forums, was as follows:\nI'm sure you all think you're hilarious in your own space/mind.\nGet off my internet.\nkthx\n&lt;a href=\"Coreiel%20%28employee%29\"&gt;Coreiel&lt;/a&gt; later modified her signature to read:\n\"Flaming a blue should aggro every blues. It makes sense\"\nCoreiel left Blizzard shortly afterwards.\nEyonix's announcement.\nOn May 17th 2007 (the following Thursday), in response to a thread about a new CM job opportunity, &lt;a href=\"Eyonix\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Tseric had indeed moved on to different things. No further information was given:\nTseric is now pursuing other opportunities and we wish him the best in his future endeavors.\nIt is not known exactly when Tseric put in his resignation or if it was planned; however, due to the fact that his final response appeared bitter in nature and was early on a Sunday morning, it is likely that he posted it while outside the office and resigned the following Monday. Some people speculate that Tseric was fired - this rumor likely stems from the fact that the thread about his job challenges was deleted. Either way, many people agree that regardless of who made the decision, it was most likely made in the five day time span between his final post and &lt;a href=\"Eyonix\"&gt;Eyonix&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement.\nCommunity response.\nPlayer response to Tseric's departure was mixed, responses spreading across various internet sites.\nOn &lt;a href=\"WOW%20Insider\"&gt;WOW Insider&lt;/a&gt;, several bloggers defended Tseric as an \"excellent CM\", while others praised him for his \"resolve and strength of character\" and criticized forum posters for \"mercilessly taunting him\". Others believed he was out of line, and could have shown more professionalism.\nOn the official forums, Tseric's departure sparked debate scattered across multiple forum sub-sections (including the General section, class forums, and various realm forums).\nTseric update.\nIn early March of 2008, Drysc entered a thread titled \"If you could ask a CM anything...\" on the General Forum and began answering a wide variety of questions with, seemingly, as high a degree of candor as he felt comfortable with.\nZalud from the realm Moon Guard asked a series of questions the fifth of which simply asked, \"Tseric. Quit or fired?\"\nDrysc, in his response to this particular question responded, \"If I answer you might ask the same thing of me tomorrow.\" Since answering the question more honestly would not, in all probability, have made Drysc likely to decide to quit, one can deduce that Tseric seems to have been fired from Blizzard. Either way, it seems clear that too much discussion over Tseric's departure is taboo.\nJar of ashes.\nAlthough some have speculated that the &lt;a href=\"Jar%20of%20ashes\"&gt;Jar of ashes&lt;/a&gt; hidden away in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; is about Tseric, it was added before Tseric's departure and the \"true\" meaning of the jar is unknown."}

The few who claim to have observed it themselves say the creature is fiercely protective of the terrace.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nThe Night.\nTsulong struggles at Night with the Sha's corrupting influence. Bringing Tsulong's remaining health to zero while at Night permanently destroys the Sha's influence over him. When he reaches 100 energy, he temporarily purges the Sha's influence and radiant sunlight turns Night into Day.\nThe Day.\nDuring the Day, Tsulong gains the upper hand over the Sha corruption. Players may heal and aid Tsulong during the Day, and bringing him to full health while in the Day permanently destroys the Sha's influence over him. When he reaches 100 energy, the Sha corrupts his emotions and Night descends upon the Terrace.\nStrategy.\nThis fight alternates between The Night and The Day (watch his energy bar to predict the transitions). During the night you DPS Tsulong. During the day you heal him. His health flips on each transition so you are making progress toward victory in both phases.\nThe Night.\nTanks keep Tsulong pointed away from the raid and swap off after each Shadow Breath. The tank without aggro should make sure to drop his Dread Shadow stacks in a Sunbeam. If something goes wrong and the tank swap is delayed, the current tank can run through the Sunbeam as long as the Shadow Breath just happened.\nAll DPS and healers should periodically run through the Sunbeam to drop stacks of Dread Shadows; simply stacking in it is inadvisable as it will shrink the longer players stay. A good time to drop stacks is right after a Nightmares spawn. The raid should also be aware of new Sunbeam spawns.\nDPS should focus on Tsulong while healers heal the Dread Shadows damage. All players should avoid Nightmares (purple swirling circles with a red border) when they spawn. Players hit by it can be dispelled with a magic dispel or &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn LFR difficulty, staying in the Sunbeam is possible for the entire phase, as it will not shrink quickly enough to despawn before the next one appears. Make sure to continue avoiding Nightmares while running to a new beam every time it spawns.\nThe Day.\nHealers should stack in front of Tsulong so they can get Bathed in Light. In this phase, most of the healing should be focused towards Tsulong. Dispel Terrorize off of Tsulong as quickly as possible to minimize damage to him.\nTanks will pick up the Embodied Terror whenever it spawns and move it in front of Tsulong about 20 yards away from the healers. When the Embodied Terror dies, a pack of Fright Spawns appears, which must be killed. Positioning these adds in front of Tsulong will get them hit with Sun Breath and help damage them since most of the DPS will be focused on controlling Unstable Sha. &lt;a href=\"Tremor%20Totem\"&gt;Tremor Totem&lt;/a&gt;s are useful to avoid the random fear casts on the raid.\nDPS priority is killing Unstable Sha before they can reach Tsulong. These adds can be slowed, stunned, snared, and knocked back. If no Unstable Sha are available, help the tanks with Embodied Terror and Fright Spawn.\nIn non-LFR difficulty, there will be two Night and two Day phases before he transitions into a third and final Night phase and enrages.\nHeroic Mode.\nDuring the Night phase, new adds called The Dark of Night will periodically spawn. They will simply fixate on the current sunbeam and extinguish it. DPS (primarily AoE and DoTs) should focus on killing these adds before they can reach the sunbeam (the adds can also be knocked back).\nDuring the Day phase, an object called The Light of Day (which can be interacted with) will periodically spawn. When clicked, the player will be buffed with greatly increased healing and mana regeneration (contrary to the tooltip, both buffs are constant over time). Ideally, these buffs should be assigned to healers with available throughput cooldowns for maximum healing on Tsulong.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nExternal links.\n \n "}

In Yalia's youth, he owned his own boat. Due to his status, it was understood that his young daughter Yalia would be married off to the son of another successful fisherman.

Their parents were slain, and Krenna and Gorgonna were &lt;a href=\"Internment%20camp\"&gt;thrown&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeart of War.\nIn the story, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; recalls the events of his first visit to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Being the first Mag'har to set foot on Orgrimmar, many observed him with curiosity and some with awe. He encounters an old soldier from the first war who remembers serving with his father. The retired soldier tells him that he is proud to see a portion of their orcish legacy remain and would gladly serve under him if he could. He tells Garrosh that he will make his people proud.\n&lt;a href=\"Krenna\"&gt;Krenna&lt;/a&gt;, however is not impressed with his lineage, as she sees Grom as the one who instilled the blood curse on her people in the first place. Nor is she impressed with Garrosh for that matter. From Krenna, Garrosh learns the harsh realities the orcs have to contend with. It is very difficult to wrest a living in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Durotar is a desert, making farming impossible. Though the markets overflow, they rely heavily on imports from distant places. Though &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt; would be suitable for their people's needs, Warchief Thrall prohibits them from settling there and any of their lumber caravans sent there are regularly ambushed by &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt; continue to contest their sovereignty over the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and remnants of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; rob &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; unchecked. Causing orcs like Krenna to become bitter and frustrated with her people's leadership.\nGarrosh is enraged by her contemptuous demeanor towards Thrall and Grom and threatens to assault her if she continues her treasonous attitude. Krenna's sister, &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt;, intervenes to stop the fight before it started and urges Krenna to walk away. Krenna reluctantly stands down and walks away, leaving Gorgonna to apologize for her sister. Gorgonna explains to Garrosh that her sister doesn't understand that her people live in Durotar as a way to atone for the crimes their people committed during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. Garrosh is also frustrated with her attitude and counters that their people did what they needed to do in order to survive and even if they did need to atone, why should the children of the orcs who had nothing to do with the war, have to suffer for the sins of their parents? Gorgonna shows him her green skin and explains that her people bear the mark and legacy of her people just the same and that she will atone in whatever way her warchief sees fit. Gorgonna tells Garrosh that he would not understand as he is a Mag'har, and because of this he is free of such a burden.\nGarrosh is shocked that Thrall would ever be that unreasonable. He becomes irritated at Krenna's words and the more Garrosh reflects on them, the more he becomes increasingly frustrated and impatient. Garrosh becomes frustrated with Thrall's lack of action against the Alliance and the Scourge; frustrated with having to divide the orcs' resources and forces to deal with the problems of the other Horde races; frustrated to see the Scourge infect their food supplies with plague and rain death upon them while Thrall refuses to unleash the full might of the Horde. Garrosh is determined to preserve Orgrimmar and restore the orcs' glory by any means necessary, even if he has to force Thrall's hand to do so.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nHer sister, &lt;a href=\"Gorgonna\"&gt;Gorgonna&lt;/a&gt;, attempts to keep the damage caused by Krenna's heavy-handedness and lack of judgment to a minimum. For instance, in &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Clemency\"&gt;Tactical Clemency&lt;/a&gt;, Gorgonna sends the player with a letter to spare &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt;, a captured trapper, from execution. When the troll leatherworker, &lt;a href=\"Hidetrader%20Jun%27ik\"&gt;Hidetrader Jun'ik&lt;/a&gt;, attempts to substitute disguised grizzly hides for &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt; hides (his belief being that there would never be enough worg hide for her troops), Krenna orders his leg broken and Gorgonna, seeking to make it look real, kicks him in the leg to make it look like she broke it.\nThrough a long series of quests you need to do in Conquest Hold, you then get a quest for the Conquest Pit, an arena in the Hold. Eventually, Krenna discovers Gorgonna's actions and challenges her to a duel to the death, along with the player(s) who aided her in the Conquest Pit, as the final quest for the arena. &lt;a href=\"Anthis\"&gt;Anthis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sethyel\"&gt;Sethyel&lt;/a&gt; joined Krenna in her fight, but was still killed by her sister, who became the new leader of the Hold.\nQuotes.\nDo not think for a second that your past accomplishments entitle you to anything, &lt;name&gt;. They don't.\nIf you want my respect you're going to have to earn it. This means following my orders without question and fulfilling them... without exceptions."}

Their main base of operations and biggest settlement is the &lt;a href=\"Stormspire\"&gt;Stormspire&lt;/a&gt;, but they can be found at &lt;a href=\"Midrealm%20Post\"&gt;Midrealm Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aeris%20Landing\"&gt;Aeris Landing&lt;/a&gt;, within the &lt;a href=\"Mana-Tombs\"&gt;Mana-Tombs&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt;, and various other places.\nThey are also allied with another ethereal faction, the &lt;a href=\"Protectorate\"&gt;Protectorate&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Consortium also do business in the &lt;a href=\"Hara%27samid%20Sector\"&gt;Hara'samid Sector&lt;/a&gt;, on &lt;a href=\"Heraazi\"&gt;Heraazi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sodaraami\"&gt;Sodaraami&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Xarodi%20Sector\"&gt;Xarodi Sector&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Consortium%20Arcanist\"&gt;ethereal arcanists&lt;/a&gt; of the Consortium have been hired by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to maintain portals to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Pathfinder%27s%20Den\"&gt;Pathfinder's Den&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wizard%27s%20Sanctum\"&gt;Wizard's Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, respectively in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nThe general process for garnering reputation from the Consortium involves completing one-time quest chains which unlock repeatable quests. Some of these important quest chains are unlocked at specific reputation levels, which can make it somewhat confusing to follow. While it is possible to reach Exalted by using only Mana Tombs dungeon runs, that method is limited by the one-per-day heroic lockout.\nto (level 70+).\nAt level 70, return to Stormspire for &lt;a href=\"Seek%20Out%20Ameer\"&gt;Seek Out Ameer&lt;/a&gt;, then go to Protectorate Watch Post. Complete &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ameer\"&gt;Commander Ameer&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"A%20Mission%20of%20Mercy\"&gt;A Mission of Mercy&lt;/a&gt; there which allows &lt;a href=\"Ethereum%20Prison%20Key\"&gt;Ethereum Prison Key&lt;/a&gt; to drop from enemy Ethereals and opens the &lt;a href=\"Ethereum%20Secrets\"&gt;Ethereum Secrets&lt;/a&gt; repeatable. The Keys can sometimes be found cheaply on the Auction Houses, and opening &lt;a href=\"Ethereum%20Prison\"&gt;Ethereum Prison&lt;/a&gt;s can also net reputation from other Burning Crusade factions.\nAt Revered, Ameer's offers the &lt;a href=\"A%20Thousand%20Worlds\"&gt;A Thousand Worlds&lt;/a&gt; chain which leads to &lt;a href=\"Bash%27ir\"&gt;Bash'ir&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and opens another pair of repeatable reputation quests.\nAt this point, once all once-time quests have been completed, the fastest way to reach Exalted is via repeatable quests. Heroic Mana Tombs can also be cleared for reputation, but since it can be completed only once per day, you could choose to clear the trash only (avoiding bosses) and reset the instance. \nThe \"daily dungeon\" quests from &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Trader%20Zhareem\"&gt;Wind Trader Zhareem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nether-Stalker%20Mah%27duun\"&gt;Nether-Stalker Mah'duun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; provide consortium rep, despite the NPCs not being marked as Consortium members (350 rep for Heroics, 250 for Non-Heroic).\nRewards.\nUpon reaching Friendly status, players are officially considered members of the Consortium and given a salary. The salary is a bag of gems at the beginning of every month, given by &lt;a href=\"Gezhe\"&gt;Gezhe&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Aeris%20Landing\"&gt;Aeris Landing&lt;/a&gt;.
