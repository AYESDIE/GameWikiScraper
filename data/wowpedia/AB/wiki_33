After the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; the world, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s very life essence started bleeding to the surface in the form of an extraordinary material known as &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt;. Both factions recognized its unique properties, but while &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance sought it to heal and protect, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde saw it as a weapon and an opportunity to seize. The war was compounded by the rising tide of power from the forces of the Old Gods that eventually resulted in a massive invasion effort by &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe tensions between the two superpowers rose and led to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, where the Horde destroyed &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Alliance's major capitals. In return, the Alliance launched the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Siege of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the ruination of one of the Horde's major capitals, the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Both factions now seek the destruction of the other in a war spanning the entire world, and recruit &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;new allies&lt;/a&gt; to bolster their depleted ranks. The culminating battle of the war was the &lt;a href=\"battle%20at%20the%20Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;battle at the Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, which ended in a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;; as the former sought to prevent the severe amounts of Horde deaths that would come from a clash. While Saurfang was killed during the battle, Windrunner's outbursts against the Horde led to her abandoning the faction. Following this battle, a de-escalation was called between the Alliance and Horde; though the war has not fully ended. Several battles were still being fought after the confrontation at the gate.\nWhile the Alliance and Horde are the main belligerents in the war, the promise of the Azerite's power has also brought numerous &lt;a href=\"independent\"&gt;independent&lt;/a&gt; powers into the conflict. These include, but are not limited to, the &lt;a href=\"Ashvane%20Trading%20Company\"&gt;Ashvane Trading Company&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods%27%20forces\"&gt;Old Gods' forces&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrelude.\nLegion.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at last made its return, both factions initially worked together, but Varian Wrynn and Vol'jin were killed in action during the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. However the Horde's losses were obstructed from the Alliance's view, so to the latter it appeared as if the former were casually abandoning them. King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and Lady &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, blaming the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for Varian's death, wished to renew hostilities with the Horde. The newly appointed Warchief, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, became a focus of Greymane's aggression.\nMeanwhile, Windrunner sought to strengthen the Horde by scheming of ways to create new &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, so she traveled to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; where the Alliance and Horde forces engaged in battles. Eventually, Sylvanas managed to capture &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt;, but her plans ultimately failed when Genn Greymane tracked her, fought with the Banshee Queen and released Eyir by shattering the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the midst of all of this, the dreadlord Detheroc impersonated Mathias Shaw and used the SI:7 to sow increasing distrust between the two factions, with the intent of causing a conflict between them. This failed, due to the work of the Uncrowned.\nFor the remainder of the war against the Legion, the hostilities between the Horde and Alliance ceased, and the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; even put their hostilities aside in order to aid the &lt;a href=\"nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; to liberate &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the Legion. Following the deaths of and &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; called Alliance and Horde members to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; in order to travel to &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. There the Burning Legion was ultimately defeated, but as the Legion's ruler &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; faced imprisonment at the hands of his &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; brethren, he managed to strike a final blow against Azeroth by stabbing &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;his sword&lt;/a&gt; into the world.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, both the Alliance and Horde converged on the destroyed , spying and thwarting each other's efforts, as well as engaging in skirmishes on the newly uncovered &lt;a href=\"Seething%20Shore\"&gt;Seething Shore&lt;/a&gt; where they fought to control the first &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; nodes and ore.\nBefore the Storm.\nThanks to the efforts of King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; met with the chosen &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; relatives and friends from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The meeting wasn't about bringing peace between the two factions, but it reunited long-stranded persons and brought a cease-fire for one day. As Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and Anduin were aware that their factions are not ready for a war, they agreed to the terms of the Gathering and promised they would not harm the other faction's members. The Gathering, however, ended in disaster. Upon seeing the Forsaken trying to defect to the Alliance and being informed of &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s presence, Sylvanas ordered her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s to kill her people but spare the humans as to not start a war. Sylvanas would personally kill Calia and threaten to kill Anduin for bringing a usurper to cause sedition, as Calia was calling out for the Forsaken to defect. Anduin, however, called Sylvanas' bluff since she was not prepared to face the unrestrained ire of the Alliance, nor did she have the full support of the Horde. Acknowledging Anduin's words Sylvanas left Arathi, and Anduin would later confide his belief of Sylvanas being lost to Genn.\nNew allies.\nAs the Silithus battles raged on, the Alliance and Horde opened new embassies where the leaders of their respective factions discussed how to prepare against the opposite faction. Following the Legion wars, the Alliance and Horde ranks were depleted so they needed to gain new allies. As such, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; recruited the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; elves of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, who already distrusted the night elves, and the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Thanks to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance gained new allies in the &lt;a href=\"Lightforged%20draenei\"&gt;Lightforged draenei&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Grand Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; and the exiled &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; blood elves who became &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nJaina: Reunion.\nAs the Alliance and Horde entered the new conflict, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tirans&lt;/a&gt; learned about it, and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Admiral\"&gt;Lord Admiral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; remained persistent that they will stay neutral and won't rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, impersonating an old woman and hearing the dialogue, resolved to convince them otherwise.\nBeginning of the war.\nBurning of Teldrassil.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;war with the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s navies were diminished. With both factions debilitated in their ability to reinforce &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde came up with a plan to secure Kalimdor and elicit a political crisis in the Alliance that would lead to its downfall. After luring a majority of the night elven forces to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; through misinformation, the Horde would seek to hold &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; hostage and use the political crisis to sow division in the Alliance. Furthermore, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; wanted to kill &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill the kaldorei's spirit and end them as a nation. The invasion of the night elven lands was successful, but &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; had allowed &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; to escape alive. News of Malfurion's survival upset Sylvanas and she felt Darnassus' conquering would not be enough of a fatal wound for the Alliance. Thus, Sylvanas had &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; burned down in order to inflict a painful wound on the Alliance that could give the Horde a chance at victory.\nBattle for Lordaeron.\nThe genocide at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; had rallied the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to seek retribution. The Alliance amassed their armies to take back the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and bring &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; to justice. The &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had managed to evacuate their citizens but division began to erupt between &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and Sylvanas over the Banshee Queen's use of unscrupulous tactics. Despite the Horde's use of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; weapons, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;; the Alliance managed to breach the city and rout the Horde army. The Alliance leadership pursued Sylvanas to the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20chamber\"&gt;imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt; where they demanded her surrender. Sylvanas however, had rigged all of Lordaeron Keep to be blighted and had lured the Alliance leadership into a collapsing imperial chamber as a trap. Although both the Alliance and Horde leadership managed to escape the blast, the Ruins of Lordaeron and the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; became saturated with Blight.\nWar Campaigns.\nGreat Sea, Zandalar and Kul Tiras theaters.\nThe Alliance had managed to capture high-value targets of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalar Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, heir to Zandalar and &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Zul\"&gt;Prophet Zul&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;, who were imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde had learned of the fact and sent a small group of operatives to rescue the prisoners in hopes of establishing diplomatic relations with the increasingly isolated troll nation, which had a powerful navy at its disposal - an invaluable asset for the Horde's dominance over the seas.\nIn response to these developments, the Alliance focused on re-establishing friendly relations with another great naval power, the islander human kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, which was still resentful over Jaina Proudmoore's inaction during the Tirassian &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;Invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt; which led to Grand Admiral &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Daelin Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s death that promptly pushed the Proudmoore Admiralty to withdraw from the bloc.\nIn recognition of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;' contributions to the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"King%20Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; formalized the induction of the Dark Iron dwarves into the Alliance.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to recruit the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Mag'har orc clans&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; saved from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. After Eitrigg and the Horde Speaker helped the Mag'har escape from the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt;, the Mag'har decides to make &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; their new home. Their leader, &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, speaks with Warchief Sylvanas and pledges the Mag'har's loyalty to the Horde.\nBattle of Dazar'alor.\nWith the bulk of &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;'s forces lured into &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance stormed &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; and slew King &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance wished to sever the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s' ties to the Horde and deal a severe blow to the Horde.\nDuring the course of the war, &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; commanded the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; to acquire fallen champions of both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt; personally acquiring bodies from the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; and other Horde lands.\nIsland Expeditions.\nThe Alliance and Horde race to secure the resources and &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; proliferating in unmapped isles in order to fund their faction's war efforts.\nEastern Kingdoms theater.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt; were &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, although some of its forces returned to Stormwind, the Alliance apparently managed to maintain its occupation over most of the immediate surrounding regions in Lordaeron, with most of its army stationed at &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the battle.\nAlthough the Ruins of Lordaeron were abandoned by both factions, and most of the Forsaken population seeming to have fled the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, re-settling in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; or neighboring lands, conflict over the rest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; erupted, with the Alliance waging an active military campaign against the remaining Forsaken settlements scattered throughout the region, their struggle spreading to the nearby regions &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the Fourth War was focused upon.\n&lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, south of Tirisfal Glades, became a major battleground, with Alliance and Horde actively contesting each other's territories throughout the conflict. &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Hayward\"&gt;Deathstalker Hayward&lt;/a&gt; and the Forsaken managed to temporarily conquer &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but they were expelled by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;, who under &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; apparently reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; once again, after which Horde forces created a distraction along the &lt;a href=\"Misty%20Shore\"&gt;Misty Shore&lt;/a&gt; to distract them long enough for Horde refugees to escape Tirisfal towards Forsaken-controlled lands in Silverpine across the water. The Horde sent &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Hadrec\"&gt;High Executor Hadrec&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher\"&gt;Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to break the Alliance's occupation over &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, and the Alliance retaliated, sending &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20MacDonnell\"&gt;High Priestess MacDonnell&lt;/a&gt;, formerly located in their Western Plaguelands base, to lead forces against the Sepulcher in turn. &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tobias%20Zaren\"&gt;Captain Tobias Zaren&lt;/a&gt;, assisted by the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;, surrounded &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, now captured by the Forsaken, trying to assassinate &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Plaguebringer%20Harris\"&gt;Chief Plaguebringer Harris&lt;/a&gt;, who had developed and begun to unleash his newest bio-weapon against Zaren's forces.\nAlthough most of the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; seems to have remained out of the Fourth War, with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; remaining neutral, an army under &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ashlam%20Valorfist\"&gt;Commander Ashlam Valorfist&lt;/a&gt; was sent from the region to attack Horde settlements in the Hillsbrad Foothills, only to be counter-attacked from the shadows by &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Clea\"&gt;Dark Ranger Clea&lt;/a&gt;, who waged a guerilla war from &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; against the invaders, in an attempt to slow their progress. &lt;a href=\"Raleigh%20the%20Devout\"&gt;Raleigh the Devout&lt;/a&gt; was able to drive away the Forsaken from his former home and re-take the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Ruins of Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, despite the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Apothecary%20Faranell\"&gt;Master Apothecary Faranell&lt;/a&gt; to weaponize the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; against his forces. He then led a cadre of paladins to purify the area, but the Horde provoked the blighted creatures in an attempt to hinder their efforts. &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt;, located west of Southshore and controlled by the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Keyton\"&gt;Captain Keyton&lt;/a&gt;, was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Ilsa%20Corbin\"&gt;Ilsa Corbin&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to secure a vital source of ore. The Gilneans also contributed to the war campaign, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; leading an army against the nearby &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;, apparently after &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt; tried to raise countless undead to attack &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;'s territories. Even &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Crater\"&gt;Dalaran Crater&lt;/a&gt; was not exempt from conflict, with &lt;a href=\"High%20Sorcerer%20Andromath\"&gt;High Sorcerer Andromath&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Derek%20the%20Undying\"&gt;Derek the Undying&lt;/a&gt; facing each other and both conducting an &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; ritual there at the convergence of its potent &lt;a href=\"ley-line\"&gt;ley-line&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Horde maintained its control over &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt;, from where they attempted to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, but were opposed by Alliance forces laying explosives in the stronghold. The Horde also sent &lt;a href=\"Usha%20Eyegouge\"&gt;Usha Eyegouge&lt;/a&gt; to try to use the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;Ruins of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; to establish a new defensible base of operations, but were soon discovered and attacked by &lt;a href=\"Grumbol%20Grimhammer\"&gt;Grumbol Grimhammer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;, both commanders surviving their respective encounters to later travel to &lt;a href=\"Mechagon\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;. After the Forsaken tried to turn the dwarven ghosts of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Garok\"&gt;Dun Garok&lt;/a&gt; against their former comrades, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; sent a battalion of troops led by paladin trainer &lt;a href=\"Brandur%20Ironhammer\"&gt;Brandur Ironhammer&lt;/a&gt; to retake the fallen fortress, but &lt;a href=\"Jezelle%20Pruitt\"&gt;Jezelle Pruitt&lt;/a&gt; attempted to drive them back through &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master%20Talonaxe\"&gt;Gryphon Master Talonaxe&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20rider\"&gt;Gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s regularly patrolled &lt;a href=\"Darrowmere%20River\"&gt;Darrowmere River&lt;/a&gt;, preventing troop movements, and the dwarves sent combat engineers to establish dams along the river from the Plaguelands to &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt; to further contain the Horde, but were opposed by the banshee &lt;a href=\"Melisara\"&gt;Melisara&lt;/a&gt; of Tarren Mill.\nFinally, &lt;a href=\"General%20Hammond%20Clay\"&gt;General Hammond Clay&lt;/a&gt;, the High Commander of Stormwind's Defense, marched from &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; with some of his troops towards &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, also seeking to secure &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient boundary separating Hillsbrad from the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to its east.\nLordaeron theater.\nNot long after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance and Horde both established major bases in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, battling each other for control over the newly rebuilt &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and its surrounding regions, whose strategic location was critical for turning the tide of the Fourth War.\nThe Alliance sought to keep the Horde's forces at bay as they still retained a presence in the northern areas of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Roderick%20Brewston\"&gt;Captain Roderick Brewston&lt;/a&gt; in Stromgarde Keep, the Alliance fighting to reclaim Arathi was largely to ensure that they are able to continue to occupy neighboring &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde sought to secure Stromgarde would set the stage for an assault on the heart of the Eastern Kingdoms and serve as a launching point for a campaign against the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, and also saw the strategic location as key in the defense of the greatest remaining Horde bastion of power in the continent, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; capital &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; in the far north.\nThe Alliance sent two former &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; (the former believing the long-disputed territory rightfully belonged to his family), along with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, to reinforce Stromgarde's defenses and repel the Horde invaders. The Horde in turn established &lt;a href=\"Ar%27gorok\"&gt;Ar'gorok&lt;/a&gt; to Stromgarde Keep's north bordering the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; mountains, and sent three of its greatest champions, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, leading orcish, blood elven and Darkspear troll forces, with some &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; tauren including &lt;a href=\"Sunwalkers\"&gt;Sunwalkers&lt;/a&gt; also joining in the assault.\nHowever, the Alliance eventually won the warfront, restoring Stromgarde Keep, and presumably the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; under Danath Trollbane's leadership, to much of its former glory.\nKalimdor theater.\nShortly after the Burning of Teldrassil and the initial outbreak of the Fourth War, while most of the civilian population was seemingly evacuated to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the remnants of the night elf military and &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; actively engaged with the Horde forces in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, which was apparently largely occupied by the Horde after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, although parts of the territory were apparently heavily contested.\nThe Horde entrenched themselves in northern Darkshore under &lt;a href=\"Chief%20Blastgineer%20Bombgutz\"&gt;Chief Blastgineer Bombgutz&lt;/a&gt;, who was drilling near the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20War%20Camp\"&gt;Shatterspear War Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and although &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt; was apparently for a while held by &lt;a href=\"hippogryph%20rider\"&gt;hippogryph rider&lt;/a&gt;s, they were attacked by Horde forces in an attempt to secure their faction's aerial superiority over Darkshore once again. They also maintained bestiaries near the southeastern &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Grove of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, which were set aflame by Alliance forces. Goblin salvager efforts by &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Goggath\"&gt;Captain Goggath&lt;/a&gt; to use Azerite-powered &lt;a href=\"shredder\"&gt;shredder&lt;/a&gt;s to dismantle the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt;, were discovered by &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Duskrunner\"&gt;Huntress Duskrunner&lt;/a&gt;, and Alliance forces attempted to steal or sabotage their technology. In &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dentaria%20Silverglade\"&gt;Dentaria Silverglade&lt;/a&gt; oversaw the evacuation of surviving night elf civilians to &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, but was targeted for assassination by Horde forces, with &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Guard%20Aldo%20Rockrain\"&gt;Blood Guard Aldo Rockrain&lt;/a&gt; leading a Horde army against her, which was in turn confronted by Alliance defenders.\nThe neighboring &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, previously overrun by the Horde in the march towards Darkshore, became swarmed in perpetual conflict. Alliance forces planted depth charges in the waters surrounding &lt;a href=\"Zoram%27gar%20Outpost\"&gt;Zoram'gar Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, the only port near Azuremyst Isle, which the Horde intended to eventually attack from the same settlement. The night elves managed to control or retake &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maestra%27s%20Post\"&gt;Maestra's Post&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Song\"&gt;Forest Song&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, but Horde forces launched attacks against all four targets, sending various commanders and soldiers, including &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Dontrag\"&gt;Sergeant Dontrag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tarkan\"&gt;Captain Tarkan&lt;/a&gt;, to directly assail them. The Alliance counterattacked, sending &lt;a href=\"Talran%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Talran of the Wild&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Jalin\"&gt;Huntress Jalin&lt;/a&gt; to recapture &lt;a href=\"Silverwind%20Refuge\"&gt;Silverwind Refuge&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Priestess%20Maestra\"&gt;Moon Priestess Maestra&lt;/a&gt; to control the pass between Darkshore and Ashenvale; the &lt;a href=\"ancient%20of%20war\"&gt;ancient of war&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Big%20Baobob\"&gt;Big Baobob&lt;/a&gt; to defend the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Aessina\"&gt;Shrine of Aessina&lt;/a&gt;, which the Horde tried to burn to the ground; and even had &lt;a href=\"Illiyana\"&gt;Illiyana&lt;/a&gt; and her sister &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s destroy goblin shredders at the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scout%20Utvoch\"&gt;Scout Utvoch&lt;/a&gt; also explored &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;, where the Alliance attempted to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; members harvesting Azerite resources.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; were a theater of conflict, with the Alliance clashing with the tauren in an attempt to capture the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, which would disrupt Horde troop movements throughout the entire continent, and besieging the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate%20of%20Mulgore\"&gt;Great Gate of Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance further re-established &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;, and attacked &lt;a href=\"Desolation%20Hold\"&gt;Desolation Hold&lt;/a&gt;, aided by supplies from &lt;a href=\"Bael%20Modan\"&gt;Bael Modan&lt;/a&gt;, from which they intended to use as a staging point to invade &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Karga%20Rageroar\"&gt;Karga Rageroar&lt;/a&gt; and her clan's battleships shelled &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Hold\"&gt;Northwatch Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and were retaliated against by &lt;a href=\"Norbin%20Nimblesprocket\"&gt;Norbin Nimblesprocket&lt;/a&gt;'s cannons, which provided the Alliance at least temporarily with superior firepower, and the Alliance and Horde also attacked each other's bases at &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Hill\"&gt;Hunter's Hill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance seeking to control the passage between &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance even sent a void elf, &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Duskwalker\"&gt;Instructor Duskwalker&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; in order to assess its viability as a base with its &lt;a href=\"mana%20bomb\"&gt;mana bomb&lt;/a&gt; effects yet lingering, and the Horde did likewise with &lt;a href=\"Zaedana\"&gt;Zaedana&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; itself became a major center of turmoil, with the Alliance setting fire to &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;'s storehouses, destroying supplies sent between &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Alliance agents also infiltrated the Isles themselves, setting fire to the Darkspear trolls' ships, and &lt;a href=\"Dockmaster%20Lewis\"&gt;Dockmaster Lewis&lt;/a&gt; openly led ships to attack them, attempting to cripple the place where much of the Horde's naval power was based. The Horde's efforts were bolstered by the vital stream of supplies from &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, their secret arrangement apparently discovered by &lt;a href=\"Corporal%20Teegan\"&gt;Corporal Teegan&lt;/a&gt;, despite the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Gazrog\"&gt;Gazrog&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere in the region, &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Watcher%20Kerry\"&gt;Keep Watcher Kerry&lt;/a&gt; attempted to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, scavenging its materials, but was opposed by &lt;a href=\"Tarshaw%20Jaggedscar\"&gt;Tarshaw Jaggedscar&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; herself, the vengeful night elves recalled their remaining forces from Kalimdor's outposts and prepared for an attack against &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, where the Horde attempted to build doomsday weapons out of Azerite.\nNorthern Kalimdor theater.\nDespite the previous skirmishes since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, most of Darkshore apparently eventually fell to the Horde once again, with the night elves being greatly outnumbered by their enemies in Kalimdor, and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s moved into the area, destroying &lt;a href=\"Lor%27danel\"&gt;Lor'danel&lt;/a&gt;, establishing new settlements such as &lt;a href=\"The%20Dredge\"&gt;The Dredge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blighting&lt;/a&gt; much of the captured land. Although &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was not able to directly provide reinforcements, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; sent his kingdom's forces to assist their kaldorei allies, and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; invoked &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s power via the forbidden &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; ritual to help balance the odds in her people's favor. The Alliance launched a massive counter-attack, led by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, in an attempt to regain control over the region for the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, eventually establishing &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; as their new base of operations and ultimately winning the Warfront.\nFaction Assaults.\nThe war between the Alliance and Horde ramps up as they fight on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and defend against each other's incursions.\nRise of Azshara.\nUnder Sylvanas' orders, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;black blade&lt;/a&gt; to guide the Horde fleet and the pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both fleets would be attacked by the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas were opened. Led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade Ankoan&lt;/a&gt;, while the Horde rallied under &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and found themselves allying with the &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos had, however, departed from the rest of the Horde forces in order to carry out a secret mission.\nIn time, Lor'themar was informed by &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ussoh\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ussoh&lt;/a&gt; that the tauren had received a vision in which Sylvanas ordered Baine's death, causing Lor'themar to declare that they must prevent the vision from coming to pass. Believing that Baine's execution would drive a blade into the very heart of the Horde, he ordered champions to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; in order to save Baine. While some champions headed directly to meet with their allies, Sylvanas' loyalists were able to secretly rendezvous with Nathanos and inform him of Lor'hemar's actions. In turn, Nathanos ordered them to play along and join the rescue mission. Unbeknownst to the Horde, Alliance spies had also discovered Sylvanas' intentions, and Jaina, recognizing that she owed Baine for returning &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to her, agreed to Anduin's request to rescue Baine. Thus, she, along with &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and their champions headed off to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile venturing through the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde and Alliance rescue teams discovered one another, and after a brief moment, agreed to work together to save Baine. When things started getting heated between Saurfang and Shaw, Jaina and Thrall were quick to get them focused on the task at hand. Upon nearly reaching Baine, the group was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Rowa%20Bloodstrike\"&gt;Rowa Bloodstrike&lt;/a&gt;, who expressed disappointment but not surprise by Saurfang's and Thrall's decision to rescue Baine. Unwilling to stand down, the group was forced to kill Rowa and moved forward to Baine, who was surprised by their presence. While Shaw moved to release Baine from his chains, Saurfang remarked that it felt too easy and the group was then attacked by &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to kill them and Jaina in particular for vengeance for the &lt;a href=\"purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;purge of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the group was successful in liberating Baine from his chains, and Jaina teleported the group safely out of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After ensuring her allies were safe Jaina departed to inform Anduin of the mission's success, with Varok telling her that Anduin didn't stand alone.\nAs a result of this unexpected alliance, the Horde and Alliance forces were directed to focus their attention on &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; over one another, with Jaina believing that it would buy time for Saurfang's rebellion to take root. In time, the combined Horde and Alliance forces invaded the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, where they ventured deep into the &lt;a href=\"Last%20Prison\"&gt;Last Prison&lt;/a&gt;, where the queen prepared a ritual to free her benefactor &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. As Thalyssra, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and heroes of Azeroth made their descent into the prison, Azshara taunted them with news of Lor'themar and Jaina's fall, but her words proved false: Lor'themar and Jaina, along with Thalyssra, Shandris, and the heroes, fought together to defeat Azshara. After the battle, Lor'themar and Jaina approached the fallen queen with weapons drawn, but the chains binding N'Zoth shattered and the Old God subsequently rescued Azshara. Though triumphant over Azshara, Lor'themar considered it a hollow victory as not only did Azshara survive, but N'Zoth was freed. He also agreed with Jaina's assessment that the Fourth War has kept them distracted and that divided they had no hope against N'Zoth. Thus Lor'themar vowed to tell his people of what transpired in Nazjatar, of how Azshara fell because the Horde and Alliance stood together, and of the rising threat of N'Zoth. Then he vowed to take his place besides Saurfang and Thrall.\nDe-escalation.\nFollowing the events within the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Palace\"&gt;Eternal Palace&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde split between &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s revolutionaries and the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the Horde leadership sided with Saurfang, with &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince\"&gt;Trade Prince&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; being the only two leaders to side with Sylvanas.\nConvening at a dilapidated scout tower, the revolutionaries officially allied with the Alliance against Sylvanas with \"For Azeroth\" as their rallying cry. Thus to protect Azeroth and depose Sylvanas, the Horde revolutionaries and Alliance planned to strike at Orgrimmar and to that end set up camp in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;. In response to Sylvanas's forces collapsing part of the canyon between Razor Hill and Orgrimmar, Saurfang turned to &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Tinkmaster Overspark&lt;/a&gt; to breach the canyon. With his forces established within the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt;, Saurfang turned to dealing with Sylvanas's spies and protecting their siege weapons. Meanwhile Sylvanas and Nathanos had secured &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; from internal dissident by arresting &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and burning the propaganda that dissidents within the city had been spreading.\nKnowing that Orgrimmar's greatest weakness was its multiple entrances Saurfang's strategy relied on attacking all three entrances at once. To that end, he directed &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;'s forces to attack Orgrimmar from the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; to lead their forces to attack the city from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and he, Thrall, and Anduin would lead their forces to attack Orgrimmar from Durotar. He further ordered &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; to lead her people to protect &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; in case Sylvanas launched a counterattack.\nHowever, before the battle could commence, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas' loyalists unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;, to which she accepted. During the duel, Saurfang managed to rouse Sylvanas' angry, causing her to let an outburst that showed she had no true loyalty to the Horde. Abandoning the faction, the Horde unified once more and Saurfang was celebrated with a hero's funeral In the months that followed, both the Alliance and Horde were contacted by &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, aiding him, &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"MOTHER\"&gt;MOTHER&lt;/a&gt;, and the champions of Azeroth with defeating N'Zoth and ending the threat of the Old God once and for all.\nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath, the Horde entered into an armistice with the Alliance. The Alliance abandoned any holdfasts they had established on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; as a show of good faith. Both groups committed, independently, to the idea of hunting down Sylvanas Windrunner for her crimes. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as Lord Commander of the Alliance and was tasked alongside &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; with hunting down Sylvanas.\nThe armistice was not met with complete faith. On the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; refused to sign this pact and distanced herself from the rest of the Alliance leadership, moving to Nordrassil with the other night elves. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; also questioned its effectiveness, seeing it as a waste of time that would not stop the Horde from eventually attacking them once again. However, most of the other Alliance leaders, including Jaina Proudmoore, appeared to, at least for the moment, support the armistice, if but only because their own lands and resources were largely depleted. The Horde, with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; gone, refused to name a new warchief. Instead, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; was formed. With an armistice signed between &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde Council, the two factions began to move away from conflict with one another. The council seemed eager to have the war at an end, and numerous new leaders were chosen. With Saurfang dead, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; returned to the Horde leadership as the new chieftain of the orcs. &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; was chosen to at last take the place of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, who had perished against the Burning Legion, as the new Darkspear chieftain. &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; became the new &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince\"&gt;Trade Prince&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, after &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; deserted the Horde in the wake of Sylvanas' abandonment. &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; was chosen as the new representative and interim leader of the Forsaken, though she voiced her desire for her people to find a different leader in time.\nHostility continued to exist between the Horde and Alliance in spite of the armistice. &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who aligned herself with the Forsaken after the main conflict had ended, and Lilian Voss were forced to take a longer path from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;; noting that, while there was an armistice, the Alliance naval forces that patrolled the areas would not be friendly to them. Thrall, Calia and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; were able to meet with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, and Tyrande Whisperwind at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;; though the meeting was noted as tense. &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt;, an Earthen Ring shaman who helped organize the meeting, feared that the meeting would erupt into violence, and stated that it was \"a mistake\" to bring the Horde leaders to Hyjal. Elements of the Alliance also believed that the Horde could be providing Sylvanas refuge in secret, with Tyrande warning Thrall to never seek to speak to her again unless he brought the head of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde refugees in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; were detained by Alliance forces, in particular for information regarding a Sylvanas loyalist. The orc child, &lt;a href=\"Zun\"&gt;Zun&lt;/a&gt;, panicked and attacked Turalyon; though he was spared after being quickly disarmed. The Alliance forces interrogated and tortured Zun's mother, &lt;a href=\"Gowzis\"&gt;Gowzis&lt;/a&gt;, using the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; for information on the loyalist dark ranger, &lt;a href=\"Visrynn\"&gt;Visrynn&lt;/a&gt;. The apothecary &lt;a href=\"Cotley\"&gt;Cotley&lt;/a&gt; was taken prisoner for his information and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockades\"&gt;Stormwind Stockades&lt;/a&gt;, under the premise he would be released after he gave all the information he knew. &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; was imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; for trespassing on their territory. This act nearly caused a breach of the ceasefire under Turalyon's orders, though this was prevented by the intervention of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. It was noted by &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; that he would not be executed without a trial from the Horde Council, though this sentiment did not please &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, who wished his spymaster released; a sentiment Thrall promised he would see rectified.\nWhen Sylvanas destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and the leadership of the Alliance and Horde met at the top of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, the two groups nearly came to blows until &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; interceded. The Alliance and Horde leaders also struggled with the subsequent loss of several of their leaders, such as Anduin, Jaina, Thrall, and Baine Bloodhoof.\nPost-war status.\nKalimdor.\nAfter they won the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, some of the Darnassian night elves, including Tyrande, Malfurion, Maiev, and Shandris left &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the recently reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, and moved back to their old home &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, where they apparently maintained a tenuous connection with tauren members of the Circle remaining there such as &lt;a href=\"Tiala%20Whitemane\"&gt;Tiala Whitemane&lt;/a&gt;. However, temporary safe passage for the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; members, including Thrall, required direct negotiation between the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; druids which guarded the World Tree and the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; shaman &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt;, who mentioned to Thrall it was best that he meet the night elves alone (with some of the Horde Council members convinced that he would be ambushed at Nordrassil), and that his going to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; without Yukha's escort would mean his \"downfall\". The night elves openly refused to recognize the armistice signed by Anduin and the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, and continued to bar all Horde members from night elf lands in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Alliance also successfully reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Keep\"&gt;Tiragarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, and soldiers from the &lt;a href=\"Northwatch%20Expeditionary%20Unit\"&gt;Northwatch Expeditionary Unit&lt;/a&gt; continued to guard and rebuild the keep after the armistice, and also maintained their hold over &lt;a href=\"Honor%27s%20Stand\"&gt;Honor's Stand&lt;/a&gt; in the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, with the Alliance bringing in new supplies to bolster their existing defenses, although the Horde soldiers who served there are bent on someday reclaiming their former base.\nThe night elves abandoned &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; after winning the Battle for Darkshore, and the ancient Highborne settlement is in ruins along with &lt;a href=\"Ameth%27Aran\"&gt;Ameth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, and most of Darkshore appears to be abandoned and uninhabited after the massive conflict, with the region described as a nearly lifeless land compared to its previous state. &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Vale\"&gt;Shatterspear Vale&lt;/a&gt; was reclaimed by the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Ohseso\"&gt;Ohseso&lt;/a&gt;, who seeks to rebuild his forces that they might ever answer the Horde's call, but also tries to honor their renewed pact of non-aggression with their night elf neighbors. Although they once highly patrolled Darkshore's roads, Tyrande and her Sentinels have begun focusing their wrath against the Horde elsewhere following the Fourth War.\n&lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; also remains highly contested between the night elves and the Horde, with the kaldorei controlling &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stardust%20Spire\"&gt;Stardust Spire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Vale\"&gt;Howling Vale&lt;/a&gt;, and the Horde repelling night elf attacks against the &lt;a href=\"Splintertree%20Post\"&gt;Splintertree Post&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Warsong Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Rampart\"&gt;Mor'shan Rampart&lt;/a&gt;, a base originally built by the Horde near the entrance in southern Ashenvale which repeatedly changed hands over the years between the factions, is currently controlled by Alliance forces. At Stardust Spire, &lt;a href=\"Huntress%20Jalin\"&gt;Huntress Jalin&lt;/a&gt; and her Sentinels doggedly patrolled the Ashenvale border, and reportedly destroyed every siege weapon the Horde brought down from the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. She further left the bones of the machines and the bodies of the engineers at the doorstep of the spire as a warning to her enemies.\nIn Azshara, night elves also began continually attacking &lt;a href=\"Valormok\"&gt;Valormok&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Talrendis%20Point\"&gt;Talrendis Point&lt;/a&gt;, with the Horde Council asked for reinforcements to hold off their relentless attacks.\nEastern Kingdoms.\nSome parts of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be inhabitable and unoccupied following the armistice, such as &lt;a href=\"Calston%20Estate\"&gt;Calston Estate&lt;/a&gt;, but most of the Forsaken, especially civilians, appear to have long since moved to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; - although Lilian mentions possibly reclaiming the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to restore the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, as her people prefer darker and damper environments to that of Durotar. &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt; is also mentioned as still heavily blighted, although it seems that the effects are very slowly receding. &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; propaganda pamphlets distributed throughout Lordaeron's living population and were found near the estate, accusing Anduin of being Sylvanas's secret lover and a traitor to their people, the two rulers having allegedly conspired at the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; to kill Calia, in order for Anduin to marry her and make secure his claim towards Lordaeron, as well as garner sympathy for the Forsaken. They further declared that the Menethil dynasty would live on, claiming to have Calia's surviving son as a living heir to the kingdom, and vowed to one day put an end to Anduin's \"puppet reign\".\nWith the exception of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, whose ranks the Horde paladins apparently formally left after the conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;Class Order&lt;/a&gt;s have remained largely neutral, with their banners featured prominently in both Stormwind's &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; and Orgrimmar's &lt;a href=\"Barracks\"&gt;Barracks&lt;/a&gt;; the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, the only Class Order without a significant membership of Azeroth's races, is the only one entirely absent from both cities. The Silver Hand retained a presence in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, where the Sanctum was cleared for the storage of important paladin artifacts. &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; appeared to have been mostly left intact by the Fourth War as well, but some artifacts have been moved to &lt;a href=\"Magister%27s%20Terrace\"&gt;Magister's Terrace&lt;/a&gt; for safekeeping.\nAfter the Battle of Lordaeron, which destroyed &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and drove the Forsaken from their stronghold in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance engaged in a massive military campaign against the remaining Forsaken settlements in the Eastern Kingdoms throughout the Fourth War. In the end, &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; (whose artifacts are taken to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; to be guarded closely) were reclaimed in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; was reclaimed in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, presumably strengthening the worgen's presence considerably, but the status of the Gilnean peninsula remains unclear. &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt; maintained a tenuous hold on &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;, the island west of Gilneas, although have not been able to take back the prison. &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of his newly restored kingdom, apparently rules most of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; after the Alliance victory in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, although most of the soldiers who fought in the battle have returned home, and there was still a limited Horde presence in some parts of the region, such as a group of Horde refugees north of &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;. \nRegardless of territorial changes, the Alliance and the Horde appear to have been significantly weakened at the war's end. Anduin was forced to conscript farmers after all his formal soldiers were stretched very thin at various battlefronts at Stromgarde and other places mid-way through the Fourth War. With Tyrande and Malfurion distancing themselves from his leadership and focusing near exclusively on retaking their homelands, the surviving night elven population mostly following their lead or too displaced to lend any significant assistance, and a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20fleet\"&gt;Kul Tiran fleet&lt;/a&gt; destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, Anduin could muster enough soldiers for only one final assault against Orgrimmar, stating that if their assault failed, they were essentially \"done for\", and even assisted by Saurfang's revolution, seemed uncertain whether they could definitively prevail. &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, located in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside Alleria, later mentioned that the Fourth War took a terrible toll upon the Alliance, depleting their military might, but vows to restore their defenses, noting that reclaiming Stromgarde was a first step, and perhaps there were other lands of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;old Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (presumably referring to &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; or other territories in his homeland &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;) which could likewise be reclaimed. Alleria, while longing to join the hunt for her sister Sylvanas, asserted that the Alliance must rebuild its strength and resolved to assist Turalyon in his efforts to do so, but also mentioned that she will see Sylvanas answer for her actions \"when the time comes\".\nIn &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar reminded &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde's armies were depleted, their treasuries emptied, their resources stretched thin, and implied that any blow to them in their current state would be disastrous, and this was apparently the reason why Baine Bloodhoof was initially very reluctant to accept &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde's ranks even after the armistice. As they were struggling already to assist its current membership, especially with the Forsaken still largely displaced. &lt;a href=\"Peon\"&gt;Peon&lt;/a&gt;s at &lt;a href=\"Crushblow\"&gt;Crushblow&lt;/a&gt; were disillusioned by their treatment as laborers and briefly deserted their base, the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; launched an assault against southern &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vintner%20Iltheux\"&gt;Vintner Iltheux&lt;/a&gt; struggled with managing &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; production for the Horde, but with Kiro's help, all these problems were eventually resolved.\nHowever, even after the Alliance settlements in the island were removed as a result of the armistice, the Horde was still apparently only able to spare a very limited number of soldiers to directly assist &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; was threatened by the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt;, with Thrall, Baine, and Thalyssra only able to muster a small host no greater than Talanji herself could gather. Thrall told her that bringing more soldiers would have left Orgrimmar undefended, and Lor'themar previously mentioned that &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; was strategically vital as a resupply point for their remaining ships. Nevertheless, with their assistance, Talanji was able to eventually secure Zandalar, formally taking her place on the Horde Council and eliminating most of Sylvanas's forces from her lands.\nInterviews.\nAccording to a 2018 interview with &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Danuser\"&gt;Steve Danuser&lt;/a&gt;, the entire expansion and the Fourth War was originally meant to be based and built around the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s deepest sense of core identity, exploring the positive and negative aspects thereof, and what that really meant to them as a whole as they both struggled to properly examine and re-define themselves:\n\"\"There has always been some question as to what the Horde stood for. And that has changed and evolved over time. Is it this disparate collection of outcasts that nobody will align themselves with? And that\u2019s why they\u2019re together, out of necessity? Or is it this group that\u2019s driven by honor and courage? Players have been able to identify and pull out parts of the storyline that they favor and maybe turn a blind eye to some of the other things, but all of those things have been part of the Horde\u2019s history.\"\n\"\"While we\u2019ve had conflicts like the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, none of those really resolved what the Horde is. Battle for Azeroth is absolutely an opportunity to look at both sides [honorable and evil] that have made up the Horde storylines throughout the years and pull them together. And maybe give a chance for the Horde to look inward and maybe become something new, something stronger than it ever was before. We look at this as an opportunity, and the thing is, to get there, we have to look at those scars that have come along the way. That\u2019s the only way we can grow and move beyond, is taking an honest look at the things you\u2019ve done, and nobody is exemplifying that path to the Horde more than what &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Saurfang\"&gt;Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and those other heroes are doing. They are embodying the other aspects of what the Horde was. So to get to the future of the Horde, we have to face the Horde\u2019s past, and face it in a very real and tangible way.\"\n\"The Alliance has its share of disparity within it as well, and different facets that have bubbled up over the years. The Alliance is going to have to realign itself. Especially the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elves&lt;/a&gt; who lose their home. How are they going to react to this? There\u2019s going to be a real self-examination of what the Alliance is about, and how they want to behave. Do they want to get revenge on the Horde, or do they want to build a better world? That\u2019s a question they need to answer.\"\"\nIn a January 2019 interview around the time of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Danuser noted that he and the other writers wanted to tell a very strong Alliance and Horde story, with the Horde stopping world-ending threats such as &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldir\"&gt;Uldir&lt;/a&gt;, but becoming increasingly divided internally, while the Alliance weren't really at each other's throats the same way: \"The Alliance is like a family. Brothers and sisters can disagree, and things can get heated, but there\u2019s still a deep and abiding love and trust there.\"\nAccording to a November 2021 interview with Steve Danuser on the lasting effects of the Fourth War, and the largely unresolved issues from its conflict, especially in regards to the night elves: \"I would say those two figures [Sylvanas and Tyrande] have a lot to \u2013 I don\u2019t know if \u2018resolve\u2019 is the right word, because can you ever resolve something that happens on the scale of an entire civilization nearly being wiped out? There is going to be some very heavy interaction between those characters, and that is pivotal to the final conclusion of how \u2018Eternity\u2019s End\u2019 and the Shadowlands saga wraps up.\"\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; concluded that with the events of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Durotar\"&gt;invasion of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; allying with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde's alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, and with the recent turmoils between the Alliance and Horde, it seemed that the Fourth War may have been on the horizon. This makes the first mention of the term Fourth War, albeit now non-canon, in the \"Warcraft\" universe. Years later, the first canon mention of the (hypothetical) Fourth War was with in .\nSpeculation.\nWhen the armistice was signed, the Alliance ceded control of their holds on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. Based on this, it is possible that the Horde did the same thing on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. However, the current status of other lands such as &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, contested between the two factions during the conflict, remains unclear.\nVideos.\n&lt;evlplayer&gt;\n&lt;/evlplayer&gt;"}

This creature resembles a purple hunting hound with a shaggy black mane and a horrible set of fangs. Two horns sprout out of its forehead, and another pair emerges from its shoulders. These creatures frequent forests, traveling either by themselves or in small packs, hunting and killing any living creature as they find it. Unlike normal dogs, darkhounds kill for sheer joy of the kill; they rarely eat what they hunt. No one really knows where darkhounds came from. They appeared shortly after the Third War, terrorizing the wildlife of the former elven kingdoms. While the Forsaken hunting and living in Tirisfal Glades consider them only a minor nuisance, occasionally a large enough pack poses a threat to &lt;a href=\"alchemist\"&gt;alchemist&lt;/a&gt;s exploring the woods for components. Many warlocks instead keep the monsters as pets, training them to be even more lethal than normal. Darkhounds understand basic Eredun, but, being little better than beasts they cannot speak. Darkhounds stalk their prey, shadowing it for hours until a suitable ambush spot presents itself. They then dart out, attempting to bring down their victim with overwhelming numbers and sharp teeth.\nAs a hunter pet.\nDarkhounds are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"hound\"&gt;hound&lt;/a&gt; family.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarf&lt;/a&gt; hunters start with a unique appearance darkhound pet."}

He serves as the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDarkmaster Gandling served as the headmaster of &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; and, along with his teacher &lt;a href=\"Ras%20Frostwhisper\"&gt;Ras Frostwhisper&lt;/a&gt;, oversaw the atrocities committed against many &lt;a href=\"Eva%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;innocent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;souls&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the few &lt;a href=\"Scholomance%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;classic&lt;/a&gt; bosses of the Scholomance to survive until after \"\", Gandling took up sole rulership of the Scholomance and the remaining &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. \nGandling appears briefly in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, where he is defeated by the combined might of &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; before he flees back to Scholomance. There, &lt;a href=\"Lucien%20Sarkhoff\"&gt;Lucien Sarkhoff&lt;/a&gt; asked the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Gandling.\nThe defeat during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, put the Darkmaster in the foulest of moods, and he immediately began preparations to reanimate &lt;a href=\"Rattlegore\"&gt;Rattlegore&lt;/a&gt; so he could guard against intruders. The darkmaster sought to make Rattlegore more ferocious than ever, imbuing him with an insatiable desire to harvest raw materials from his enemies.\n&lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; turned her wrath on the Scourge necromancers of Scholomance. The darkmaster and Voss faced each other in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Summoning\"&gt;Chamber of Summoning&lt;/a&gt;, where he was aided by a group of &lt;a href=\"Boneweaver\"&gt;Boneweaver&lt;/a&gt;s. Soon, a group of adventurers also arrived and assisted Lilian in defeating the undead, after which Gandling teleported further in Scholomance. Lilian caught up with him, but he managed to briefly control her. He forced her to fight the adventurers, but they managed to defeat and free Lilian. She mustered her strength and attacked Gandling, breaking the improved bone shield that was protecting him. With his protection broken, he retreated into his &lt;a href=\"Headmaster%27s%20Study\"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe adventurers allied with the &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Lord%20Alexei%20Barov\"&gt;Spirit of Lord Alexei Barov&lt;/a&gt;, who believed Gandling's defeat would allow his spirit to finally rest in peace, attacked him.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; stated that according to &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; reports, Darkmaster Gandling is still active at the head of &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Jandice%20Barov\"&gt;Jandice Barov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rattlegore\"&gt;Rattlegore&lt;/a&gt;, and has many puppets to play with.\nWhether this means he was resurrected as an undead or simply was not killed as previously believed is unknown. The continued presence of Jandice Barov appears to mean that the curse upon the Barovs continues.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Course: Advanced Studies\"\n\"The recent defeat in Andorhal has put Darkmaster Gandling in the foulest of moods. More than ever, all students of Scholomance are advised to impress him at every turn. Pupils who dissatisfy the headmaster will be removed from class to perform lab work... or become lab work.\"\nSpells and abilities.\nThe Darkmaster attacks players with Incinerate and Immolate and periodically assigns one a Harsh Lesson, sending the player to a side room to fight &lt;a href=\"Expired%20Test%20Subject\"&gt;Expired Test Subject&lt;/a&gt;s. When a tank or healer is sent, Gandling channels Rise!\nStrategy.\nGandling does not need to be tanked normally, as he will only use Incinerate and Immolate from his spot in the middle of the room. He will occasionally teleport a random player in to one of the side rooms. Said player must fight his or her way out back to the study on their own.\nThere are several possible ways to deal with the Expired Test Subjects when trapped:\nIf a tank or a healer gets teleported, a large number of weakly-hitting skeletons will swarm the room. Focus on them instead of Gandling, as he takes much less damage while Rise is being channeled.\nIn the RPG.\nDarkmaster Gandling is a &lt;a href=\"mummy\"&gt;mummified&lt;/a&gt; wretch. He teaches students how to raise the dead in the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s name. Formerly a &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; wizard, he betrayed his masters for dark power and now revels in undeath. His graduates go on to &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s capital in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Hearthstone.\nDarkmaster Gandling appears as a in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"He doesn\u2019t grade on a curve, but on a sharp spike instead.\""}

He is not, arguably, the most difficult boss nor is he the owner of it like &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Alexei%20Barov\"&gt;Lord Alexei Barov&lt;/a&gt;. He is, however, the headmaster of the School of Necromancy at &lt;a href=\"Caer%20Darrow\"&gt;Caer Darrow&lt;/a&gt;, appointed personally by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;.\nGandling appears after the six bosses and all human mobs found in the six chambers around the Headmaster's Study are slain. The bosses are &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Alexei%20Barov\"&gt;Lord Alexei Barov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Theolen%20Krastinov%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Doctor Theolen Krastinov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Ravenian%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;The Ravenian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Polkelt\"&gt;Lorekeeper Polkelt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Instructor%20Malicia%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Instructor Malicia&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Illucia%20Barov\"&gt;Lady Illucia Barov&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nGandling is a 61 &lt;a href=\"elite\"&gt;elite&lt;/a&gt; caster boss. He casts Shadow Portal, a spell that teleports a random member of the group into a room with 3-4 level 60 non-elite mobs. That member must clear the room alone before the door to the rest of the instance opens and he is released (unless you can run past the mob without catching aggro). Those mobs do not vanish nor does the room open automatically upon Gandling's death. Despite their high level, each mob has very low stamina, taking only a few hits.\nGandling will spawn even if trash mobs remain in Shadow Vault, Vault of the Ravenian, Hall of Secrets, Barov Family Vault, and Hall of the Damned, however the trash must be cleared in the The Coven in order for him to spawn. Because he will teleport even solo adventurers to those halls during the fight, it remains wise to clear all of them.\nOther spells he casts are:"}

{"id": "328861", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=328861", "title": "Darkmoon Faire", "text": "The Darkmoon Faire (or the Darkmoon Theater Troupe) is a large gathering of activities on the southern area of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt;, brought together by &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;. The faire opens on the second Sunday of the month at 3 AM realm time and lasts for one week. At the conclusion of that week, players on the island are automatically teleported off the island, back to Elwynn Forest/Mulgore.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%204.3.0\"&gt;patch 4.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkmoon Faire could be found at one of three locations: Outside &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, outside &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, and on the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttendees can complete &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s associated with each sideshow game to win a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Game%20Prize\"&gt;Darkmoon Game Prize&lt;/a&gt; containing a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Prize%20Ticket\"&gt;Darkmoon Prize Ticket&lt;/a&gt; and possibly another prize. Each game requires a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Game%20Token\"&gt;Darkmoon Game Token&lt;/a&gt; which is purchasable from vendors scattered throughout the faire. Tokens and prize tickets are also rewarded from once-per-faire &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;-specific quests, which grant +5 &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; in the appropriate profession. Prize tickets can be used to purchase &lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"vanity\"&gt;vanity&lt;/a&gt; items, &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt;s, and replica armor for use in &lt;a href=\"transmogrification\"&gt;transmogrification&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, there's a carousel that boosts &lt;a href=\"experience\"&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; gain.\nTraveling to and from the Faire.\nThe Darkmoon Faire showcases the weird and extraordinary. Gathering the exotic from around the world, Silas Darkmoon presents the Darkmoon Faire as a celebration of the wonders and mysteries found in Azeroth. The faire spends most of its time in parts unknown but is available from time to time by accessing portals in Elwynn Forest and Mulgore.\nPlayers can reach &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt; via the portal in the Darkmoon Faire Staging Grounds that are set up near one of their major cities:\nTo quickly get to the staging grounds, players may speak to &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%20Mystic%20Mage\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire Mystic Mage&lt;/a&gt; located in each major city to for a teleport - they charge a low price that varies by character level. Once on the Island, the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Path\"&gt;Darkmoon Path&lt;/a&gt; leads down the ridge to the Faire to the south, and mounts are provided for players who are too low level for standard riding.\nPlayers need only travel to the southernmost point of the island, to the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Boardwalk\"&gt;Darkmoon Boardwalk&lt;/a&gt;, where a \"Portal Back\" is under a small tent. The portal returns players to the staging grounds in either Elwynn Forest or Mulgore, depending on faction. There is a similar portal at the start of the Darkmoon Path for players who arrive on the island only to remember they forgot something (such as materials for the various profession quests at the Faire).\nCollectables.\nBattle pets.\n21 battle pets are available from the Darkmoon Faire.\nSeven pets are available for purchase for each:\nTwo can be obtained from defeating the pet tamers:\nTwo pets drop from world bosses:\nOne pet can be fished up:\nTwo pets can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Flik\"&gt;Flik&lt;/a&gt; for :\nTwo pets can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"Galissa%20Sundew\"&gt;Galissa Sundew&lt;/a&gt;:\nOne pet is a quest reward:\nTwo pets are achievement rewards:\nTwo wild pets can be captured:\nMounts.\nFour mounts are available for purchase:\nToys.\nFifteen toys are available during the Darkmoon Faire.\nFour are available for purchase:\nOne is a quest reward:\nEight are achievement rewards:\nTwo are boss drops (or found on the Auction House):\nOther.\nThis section consists of items that don't fit in any of the sections above:\nOne can be purchased from a vendor:\nTwo are achievement rewards:\nSideshow games.\nThe Darkmoon Faire contains several sideshow-inspired minigames. Each minigame costs one &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Game%20Token\"&gt;Darkmoon Game Token&lt;/a&gt; to play for a fixed amount of time. Each one also has has an associated repeatable quest which can be completed over the course of multiple play sessions - or a single one, with enough luck or skill. Completing each quest awards one &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Game%20Prize\"&gt;Darkmoon Game Prize&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Darkmoon Cannon.\nLocated across from the Eastern Pavilion, the &lt;a href=\"Blastenheimer%205000%20Ultra%20Cannon\"&gt;Blastenheimer 5000 Ultra Cannon&lt;/a&gt;, owned by &lt;a href=\"Maxima%20Blastenheimer\"&gt;Maxima Blastenheimer&lt;/a&gt;, launches guests through the air towards a target sitting in the waters near the boardwalk south of the faire grounds. Getting a bullseye earns 5 points, landing close to it earns 3 points, and getting near it earns 1 point. A mage is located on the beach next to the target and will teleport anyone who has recently launched from the cannon back for additional attempts, or simply to continue their Faire-going...for a price.\nThe associated quest is &lt;a href=\"The%20Humanoid%20Cannonball\"&gt;The Humanoid Cannonball&lt;/a&gt; and requires 5 points - a single bullseye. Getting a bullseye also awards the &lt;a href=\"Blastenheimer%20Bullseye\"&gt;Blastenheimer Bullseye&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nRing Toss.\nLocated next to the Southern Pavilion, this game provides guests with 10 rings in which to toss onto the pole attached to &lt;a href=\"Dubenko\"&gt;Dubenko&lt;/a&gt;, a turtle in a large circular pen. Dubenko moves a few yards from time to time, and the ring toss itself is not entirely precise. &lt;a href=\"Jessica%20Rogers\"&gt;Jessica Rogers&lt;/a&gt; runs the game and provides the associated quest, , which asks for 3 rings on the pole.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%206.1.0\"&gt;patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, a new achievement was added: &lt;a href=\"Triumphant%20Turtle%20Tossing\"&gt;Triumphant Turtle Tossing&lt;/a&gt;, which is awarded for a perfect run of getting all 10 rings on the turtle. The achievement awards the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Ring-Flinger\"&gt;Darkmoon Ring-Flinger&lt;/a&gt; toy. See the achievement article for a strategy.\nShooting Gallery.\nLocated next to the Western Pavilion, &lt;a href=\"Rinling\"&gt;Rinling&lt;/a&gt; has finally opened his shooting gallery after years of collecting engineering parts for his equipment. Guests are given a pellet rifle to shoot the targets that light up. Players will have 60 seconds to earn 25 points, which completes the quest, &lt;a href=\"He%20Shoots%2C%20He%20Scores%21\"&gt;He Shoots, He Scores!&lt;/a&gt;.\nTonk Challenge.\nLocated next to the pastry tent, guests are given a &lt;a href=\"steam%20tonk\"&gt;steam tonk&lt;/a&gt; controller with which to pilot their tonks, within a \"town\" modeled with small paper buildings and surrounded by a fence. Players will have 60 seconds to destroy 30 targets, while being attacked by enemy tonks and &lt;a href=\"MiniZep%20Controller\"&gt;MiniZeps&lt;/a&gt; at the same time. &lt;a href=\"Finlay%20Coolshot\"&gt;Finlay Coolshot&lt;/a&gt; runs the game and offers &lt;a href=\"Tonk%20Commander\"&gt;Tonk Commander&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%206.1.0\"&gt;patch 6.1.0&lt;/a&gt;, a new achievement was added: &lt;a href=\"Ace%20Tonk%20Commander\"&gt;Ace Tonk Commander&lt;/a&gt;, which is awarded for getting 45 points in a single run (more than the 30 needed for the quest). This achievement awards the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Tonk%20Controller\"&gt;Darkmoon Tonk Controller&lt;/a&gt; toy.\nWhack-a-Gnoll.\nLocated near the entrance, guests receive a mallet to whack some stuffed gnolls that pop out of nine barrels in the area. Players will have 60 seconds to earn 30 points. The gnolls come in three types: normal, Hogger, and baby, awarding 1 point, 3 points, or a &lt;a href=\"knockdown\"&gt;knockdown&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. &lt;a href=\"Mola\"&gt;Mola&lt;/a&gt; runs the game and gives the quest &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Hammer%20Time\"&gt;It's Hammer Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%206.2.0\"&gt;patch 6.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"That%27s%20Whack%21\"&gt;That's Whack!&lt;/a&gt; achievement was added. It requires scoring 45 points in a single session of Whack-a-Gnoll and rewards &lt;a href=\"Hogs%27%20Studded%20Collar\"&gt;Hogs' Studded Collar&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirebird's Challenge.\nAdded in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, near the fireworks vendor, guests are given ten seconds of flight and tasked to fly through 15 floating rings of fire, which are spread out all over Darkmoon Island (and not just the Faire area). Each fire ring flown through refreshes the 10-second flight timer. Fly through 10, 20, or 50 rings in a single Darkmoon Game Token-costing session to earn achievements: &lt;a href=\"Flying%20High\"&gt;Flying High&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ringmaster\"&gt;Ringmaster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brood%20of%20Alysrazor\"&gt;Brood of Alysrazor&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. Completing the Brood of Alysrazor achievement awards the toy &lt;a href=\"Blazing%20Wings\"&gt;Blazing Wings&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ziggie%20Sparks\"&gt;Ziggie Sparks&lt;/a&gt; runs the game and gives the quest &lt;a href=\"Firebird%27s%20Challenge%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Firebird's Challenge (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nDarkmoon Races.\n&lt;a href=\"Malle%20Earnhard\"&gt;Malle Earnhard&lt;/a&gt; runs the Darkmoon Races, starting at the boardwalk. The objective is to make it from the start/finish line to a set number of colored checkpoints, and then back to the finish line in as few bell tolls as possible, while taking advantage of speed and jump boosts and avoiding electrified fences.\nThere are a few quests:\nWait, speed boosts? There are a number of power-ups, which can be triggered by running over objects on the race course, including:\nWhile racing, players have access to a special ability while on the Racing Strider.\nThe Real Race is timed, and there are achievements awarded for completing the race in a set amount of time:\nSchedule.\nEach month, a new wrinkle is added. Old options are still available, and achievements are possible using each combination\nRace map.\nHere is the map for \"The Real Race\":\nDarkmoon Faire Dance.\nAdded in &lt;a href=\"patch%209.2\"&gt;patch 9.2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Simon%20Sezdans\"&gt;Simon Sezdans&lt;/a&gt; runs the Darkmoon Faire Dance in the &lt;a href=\"South%20Pavilion\"&gt;South Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;. Square off against dance masters and earn combos by matching their moves. Do your best and earn the following achievements.\nProfession quests.\nThe Darkmoon Faire offers a quest corresponding to each primary and secondary &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;. These can only be completed once per monthly faire, and only by players who have the corresponding profession. Some quests can be completed at the faire, and some require ingredients imported from outside the faire, but Archaeology is the only one that asks for anything that cannot be purchased at a goods vendor near the Faire Staging Areas. Completing each quest awards one &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Game%20Token\"&gt;Darkmoon Game Token&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Prize%20Ticket\"&gt;Darkmoon Prize Ticket&lt;/a&gt;s, and 5 skill points in the associated profession!\nAll the profession quests require the player's skill level to be at least 75 in order to see the following quests.\nOther activities.\nDarkmoon Cards.\nAn important function of the Darkmoon Faire is to allow the return of decks of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Cards\"&gt;Darkmoon Cards&lt;/a&gt;. These are collectible sets of cards which may be created through &lt;a href=\"Inscription%23Darkmoon_cards\"&gt;inscription&lt;/a&gt; or (for level 60 and level 70 cards) found as loot. When all the cards in a set are collected, they form a deck. Higher-level decks may be returned to The Darkmoon Faire for an epic trinket. Lower-level decks reward the returner with more modest items. Returning any kind of deck also awards reputation with the Darkmoon Faire.\nRefer to &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Cards\"&gt;Darkmoon Cards&lt;/a&gt; for a complete list of the rewards, and the sources of the cards.\nFortunes.\nLocated between the Southern Pavilion and the Ring Toss, &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt;, a wise &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;, will give guests a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%20Fortune\"&gt;fortune&lt;/a&gt; after answering a couple of questions. With this fortune guests are given a buff, which will depend on the answers given. This buff lasts two hours.\nTest Your Strength.\n&lt;a href=\"Kerri%20Hicks\"&gt;Kerri Hicks&lt;/a&gt; challenges adventurers to go forth and challenge worthy opponents and bring back trophies of your victories to show just how strong you can be. She offers the quest &lt;a href=\"Test%20Your%20Strength\"&gt;Test Your Strength&lt;/a&gt;, which requires the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Adventurer%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide&lt;/a&gt; to be in the bags. Kerri gives 10 prize tickets for bringing back 250 trophies.\nIt is anticipated that players will carry the adventurer's guide with them even when the faire is not accessible to keep accumulating artifacts and trophies to turn in when the faire returns.\nDarkmoon Zoo Bizarre.\nNear the end of the faire, is the zoo, which is run by &lt;a href=\"Yebb%20Neblegear\"&gt;Yebb Neblegear&lt;/a&gt;. The zoo contains many animals and even a petting area with penguins, bush chickens, rams, and even ponies. The rams and ponies can also be ridden. There's a special VIP waiting area in which random VIPs wait for a tour. Oddly, Yebb calls his zoo a \"Bizarre\" rather than a Bazaar.\nDeathmatch Pit.\nLocated at the &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch%20Pavilion\"&gt;Deathmatch Pavilion&lt;/a&gt;, contestants compete every three hours (starting at midnight) for a chance at the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Treasure%20Chest\"&gt;Darkmoon Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt;. \nEnter through the gate at any time to enter the contest, or for some free for all action, even when no prize is available.\n&lt;a href=\"Korgol%20Crushskull\"&gt;Korgol Crushskull&lt;/a&gt; will announce when the chest is soon to appear.\nBattle Pets.\nJust south of the Shooting Gallery where the Tonk Free-for-All originally was is a spectator ring, with Gilnean Master Pet Tamer &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Feasel%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Jeremy Feasel&lt;/a&gt; ready to take on all challengers. You may challenge Feasel once a day with one &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Game%20Token\"&gt;Darkmoon Game Token&lt;/a&gt; for a bag of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Pet%20Supplies\"&gt;Darkmoon Pet Supplies&lt;/a&gt;. There is a rare chance of getting a new companion from the bag, the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Eye\"&gt;Darkmoon Eye&lt;/a&gt;. The associated quest is &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Pet%20Battle%21\"&gt;Darkmoon Pet Battle!&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn 6.0.2, &lt;a href=\"Christoph%20VonFeasel\"&gt;Christoph VonFeasel&lt;/a&gt; has appeared to show up Jeremy. Use a Darkmoon Game Token and defeat Cristoph to receive a bag of &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Darkmoon%20Pet%20Supplies\"&gt;Greater Darkmoon Pet Supplies&lt;/a&gt;. Rarely in the bag is the magical pet &lt;a href=\"Syd%20the%20Squid\"&gt;Syd the Squid&lt;/a&gt;. The associated quest is &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Darkmoon%20Challenger%21\"&gt;A New Darkmoon Challenger!&lt;/a&gt;.\nMerry-Go-Round.\nThe Darkmoon carousel has been installed between The Darkmoon Cannon and the Shooting Gallery. For to , varying by level, &lt;a href=\"Kae%20Ti\"&gt;Kae Ti&lt;/a&gt; sells a &lt;a href=\"Ride%20Ticket%20Book\"&gt;Ride Ticket Book&lt;/a&gt;, which contains five &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Ride%20Ticket\"&gt;Darkmoon Ride Ticket&lt;/a&gt;s. Stepping onto or riding the carousel will grant the &lt;a href=\"WHEE%21\"&gt;WHEE!&lt;/a&gt; buff, granting +10% to reputation and experience gains, the duration of which will increase in 5-minute increments every couple seconds the Carousel is ridden up to a maximum of 1 hour. Players will be teleported out of the area if they have no ticket, in the same way they are removed from the sideshow areas without having started (or at the end of) the respective game.\nTickets are consumed when a fresh buff is granted (without having one yet or after it has expired), whereas returning before the buff falls off allows refreshing of the duration without paying a new ticket. You are still required to have a ticket with you in order to enter the area, so each character that plans to employ the buff during the event needs 2 tickets, one to get in the first time, and one to refresh the duration. The tickets are not soulbound and can, therefore, be sent to alts accordingly.\nA player may also save by buying the tickets at a low level and sending them to 5 high-level characters - remember, mailing costs money too.\nSandbox.\nA children's sandbox is located at the northeastern side of the fairgrounds. It contains several rideable Sandbox Tigers, which function identically to &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20%22Tiger%22\"&gt;Darkmoon \"Tiger\"&lt;/a&gt;s. Around the sandbox are four tonk controllers, available for free-for-all matches.\nThe Tauren Chieftains' concert.\nAt the top of every hour &lt;a href=\"The%20Tauren%20Chieftains\"&gt;The Tauren Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; perform &lt;a href=\"Power%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Power of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; on their own stage.\nDarkmoon Despoiler.\nPlayers equipped with a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Adventurer%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide&lt;/a&gt; have the opportunity to obtain artifacts that are occasionally dropped by &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt; bosses and enemy players. These artifacts can be accumulated even when the Faire is not active, and start quests to turn themselves in to &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Thaddeus%20Paleo\"&gt;Professor Thaddeus Paleo&lt;/a&gt; (for the most part - &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yebb%20Neblegear\"&gt;Yebb Neblegear&lt;/a&gt; each also accept one item). Each of the nine can only be redeemed once per Faire, but all nine items may be turned in each month, and reward &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Prize%20Ticket\"&gt;Darkmoon Prize Ticket&lt;/a&gt;s for everyone. Completing all nine quests awards the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Despoiler\"&gt;Darkmoon Despoiler&lt;/a&gt; achievement, including 2 sub-achievements for the dungeon-specific and PvP-specific drops separately.\nGryvern roller coaster.\nAdded in &lt;a href=\"patch%208.1.5\"&gt;patch 8.1.5&lt;/a&gt;, for a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Ride%20Ticket\"&gt;Darkmoon Ride Ticket&lt;/a&gt; sold by &lt;a href=\"Mae%20Ti\"&gt;Mae Ti&lt;/a&gt; one can take a roller coaster ride on a Gryphon or a Wyvern seat. Completing a ride awards you with the &lt;a href=\"WHEE%21\"&gt;WHEE!&lt;/a&gt; buff.\nWorld bosses.\nThere are two world bosses on Darkmoon Island, &lt;a href=\"Moonfang\"&gt;Moonfang&lt;/a&gt;, a wolf that frequently spawns in the western forest, west of the main faire area, and the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Rabbit\"&gt;Darkmoon Rabbit&lt;/a&gt;, which rarely spawns in a cave on the southeastern shore of the island. Both will require a raid to defeat.\nDarkmoon Island.\nSince the Faire is the only time they have access to it, players should make sure to explore the non-Faire portions of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt; while they have a chance. The island's waters offer an impossible variety of fish appropriate to each fishing level and the chance to hook a &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Pony\"&gt;Sea Pony&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Shipwreck%20Debris\"&gt;Shipwreck Debris&lt;/a&gt; for those searching for a more unusual catch.\nTicket redemption.\nThe tickets earned by completing quests can be redeemed for a variety of vanity items and heirlooms from vendors near the center of the Faire. &lt;a href=\"Lhara\"&gt;Lhara&lt;/a&gt; sells companion pets and mounts, while &lt;a href=\"Gelvas%20Grimegate\"&gt;Gelvas Grimegate&lt;/a&gt; offers souvenirs and toys, including two transmogrification items, a 16-slot bag, &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Top%20Hat\"&gt;Darkmoon Top Hat&lt;/a&gt;s, and another companion pet. Daenrand Dawncrest makes all &lt;a href=\"Justice%20point\"&gt;Justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Heirloom\"&gt;Heirloom&lt;/a&gt;s available, and &lt;a href=\"Barum\"&gt;Barum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Baruma\"&gt;Baruma&lt;/a&gt; will exchange tickets for numerous replica items. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"Rona%20Greenteeth\"&gt;Rona Greenteeth&lt;/a&gt; will trade for two legs of old mutton usable as maces, at her food cart in the woods outside the Faire. See the ticket page for full item lists.\nRefreshments.\nThere's three booths found at the faire for refreshments:\nUnfortunately, the eating area and booths were built right next to the Tonk Challenge game, offering very little quiet while trying to enjoy your meal.\nThere is also a more questionable food wagon, just west of the faire in the nearby woods, that is run by &lt;a href=\"Rona%20Greenteeth\"&gt;Rona Greenteeth&lt;/a&gt;. She sells food that she has caught herself and made into dishes that may give customers pause.\nPavilions.\n\"Currently nothing exists in any pavilion and are currently under construction, except for the Deathmatch Pavilion.\"\nIn the RPG.\nThe Darkmoon Faire travels the world gathering mysterious delights and delightful mysteries. It spends most of its time in \"parts unknown,\" as its members say, but every month or so it stops south of Thunder Bluff in Mulgore, or near Goldshire in Azeroth's Elwynn Forest.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; tried, but he couldn't get a straight answer as to the Darkmoon Faire's history. No one seemed to know, or to want to tell him. Since the Darkmoon Faire appeared in the world only recently, it must have come to being only recently. Brann knows that Silas Darkmoon is in charge of the Faire and invented it. The Faire includes members of many different races, so his guess is that the Darkmoon Faire was once a small and forgettable operation that gradually recruited more interesting individuals until it was the Darkmoon Faire that exists today.\nThe Darkmoon Faire has a huge variety of tasks available for heroes, from crafting items to collecting obscure trinkets from the far corners of Azeroth. Heroes could also join the Faire, if they enjoyed its particular traveling lifestyle. As members of the Faire, the heroes fight monsters and bandits that attack the caravan as it travels \u2014 and, since no one knows exactly where the Faire goes when it's not in Mulgore or Elwynn, these creatures may be strange indeed. If the heroes prove able, they may be in charge of all defense for the Faire, including police-type action when the Faire is in session.\nThe Faire may also send the heroes on various quests of the sorts they would normally send adventurers on; doing so gives the heroes a constant source of patronage. As the heroes are eventually quite powerful, Silas Darkmoon may let them in on the Faire's secrets, and perhaps send them to much stranger locales to gather mysteries and relics.\nOrganization.\nThe most important members of the Darkmoon Faire are those who run the booths. The booths offer many different things: You can see the self-styled strongest woman in the world, play a variety of games involving hammers and thrown balls, eat delicious food, and drink yourself silly. Each vendor (for lack of a better term \u2014 not all of them sell goods) is in charge of his or her own booth and is in a constant state of improving his or her power to draw an audience. A vendor may alter her booth by providing new attractions or with new costumes or fireworks to enhance the booth's visual appeal.\nSilas Darkmoon is in charge of the Faire as a whole, but he allows his vendors pretty free rein. As long as the vendors bring in people who spend money, Silas is happy. Silas is also in charge of making sure the caravan moves when it's supposed to move and goes to the places to which it is scheduled. Many other individuals are also involved with the Faire, and these people's duties are myriad. They sweep trash and hammer spikes. They prop up tents and make the food for the vendors. They repair wagon axles and replace elderly pack animals. They are also responsible for protecting the caravan as it travels, and, as the Faire includes many noncombatants and travels through mysterious lands, this job should not be underestimated. They bludgeon their enemies with everything from maces to last year's mutton. These are tough customers!\nMembers.\nThe Darkmoon Faire is unique for many reasons; one of them is that its members come from all races. Alliance and Horde races are all represented in their ranks, as are members of neutral or ordinarily hostile races. Orc children dash about, trolls hawk food and games, gnomes expound on their services from brightly-colored booths, and a gnoll fortune teller reveals the future. If it is nothing else, the Darkmoon Faire is proof that the varied races can still work together for a common goal.\nThe Darkmoon Faire accepts anyone willing to make the trek with them, as far as I can tell. I believe that recruits must also swear an oath of secrecy so that they do not reveal the Faire's movements. Other than that, as long as you are reasonably healthy and dedicated, you are welcome to join. Enterprising businessmen can maintain their own booths, though the costs of building, maintaining, and transporting it fall to the owner. The entrepreneur also divides his profits between himself and the Faire, but benefits from the draw the Faire creates, the prestige of being associated with it, and the protection of journeying with a large and well-armed caravan.\nThe Faire always needs workers, as well, who do everything from set up stages to fight hostile creatures on the caravan's journeys. These folks are usually young and join the Faire because of a desire to travel the world and experience some excitement, but don't want to take the risks of being real adventurers.\nMost individuals who join the Faire share a few things in common. Since they spend so much time in foreign lands, most have no families (or don't particularly like their families). For similar reasons, the Faire attracts its fair share (so to speak) of criminals on the run, though these are usually con artists and similar types, as their skills are helpful for marketing and Silas Darkmoon allows no violence among his troupe.\nDarkmoon Faire Forces.\nThe Darkmoon Faire is not a military organization, so it doesn't have an official military. However, the Faire travels through dangerous places as it moves across the world, and not all of its patrons have its best interests in mind. When it is set up and functioning, the gold in its coffers and the magic items in its vaults make tempting targets for bandits. Thus, the Faire needs some sort of protection, and it gets it from the Faire workers who are also responsible for hammering tent spikes and mucking out the stables.\nAbout half the Faire workers have official combat training. These are soldiers, warriors, or, more rarely, &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s, hunters, or scouts. Scouts are particularly valuable as they are adept at blazing trails, avoiding dangerous wilderness areas, and tracking down mules and small children who wander away. If attacked while traveling, the caravan pulls into as close a formation as it can. The Faire workers move out to combat the threat. The noncombatants, including children and most of the booth proprietors, hide in the wagons. Those members who may prove useful in a fight \u2014 such as Silas Darkmoon, Professor Thaddeus Paleo, Kerri Hicks (the \u201cStrongest Woman Alive\u201d), and Sayge the fortune-teller \u2014 take up positions to defend the noncombatants and the stores of gold and magic hidden in the wagons. Some of them may move to the frontlines to assist the Faire workers if the situation warrants. The Darkmoon Faire has never suffered attack while it has been set up and entertaining patrons, but if it were, it would use similar tactics. Children and booth owners would hide wherever was convenient while the Faire workers grabbed whatever weapons were on hand to combat the threat. They would also petition their customers to help \u2014 and, as the Faire draws many adventurers, they could provide valuable support indeed.\nSpecial security forces in the Darkmoon Faire wear clown suits.\nActivities.\nThe Darkmoon Faire boasts a host of entertainments for the connoisseur of the questionable. On the surface, it appears to be a business, and it makes money by inviting people in to participate in a variety of games, ogle strange beasts, and see interesting sights and individuals, including the strongest woman in the world. You can also have your fortune read.\nThe Darkmoon Faire is a traveling carnival. When it's not vanished into mysterious parts of the world, it sets up its colorful booths and banners in Mulgore or Elwynn (so members of both the Alliance and the Horde can partake of its wonders). The Faire offers a variety of diversions for people of all stripes. Brann admit he was a little suspicious when he passed beneath the Faire's lively green and purple bunting for the first time. He doubted there was anything in there that would appeal to him \u2014 a dwarf of deep thoughts with an eye for true mysteries. Though the fact that members of various races would get together to create something like the Darkmoon Faire does have an intrigue.\nBrann think he was mostly correct \u2014 entering the Darkmoon Faire, you want to check your brain at the door. However, he underestimated the sheer entertainment value inherent in the place. The enthusiasm of the barkers and the booth minders and the patrons develops into something irresistible, and Brann found himself hooked. He also has a suspicion that the Darkmoon Faire is more than it appears.\nLocations.\nThe Darkmoon Faire frequents two places: an area of Mulgore southwest of Thunder Bluff, and the Elwynn Forest near Goldshire. Where the Darkmoon Faire is when it isn't in either of these places, Brann was not able to discern, nor did he know how it gets from one place to another. The closest thing to a real answer he got was that the Faire spends a substantial amount of time in \u201cparts unknown,\u201d supposedly meaning that they have no idea where the Faire is (instead of meaning that the Faire is in an area of Azeroth that we have yet to discover).\nBrann's personal theory is that the Darkmoon Faire wanders certain areas in the wilds of Azeroth, gathering secrets. He has a suspicion that the carnival is just a front. The Faire's true purpose is to gather information and uncover mysteries. He could appreciate this, as secrets and forgotten lore are far more valuable to him \u2014 and to many adventurers \u2014 than glowing table legs and a few hours of idle enjoyment. Perhaps Silas shares what he discovers, for a price, with those who know the proper way to ask.\nRelationships.\nThe Darkmoon Faire is a business (don't be fooled by the surprisingly few goblins involved), and good business practice is to be friends to everyone. The Faire splits its time between Mulgore and Goldshire, and therefore between the Alliance and the Horde; it is certainly a neutral organization. And unlike some other neutral organizations, it does not use violence and underhanded tricks to pursue its agenda. Thus, others tend to view the Darkmoon Faire with amusement, whether or not they ever avail themselves of its services. Of special note is the Faire's relationship with adventurers. It seems the Darkmoon Faire's members always have a need for free agents for one reason or another, from making boots to gathering missing cards to collecting the eyes of dead bats. The Faire pays its benefactors with Darkmoon Faire tickets, which the recipients can turn in to receive prizes \u2014 mostly of the mysterious \u201cWhat's in this box?\u201d variety. In this way, the Faire manages to secure outside services without really paying for them.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Gathering the exotic from around the world, &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; presents the Darkmoon Faire as a celebration of the wonders and mysteries found in Azeroth. While the Faire spends most of its time in parts unknown, they do stop from time to time in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;. \nDescription.\nThe Darkmoon Faire is an event that appears in the game. The location of the Faire rotates monthly among three locations:\nSetup takes the carnies three days; and the Faire opens early that Monday, and remains there for one week. &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%20Herald\"&gt;Heralds&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; announce the arrival of the Faire.\nThe Faire itself is neutral and can be visited by players of either faction regardless of the location. Naturally, on &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; servers, you will be flagged and subject to enemy player attack while it is in the other faction's area. On PvE servers, Alliance guards in &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt; can &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; on Horde players, especially in the north part of the Faire (the Faire in &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt; has no &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; guards nearby).\nFaire schedule.\nThe Darkmoon Faire visits once a month, starting at 12:01 a.m. on the Sunday before the 1st Monday of each month. The event dates are automatically added to the in-game &lt;a href=\"calendar\"&gt;calendar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tauren Chieftains' concert.\nTo celebrate the 2007 &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon\"&gt;BlizzCon&lt;/a&gt; event on August 3 and 4, &lt;a href=\"The%20Tauren%20Chieftains\"&gt;The Tauren Chieftains&lt;/a&gt; (aka Level 70 Elite Tauren Chieftain) made a guest appearance at the new Darkmoon Faire location outside of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; city. At the top of every hour for the duration of BlizzCon, they performed &lt;a href=\"Power%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Power of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; on a special stage set up for the occasion.\nhttp://blue.cardplace.com/newcache/us/676238677.htm\nThe concerts still occurred up to August 12 but after the Faire moved away the concerts did not return. It was likely only for the debut of the Shattrath location, and that the band would be making regular appearances at &lt;a href=\"World%27s%20End%20Tavern\"&gt;World's End Tavern&lt;/a&gt; in Shattrath from then on.\nVendors and other NPCs.\nThe Faire has some vendors and some special NPCs.\nDarkmoon Faire Prize Tickets.\n are used like currency to purchase Darkmoon Faire prizes from &lt;a href=\"Gelvas%20Grimegate\"&gt;Gelvas Grimegate&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkmoon Faire prize vendor NPC. The Darkmoon Faire tickets are soulbound, so you cannot trade them. They can be saved up, in stacks of 200. The tickets are the same and can be earned and spent at any Darkmoon Faire location.\nPrizes purchased with tickets.\n&lt;a href=\"Gelvas%20Grimegate\"&gt;Gelvas Grimegate&lt;/a&gt; sells the following items in exchange for your tickets:\nYou will not be offered prizes that are above your level.\nEarning tickets.\nThe easiest way to earn five Darkmoon Faire Tickets is by finding the Darkmoon Faire herald and doing the Darkmoon Faire quest (find the Darkmoon Faire and locate the prize-turn-in NPC). Five tickets are enough for a , which is level-appropriate for a character in the teens to low twenties. This quest gives 75 rep with the Darkmoon Faire (82 rep for human characters, with 10% rep bonus). This low amount can alter your availability of turn-ins (see following); one way around this is to postpone completing this quest until after you have turned in your items. \nThe primary way to earn Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets is to provide Darkmoon Faire NPCs with requested items in exchange for tickets. You earn tickets by turning in animal parts or some trade-skill goods (see list following). These are &lt;a href=\"Quest%23Repeatable%20quests\"&gt;repeatable quests&lt;/a&gt;, but will only be available to you depending on your level, and as your &lt;a href=\"%23Reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with Darkmoon Faire increases, easier turn-ins are no longer offered. Each turn-in gives 250 rep with Darkmoon Faire (275 for human characters, with their 10% rep bonus). This means that every turn-in consumes a limited number of turn-in slots (for all except the top-level turn-in, which does not cut off). To maximize the value of your turn-ins and so you are not stuck with items you can no longer turn in for tickets, note when each item turn-in cuts off. \nYou can turn in quest items produced by a profession even if you do not have that profession; this is a change from past WoW versions. There are only turn-in quests for &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"leatherworking\"&gt;leatherworking&lt;/a&gt; items, but there are also farmable animal part turn-ins. Each kind of turn-in, by profession or animal parts, is offered by a different Darkmoon Faire NPC. Look around the Faire for the one you want; they are easy to find. \nThe following list shows the animal parts turn-in, then the blacksmithing, engineering, and leatherworking turn-ins as a series of tiers arranged by availability and cutoff. For each of the following tiers, you may turn in any set of the listed items as a single turn-in transaction. Each tier also lists the number of Darkmoon Faire (DMF) tickets given as a reward, the required character level, the reputation cap, and the total number of possible turn-ins, and the possible number of turn-ins if you have already completed the earlier tiers, for normal reputation gain (and for humans with a 10% rep bonus).\nTier 1.\nYields 1 DMF Ticket, requires level 1, cuts off at 401 reputation.\nYou can do 2 turn-ins (same as a human); 2 if you do the herald quest first (same as a human).\nPer turn-in:\nTier 2.\nYields 4 DMF Ticket, requires level 10, cuts off at 1100 reputation. \nYou can do 5 total or 3 more turn-ins (4 total or 2 more as a human); 5 total or 3 more if you do the herald quest first (4 total or 2 more as a human).\nPer turn-in:\nTier 3.\nYields 8 DMF Ticket, requires level 20, cuts off at 1625 reputation. \nYou can do 7 total or 2 more turn-ins (7 total or 2 more as a human); 7 total or 2 more if you do the herald quest first (6 total or 2 more as a human).\nPer turn-in:\nTier 4.\nYields 12 DMF Ticket, requires level 30, cuts off at 2500 reputation. \nYou can do 11 total or 4 more turn-ins (not same as a human); 10 total or 3 more if you do the herald quest first, (9 total or 3 more as a human).\nPer turn-in:\nTier 5.\nYields 20 DMF Ticket, requires level 40, unlimited. \nYou can do any number of these tier 5 turn-ins.\nPer turn-in:\nYou will be offered all of the quests in a tier, if the tier is available to you. Each turn-in is independent. You can mix and match turn-ins until you reach the rep limits. \nThe highest level quests (tier 5) remain available, although they are implemented as two sets of quests, one set that gives reputation that does cut off and is replaced by another set that does not give reputation and does not cut off. \nSince the number of turn-ins is limited, if you want to earn as many tickets as possible, do the highest tier available to you, and since Tier 5 is unlimited, do it last. Even consider holding off doing low-value turn-ins and save the turn-in slot for better turn-ins. In particular, consider skipping the tier 1 quests, which yield only one ticket each.\nTicket transactions as quests.\nBoth the item turn-ins to earn tickets and the ticket turn-ins to purchase prizes are implemented as quests. So, although the Darkmoon Faire Ticket works kind of like currency, and the ticket turn-in NPC works kind of like a vendor, quest completion changes happen in a dialog box when you turn in items in exchange for tickets or purchase prizes with tickets. For instance, each time you transact, the dialog closes, so, unlike a vendor, where you can purchase a stack of something just by clicking on the item, the Darkmoon Faire Ticket turn-ins require a separate dialog with the NPC for each turn-in. Also, to do a turn-in to earn tickets or use tickets for a purchase, you need an open slot in your quest log to accept (and then complete) the quest.\nSee the item article, &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%20Prize%20Ticket\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire Prize Ticket&lt;/a&gt;, for a full list of ticket-earning quests and ticket purchase quest; the same transactions as are listed above, in quest format. \nDarkmoon Cards.\nAn important function of the Darkmoon Faire is to allow the return of decks of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Cards\"&gt;Darkmoon Cards&lt;/a&gt;. These are collectible sets of cards which may be created through &lt;a href=\"Inscription%23Darkmoon%20cards\"&gt;inscription&lt;/a&gt; or (for level 60 and level 70 cards) found as loot. When all the cards in a set are collected, they form a deck. Higher-level decks may be returned to The Darkmoon Faire for an epic trinket. Lower-level decks reward the returner with more modest items. Returning any kind of deck also awards reputation with the Darkmoon Faire.\nRefer to &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Cards\"&gt;Darkmoon Cards&lt;/a&gt; for a complete list of the rewards, and the sources of the cards.\nBuffs.\nIf you go to the fortune-seeking &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt;, he will tell you your fortune by giving you a strong buff and a small note. You can receive a new buff only after at least two hours and if your buff has run out.\nThe buff he gives you depends on what you answer to his questions. See the &lt;a href=\"Sayge%27s%20Fortunes%23Guide%20to%20Answering%20Sayge\"&gt;guide to Answering Sayge&lt;/a&gt;.\nReputation.\nIncreasing Reputation.\nAll players begin at 0/3000 Neutral with the Darkmoon Faire. You cannot be \"at war\" with the Faire. Up to 2000 friendly, the primary method of increasing reputation with the Darkmoon Faire is by turning in items requested by various NPCs around the Faire.\nRefer to the section &lt;a href=\"%23Earning%20tickets\"&gt;Earning tickets&lt;/a&gt; above for detailed information on item turn-in quests. Each turn-in increases Darkmoon Faire reputation by 250, (275 for human characters, due to 10% reputation bonus). As your reputation increases, certain turn-in quests will become unavailable and you must rely on more difficult ones. Once your reputation passes a certain number, you can no longer turn in those items.\nThe table shows how many turn-ins you can do for each tier; keep in mind that the Rep displayed is after the turn-in.\nUpon reaching 2250 reputation into Friendly (5250 total rep), turn-ins will no longer provide reputation gains. All turn-in quests will be replaced by \"More\" versions; for example, &lt;a href=\"Thorium%20Widget%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Thorium Widget (quest)&lt;/a&gt; will be replaced with &lt;a href=\"More%20Thorium%20Widgets\"&gt;More Thorium Widgets&lt;/a&gt;. These quests reward the same amount of tickets, but zero reputation. Upon hitting this reputation level, the Darkmoon Faire NPCs' gossip text changes.\nThe simplest method of increasing your reputation beyond this point is by turning in decks of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Cards\"&gt;Darkmoon Cards&lt;/a&gt;. Lesser decks, which can be assembled from cards made by &lt;a href=\"inscription\"&gt;Scribes&lt;/a&gt;, award 25 reputation each. These may be turned in at any time, even if the Darkmoon Faire is not running. Major decks, which are assembled from cards made by &lt;a href=\"inscription\"&gt;Scribes&lt;/a&gt; or found as loot, award 350 reputation; they may only be turned in when the Darkmoon Faire is running.\nIf you haven't already completed them, the quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;The Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; will both give you a further 75 reputation above 2000 Friendly, but are not repeatable. Both versions are available to any race of both factions, and are not mutually exclusive, although it will be difficult for an Alliance member to get the Horde quest, and vice versa.\nA final method of gaining reputation above 2000 Friendly is completing any of the four versions of the quest entitled &lt;a href=\"Your%20Fortune%20Awaits%20You...\"&gt;Your Fortune Awaits You...&lt;/a&gt;. Four of the possible twenty-nine fortunes offered by &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt; at the Darkmoon Faire start this quest. They have players seek a chest in &lt;a href=\"The%20Deadmines\"&gt;The Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;The Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Palemane%20Rock\"&gt;Palemane Rock&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Eastvale%20Logging%20Camp\"&gt;Eastvale Logging Camp&lt;/a&gt;. These quests reward 75 reputation each, (as well as the contents of the chest) and they can be repeated, provided you are able to get the fortune again. Because of the long cooldown on Sayge's fortunes and the approximate 14% chance to get one of these fortunes, increasing your reputation this way is very slow work.\nThere is no known benefit from Darkmoon Faire reputation beyond the discount on the food, drink, special items, and the already cheap beer; although at the reputation level at which turn-ins stop giving reputation, Silas Darkmoon hints at rewards for those who continue to earn reputation.\nInsane in the Membrane.\n reputation with Darkmoon is one of the requirements for the &lt;a href=\"Insane%20in%20The%20Membrane\"&gt;Insane in The Membrane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Feat%20of%20Strength\"&gt;Feat of Strength&lt;/a&gt;.

It\u2019s unbelievable! You\u2019ll be dazzled. You\u2019ll be amazed! You aren\u2019t prepared for the Darkmoon Faire, \u2018cause it\u2019s like nothing you\u2019ve seen before!

The Darkmoon Faire ain\u2019t what it used to be and it ain\u2019t where it used to be. The management hasn\u2019t changed but the Faire certainly has.

Things have changed \u2018round here: we\u2019ve got an island all to ourselves now, and what an island it is. Mist-shrouded Darkmoon Island is a conundrum wrapped in an enigma. It\u2019s a place of mystery and wonder, and you wouldn\u2019t believe the deals we made to get it\u2026 or who we made \u2018em with. But never mind that, just follow me right through here and I\u2019ll show you what the Darkmoon Faire is all about.\nAll new! All spectacular!\nCatch a show at the marvelous main stage or witness a dazzling fireworks display. But don\u2019t stare too long or you might miss the stunning spectacles that surround you. Gaze in awe of our magical menagerie, get your fortune told by the amazing &lt;a href=\"Sayge\"&gt;Sayge&lt;/a&gt;, go on a pony ride, experience the healthful effects of carnival food, and more!\nOf course, there\u2019s more to the Darkmoon Faire than just fantastic shows and culinary delights. You can still turn in your &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Card\"&gt;Darkmoon Card&lt;/a&gt;s, but you wouldn\u2019t just come here for measly ol\u2019 cards when there\u2019s so much more to see, experience, and win. Yes, win! You like dancing bears, right? Everybody likes dancing bears. Even bears like dancing bears. How about a dancing bear\u2026 you can ride!\nThat\u2019s not all! We have adorable companion pets includin\u2019 a fez-wearing monkey, a plethora of profession recipes, toys, balloons, souvenirs, delectable carnival snacks and beverages, heirlooms for the little ones, and even replicas of long-lost suits of armor that we\u2019re offering for your Transmogrification needs. You can also make your mark with new achievements and titles. All it takes to earn these fabulous rewards is a few Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets and a good reputation with the carnies. How do ya get your grubby mitts on some tickets? I\u2019m glad you asked!\nStep right up! Try your luck! Everyone\u2019s a winner!\nHave we got games? You bet we\u2019ve got games, and they\u2019re so easy to play an orc could do it. Just head on over to the midway, buy some &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Game%20Token\"&gt;Darkmoon Game Token&lt;/a&gt;s, and get ready to play. Easy to learn, difficult to master, anyone can play and everyone can win. Just lay your tokens down for a chance at winning Darkmoon Prize Tickets playing games like &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%23Whack-a-Gnoll\"&gt;Whack-a-Gnoll&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%23Tonk%20Challenge\"&gt;Tonk Battle Royale&lt;/a&gt;, the Cannon, &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%23Ring%20Toss\"&gt;Ring Toss&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%23Shooting%20Gallery\"&gt;Shooting Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, and more! Five games are there to test your skills at any one time. The better you play, the easier it is to win a bucket of Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets! Once a month, you\u2019ve got a shot at tickets, and the fun never stops \u2018cause you can play as many times as you like. But that\u2019s not the only way to win big!\nThe Darkmoon Faire Field Guide\nIt\u2019s your passport to riches, my friend. Y\u2019see, we need a few things -- just some junk, nothing valuable to a big hero like you. We call \u2018em Darkmoon Artifacts, and there\u2019s all different kinds to be found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Adventurer%27s%20Guide\"&gt;Darkmoon Field Guide&lt;/a&gt; helps you discover artifacts while you\u2019re explorin\u2019 dungeons, slayin\u2019 monsters, and fightin\u2019 in Battlegrounds. Without a guide, you\u2019d never notice \u2018em, and it\u2019ll help keep you focused on the stuff we want. Whether you just reached level 10, or you\u2019ve crushed the biggest baddies in the land, we need somethin\u2019 from nearly everybody. You won\u2019t have to go too far out of your way to get \u2018em and each month you\u2019ll get a new opportunity to seek out an Artifact for us. What do you get out of the deal? Don\u2019t you worry, you\u2019ll get your cut. When you bring a Darkmoon Artifact back to us, you\u2019ll get valuable experience (it builds character, you know!), earn a better reputation, and possibly earn precious Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets too!\nOh, did I mention that you can use the Field Guide to get to Darkmoon Island whenever the Darkmoon Faire\u2019s monthly extravaganza is up and running?\nSo, you want to work in show business?\nMaybe you\u2019d like a little peek behind the scenes, eh? Want to see what it takes to run the greatest show on Azeroth? Well, it\u2019s not all sunshine and cotton candy, my friend. There are beasts to heal, food to cook, and buildings to fix. If you\u2019re willing to help keep the show going and put your skills to work, you\u2019ll not only impress us, but you can get experience, Darkmoon Prize Tickets, and even polish up your skills -- up to five skill points per profession, per Faire week, if you\u2019re good at what you do!\nDarkmoon Deathmatch!\nLike any good carnival, the Darkmoon Faire has a shady side. You can leave the skilled labor to the suckers and go for a faster score instead. If you\u2019ve got the minerals, the Darkmoon Deathmatch offers an experience unparalleled since the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Pitmaster%20Pei\"&gt;Pitmaster Pei&lt;/a&gt; has a big old treasure chest just brimming with goodies and Darkmoon Faire Prize Tickets that he\u2019ll drag out into the &lt;a href=\"Deathmatch%20Pavilion\"&gt;Darkmoon Deathmatch Pit&lt;/a&gt; every three hours or so. Everybody wants it, so if you want a piece of the action you\u2019ll just have to jump in and prove that you\u2019re the toughest one in the Pit.\nOh, the Faire is perfectly safe, Clem. Just don\u2019t wander into the woods.\nNow, now, don\u2019t panic. Darkmoon Isle might be a bit spooky, but except for the Deathmatch Pit, the Faire itself is completely safe, I guarantee it. It\u2019s a sanctuary even, and we won\u2019t let anybody\u2019s beef ruin the fun. The shadowy woods surroundin\u2019 the fair are another thing entirely, though. I wouldn\u2019t say that people have disappeared into those woods never to return, but, well\u2026 people disappear into those woods never to return. So watch your step, and your back, when you leave the Faire. Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn ya!\nMark your calendar\nNow that you know how amazing the new Darkmoon Faire is, you won\u2019t want to miss it. Just take a look at your in-game calendar, and the Darkmoon Faire dates will show up there on the first week of every month. Darkmoon Faire barkers and displays will also pop up in every capital city to herald the arrival of the Faire. &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt; himself has even started up a mailer to make sure that no one misses out!\nHitch a ride\nDuring the first week of each month, convenient Darkmoon Faire outposts with Darkmoon Portals will appear in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;, offering free rides to Darkmoon Island and the Faire!\nDarkmoon Mages in capital cities and on Darkmoon Island will also be around to help you get between the Faire and various capital cities. There\u2019s no such thing as a free lunch, so naturally you\u2019re obliged to compensate them for their services.\nThe all new Darkmoon Faire is coming to Darkmoon Island in patch 4.3. Don\u2019t miss it!\nGetting there.\nPlayers can reach the island via the portal in the Darkmoon Faire Staging Grounds that are set up near one of their major cities:\nTo quickly get to the staging grounds you can pay a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire%20Mystic%20Mage\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire Mystic Mage&lt;/a&gt; located in each major city to teleport you - the price is low and varies by character level.\nGetting out.\nOther than using a &lt;a href=\"Hearthstone\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt; or other personal teleportation methods, players need only travel to the southernmost point of the island to the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Boardwalk\"&gt;Darkmoon Boardwalk&lt;/a&gt; where a Portal Back is under a small tent. Taking the portal will take you back to the staging grounds in either Elwynn Forest or Mulgore, depending on your faction.\nIf you portaled to the island and immediately remembered you forgot something, you can just turn around and use the Portal Back to your faction's staging ground.\nGeography.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; itself is the biggest feature of the zone, situated in the flat, south-central part of the Island and occupying nearly half of that region. The Faire borders the beach in the south, which extends around to the east and northwest until it runs into cliffs. Darkmoon Island's most prominent geographical feature is a high ridge, inaccessible in places, running along the north and east sides of the island. Portals from Elwynn Forest and Mulgore deposit players on the ridge in the north, where they can follow a &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Path\"&gt;path&lt;/a&gt; south down the ridge to the Faire. The entire interior of the island, aside from the Faire itself, is heavily forested.\nSpeculation.\nAlthough the exact location of the island is a mystery, it's likely to be between the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, due to being in the Great Sea, ability to catch fish found only in northern Azeroth, and there's occasionally a &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; visiting the faire. Tuskarr are said to die just a few days after leaving their own climate. Although this is somewhat proven wrong by &lt;a href=\"Trawler%20Yotimo\"&gt;Trawler Yotimo&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Anglers%20Wharf\"&gt;Anglers Wharf&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt however may be south of the Maelstrom, since it's revealed in the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; raid, during the &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Spine of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; encounter, that the area north of the Maelstrom may be entirely known as the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt;, since the encounter takes place &lt;a href=\"Above%20the%20Frozen%20Sea\"&gt;Above the Frozen Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Battle Pet Daily Tamer addon show &lt;a href=\"Jeremy%20Feasel%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;Jeremy Feasel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Christoph%20VonFeasel\"&gt;Christoph VonFeasel&lt;/a&gt; as being South of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;."}

After \"Warlords of Draenor\" was released however, due to too many &lt;a href=\"loot%20ninja\"&gt;loot ninja&lt;/a&gt; raid leaders, combined with the Rabbit's long spawn timer during a limited event, the loot rule was changed to personal loot only. If a player cannot loot the corpse, then that person did not have the pet drop for them.\nStrategy.\nThe Darkmoon Rabbit is a &lt;a href=\"graveyard%20zerg\"&gt;graveyard zerg&lt;/a&gt; boss encounter, rarely found in the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island%20Cave\"&gt;Darkmoon Island Cave&lt;/a&gt; on the southeastern tip of &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Island\"&gt;Darkmoon Island&lt;/a&gt;. Upon attacking the beast, it will attempt to melee whoever has the most threat, and thus can be tanked while not casting it's special move. Periodically, it will cast HUGE, SHARP TEETH!, and jump on a random player's neck and deal 25% of the target's health as damage every second. The targeted player will run around in fear, and the effect also reduces incoming healing by 100%. However, absorption shields (like ) will help mitigate the damage. Targeted players will frequently die, but very well geared players may survive.\nIf killed, players will spawn in the tent with the &lt;a href=\"Injured%20Carnie\"&gt;Injured Carnie&lt;/a&gt;s, and should quickly run southeast back to the beach. It is important to stack on the beach or in the cave near where the rabbit was first engaged, as the rabbit will reset or evade if taken anywhere other than the cave or the beach. If feared, it is important to attempt to remain near the stack. Killing the rabbit takes time, but as long as the rabbit stays near the cave it should die without problem.\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe Darkmoon Rabbit appears as a in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". Its flavor text reads: \"That's no ordinary rabbit! That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on!\"\nTrivia.\nDue to the appearance of the Darkmoon Rabbit and the nature of the boss fight, it is a reference to the in \"\". The achievement title references the moment after the group charges en masse to kill the Killer Rabbit, only to lose two more knights and retreating. After ascertaining their losses to be a total of three knights, King Arthur declares, \"Well, we'd better not risk another frontal assault; that rabbit's dynamite!\""}

{"id": "638098", "revid": "541395", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=638098", "title": "Sharding (term)", "text": "Sharding is a game design tool created to prevent player overcrowding in outdoor areas of \"World of Warcraft\", and improve server performance.\nBehavior.\nWhen too many players are in an area, the game automatically creates a new \"shard,\" a copy of that area. Players entering the area will be placed on the new shard. The world appears identical from the player's perspective, with minor differences:\nShards can be any geographic size but are usually limited to &lt;a href=\"zone\"&gt;zone&lt;/a&gt;s or smaller areas. The borders of a sharded area are invisible to players.\nBy design, players usually do not notice when the game moves them between shards, but players may notice NPCs momentarily disappear.\nSharding is enabled on all &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;retail \"World of Warcraft\"&lt;/a&gt; normal realms. Sharding is disabled by default on retail &lt;a href=\"RP\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt; realms to facilitate player-run events, but Blizzard occasionally enables it on these realms for server stability when needed.\nSharding and parties.\nWhen joining a &lt;a href=\"party\"&gt;party&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; party, all party members are automatically moved to the leader's shard, but only if they are in the same zone as the leader. If they are not in the same zone as the leader, party members will not change shards. Joining (or leaving) a party, toggling &lt;a href=\"War%20Mode\"&gt;War Mode&lt;/a&gt;, and toggling &lt;a href=\"Chromie%20Time\"&gt;Chromie Time&lt;/a&gt; are the only known ways for players to move themselves to a different shard. \nComparison to related tools.\n&lt;a href=\"Phasing\"&gt;Phasing&lt;/a&gt; is distinct from sharding. Phasing refers to the changing of the world's appearance to match the player's current progress in the story. For example, the area surrounding &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; appears different depending on whether you've completed the Wrathgate questline. But similar to sharding, players in different phases cannot see each other. (Although &lt;a href=\"Party%20Sync\"&gt;Party Sync&lt;/a&gt; allows players who have progressed to different stages of the story to \"sync\" and share the party leader's phase.)\n&lt;a href=\"Layering\"&gt;Layering&lt;/a&gt; is the same as sharding, but affects an entire &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt;, covering \"all\" zones. Layering was used to alleviate overcrowding at the launch of &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Classic\"&gt;World of Warcraft Classic&lt;/a&gt;, but was later removed.\n&lt;a href=\"Cross-realm%20zones\"&gt;Cross-realm zones&lt;/a&gt; (CRZ) is very similar to sharding, but is designed to prevent \"under\"-crowding. If a zone on a realm has very few players, the game automatically moves players from multiple realms into the same \"instance\" of the zone (effectively a shard) to make it \"feel active and alive.\""}

Simply hold DPS or have very light DPS and make sure that once one of the tanks has been impaled, the other tank taunts Gal'darah off and tanks him so the first tank can also be impaled.\nOnce everybody has been impaled, he can be killed normally. Do not worry if a non-tank gets killed by an impale, as they still count for the achievement. A healer being killed can make it slightly more difficult, but no more than usual.\nA death mid-fight, with a battle res, does NOT discredit the party, nor the player who died, from getting this achievement."}

They are found in all seas of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, nearly all of them being aggressive.\nSharks have no true bones, only cartilage. Because their feeding habits involve biting things with a great deal of force, losing teeth is common. Therefore, sharks have multiple rows of teeth which they replace constantly throughout their lifetimes. After birth, newborn sharks quickly flee their hungry mothers. Their early independence makes them dangerous, even while young.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20Man%20Barlo\"&gt;Old Man Barlo&lt;/a&gt; mentions spear-hunting mammoth sharks off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and needing a special toxin to do it.\nKnown species.\nThere exists many types of sharks, but due to the limited models created, all them tend to look alike except for the new models created for the \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion.\nIn the RPG.\nThese carnivorous fish are aggressive and liable to make unprovoked attacks against anything that approaches them. Smaller sharks are from five to eight feet long and not usually dangerous to creatures other than their prey. Large sharks can reach around fifteen feet in length and are a serious threat. Huge sharks are true monsters, like great whites, that can exceed twenty feet in length.\nSharks circle and observe potential prey, then dart in and bite with their powerful jaws. A shark can locate creatures underwater within a thirty-foot radius. This ability works only when the shark is underwater. A shark can notice creatures by scent in a 180-foot radius and detect blood in the water at ranges of up to a mile.\n&lt;a href=\"Aquatic%20shaman\"&gt;Aquatic shaman&lt;/a&gt; turn into ghost sharks rather than &lt;a href=\"Ghost%20Wolf\"&gt;ghost wolves&lt;/a&gt;."}

During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, he was seen in the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a &lt;a href=\"flight%20master\"&gt;flight master&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHe has recently been captured by the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Master%20Talonaxe\"&gt;Gryphon Master Talonaxe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Thadius%20Grimshade\"&gt;Thadius Grimshade&lt;/a&gt;, sent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to save him in &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Priestess%20Hexx\"&gt;Vile Priestess Hexx&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to Aerie Peak where he lives happily with his parents, Swiftwing and &lt;a href=\"Keenclaw\"&gt;Keenclaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nSharpbeak no longer needs saving and is now a powerful fully matured elite gryphon. Found in the same location as before, he appears to be assisting the Wildhammer dwarves in an attack on the Vilebranch trolls.\nDragonflight.\nSharpbeak found a rider in &lt;a href=\"Sheridon%20Hastle\"&gt;Sheridon Hastle&lt;/a&gt; and with him joined the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt; on the joint Alliance-Horde scientific study of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately at some point after entering the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt; below the isles, Sheridon was killed by &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zaqali%20tribe\"&gt;Zaqali tribe&lt;/a&gt;. This sent Sharpbeak into mourning to the point of refusing to eat, until an adventurer (possibly the very same who once saved him from the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch\"&gt;Vilebranch&lt;/a&gt;) helped to comfort him."}

Swimming is slower than &lt;a href=\"running\"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;, but faster than &lt;a href=\"walking\"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen your character is in the water, press the &lt;a href=\"sit\"&gt;sit&lt;/a&gt; key will dive deeper, while pressing the &lt;a href=\"jump\"&gt;jump&lt;/a&gt; key will surface. You can hold the left mouse button to look around. You can hold the right mouse button and then move your mouse up and down to change your swim direction. Moving your character forward or backwards will then make them swim in the direction you have chosen. As a ghost or while water-walking, pressing both mouse buttons and angling the camera downward will allow your ghost to swim.\nWhen underwater, a character begins to run out of &lt;a href=\"breath\"&gt;breath&lt;/a&gt; and may drown. Resurfacing will allow the breath bar to slowly refill. Some underwater places have 'pockets of surfacing air' visualized as underwater air bubbles coming from cracks in the crust or barnacle-like models - you can stay there and fill your breath bar. These pockets are usually places in places related to some underwater quest. Deeper waters (such as around the &lt;a href=\"continent\"&gt;continent&lt;/a&gt;s) will fatigue characters, whether they are above or below the surface. When either the breath bar or &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; bar expires, characters begin to take damage. Both drown and fatigue damage can be healed, allowing the character to go on for a little longer. \n&lt;a href=\"Ghost\"&gt;Ghost&lt;/a&gt;s do not have to breath underwater, but are still affected by fatigue and can be killed a second time.\nMounts.\nThere are swimming mounts that are specifically desgined to increase swim speed, with the caveat of only being truly useful in water. Many are gained through &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; or fishing up a currency, looting a rare, as a rare drop, or as a quest reward. Examples include:\nUnderwater Walking.\nUnderwater walking is a new movement mechanism introduced in &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that allows the character to function as if he/she is on land when standing or walking on the seafloor. This includes water breathing, the ability to eat or drink while on the seafloor, the ability to mount on the seafloor, and increased movement speed while not mounted and walking on the seafloor. "}

There she understood why they were free; the Lich King's weakening, incapable of widely mind-controlling all of his undead minions. The dreadlords were plotting to exploit his weakness and overthrow the &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Dark Lord's greatest champion&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas agreed to assist them and a small alliance (of convenience) was formed.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt; started to plot against the self-styled &lt;a href=\"king\"&gt;king&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, making a trap, attempting to kill him. Arthas was able to escape from the Dreadlords' trap from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"Bloodfeast\"&gt;a powerful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; in the process. After Sylvanas sent her banshees to rescue Arthas and escort him across the river but in truth, she was luring him into a trap. Ner'zhul warned Arthas that he had been deceived, but was too late as Sylvanas successfully immobilized the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; with an arrow. Sylvanas was about to destroy Arthas but was stopped by the timely intervention of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Lady was forced to retreat but vowed to never stop hunting Arthas.\nDeclaration of war.\nLater Sylvanas was visited by Varimathras, who offered her a chance enter the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; through joining their new order, but Sylvanas refused to give up her newfound freedom and remorsefully insulted the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; stating that she lived as a slave long enough and that she wouldn't relinquish her freedom by shackling herself to fools like them. Varimathras replied by attacking Sylvanas' base but the banshee used her surgical tactics to fight back and used her banshee power and her banshees to boost her once-low-numbers and succeed in putting the dreadlord against the wall. Varimathras surrendered and offered his services to Sylvanas in exchange for his life. She agreed, but kept him on a very tight leash.\nAt this time the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;Plaguelands civil war&lt;/a&gt; was already escalated. Opposing Sylvanas' Forces were the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater the Dark Lady used Varimathras to obtain much information about his nathrezim brothers in order to plot an attack on &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;'s forces base. Detheroc, instead of eliminating the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt; had mind-controlled the &lt;a href=\"%3AGrand%20Marshal\"&gt;:Grand Marshal&lt;/a&gt; and his forces, boosting his own with them.\nSylvanas and her forces led a covert assault in the night and destroyed much of Detheroc's and Garithos' strongholds. After Detheroc was torn to bloody shreds, Garithos and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;his men&lt;/a&gt; were freed from the spell and formed a temporary alliance with Sylvanas to recover their lost lands. Unbeknownst to him, however, Sylvanas had no intention of giving them their lands back.\nOne day before the final confrontation, Sylvanas gathered her followers and discussed the next steps and the alliance with Garithos' humans. &lt;a href=\"Lydon\"&gt;Lydon&lt;/a&gt; was among them.\nSylvanas, Varimathras, and Garithos led a final assault against &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;'s center base. Sylvanas led from the front, while Garithos led from behind. The joint assault eventually destroyed Balnazzar's stronghold. Sylvanas then ordered Varimathras to kill Balnazzar as a final test of loyalty. Though hesitant, Varimathras supposedly complied with the task, but unknowingly to Sylvanas, the dreadlord left Balnazzar alive to hide later. And so, Garithos then demanded that Sylvanas leave immediately, grossly and coarsely stating that he wanted \"her wretched animals out of his city\". However before he could complete his threats, Sylvanas ordered Varimathras to kill him as well, to which he quickly and gladly carried out the order.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; under her control, Sylvanas declared that her forces were no longer part of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. From then on, they would be known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, which started building their new bastion and capital to their newly-founded kingdom on Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;ruined&lt;/a&gt; Capital City's sewers: &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nAllies.\nSylvanas and her banshees mind-controlled the following:"}

Vowing to avenge her death, Sylvanas gathered other renegade undead and set out to wage war against the Scourge. Thus it was that the Forsaken came to be, with Sylvanas as their queen. Under Sylvanas' command, the Forsaken joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and later helped bring about the Lich King's fall in the frozen wastes of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. She seeks a higher purpose for a people who have already died once.\nYet many challenges still lay ahead for Sylvanas. After an &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; within her ranks that killed other members of the Horde, the banshee queen is now mistrusted by many of her allies. Most recently, Sylvanas began fortifying her territory within the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; in order to establish a proper kingdom for her followers. While Sylvanas maintains that her loyalty to the Horde is undiminished, some of the faction's members are uncertain about her true intentions.\nAfter the fall of the Lich King, Sylvanas came to the shocking realization that she, like Arthas before her, was damned to an eternity of darkness and torture in the afterlife. Yet she also found new purpose when she met the ancient evil controlling this realm, an entity known only as the &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer\"&gt;Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. She formed an alliance with him, and shortly after entered into a pact with the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Sylvanas to regain her place in the realm of the living for as long as her Val'kyr survive. Sylvanas would initially claim that she considered her people a bulwark against the horrifying darkness that awaits her in the end. However, the truth of the matter was that she needed them to create as much war and death as possible to deliver souls to her new ally. To this end, she subsequently launched an aggressive attack into the regions of Lordaeron and the greater Eastern Kingdoms not directly under her control, in an attempt to conquer the continent and secure it for the Forsaken, while securing all souls lost for the Jailer.\nMortally wounded during the battle for the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; declared Sylvanas as his successor with his dying breath, leaving her to lead the Horde against the invading forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Following the Legion's defeat, Sylvanas led the Horde against the Alliance in a &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; that spanned all of Azeroth.\nUpon being challenged to &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; by the defector &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas easily defeated him after a short combat with the help of her newfound powers, but in the process revealed to the spectators of Horde and Alliance that these matters meant nothing to her, implying that she was dealing with matters of a much grander scale. Ultimately, Sylvanas left everyone behind and flew away from Orgrimmar in the form of a dark smoke, yet despite the appearances, there were those who were &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;still loyal&lt;/a&gt; to her cause.\nAfter defeating &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and shattering the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas opened a doorway into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and worked side by side with the Jailer, under the belief they would shatter the systems of Death and grant everyone free will. However, upon discovering that she had been lied to and that her ally intended to have everyone (herself included) serve him, she declared that she'd never do so. The Jailer responded by returning the fragment of her soul she'd long been missing, rendering her unconscious and abandoning her to her enemies. &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; helped the two disparate parts of Sylvanas' soul reunite, and a remorseful Sylvanas subsequently set about making amends for her sins by aiding the heroes of Azeroth in working against the Jailer and freeing &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; from his control. After the Jailer's defeat, Sylvanas submitted to the judgment of her archenemy &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who sentenced her to freeing all of the souls trapped in the Maw as the first step toward penance for her crimes.\nSylvanas serves as one of the main characters in ', ', and \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\". However, Sylvanas has recently become more antagonistic, serving as one of the main antagonists (alongside &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;) in ', and a major antagonist in '.\nBiography.\nRanger-General of Silvermoon.\nSylvanas was a member of the prominent &lt;a href=\"Windrunner\"&gt;Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; family of the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas was the middle sister between the oldest sister &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, and the youngest sister &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;. She also had a brother named &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lirath&lt;/a&gt;. Her family lived at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt; in the tranquil forests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas joined the &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; and eventually became their leader, rising to the rank of &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, the military leader of all high elven forces, succeeding her mother &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lireesa&lt;/a&gt;.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas earned a reputation as a fearless and cunning ranger while battling the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Some time before the Second War, Sylvanas admitted the highly talented &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; into the ranks of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;. This decision surprised many of her compatriots, such as &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Renthar%20Hawkspear\"&gt;Renthar Hawkspear&lt;/a&gt;. Some of Sylvanas' comrades took note of the inordinate amount of pride Sylvanas took in her human disciple and opposed the notion of allowing a human to train with the elven rangers. Sylvanas frequently visited Nathanos at his home at the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt;, officially to hear reports, but rumor spread throughout the Farstriders that she was involved in a romantic relationship with her human pupil. Sylvanas visited Nathanos at the Marris Stead shortly before the onset of the Second War. She spoke to him of a potential invasion of Quel'Thalas from the Horde and met Nathanos' young cousin, &lt;a href=\"Stephon%20Marris\"&gt;Stephon Marris&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas asked the boy if he wanted to be a ranger when he grew up, but he replied that he wanted to be a &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas gave him a gold coin and told him to keep it until he was old enough to buy his first sword. Before leaving, Sylvanas spent the night at the stead.\nEven the high elven prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; took an issue with Nathanos and sent a letter to Quel'Thalas demanding Sylvanas dismiss the human from the ranger corps. Despite this opposition, however, Sylvanas persisted, and her response was simply that Nathanos would be a loyal ally. This would prove correct, as Nathanos' talent allowed him to become the first and last of the human ranger lords, being promoted by Sylvanas herself, and was responsible for victories spanning a decade of conflict.\nThe Second War.\nDuring the Second War, the high elves initially sent only token support to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, though Sylvanas' older sister Alleria took her squad of rangers and joined the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nAfter the forests of Quel'Thalas mysteriously began to burn, Sylvanas and her rangers set out to discover the cause. She came across both her sisters being chased by a band of forest trolls, whom they dispatched quickly. Alleria alerted Sylvanas of the coming orcish Horde, and that it was they who were burning Quel'Thalas with &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; fire. Sylvanas and her rangers moved quickly to meet the Horde and trap them between themselves and the Alliance forces under the command of the paladin &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. The battle took many turns but ultimately the Horde abandoned Quel'Thalas. Sylvanas stayed behind to hunt down any remaining orcs. Shortly after, the Horde was defeated, the Dark Portal destroyed, and the Second War ended.\nSometime after the Second War, Sylvanas raised her second-in-command Lor'themar Theron to the rank of Ranger Lord of the Farstriders.\nAs the humans started rebulding Stormwind, she attended the inauguration of the newly erected statues dedicated to the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt;. She is also the author of the plaque of Alleria's statue.\nInvasion of the Undead Scourge.\nAfter the high elves withdrew from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas and her rangers were the primary guards against any would-be attackers on &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Several years later, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the betrayer of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, arrived unexpectedly on the doorstep of Quel'Thalas with a horde of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; at his back. &lt;a href=\"Kelmarin\"&gt;Kelmarin&lt;/a&gt;, one of Sylvanas' scouts, quickly informed her of the swarm of undeath fast approaching the first &lt;a href=\"elfgate\"&gt;elfgate&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas organized her &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, and went to observe the despoiler of Lordaeron herself.\nShe came face-to-face with Arthas and suggested that the death knight turn back. However, Arthas retorted that death itself had come to Quel'Thalas, and began his assault on the first elfgate. Despite the Farstriders' best efforts, Arthas was able to successfully crash through it with his necromantic allies, and hulking &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s acting as sentient siege engines. Sylvanas and her surviving rangers fled back to the second gate, and Sylvanas came to the grim realization that she could not win this battle. However, she held out hope that the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; - if they knew what was approaching - could still turn the battle around. She had another ranger rush to inform them that Quel'Thalas may have been &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;betrayed&lt;/a&gt;, and observed as the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; wrought a trail of &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;dark, unholy destruction&lt;/a&gt; upon the land.\nArthas continued relentlessly towards the second gate, killing every elf who got in his way. The fallen prince soon learned that the second elfgate was only passable with the use of the &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20the%20Three%20Moons\"&gt;Key of the Three Moons&lt;/a&gt;, assembled from the mooncrystals hidden within the forest. Sylvanas destroyed the bridge leading to the second gate in an attempt to halt the undead advance, though all her effort proved in vain as Arthas successfully collected all the mooncrystals for the gate and ordered his mind-devoid minions to create a huge bridge of bodies to supplement the destroyed passage.\nOnce Arthas had bested the gate, Sylvanas retreated to &lt;a href=\"Fairbreeze%20Village\"&gt;Fairbreeze Village&lt;/a&gt;, and had its citizens evacuated. With little more than her most stalwart rangers left by her side, Sylvanas resolved to make a final stand before Arthas could push his way into &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Every runner she sent to Silvermoon was murdered, and Sylvanas coordinated an aerial &lt;a href=\"dragonhawk\"&gt;dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; attack to counter the invaders. However, this too proved mostly futile. Knowing that her own death approached, Sylvanas could think only of her sister, &lt;a href=\"Alleria\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, and gazed upon a &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;necklace&lt;/a&gt; gifted to her by her elder sibling. Sylvanas mused that they would likely be reunited soon.\nSylvanas' final stand was against Arthas himself just east of Fairbreeze Village, fast closing in on Silvermoon, who at this point was frustrated at the harsh resistance Sylvanas had given him. The two engaged in combat, though the exhausted ranger-general was unable to match the power of &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, which shattered her weapons and pierced through her abdomen.\nAccording to Arthas, it was Sylvanas who brought doom on the high elven people; initially, his only goal was reaching the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas the Banshee.\nThe official story given by the high elves of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; had the Ranger-General having perished valiantly in battle against the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and her body being burned to ashes in the fire that had devastated half the capital. &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; had been told a different story: that Sylvanas was instead captured, horribly mutilated, then finally slain for &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' pleasure. In this version of events, her body was taken into a dark temple, where Arthas corrupted her soul, transforming her into a haunting, mournful phantom called a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; that was left to roam the ruins of Quel'Thalas.\nIn truth, as Sylvanas lay dying after being impaled by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, she told Arthas to finish her, saying she deserved a clean death. Having had to fight her every step of the way, Arthas responded by telling her the last thing he would give her was the peace of death. Moments after Sylvanas passed away into a comforting darkness, she felt agony unlike any she had ever known. Arthas ripped her soul back into the world and Sylvanas Windrunner became the first of the high elven banshees. Frostmourne fractured her soul, consuming a fragment of it and leaving that part frozen in time while the rest of her continued onward. As a banshee, she was able to give voice to her pain, and in so doing she would cause pain to others. Her body was flung onto a meatwagon, lost among the thousands more the Scourge had claimed, and would later be locked in an iron coffin as a further act of vengeance upon the ranger-general.\nSylvanas, now an undead banshee, was granted a number of unconventional abilities by Arthas. Though bound to his will completely, in a process she likened to a puppet master pulling strings, Arthas allowed her to retain her self-awareness - so that she might witness the destruction she would bring to her people firsthand. Sylvanas the banshee was paraded in front of Silvermoon as something of a trophy, and though the high elves were shocked to the core, Sylvanas could not help but feel pride as they continued their futile, brutal struggle against Arthas. Though Arthas had been able to fill the first crossing with bodies to form a passage, Sylvanas gloated to him that he would never be able to do so to reach &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas plunged Frostmourne into the ocean and created a path of frost for his army to use instead.\nArthas began his brutal assault on the Sunwell, and Sylvanas watched helplessly as he engaged in single combat with the high elven ruler, &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;High King Anasterian Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;. She hoped dearly that the aged king could put an end to him, though knew that it was not possible. Her hopes were raised when Anasterian managed to dismount Arthas by grievously wounding his skeletal steed, &lt;a href=\"Invincible\"&gt;Invincible&lt;/a&gt;, though the act only served to enrage Arthas further, and King Anasterian fell, both body and soul, before Frostmourne. Sylvanas witnessed the rebirth of &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; via the destruction of the Sunwell and overtaken with grief, let out a banshee's screech that almost deafened the army but only amused Arthas. However, Sylvanas could not help but feel elated to see the traitor, &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, cut down by Arthas as well.\nWith that, the mighty elven homeland of Quel'Thalas suffered its darkest hour. The former ranger-general accompanied Arthas to a demon gate, where Kel'Thuzad communed with &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;. The demon instructed them to attack &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; next, and Sylvanas mocked Arthas for a hint of regret she could sense within him - pertaining to someone he perhaps had \"fond memories\" regarding - &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Arthas quickly silenced her, exerting his dominion over her spirit, though Sylvanas could not suppress a smirk of satisfaction. Over time, Sylvanas would listen to Arthas' talks, including mentions of the location of her body. She was ultimately present for the summoning of Archimonde after the fall of Dalaran.\nReturn to Lordaeron.\nSylvanas became one of Arthas' primary generals, and she remained behind in Lordaeron with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; under the watchful eye of the dreadlords, who had been left stationed in Lordaeron to protect it in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; was defeated at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas would quickly learn of this news from Kel'Thuzad. As the months passed, the dreadlords were still ignorant of their master's defeat. &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, the three prime dreadlords overseeing Lordaeron, were convening under Sylvanas' undead, watchful eyes when Arthas stormed into the stronghold, fresh from his journey to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. He informed them of the Legion's failure and his intentions to take control of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlords fled, outraged but unwilling to risk their lives by battling Arthas' army.\nArthas approached his servants and ordered that Lordaeron be purged of all life as a tribute to &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. Kel'Thuzad, however, informed him that human refugees had begun to flee from the outer villages, and that, should they escape into the mountain passes, they would be impossible to track. Arthas stationed himself and his two generals on the three possible escape routes and they each led detachments of undead troops against the fleeing humans while taking great pains to ensure that few, if any, made it past their blockade to safety. Despite the efforts of the paladin &lt;a href=\"Dagren%20the%20Orcslayer\"&gt;Dagren the Orcslayer&lt;/a&gt; and his companions, Sylvanas led her banshees into battle against the human refugees, aided in the destruction of all the remaining villages in her area, and slaughtered any human trying to escape. Finally, Sylvanas, Arthas, and Kel'Thuzad arrived at the central headquarters of the paladins and killed them all in a vicious battle, annihilating the last of the civilian presence in Lordaeron.\nThe Dark Ranger.\nAround this point, the weakened Ner'zhul began to lose control of the minds of Sylvanas and a number of banshees. She kept this discovery from Arthas and Kel'Thuzad while continuing to serve. The dreadlords extended an invitation for Sylvanas to speak with them in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and explained that they knew the cause, and arranged a secret meeting with her. They told her that Ner'zhul's \u2014 and by extension Arthas' \u2014 powers were beginning to diminish. The &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; intended to use this opportunity to seize control of Lordaeron. Sylvanas tentatively agreed to assist, but under the condition that her aid would be provided on her own terms.\nRight after the meeting, Sylvanas summoned her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, and together they went to &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt; in search of her body. Sylvanas found her body locked into a coffin as requested by Arthas to further torment her., as well as her bow. She then prepared a special poison with &lt;a href=\"woundwood\"&gt;woundwood&lt;/a&gt; and troll poison and tested it on a bear. The dreadlords planned on killing Arthas within the capital, but Sylvanas created a contingency plan in the case of Arthas' escape. She arranged for her banshees to feign allegiance and escort him through woods to a field where she would be waiting for him. After Arthas survived the dreadlords' ambush and escaped the capital, Sylvanas' loyal sisters saw him to the arranged place and then killed his bodyguards.\nSylvanas thought that punishing Arthas would absolve her of the crimes he had forced her to commit against her people during the invasion of Quel'Thalas. Hiding in the shadows, she struck him with an arrow she had crafted \u2014 a venomous sting that would paralyze him. Arthas was furious at her betrayal and demanded that she finish him. But Sylvanas refused to show him the mercy of a quick death and intended to make him suffer \u2014 as he had made her suffer in undeath. She was about to begin her grisly work with a dagger in her hand but was stopped by a female shade and the arrival of Kel'Thuzad and his undead army. Sylvanas and her banshees were forced to flee but vowed to never stop hunting Arthas.\nAfter the failed attempt, Sylvanas returned to Quel'Thalas once again, and this time she entered the vicinity of &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Retreat\"&gt;Farstrider Retreat&lt;/a&gt; where she found Lor'themar and Halduron. She overheard them speaking about the fallen quel'dorei and the undead still present. As she was to reveal herself, her friends mentioned nightmares of Sylvanas massacring their people and pointed out that Sylvanas was no more as she would have found a way to resist Arthas' command during the invasion, and they considered her to be gone. With all that heard, she decided not to make her presence known and quietly left the dead forest back to Lordaeron.\nQueen of the Forsaken.\nArthas left for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, having been summoned by the Lich King, and Kel'Thuzad went into hiding. Sylvanas and her sisters were freed, but Sylvanas was still troubled. Though free from Ner'zhul, she and the other free-willed loyalists remained monstrous abominations in appearance.\nHer thoughts were interrupted as Varimathras arrived on the scene. The dreadlord invited the banshee to join him and his brothers in their new order. But Sylvanas was not so quick to relinquish what freedom she had just gained. She told him that her assistance was enough, and demanded to be left alone. Varimathras ominously warned that those who were not part of this new land would be cast aside and that she had best not vex the new rulers of the Plaguelands. Sylvanas was adamant. As Varimathras departed, Sylvanas knew that an attack was imminent. But with only her banshees and some lesser undead to serve for her, Sylvanas was certain that she would soon fall. She needed to acquire an army.\nScouting the outer wilderness, Sylvanas found a plethora of creatures who would serve her well, and with her banshees at her disposal, they would have little choice in the matter. She sent out her banshees to possess &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt; the leader of the local ogres, the &lt;a href=\"Bandit%20Lord\"&gt;Bandit Lord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackthorn\"&gt;Blackthorn&lt;/a&gt;, the gnoll ruler &lt;a href=\"Snarlmane\"&gt;Snarlmane&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Murloc%20Puddle%20Lord\"&gt;Murloc Puddle Lord&lt;/a&gt;. Those she did not possess were killed. With so many new allies, Varimathras was quick to fall before her. But after she defeated him, Varimathras begged for his life, saying that he could serve her well. He knew his brothers' tactics, and where their bases were located. Sylvanas knew trusting such an insidious creature was a risk but felt that she could control him enough for her purposes. With Varimathras' assistance, they moved against Detheroc's forces.\nDetheroc had acquired a human puppet, &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;, and his men, and was using them to protect himself. Sylvanas had his scouts possessed and then infiltrated his base while their guard was down. As they slept, Sylvanas swept through the twin bases and slaughtered any before her. Though they eventually awoke and raised the alarm, it was too late. Sylvanas disabled the humans and ravaged Detheroc's forces, eventually coming to the dreadlord himself, and killing him swiftly. With the dreadlord dead, Garithos was freed from his mental control. Sylvanas saw him as arrogant and foolish but felt that she could use him. She lied and promised to relinquish control of the Capital to him if he helped her kill Balnazzar.\nThe night before attacking the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas met with the freed undead. She spoke about their purpose in the world and if they help her retake the Capital. An undead alchemist called &lt;a href=\"Lydon\"&gt;Lydon&lt;/a&gt; asked her what would become of Garithos' humans. She responded that they would just serve for the battle.\nGarithos attacked from the rear entrance to the city as Sylvanas and Varimathras came from the front. As they moved into the city, Sylvanas found caches of items left by the Lordaeron royals and used them to further the assault. Despite the dreadlord's demonic allies, his forces were destroyed, and, as a final test of loyalty, Sylvanas demanded that Varimathras kill Balnazzar. Varimathras froze, saying that it was forbidden for one Nathrezim to kill another. But she required Varimathras to prove his loyalty to her. Varimathras obeyed and struck down Balnazzar. However, whether by accident or design, Balnazzar later re-emerged as a leader of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Varimathras was not so reluctant when Sylvanas ordered him to do the same to Garithos.\nWith all their enemies dead, Sylvanas made a proclamation to Varimathras. They would rule the Plaguelands as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and would stake out their own destiny, where none would get in their way.\nSylvanas quickly went about founding her new empire of undeath. Freeing as much undead from the Lich King's dominion, and organizing them into a new nation of their own, Sylvanas attacked the royal catacombs beneath the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; - the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; - and took it over for the Forsaken. The Forsaken have since worked to complete Arthas' plans in the Undercity; extending its dungeons and tombs considerably to forge a functional capital for their own use.\nVarimathras then told her about Arthas' fate in Northrend - that he merged with the Lich King and was now seated on the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. From her Forsaken, Sylvanas learned about what had happened with King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20chamber\"&gt;imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt; and was told that his blood was even on the crown, but the crown was nowhere to be found after her battle with Balnazzar. Nevertheless, she did not care for the chamber's throne or the lost crown as her plan was the Undercity. Once, as she stood in the chamber, lost in the memories of her friends, family, lover, as well as thoughts of her new leadership role, she was suddenly approached by a Forsaken who introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt;. He told her about his plan to create &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;|a new plague&lt;/a&gt;, which Sylvanas allowed him as she needed a weapon against Arthas as well as to protect her new charges in order to send them at their enemies. After giving Putress the rank of grand apothecary and sending him to Varimathras for aid, she resolved to find Nathanos.\nShe spent a week scouring the Eastern Plaguelands but returned to the Undercity frustrated and without her former lover. As she returned to the Undercity, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Clea\"&gt;Dark Ranger Clea&lt;/a&gt; informed her that they found Nathanos near his homestead raised as a Scourge. Sylvanas and her dark rangers returned to the empty stead, and she briefly wondered if Stephon had survived or became Scourge. Soon the group was attacked by plaguehounds, but the rangers quickly disposed of the beasts. They continued through nearby pockets of the undead, until they found him. Nathanos did not immediately recognize her and attempted to attack her with the unending rage filling the void in his soul, but was fettered by dark ranger arrows while Sylvanas called him to his senses. Sylvanas tore Nathanos free from the Lich King's will, a feat that had never done, as the Forsaken had simply regained their free will, and told her disheveled former pupil of the plight of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. She then named Nathanos her champion, in their quest to avenge themselves upon Arthas.\nAt some point, Sylvanas raised &lt;a href=\"Velonara\"&gt;Velonara&lt;/a&gt; as a dark ranger. She also encountered and freed &lt;a href=\"Reigol%20Valdread\"&gt;Reigol Valdread&lt;/a&gt; who initially assisted her but later asked her to release him from her service which she eventually agreed to do.\nThe Sunwell.\nSylvanas, the Banshee Queen, and leader of the Forsaken traveled to Quel'Thalas for her own reasons, but soon encountered the traitor &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan\"&gt;Dar'Khan&lt;/a&gt;, confronting him in the ruins of Silvermoon. She aided &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; in attempting to stop the traitor from claiming the Sunwell's energies; though she was initially unsuccessful, she distracted Dar'Khan long enough for &lt;a href=\"Anveena\"&gt;Anveena&lt;/a&gt; to regain her power and vaporize him. Sylvanas agreed to keep Anveena's identity a secret in the interests of preventing Arthas from gaining the Sunwell's power.\nJoining the Horde.\nThe Forsaken, having carved a functional empire of their own and with growing numbers by the day, knew that the next step to realizing their vengeance upon &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; was to secure their place in the world. Though Sylvanas had presided over the civil war in the Plaguelands and successfully conquered the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, how long the relatively small faction of the Forsaken could keep their holdings was unclear.\nAs such, Sylvanas looked to finding allies. To that end, she sent ambassadors to both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Her emissaries to the Alliance never returned. Sylvanas suspected that they hadn't survived long enough even to make it past the gates of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, her ambassadors to the Horde fared better with the &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; believing that Forsaken could be redeemed and spiritually revived. Hamuul brought Forsaken ambassadors to meet with &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, high chieftain of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; tribes, and Cairne agreed that the undead should be given a chance to thrive. Thus, the tauren convinced Warchief Thrall, despite his misgivings, to forge an alliance of convenience between the Forsaken and the Horde. This alliance of convenience has granted the Horde a better footing in the mostly &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; controlled &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and in turn, with the Horde's protection, and even the assistance of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken were able to keep their holdings in Lordaeron.\nThe Forsaken's dominion.\nHaving carved out an alliance with the Horde, the Forsaken looked to expanding their ever-growing empire of undeath. By freeing the minds of the undead under the sway of the Lich King, Sylvanas came to preside over an impressive faction of her own. Nathanos was named the champion of the Banshee Queen and took up residence on the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt; to train and direct his Queen's new champions.\nSylvanas sent &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to train under Nathanos, and later to help remove the zealous &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; presence constantly harassing Forsaken lands. Sylvanas sanctioned the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt;, which has quickly become one of the most powerful spy organizations on Azeroth, and also oversaw the early production of a master plague capable of bringing the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; to its knees - the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; rising to meet this goal.\nSylvanas tasked Varimathras with the conquering of the human and dwarven lands in southern Lordaeron.\nHallow's End.\nThe Forsaken have incorporated the notion of &lt;a href=\"Hallow%27s%20End\"&gt;Hallow's End&lt;/a&gt; into a core part of their culture. Sylvanas hails it as the night where the Forsaken are strongest - the night where their enemies fear them the most. She appears in a ghostly form outside of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; to burn the large &lt;a href=\"wickerman\"&gt;wickerman&lt;/a&gt;; much to the crowd's &lt;a href=\"Wickerman%20Guardian\"&gt;delight&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Wickerman%20Festival\"&gt;Wickerman Festival&lt;/a&gt; celebrates the anniversary of the Forsaken's campaign against the Scourge and Burning Legion and the birth of the Forsaken as a people.\nSince the Cataclysm, Sylvanas gives a new speech during Hallow's End, and there are sound files for this speech, just as Genn Greymane has.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nIn undeath, Sylvanas still considers herself one of the foremost protectors of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and repeatedly offered assistance in the form of supplies and troops to the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. This is due to the fact that the Dark Lady still had a lot of love for Quel'Thalas, its people, and identified with them on many fronts. Though the sin'dorei initially declined most of Sylvanas' offers, fearing a trick, the beleaguered elves eventually allowed Sylvanas to station Forsaken soldiers in their lands, most prominently in the village of &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt;. She appointed &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Mavren\"&gt;High Executor Mavren&lt;/a&gt; to assist &lt;a href=\"Dame%20Auriferous\"&gt;Dame Auriferous&lt;/a&gt; in defeating &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; because he used to fight the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas played a large part in convincing &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to accept the blood elves into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the battles in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, blood elven adventurers would travel to &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt; - Sylvanas' former residence - and acquire &lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;The Lady's Necklace&lt;/a&gt;, what was once a gift to Sylvanas from her elder sister, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;. It is delivered to the Banshee Queen herself, and Sylvanas is briefly taken aback by the sight of it. However, she quickly composes herself and lashes out at the adventurer - ensuring them that it means nothing to her and that Alleria Windrunner is a long-dead memory; dropping the necklace. She dismisses the adventurer from her chambers, though in a rare moment of emotion, summons a choir of &lt;a href=\"Highborne%20Lamenter\"&gt;high elven banshees&lt;/a&gt; and begins to sing a &lt;a href=\"Lament%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;melancholic song&lt;/a&gt; for her bereaved homeland. She then kneels down to pick up the necklace.\nOn behalf of &lt;a href=\"Mehlar%20Dawnblade\"&gt;Mehlar Dawnblade&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas would later assist sin'dorei &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; in the creation of a powerful &lt;a href=\"Scourgebane\"&gt;scourgestone&lt;/a&gt;; Sylvanas' intimate knowledge of the Scourge's workings proved essential in its creation.\nLegends: Crusader's Blood.\nSylvanas alongside Varimathras attacked a camp of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in Tirisfal Glades and defeated its leader, &lt;a href=\"Renee%20Lauer\"&gt;Renee Lauer&lt;/a&gt; who was responsible for the deaths of some Horde members. After this, Renee was resurrected as a Forsaken.\nArthas: Rise of the Lich King.\nSylvanas once went to see &lt;a href=\"Faranell\"&gt;Faranell&lt;/a&gt; who showed her the effects of the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;. She was satisfied with the result but warned Faranell that the Plague should never fall into the wrong hands. Arthas killed and consumed the dream form of Ner'zhul thus he became the only person known as the Lich King. In that moment, he opened his eyes, and Sylvanas felt that something terrible was happening.\nA Council for War.\nThe time had finally come to deal with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas and her chief &lt;a href=\"apothecary\"&gt;apothecary&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt;, met with &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; to plan their next move. After the duel between Garrosh and Thrall (fueled by Garrosh's belief that immediate action needed to be taken) was interrupted by a Scourge assault, Sylvanas helped to defend &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde victory, Thrall declared war upon the Lich King. Pleased, Sylvanas dispensed Putress to assist the Horde in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; - his vast knowledge of the plague surely being a beneficial addition to its arsenal.\nIn the Shadow of the Sun.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; now dedicated to a Northrend campaign, Lady Sylvanas and a group of &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dreadguard\"&gt;Royal Dreadguard&lt;/a&gt;s traveled to &lt;a href=\"Sunfury%20Spire\"&gt;Sunfury Spire&lt;/a&gt; to gain the support of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; towards the war effort. She was met by her old comrade, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, Regent Lord of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt; and the current &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas instructed Lor'themar to send a force of blood elves \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 to Northrend, though Lor'themar was apprehensive, reasoning that he had only just overcome the war on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas noted that the blood elves are a part of the Horde only by her hand and that if they do not mobilize they would surely lose its support - and Forsaken support in their lands.\nWith his arm twisted, Lor'themar relented, and agreed to send a contingent of blood elves to the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas prepared to leave, though Rommath was outraged at this turn of events. He threw Sylvanas' offers of aid back at her, stating that the situation was blackmail. Sylvanas informed him that all she desired was the strength to defeat their &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;greatest foe&lt;/a&gt; - and that moreover, her offers were just that - offers. Lor'themar quickly ended their conversation, and Sylvanas' eyes flashed for the briefest of moments at his &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt; farewell. She silently left.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe Horde thus began their assault on the frozen region of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. While the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;main Horde advance&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, attacked from &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;; the Forsaken - coming under the banner of the aptly named &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Hand of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; - assaulted the region from &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; with their considerable navy. Under Sylvanas' direct leadership, the Hand of Vengeance brought with it everything in the Forsaken's arsenal - including the penultimate phases of their enigmatic plague, which would be perfected during their time in Northrend.\nOne of the new Forsaken camps in Northrend was &lt;a href=\"New%20Agamand\"&gt;New Agamand&lt;/a&gt;, where most of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;'s members took up residence to finish perfecting the plague to unleash upon the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Lady Sylvanas had been methodically and patiently overseeing the creation of this contagion for several years now, and it seemed the time, at last, had come to test it on the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, whom Sylvanas had deployed in Northrend, would soon come to undertake this honor. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, after the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; appeared, Putress betrayed the Dark Lady and ordered the Forsaken to bombard the entire battlefield with their cursed &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;, killing &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and Horde alike.\nBattle for the Undercity.\nFollowing the disastrous assault upon &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, an uprising broke out within the Undercity. Varimathras and hordes of his demonic brethren, in league with Putress, overran the city, slaying all those who would not submit to their dark rule. Sylvanas herself nearly died in the coup, but managed to escape with a number of loyalists and fled to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Determined not to allow the &lt;a href=\"Nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlords&lt;/a&gt; a foothold in Horde territory, Thrall and Sylvanas planned an immediate counter-attack. In the midst of their planning, however, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; arrived with terrible news: in the wake of &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;'s death, King Varian was preparing for a possible war with the Horde. Jaina had been sent to elicit an explanation for the betrayal at the Wrathgate. Though Thrall and Sylvanas explained that the Horde was not responsible for Putress, Jaina had warned them that King Varian would most likely pursue retribution.\nSylvanas returned to the Undercity at the head of a Horde army, determined to retake her city. Along with Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, she led the assault into Undercity itself, &lt;a href=\"Lament%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;a cry for her people&lt;/a&gt; upon her lips. In the Throne Room, Sylvanas fought and finally slew Varimathras, retaking her throne. As this was occurring, King Varian launched his own assault on the Undercity from the sewers, eventually finding and killing Putress. Upon discovery of various Forsaken experiments on their human captives, King Varian was set on declaring war on the Horde. King Varian entered the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt; shortly after Varimathras' defeat, branding them monsters and charged at the Warchief and the Dark Lady. However, he was quickly teleported out of the battle by Jaina, who took the Alliance forces back to Stormwind.\nWith the battle over, Sylvanas was thus able to reclaim her throne, with the treacherous rebels put to death. Sylvanas was willing to take vengeance against the Lich King at almost any cost, even by making a weapon as deadly as the plague. Whether she was aware that Putress and Varimathras were planning to use the concoction remained a mystery. Rumors persisted that she knew about the attack at the Wrath Gate beforehand, and her denials did not assuage the doubts of her detractors. However, the entire Wrathgate fiasco did not sit well with Thrall, who dispensed a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; to keep watch over the Forsaken. With that, Sylvanas herself made the journey to Northrend - to finally deliver her vengeance upon Arthas.\nThe Frozen Halls.\nSylvanas led the Horde forces to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt; inside &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, to confront the &lt;a href=\"Escape%20from%20Arthas\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and gain her vengeance against Arthas for destroying Quel'Thalas and damning her to undeath. Accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Kalira\"&gt;Dark Ranger Kalira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Loralen\"&gt;Dark Ranger Loralen&lt;/a&gt;, she instructed Horde heroes in their battles through the accursed halls and joined with several Horde champions of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. Following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Ick%20and%20Krick\"&gt;Ick and Krick&lt;/a&gt;, Krick begged for mercy before Sylvanas and attempted to sate her with the knowledge that &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; itself is within the halls - unguarded. Krick was ultimately disposed of by &lt;a href=\"Scourgelord%20Tyrannus\"&gt;Scourgelord Tyrannus&lt;/a&gt;, and Sylvanas made the journey to the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;. Before entering the halls, they had to battle with Tyrannus. Right after his death, &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt; appeared and killed almost all the combatants except Sylvanas, her two rangers and the adventurers, who she pulled out of Sindragosa's range. She sent Kalira to get reinforcements and with Loralen and the adventurers entered the Halls of Reflection.\nUpon reaching Arthas' private chambers in the Halls of Reflection and standing so close to Frostmourne, Sylvanas felt the pain of her death to this blade renewed. Nonetheless, she attempted to commune with the spirits within the sword, hoping that \"salvation lies within\". At that point, the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; appeared, warning her that the Lich King was on his way, and of the foolishness of attempting to defeat him there. He revealed that even if Arthas were to be destroyed, there must be someone to take his place as master of the Scourge, lest they wash across the world like locusts, consuming everything in their path. To defeat the Lich King, Uther said, he must be destroyed at the place he was created: The Frozen Throne.\nJust then, the Lich King arrived and reclaimed his blade, consuming the soul of Uther within it. He summoned &lt;a href=\"Falric%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;, his two top lieutenants, to kill the intruders. While the adventurers battled the pair and the ghosts they summon, Sylvanas and Dark Ranger Loralen gave chase as the Lich King fled to his &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Throne\"&gt;inner sanctum&lt;/a&gt;. Upon defeating the death knights and their ghostly allies, the party found Loralen dead in the hallway and sounds of battle coming from the chamber before them - Sylvanas and the Lich King in single combat. Realizing he was too powerful to confront there, as Uther had warned, Sylvanas and her escorts fled, breaking through the ice walls and packs of undead minions the Lich King summoned to slow their progress. As they reached the outside, they realized that it is a dead-end, and resolved themselves to die in battle against the Dark Lord. Just then, the gunship \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" arrived on scene to rescue them. As they fled the Halls of Reflection, Sylvanas realized that the Lich King's powers have increased tenfold and that to defeat him, a mighty army was needed, one greater than even the Horde could muster.\nFall of the Lich King.\nEventually, Arthas fell in combat with &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; and his champions, ending his reign of terror. With the death of the Lich King, an adventurer bearing &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne\"&gt;Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt; finds a &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Chest\"&gt;Sealed Chest&lt;/a&gt;, containing various items, among them a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Sylvanas\"&gt;vial of blood&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer brings the vial to Sylvanas, waiting in &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Light's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nStormrage.\nAs the whole of Azeroth was enveloped within the effects of the Emerald Nightmare, so was the Undercity and the Banshee Queen herself. Sylvanas dreamt about being a high elf once again after the actually dead Varimathras had turned her back into one. However, her fears gripped her once more as the actually dead Lich King reappeared and tortured her while Varimathras betrayed her once again in her dream. &lt;a href=\"Sharlindra\"&gt;Sharlindra&lt;/a&gt; and the other denizens of the Undercity could not bring her out of the spell's grip.\nEdge of Night.\nAfter the death of the Lich King &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas ventured alone to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. While irritated that she was not there to see him fall, Sylvanas took solace in knowing that the work she had begun in the lush forests of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; was at last complete: Arthas was dead. With her life's - and unlife's - goal sated, Sylvanas could think only of the bright fate that had awaited her before Arthas tore out her soul and prepared to hurl herself from the citadel onto the saronite spikes below, the only thing capable of destroying her completely. As she contemplated the end of her long journey, nine Val'kyr encircled her, granting her visions of her past. Sylvanas ignored them and hurled herself off the Frozen Throne.\nSylvanas saw a vision of her peoples' future. Without her leadership, the bulk of the Forsaken was sacrificed by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in a failed assault on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Bulwark\"&gt;Bulwark&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Lydon\"&gt;Apothecary Lydon&lt;/a&gt; organizes a last, desperate counterattack against the invading Alliance forces. As the tide turned against them, the Forsaken threw themselves into raging fires rather than face the onslaught to come. As the vision ended, Sylvanas found herself floating in a dark void, where she knew only terror, cold, hopelessness, fear, and regret. She also ran into the ghost of Arthas and was surprised to find that all he was at this point was a frightened and lonely little boy. Looking at the man who had inflicted such torment, Sylvanas admitted that had her soul not been broken she may have actually felt pity for him despite what he had done to her. As she realized that this realm of anguish was to be her eternity, the Val'kyr appeared to her again. Led by &lt;a href=\"Annhylde%20the%20Caller\"&gt;Annhylde the Caller&lt;/a&gt;, they offered the Dark Lady a pact: instead of allowing Sylvanas to reside eternally in this terrifying realm, Annhylde offered to take her place if she binds herself to the remaining Val'kyr; a powerful vessel through which they can continue to exist as more than slaves, their fates intertwined. Sylvanas accepted the pact and was returned to the realm of the living surrounded by the eight remaining Val'kyr.\nSylvanas returned to &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, where Garrosh was leading the assault on Gilneas and stated that the invasion would be carried out her way; Garrosh begrudgingly accepted, and Sylvanas ordered her fleet around to the southern coast to harass the villages and split the defenders. Reflecting on what she had been through, Sylvanas realized that her people were no longer simply arrows in her quiver, but an important resource that would not be squandered.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; fiasco, the Forsaken as a whole came under scrutiny from the wider Horde. Use of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; was explicitly banned, though the apothecaries were permitted to work on a considerably weaker strain. Sylvanas was then ordered to move south into Gilneas because the Horde wanted a port in northern &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. She spearheaded the attack on Gilneas and was initially successful in conquering the city thanks to the efforts of her &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; allies. Through her ally, &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt;, she had learned that the legendary &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; was in Gilneas and sought custody of it.\nHowever, the Forsaken had not counted on the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneans&lt;/a&gt; controlling the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; that had spread among them, and the Gilneans uniting their forces after internal struggling to push the Forsaken out of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;. Backed into a corner, Sylvanas faces off against &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Prince Liam Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and a Gilnean resistance force. She quickly turns the tables despite her disadvantage, and aims a poisoned arrow at Genn - though Liam hurls himself in its way; dying in the process. Frustrated, and with the new Warchief's &lt;a href=\"General%20Warhowl\"&gt;presence breathing down her neck&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas orders the city to be drenched in blight to secure a certain victory. The Gilneans learn of this and begin to evacuate their citizens. With the battle over and Gilneas once again in Forsaken hands, Sylvanas retreats.\nHowever, the Forsaken lose their holdings in Gilneas after a night-time raid by the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt;. In a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; (whom Sylvanas does not appear to think particularly highly of), Sylvanas reveals the newest allies of the Forsaken - the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, the ascended vrykul women who once served the Lich King, and uses them to raise dead enemies as Forsaken as a solution to the undead not being able to procreate. After an insulting exchange with the highly revolted Garrosh, &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; is dispensed to \"guard\" the Dark Lady and keep tabs on the Forsaken.\nSylvanas personally takes to the battlefield in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, leading her army against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; counterattack from Gilneas. The Forsaken come under heavy fire from the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, backed by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; pack and the &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; troops. While the Forsaken forces begin to push forward with the help of their allies, old and new (&lt;a href=\"Orcish\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements and the Val'kyr, respectively), the latter efficiently bringing in the fallen to bolster their ranks, Sylvanas devises a plan to end the battle in victory- beginning with the resurrection of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Godfrey captures &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and delivers her to Sylvanas, Sylvanas heads towards the shattered &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; and gives &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; a choice: the surrender of the Gilneas Liberation Front or Lorna becomes one of the Forsaken. Darius decides to surrender and Sylvanas allows him to leave with his daughter and his men. Shortly afterward she is killed by Godfrey, who quickly flees to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; orders the Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Agatha\"&gt;Agatha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthura\"&gt;Arthura&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Daschla\"&gt;Daschla&lt;/a&gt; to fix her. After a moment of thought, the three Val'kyr sacrifice themselves and give Sylvanas life once more. This convinces Sylvanas beyond a shadow of a doubt that the Val'kyr are the future of her people.\nThe Dark Lady and her forces are eager to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, and the fallen (and resurrected) Prince &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, now a member of the Forsaken, along with &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Alina\"&gt;Dark Ranger Alina&lt;/a&gt; are presiding over the possible conflict. Sylvanas herself mused to Alina that the Forsaken's complete conquest of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; may be the only way they can find satisfaction, and perhaps, relief.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas disguises herself as &lt;a href=\"Lindsay%20Ravensun\"&gt;Lindsay Ravensun&lt;/a&gt;. She expresses dissatisfaction with how &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; deals with the Alliance - especially after the Alliance forces assault the Forsaken's side of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, despite Koltira's apparent truce with the enemy commander, &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas steps in to turn the battle around, unleashing the Val'kyr to secure a safe victory.\nAfter the Alliance is defeated, Sylvanas confronts Koltira about his ill-fated truce with Thassarian and scolds him for being weak. A portal to the Undercity is opened and Koltira is pulled through by a hooked chain, where Sylvanas will attempt to purge him of his compassion for Thassarian and make him more of a servant of the Horde - more specifically, a servant of Sylvanas and the Forsaken.\nLady Sylvanas later sends &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Cozwynn\"&gt;Lady Cozwynn&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, to serve as the Horde liaison to the new &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; Chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, in order to improve her relations with the Warchief and \"mend broken fences.\"\nSylvanas also arranged for &lt;a href=\"Godan\"&gt;Godan&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to create a powerful staff to recognize the service of a young Forsaken priest.\nLady Sylvanas and the Forsaken as a whole have come under the observation of the neighboring &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forces and certain members of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. As similarities between her and the Lich King increase, the Forsaken are now being watched very closely. Sylvanas also refused all attempts to negotiate the release of Koltira with the Ebon Blade.\nTides of War.\nSylvanas was present at the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; leader meeting called by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, in which the Warchief made clear his plans to attack and crush the nation of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas was opposed to this notion, wary that the Alliance may take their anger out on the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; if their main base of power on &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; is compromised. Sylvanas repeatedly looked to &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; for support, playing upon his sympathy, though Lor'themar gave her none.\nGarrosh assured Sylvanas that any counterattacks would be dealt with, and the Dark Lady dispensed &lt;a href=\"Frandis%20Farley\"&gt;Captain Frandis Farley&lt;/a&gt; to represent her during the siege of Theramore. After the war, &lt;a href=\"Malkorok\"&gt;Malkorok&lt;/a&gt; had Farley killed in the inn in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; for questioning his actions in the meeting with Baine and Vol'jin.\nEscalation.\n&lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; vaguely referenced her as an ally against &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in the burgeoning &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Horde Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; (noting that she needs \"no excuse\" to strike against Garrosh).\nSiege of Orgrimmar.\nSylvanas accompanied &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to seize &lt;a href=\"Bladefist%20Bay\"&gt;Bladefist Bay&lt;/a&gt; from Garrosh's forces. While nearing to make a landfall, she and Theron discussed raising the dead. While the blood elven regent forbade her to use her resurrection skills on the elves, he did not care about the human ones. She planned to use her angels to fill the streets of Orgrimmar and raise the dead but it is currently unknown if she succeeded or not. She takes part in the &lt;a href=\"Galakras\"&gt;Galakras&lt;/a&gt; encounter along with Lor'themar and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas is present along with the rest of the Horde's leadership (barring &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, who was injured earlier in the siege) at the defeat and arrest of Garrosh. When Thrall names &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; the new Warchief, Sylvanas nods in acknowledgment. However as the quote below indicates, she's not quite as accepting as she appeared, hinting that she's going to give him a hard time to 'test' him.\nWar Crimes.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas and other Horde leaders are summoned to the Temple of the White Tiger to witness the judgment of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas is initially displeased at the idea of a trial rather than an execution and opposes the appointment of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; as Hellscream's defender. When Baine's defense of Hellscream proves better than the Banshee Queen would like she accuses him of being an \"Alliance sympathizer\", prompting the tauren chieftain to somewhat aggressively, albeit calmly, deny her claim while grabbing her upper arms.\n&lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, noticing her sister's mutual hatred for Garrosh, anonymously summoned her to &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt; to plot the assassination of the tyrannical former Warchief. Concocting a new, untraceable poison with her Forsaken subjects, she and Vereesa planned to lace Hellscream's last meal with it. In the meantime, Vereesa entertained the idea of joining her sister in a leadership position of the Forsaken despite the fact that it would require her to abandon her children. Sylvanas realized that the Forsaken would not accept a living creature into their leadership and decided she would murder Vereesa so that her \"Little Moon\" could be reborn at her side as an undead.\nAt the last moment, Vereesa relented and informed &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of the poison in Hellscream's food. Despite Hellscream's hateful words and remorseless attitude, the prince saved the imprisoned orc's life, foiling the Banshee Queen's plan. After learning of the plan's failure, the Banshee Queen rampaged through the wilderness, angrily killing any wildlife unfortunate enough to get in her way and proclaiming that she would never attempt to love again.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nSylvanas sent the mage &lt;a href=\"Vivianne\"&gt;Vivianne&lt;/a&gt; to assist the commander on and to retrieve samples of the &lt;a href=\"Infested\"&gt;Infested&lt;/a&gt; for study. &lt;a href=\"Benjamin%20Gibb\"&gt;Benjamin Gibb&lt;/a&gt; was also doing reconnaissance for the Dark Lady in &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor%27s%20Garrison\"&gt;Admiral Taylor's Garrison&lt;/a&gt;.\nDark Mirror.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasions\"&gt;Legion began invading Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas called Nathanos to partake in a ritual meant to make him stronger. He agreed to take part, though not before attempting to provoke her. When he discovered that the ritual would involve the Val'kyr sacrificing his cousin &lt;a href=\"Stephon%20Marris\"&gt;Stephon Marris&lt;/a&gt;, he felt no regret, only the duty-bound oath he had made towards Sylvanas. The Val'kyr proceeded to place herself between the human and the undead and began chanting guttural words in an ancient tongue, flashes of blue and gold pulsing from her hands. Nathanos lost his senses for a time, his world exploding in fire and pain. When the Blightcaller's wits returned, he found that he had been transformed to become stronger than before and not be as decayed and withered as he had been. However, upon looking into a mirror, he noticed that his new face was not entirely his own. He then noticed that the second ritual table was empty save for a bit of ash and oily residue stains. Sylvanas directed &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Anya\"&gt;Dark Ranger Anya&lt;/a&gt; to escort her champion to the armory to see him outfitted in a manner that befits his station. Along the way, Anya implied to Nathanos that Sylvanas had feelings for the champion, a notion that the Blightcaller disagreed with, as he personally felt that whatever emotion his mortal heart might have held, now it had room only for rage and contempt.\nLegion.\n\"The Forsaken's ruthless leader is a formidable champion of her people. But with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, the stakes for the Dark Lady have never been higher. Should Sylvanas perish, her demise will be the beginning of her eternal damnation. All that stand between her and this doom are her &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, yet few of these spirit guardians remain. As her fate edges closer to the abyss, Sylvanas must decide how far she'll go to protect her people... and whether they're more precious to her than her soul.\"\nSylvanas took part in the Horde's attack force heading for the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; in a joint assault with the Alliance. When a demonic attack critically damaged the Alliance's gunship, she vaulted onto it before it crashed into her own. She fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; against a rampaging &lt;a href=\"abyssal\"&gt;abyssal&lt;/a&gt; and survived the gunship's fall to continue the battle on land. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;'s forces regrouped with &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and the Horde reinforcements and fought their way to defeat the demons of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20City\"&gt;Black City&lt;/a&gt;. They then pursued and witnessed the sacrifice of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; after the warlock summoned &lt;a href=\"Krosus\"&gt;Krosus&lt;/a&gt;. After the Horde forces defeated the demon with the Alliance's help, Sylvanas told King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that the Horde would hold the high ridge and cover the Alliance's flank while the Alliance confronted Gul'dan. The Horde forces held the high ridge until they discovered that another portal opened up behind them and its vast reinforcements threatened to overwhelm the Horde defenders. The Horde was overwhelmed by an attack from behind, and Vol'jin was mortally wounded by a poisoned spear. Sylvanas rode to secure her Warchief who urged her not to let the Horde die this day. Seeing the Horde forces crumbling and incoming Burning Legion reinforcements, Sylvanas blew her war horn signaling her Val'kyr to secure injured Horde soldiers and ordered a retreat. The Horde abandoning their strategic position left the Alliance vulnerable, however, and Varian watched in shock and disappointment as he witnessed the Horde forces quit the field. Varian was forced to order a retreat via gunship. As it took off, however, Gul'dan summoned an immense &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt; through the portal, which grabbed onto the airship, causing it to tip and send many Alliance soldiers plummeting to their deaths. King Varian sacrificed himself to distract the Burning Legion so that the remaining Alliance forces could secure their escape. Sylvanas grimly gazed at the massive &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; explosion that resulted from Gul'dan executing the subdued Varian Wrynn with fel magic as she steered her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the battle at the Broken Shore, Sylvanas was summoned by the dying Vol'jin to &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; posing as a more benevolent &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; granted Vol'jin a vision, Vol'jin decided to make Sylvanas &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde in his final moments. Vol'jin was burned on a funeral pyre, and during the ceremony, Sylvanas asked the masses of the Horde who would aid her in avenging him. The members of the Horde replied with thunderous battle cries and roars, and the other Horde leaders pledged their loyalty to the new Warchief. When demon infiltrators assaulted Orgrimmar, Sylvanas' forces and the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; envoy, &lt;a href=\"Allari%20the%20Souleater\"&gt;Allari the Souleater&lt;/a&gt;, were able to repel the attack. Seeing that &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s would play a crucial part in the war, but mistrustful of their motives, Lady Windrunner sent a Horde champion to act as the Horde's envoy to the Illidari and, unofficially, as her spy.\nSylvanas later took the Forsaken fleet to &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. While her Horde forces pursued the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas intended to search for another treasure that she would be pursuing through her own means. Suddenly, the fleet was attacked by a single Alliance gunship, the &lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;. The attack was at the command of a vengeful &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Admiral%20Rogers\"&gt;Sky Admiral Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, who have been pursuing Sylvanas. Sylvanas tasked her champion, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, and a Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to defend the fleet. Before her royal flagship --&lt;a href=\"The%20Windrunner\"&gt;The Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;-- could be boarded by the Alliance, Sylvanas escaped to Stormheim to fulfill her mysterious agenda alone.\nSylvanas was later found in &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt; making a deal with &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt;. She left Helheim and took a contingent of &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"The%20Oblivion\"&gt;The Oblivion&lt;/a&gt; to the outskirts of &lt;a href=\"Skold-Ashil\"&gt;Skold-Ashil&lt;/a&gt;. There they attempted to overtake the vrykul city by force but were repelled. Sylvanas chose a different approach and sent a Horde adventurer to undergo a rite of ascension to gain access to the vault that Sylvanas desired entrance to. Once the vault was opened, Sylvanas revealed she intended to subjugate &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; and force her to make more Val'kyr for the Forsaken.\nAt the vault, Sylvanas used a magical lantern called the &lt;a href=\"Soulcage\"&gt;Soulcage&lt;/a&gt; to bind Eyir and tortured the Val'kyr to obey her commands. Genn Greymane let out a beastly howl and spoke to Sylvanas in a menacing tone from the shadows. Genn told Sylvanas her quest for immortality had left her vulnerable and cried out that he would have his vengeance on her as he pounced at her from the ceiling. He declared he would avenge Varian, Gilneas, and his son as he stroke at her; eventually knocking her down. Genn then charged at her, but Sylvanas evaded him and shot a poisoned arrow at his shoulder, thus turning Genn human. Sylvanas taunted Genn by saying she overestimated him and calling him an \"old wolf\". Genn then revealed that he stole Sylvanas' magical lantern during his last charge and smashed it on the ground, thus freeing Eyir. Sylvanas watched in shock and anger as Eyir was released from her binds and disappears. Genn walked out of the vault, snapping the shaft of Sylvanas' poisoned arrow lodged in his shoulder, and told Sylvanas that since she stole his son's future, he now took hers.\nThough Eyir escaped her grasp, Sylvanas intended to pursue the Val'kyr even if she had to hunt her through the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;halls of Valhalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a Horde player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Sylvanas can be found in the Undercity alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas hosts the ceremony that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from Warchief Sylvanas, as well as an artifact appearance.\nShe later sent &lt;a href=\"Crysa\"&gt;Crysa&lt;/a&gt; to study the birds of the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; to see if they could be used to carry messages across long distances.\nWindrunner: Three Sisters.\nSylvanas and her sisters finally met and were reunited after years of separation, with the goal of reclaiming their ancestral home and see if they could still be family. After reuniting with her sisters, the Windrunner sisters set off to purging &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt; of the undead. During their journey, the sisters played the game \"One is a lie\" in which they each made three statements with one being a lie. Sylvanas' statements were: there were times she wished she was still alive, she was proud to be &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and lastly she would never betray her sisters. As the Windrunner sisters were fighting &lt;a href=\"shade\"&gt;shade&lt;/a&gt;s of people they once knew in &lt;a href=\"Goldenmist%20Village\"&gt;Goldenmist Village&lt;/a&gt;, the reunion took a certain turn when &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt; and Sylvanas entered an argument about whether Sylvanas manipulated &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt; into murdering &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, to which Sylvanas defended her character and revealed it was Vereesa's plan from the beginning. Sylvanas held Vereesa's lack of nerve responsible for the fallout of Garrosh's actions thereafter, including the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas' rage culminated in her unleashing her banshee powers on one shade and brutally eviscerated it. Disgusted by Sylvanas' savage brutality, Alleria transformed into her &lt;a href=\"Entropic%20Embrace\"&gt;Void form&lt;/a&gt; to declare that the sister she once knew was gone. Sylvanas retorted she had no choice in becoming undead while Alleria abandoned them and chose to become a &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; abomination. With both sisters seeing a monster in the other, Vereesa tried to stop the quarrel and dissipate the hostilities by refocusing their efforts in clearing their home of the undead and revealing the verdicts of their game. Though Sylvanas' sisters revealed their truths and lies, when it was Sylvanas' turn to reveal her truths and lie, she refused to continue the game. It was later revealed that Sylvanas had brought a squad of dark rangers with her, who stood ready to assassinate her sisters if the signal was given. The Spire retaken, Alleria and Vereesa parted ways with Sylvanas. She had almost given the signal, until Vereesa apologized to Sylvanas for backing out of her agreement to stay with her after their attempt on Garrosh's life, and told her she hoped she will forgive her one day. Supposedly letting her sisters leave to indulge in their sorrow-filled lives a bit longer, she still claimed that, in the end, they would serve her.\nBefore the Storm.\nWhile Sylvanas attended to her duties as &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, she met with her champion &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; who reported to her the ongoings of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. Nathanos reported that while many are proud that a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; has been crowned warchief, others resent that she had forgotten those who were loyal to her. Sylvanas laughed at the irony of the zero-sum situation: &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; claimed she doesn't give the other Horde races enough attention while the Forsaken claim she gives them too much. She cursed &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; for thrusting the public position of warchief onto her. As Sylvanas paraded with a diverse contingent of Horde races on their way to the celebration feast, Nathanos elaborated that she left a power vacuum behind in the undead's capital, and the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; was created as an interim government to attend to the Undercity's needs. Word has also reached the Undercity of Sylvanas' efforts to create more &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; and how her plans were foiled by &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. The Desolate Council has reservations about her actions and has requested an audience with her to speak of disagreements about their future. Sylvanas confided to Nathanos that she would rebuild the Horde military in order to conquer &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; dead and his soft son\u2014 &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 ruling in his stead, Sylvanas believed it an opportune time to turn the bloodlust of the Horde on their perennial enemies, the humans of Stormwind. From the slaughter of the Stormwindians, she planned to bolster the ranks of the Forsaken, a fate she considered a mercy as they would be united with their Forsaken loved ones in death and freed from the harshness of life's passions and loss.\nAfter the Legion's defeat, and &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; impaling &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; discovered a &lt;a href=\"Azerite\"&gt;mysterious new substance&lt;/a&gt;. During the celebration feast, &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; showed &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; to Sylvanas, who declared that it would change everything. While Sylvanas sent Bilgewater goblins to mine Azerite and research the mineral, Baine set up a meeting between Sylvanas and &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Magni had asked Sylvanas to remove the goblins from Silithus and attempted to recruit the Horde healers in the mission to restore &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from Sargeras' destruction. Sylvanas tasked Baine to organize the Horde's response in the healing efforts, but she prohibited cooperation with the Alliance and ordered Baine to cease all contact with King Anduin Wrynn. Much to the objections of the other Horde races, Sylvanas chose to maintain Gallywix's Azerite mining operations and investigations, citing its research to be invaluable to the Horde's efforts and that she will divulge the research when the moment was right.\nSylvanas traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;Gallywix Pleasure Palace&lt;/a&gt; to check on Gallywix's progress in researching Azerite and to spur his focus on creating Azerite weapons. Nathanos Blightcaller however, interrupted their meeting to relay Anduin Wrynn's missive concerning the proposal of the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas' own family reunion had embittered her to reconciliation with the living, and Sylvanas herself didn't want her own people to lose their pride as Forsaken should they too be disappointed by rejection. Nathanos however, proposed she could use the Gathering to her advantage by publicly supporting it and either using the reconnection with their loved ones to motivate them to continue existing as undead and prolong the Forsaken's will to propagate, or use the hurt feelings from the reunion's failure to sway the Forsaken masses to be amenable to bloodlust and vengeance on the living. Sylvanas herself considered it an opportunity to gain Stormwind's trust and exploit it with betrayal. Seeing the benefits and after hearing Nathanos' opinion of the Desolate Council not being a threat, Sylvanas consented to the Gathering, but only with the Desolate Council members' sole participation and a small group of humans. Sylvanas and Nathanos returned to the Undercity, where she clarified her concerns and stipulated the conditions for the Gathering. She also did her best to sow doubt in the Forsaken and encouraged thoughts of their rejection. Sylvanas was certain the natural prejudices will dash any hopes of reconciliation with the living and discredit those sympathetic to the notion in the Desolate Council.\nDuring the Gathering, King Anduin met with Sylvanas face to face to set the terms of the event, and he bluntly asked her if she intentionally betrayed his father during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. Though shocked by Anduin's straightforwardness, she gave an honest answer, that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s numbers sealed Varian's fate regardless of the decision she made. Though the Gathering started off peaceful, Sylvanas caught wind of the defection of some of the Forsaken as it unfolded before her as she stood, watching, on &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. In order to clarify if the Forsaken were indeed defecting, she signaled the recall of the Forsaken participants. However, some refused to heed the retreat. Shortly thereafter, one of her &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s came to her stating &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the throne of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, was the reason for the defection. She then let loose her &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s on &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s. Sylvanas ordered her dark rangers to kill all Forsaken present on the field, including those running back towards &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas reasoned that the only Forsaken she trusted were those who were already broken and bitter by their experiences, while those that still had sympathies could not be permitted to fester their hope. Sylvanas herself personally murdered Calia Menethil right in front of Anduin and threatened to kill Anduin as well. She reasoned it would be her right, considering Anduin brought a usurper to cause sedition. Anduin however, called Sylvanas' bluff since she was not prepared to face the unrestrained ire of the Alliance, nor did she have the full support of the Horde. Leaving himself vulnerable, Anduin carried Calia's corpse back to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nNew allies.\nSylvanas gathered the Horde leaders in the newly opened &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; in order to discuss new allies. Upon helping or securing the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, she accepted the pledges of loyalty from High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nWar of the Thorns.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; had been saturated with &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"spy\"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt;. Since it would be too costly for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to uproot them all, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; Sylvanas Windrunner had chosen to tolerate their presence. One day, Sylvanas had summoned &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; to a secret meeting in &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;. After Sylvanas assured Varok that her champion &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt; was keeping this meeting private from Alliance spying, Sylvanas asked Varok to make a hypothetical battle plan on how to sack &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter evaluating all the scenarios he could think of, Varok concluded that the Horde would be unable to sack Stormwind City and any progress at doing so would be tentative at best. Sylvanas suggested Varok think of a more elaborate strategy with Stormwind's conquering as the final phase rather than the sole objective. Enraged by Sylvanas' warmongering, Varok finally questioned his warchief why she was eager to start a bloody war with the Alliance. Sylvanas rationalized that she believed that the Alliance and Horde will never forgive the transgressions they had committed against one another and that war was inevitable. Thus, the only way to ensure peace for the Horde was to dominate the Alliance in war and win it on their terms. When Varok suggested that the Horde should then be preparing to defend themselves for the next war instead of instigating it, Sylvanas countered by explaining that while Varok himself had shown that Stormwind City was seemingly impenetrable to conquering, the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; showed that Orgrimmar was not; thus the Horde was more vulnerable to losing in a war than the Alliance. With &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; undoubtedly changing warcraft, Sylvanas proposed that they take every opportunity to achieve victory and ensure lasting peace for future generations of the Horde. Varok came to agree with Sylvanas' sound reasoning but still could not fathom what strategy would be effective enough to sack Stormwind when they lack the logistics to maintain an invasion.\nSylvanas led Varok to the realization that the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;war with the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had weakened both factions' navies and the deterrence of swift reprisal that enforced the stalemate between the Horde and Alliance was no longer feasible. With both the Alliance and Horde's navies diminished, they would be unable to transport troops and thus would be slow to project military power to reinforce distant warfronts. With such a weakness, the Horde could secure &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the center of Alliance military power in Kalimdor, would be a feasible target to conquer; especially if the Horde took the Alliance by surprise. The cost, however, would be that their holdings in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; would likely be susceptible to reprisal, especially Sylvanas' own capital, the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas, however, proposed to politically divide the Alliance by baiting the night elves into demanding the Alliance prioritize the retaking of their homeland and thus dividing the Alliance's forces. The Alliance would lack the fleet nor the strength to retake Kalimdor and thus weaken or become politically fractured. Furthermore, holding Darnassus hostage would paralyze the Alliance from counterattacking as the night elves would not stand for their city being annihilated and thus create a divide between them and the Gilneans, who had lost their nation years ago and were not prioritized for military aid on that warfront either. With such a political crisis, Anduin Wrynn would not be able to act and each Alliance nation will act in its own interest to defend themselves from a unified Horde. Varok came to the realization that was how they intended to defeat Stormwind, by politically carving each individual nation away from the Alliance and then dominating them into a surrender. However, Sylvanas was well aware that they can only divide the Alliance if the war to conquer Darnassus does not unite the Alliance against the Horde. That can only happen if the Horde wins in an honorable victory, which Sylvanas knows the Horde doesn't trust her to do. Thus, Sylvanas has authorized Saurfang to create the battle plans and execute their strategy.\nTo lure out the Alliance from &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas suggested duping the Alliance spies into believing a false narrative. Thus, Varok began planting misinformation and acting out an adversarial relationship with Sylvanas and Nathanos to make it seem as if he was priming the Horde to monopolize the Azerite in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; and was also bullying Sylvanas into endorsing his campaign. The Alliance took the bait; fearing the Horde was proliferating Azerite weapons, they sent a sizable night elf fleet to Silithus as deterrence. &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; traveled to Stormwind City to help the Alliance leadership plan the war, leaving only &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his skeleton crew of night elf defenders for the Horde to contend with. Although Sylvanas' advisers saw this as a boon, Sylvanas seemed quite annoyed that only one night elf leader would fall in the invasion. To scare the night elves into surrendering without creating a unifying atrocity for the Alliance to rally to, Varok suggested they bring many &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s with them. That way, the threat of raining death on Darnassus with impunity would deter the night elves in the city from resisting.\nSylvanas sought to capture the world tree &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; because the Alliance would use it as a safe harbor to transport &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; from Kalimdor to the Eastern Kingdoms, and she expected that Azerite to be used for weapons to attack Silvermoon and Undercity, and then turn to Kalimdor. By occupying &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; the Horde could control the flow of Azerite and the Alliance would not attack the city for fear of hurting the civilians. Knowing the night elves would resist them every step of the way, she also sought to kill &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and break their spirits.\nWhile High Overlord Saurfang led the charge to secure &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas focused on hunting Malfurion Stormrage. Sylvanas clashed with Malfurion twice \u2014 once, when she interrupted a fight between Malfurion and &lt;a href=\"Lorash%20Sunbeam\"&gt;Lorash Sunbeam&lt;/a&gt; and another when Sylvanas attacked Malfurion when he had trapped &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Astranaar\"&gt;Astranaar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite her efforts, Malfurion had managed to elude her. As Sylvanas hunted Malfurion, she could not help but muse that the war was turning the night elves cruel against the Horde but used their hatred in such pitiful ways. Sylvanas contemplated that war was meant to transform civilizations into doing the unthinkable, and since Malfurion refused to change accordingly, she believed it will inevitably lead to his downfall. Sylvanas also pondered how Saurfang had been wounded by war but she believed he had fooled himself into believing his sense of honor would help him cope with it. Saurfang would be a dangerous enemy to Sylvanas if his honor or the Horde would ever be taken from him, although she would prefer it if he'd just rid himself of such foolish notions such as honor and stand by her side regardless of the morality of her actions. Sylvanas knew if Saurfang refused to side with her, she'd have to kill him.\nAfter securing Ashenvale, the Horde turned its attention to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. When the Horde invaded Darkshore however, many of their men were incinerated by the wall of &lt;a href=\"wisp\"&gt;wisp&lt;/a&gt;s Malfurion had erected. To compound to their troubles, the night elven fleet had returned and were aiding in the kaldorei defense. The night elves' defenses were enough to halt the Horde's advance, and Sylvanas and Saurfang knew they needed to act quickly before &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s reinforcements arrive to stop the invasion. Thus Sylvanas and Saurfang came up with a plan to divide the wisps' attention on multiple fronts, thus diminishing their effectiveness. Saurfang and Nathanos Blightcaller took a group to scale the mountains in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and distract the wisps to the north. Once the wisp wall dispersed, Sylvanas led the main Horde army to breach the wisp barrier. In Darkshore, Sylvanas tasked &lt;a href=\"Morka%20Bruggu\"&gt;Morka Bruggu&lt;/a&gt; to lead a group of Horde infiltrators to commandeer some night elven ships from the night elven fleet. Meanwhile, Sylvanas and her army faced off against Malfurion Stormrage, who told her she will not be forgiven for her atrocities; Sylvanas responded she was well aware.\nDespite Sylvanas' overwhelming numbers, Malfurion had managed to dispatch all of Sylvanas' guards, leaving Sylvanas and Malfurion to face off alone. Sylvanas and Malfurion dueled each other on the shores of Darkshore. Before their fight could be concluded, Saurfang interrupted and had thrown his axe at Malfurion, wounding him with a dishonorable blow. Although Saurfang was upset that he had done something ignoble, Sylvanas commended Saurfang for his sneak attack and gave him the honor of finishing Malfurion off. When Saurfang returned to her, however, she was displeased to learn that Varok did not kill Malfurion and that Tyrande had intervened to save him. Sylvanas was so enraged that she was considering killing Saurfang, but she stopped herself when she thought it would be an inopportune time. She walked away from Saurfang and Nathanos' bickering so she could cool off her rage and contemplate about this turn of events. Sylvanas spotted a &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Sentinel leader&lt;/a&gt; off in the distance that was still fighting hard \u2014 even with other arrow shafts buried in her body \u2014 and felled her. Sylvanas pondered how Malfurion's survival would give hope to the Alliance and that would eventually heal the wounds they inflicted on them. Sylvanas even considered that &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; herself may have played a part in ruining her plans. The Banshee Queen seethed at the thought that forces beyond the Alliance would rise up to oppose Sylvanas\u2019 true objective.\nAfter securing &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas gave &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; orders to secure the beach and prepare to invade &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas noticed a gravely wounded &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt;, who then explained that only innocents remained in Teldrassil and that Sylvanas' war was one of hatred and rage. She attempted to remind Sylvanas of her former life as a defender of her people but Sylvanas whispered to the ranger that she remembered herself to be a fool. Sylvanas experienced a flashback of her inability to stop the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion of Quel'thalas&lt;/a&gt; and stated that now Delaryn will understand her beliefs through her own failure. Sylvanas explained that life was pain and that hope fails, telling Delaryn not to grieve, for she would soon join her loved ones. Delaryn explained that she grieved for Sylvanas, for she had made life her enemy, and that was a war she could never win; that she could kill her people, but she could never kill hope. In response to Delaryn's defiance, Sylvanas turned Delaryn's head to gaze at Teldrassil in her final moments, then gave Nathanos the order to burn Teldrassil, to which he and the rest of the Horde present complied. As the Horde &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s besieged Teldrassil, Sylvanas watched the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; burn.\nSaurfang roared at Sylvanas and scolded her for her lack of honor and the danger she put the Horde in. Sylvanas however, was calm and was already proceeding with planning the defense of Undercity. When Varok accused Sylvanas of damning the Horde for a thousand generations, Sylvanas retorted that this was a war and a failure of his own making. Darnassus was never the objective; the goal was to create a wedge that would split the Alliance apart. Sylvanas needed a weapon that would destroy hope and Varok gave that up to spare Malfurion. The genocide in Teldrassil is Sylvanas' way of remedying Saurfang's blunder. Sylvanas believes that the Alliance will now fight in pain and that will give them a chance at victory.\nBattle for Lordaeron.\nDuring the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, Warchief Sylvanas contemplated the cycles of hatred and ever-changing alliances the Horde has to live by. She believes that sharing the world has made the Horde weak and that they have forgotten what has made them strong. The Horde forces are weakening from the constant siege barrages whittling away their fortifications and Alliance range assaults. As the Alliance closes in, Sylvanas makes a daring maneuver to infiltrate one of the mobile siege towers and single-handedly destroys it. After which, she turns into her banshee form, killing several Alliance soldiers by phasing through them, and ending her rampage with a \"For the Horde\" battle cry. This display of strength inspires the Horde's forces to push back the Alliance. The Alliance's forces began wavering until King Anduin Wrynn conjured a dome of light to reinvigorate his forces, while Sylvanas and her forces could only watch on. With the Alliance forces regrouped, both the Alliance and Horde charged at each other to resume the battle.\nAs the Alliance soldiers began to gain ground on &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas ordered her &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20War%20Machine%20%28Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron%29\"&gt;Azerite War Machine&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the Alliance's siege towers. When the war machine was destroyed by Anduin, Sylvanas ordered her troops to deploy the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; on the field, much to &lt;a href=\"High%20Overlord%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;'s protest, as there were both Alliance and Horde troops who would be caught in the blast. Nevertheless, the Blight was deployed, and Sylvanas raised those who died on either faction as skeletal minions to push the Alliance back.\nHowever, the timely arrival of Jaina Proudmoore turns the tide of battle back in the Alliance's favor and Sylvanas is forced to pull back the Horde's forces. She is then confronted by Saurfang who criticizes her for her ultimate endgame calling it an 'honourless travesty'. Sylvanas responds that honor means nothing to a corpse and that she believes this Horde is worth saving while telling him to go die his 'warrior's death' and that she may end up raising him to serve her in undeath.\nSylvanas along with Baine and Nathanos then enter Lordaeron's throne room where Baine then confronts Sylvanas over abandoning Saurfang with Sylvanas simply replying that it was the death he wanted and that he could either go join him or tend to the living instead. Sylvanas then turns to Nathanos and hands him her bow; telling him to do what must be done, she then comforts him and tells her champion to go. Alone, Sylvanas then sits on the throne, lounging while waiting for the Alliance to come. Anduin Wrynn, accompanied by Genn Greymane, Alleria Windrunner and Jaina Proudmoore then enter the throne room with Anduin declaring that she has led the Horde without honor and that the battle is over; all while Sylvanas defiantly mocks Anduin and his allies. When she is given the ultimatum of surrendering or dying, Sylvanas confidently rose from the throne and strides towards Anduin; all while his followers watch her ready to strike should she try anything. Sylvanas then simply tells Anduin that he's won nothing and then suddenly shifts to her banshee form; letting off a scream that temporarily incapacitates the Alliance leaders. Multiple explosions of blight set off as she flys out through the ceiling. She then lands on the Horde airship where Nathanos returns her bow to her. Sylvanas then watches Lordaeron as it is completely covered in blight. The Alliance leaders have escaped, however. Sylvanas simply smirks at them as she and the other Horde leaders fly away.\nZandalar.\nAt an unknown point in time, Sylvanas entered into negotiations with &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The Warchief desired the might of the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Zandalari navy&lt;/a&gt;, while Talanji sought the strength of Horde champions to combat the threats within &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. However, Talanji was captured by the Alliance while en route to Orgrimmar. Catching wind of this, Sylvanas ordered a strike team to liberate her from the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt; and deliver her to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. When freed, Talanji instead decided to return to &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; with the Horde forces sent to retrieve her. \nThe Warchief later traveled to &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; aboard the &lt;a href=\"Banshee%27s%20Wail\"&gt;Banshee's Wail&lt;/a&gt; to begin the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Horde War Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and ordered Nathanos to dispatch reports to her as the war progressed.\nFollowing the release of &lt;a href=\"Mythrax%20the%20Unraveler\"&gt;Mythrax the Unraveler&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; informed Sylvanas of the new threat as he believed that she would know how to best proceed against it. After the &lt;a href=\"%3AAbyssal%20Scepter\"&gt;:Abyssal Scepter&lt;/a&gt; was acquired from &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; informed Sylvanas of the mission's success.\nThe Mag'har.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the to recruit the that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; helped save from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Eitrigg and a Horde champion helped the Mag'har escape from the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; through a portal leading to Azeroth, shortly before it closed behind them. The Mag'har thus decided to make &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; their new home, and their leader &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; pledged them to the Horde.\nTides of Vengeance.\nDuring the assault on &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas ordered Nathanos Blightcaller to raise &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; into undeath. While he was successful and even raised &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt;, one of the four remaining Val'kyr was slain by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, leaving only three powerful enough to resurrect Sylvanas, should she be slain again.\nSylvanas saw &lt;a href=\"Derek%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Derek Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, whose body was recovered by the &lt;a href=\"Honorbound\"&gt;Honorbound&lt;/a&gt; as a valuable weapon, a dagger to plunge into the hearts of &lt;a href=\"House%20Proudmoore\"&gt;House Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; when the time was right. Seeking another advantage against the Alliance, Sylvanas has ordered for &lt;a href=\"Priscilla%20Ashvane\"&gt;Priscilla Ashvane&lt;/a&gt;, noted to be one of the greatest enemies of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; until her capture, to be released from &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Dagor\"&gt;Tol Dagor&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valtrois\"&gt;Valtrois&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; broke into the prison, freed Ashvane, and fought their way through the prison. Sylvanas would personally travel to Tol Dagor and meet with the deliberate Ashvane. Though acknowledging that Sylvanas only freed her because the Warchief wanted something from her, Ashvane agreed to discuss their mutual interests. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Siege of Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; and death of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas ordered the Val'kyr &lt;a href=\"Kyra\"&gt;Kyra&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect Derek into undeath with the goal of twisting him to became a weapon against &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas later attended Talanji's coronation and accepted Talanji's oath of loyalty to the Horde, as its equal.\nAfter catching word of Varok Saurfang's escape from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas ordered &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lyana\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lyana&lt;/a&gt; and an adventurer to find Saurfang before the Alliance could. After Saurfang's location is found, Lyana departed, allegedly to report to Sylvanas. The adventurer was approached by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; who implored them to aid Saurfang instead.\nThose who choose to aid Saurfang learn that Sylvanas had ordered for his death, an order that is thwarted when Saurfang, Zekhan, and the adventurer kill Lyana and the rest of the assassins sent to kill Saurfang. Saurfang then instructed his companions to return to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, ensuring that the adventurer would remain in Sylvanas' favor and that Zekhan could secretly spread the word in Orgrimmar. After striking the adventurer in the face, as part of a gambit to make it look like Saurfang ambushed the assassination squad, Saurfang traveled further west into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers informed Sylvanas of Saurfang's survival. Sylvanas remarked that it was \"fortunate\" that the adventurer escaped with little more than a bruise. Expressing her disappointment with the situation, Sylvanas said that Saurfang will be found, delivered to her, and that she will not be failed again.\nThose who rejected Zekhan's mission instead report to Sylvanas, who after being informed of the situation exclaimed that she has special plans for Zekhan.\nSometime after &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thomas%20Zelling\"&gt;Thomas Zelling&lt;/a&gt; rescued Derek Proudmoore and delivered him Jaina, Sylvanas called for the leaders of the Horde to gather in &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;. At this meeting, Sylvanas revealed that she knew that Derek had help in escaping to the Alliance. She then questioned Zelling who Nathanos held at bow point and in response, Baine admitted his role in Derek's freedom and revealed that Sylvanas planned to deny Derek his free will by violating his mind to which Sylvanas thanked him for his honesty. After Nathanos killed Zelling, an outraged Baine asked her if they were nothing more than pawns in her game and accused her of betraying the Horde. However, the Warchief was unmoved and in turn, accused Baine of betraying the Horde and ordered his arrest. As the guards surrounded Baine, he declared that Sylvanas would leave the Horde in ruins. With Baine under arrest, she turned to the other Horde leaders and declared that there was no place for weakness in their ranks and that they best remember where their loyalties lay. With the meeting concluded Sylvanas left the stronghold. The majority of Horde leaders would express to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; their displeasure with her actions, some questioning the integrity of the Horde itself.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Uu%27nat\"&gt;Uu'nat&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Crucible of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, Horde champions discovered the empty blade that once held &lt;a href=\"Xal%27atath\"&gt;Xal'atath&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling the power that resonated within the blade, almost if as if the weapon spoke with another voice, these champions were compelled to deliver the artifact to their warchief. Upon receiving the blade Sylvanas declared them worthy champions and that the blade is the compass that will guide them to victory.\nRise of Azshara.\nEntrusting Nathanos with a mission of the uttermost priority, Sylvanas gave her champion the black blade, which would be used to guide the Horde fleet and the pursuing Alliance fleet towards &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; where both fleets would be attacked by the naga under &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s command after the seas opened. She specifically instructed Nathanos to call for the Speaker of the Horde to join the rest of their forces to embark on this endeavor.\nWhen Alliance spies discovered that Sylvanas planned on executing &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, King Anduin sent &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; to rescue his friend. Meanwhile &lt;a href=\"Spiritwalker%20Ussoh\"&gt;Spiritwalker Ussoh&lt;/a&gt; received a vision from the spirits about Sylvanas' ordering Baine's death causing Lor'themar to turn to &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; in order to save Baine. Despite not knowing that the Alliance and Lor'themar had discovered that she planned on killing Baine, Sylvanas had anticipated that a rescue attempt would be made and arranged for &lt;a href=\"Magister%20Hathorel\"&gt;Magister Hathorel&lt;/a&gt; to ambush anyone who sought to rescue Baine. However, despite the Magister's best efforts the group (who had united together in order to save Baine) was successfully able to free Baine from his shackles and Jaina teleported the group out of Orgrimmar.\nFollowing Baine's release, Thrall revealed his belief that Sylvanas would now come for Thunder Bluff to burn it like she did &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas later called for her &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; to meet her in Grommash Hold and vowed that the traitors (Saurfang's revolutionaries) will be dealt with. To that end, she ordered &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, the only two leaders of the Horde to side with her, to prepare for battle. While Geya'rah remarked that the Mag'har always stood ready to destroy their enemies, Gallywix revealed that the mechs were good to go but remarked that they weren't cheap and that Sylvanas better be ready to pay on delivery. Furthermore, in light of &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; siding with Saurfang, Sylvanas called for the orc to be captured and brought before Nathanos. After Nathanos and the loyalists got their house in order, Nathanos declared that it was time to deal with revolutionaries and Alliance outside the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Gates of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, before the battle could start, Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas' loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. When Sylvanas questioned why she should accept his challenge, Saurfang merely pointed out that she wanted him to suffer, causing Sylvanas to wordlessly agree. While Sylvanas armed herself, Saurfang was granted &lt;a href=\"Dra%27gora\"&gt;Dra'gora&lt;/a&gt; by Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Shalamayne\"&gt;Shalamayne&lt;/a&gt; by Anduin. Sylvanas initially had the upper hand against Saurfang, but when she began to mock him about hope, Saurfang got his second wind by declaring that Sylvanas couldn't kill hope. As Saurfang turned the tide against Sylvanas, he claimed that she failed to kill hope at &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; and failed in getting the Horde and Alliance to keep killing each other. Saurfang further declared that the Horde was strong and would endure, and was able to slash Sylvanas across her eye. This, in turn, caused an enraged Sylvanas to declare that Horde was nothing. Saurfang was then killed by Sylvanas, who subsequently abandoned the Horde altogether.\nSylvanas later rendezvoused with Nathanos at the &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Spire\"&gt;Windrunner Spire&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. The pair talked before wishing one another a safe journey as they departed. With her champion gone, she turned to the loyalists and declared that nothing could stop what was to come. She believed that the only reason the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; weren't in irons or worse was because the rest of the Horde was ignorant of their service to her. While acknowledging that Saurfang's challenge ended the war, she mentioned that it didn't matter now as countless souls were fed to the hungering darkness. She mentioned that though she cared nothing for the living, she did pity the Forsaken and abandoned them because they clung to hope. Revealing that she had struck a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas remarked the armies of Azeroth will fight &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;her master&lt;/a&gt;, who will line the streets with corpses and, in the end, he too will serve Death. Her reflection finished, Sylvanas remarked that nothing lasts and that the loyalists will understand when they see each other next.\nIn the wake of Sylvanas' betrayal, most of her loyalists bent the knee to the revolutionaries, and those who &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to join the united Horde were rounded up in chains. While &lt;a href=\"Former%20Banshee%20Loyalist\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; within the Forsaken sought vengeance against her, others were in disbelief and denial about Sylvanas' betrayal, and some like Nathanos and &lt;a href=\"Lenara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lenara&lt;/a&gt; stayed by her side. Unbeknownst to Sylvanas, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; ordered for the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; to track her down while agents started scouring the Eastern Kingdoms for her and Nathanos.\nShadows Rising.\nThe Dark Lady and &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;her forces&lt;/a&gt; now work in the shadows as both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; race to uncover her next move, including her own sister, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;. Struggling to shoulder the crushing weight of leadership, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin&lt;/a&gt; entrusts the &lt;a href=\"void%20elf\"&gt;void elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to uncover Sylvanas' whereabouts. Meanwhile, the Banshee Queen had tasked &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; with a terrifying gambit: to kill the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; himself, &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nSylvanas later journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; where she fought against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. After winning the battle, she took the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; from him, causing Bolvar to remark that it would be her prison. However, Sylvanas countered that the world was a prison and after splitting the helm in two, thereby piercing the veil between Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Lady declared that she was setting everyone free. After her victory, Sylvanas encountered Nathanos who reported that Bwonsamdi still lived, Sira Moonwarden had been captured, how the Horde came in full force, and her champion believed that Bwonsamdi will now only grow more defiant. Though acknowledging that it was a blow to her plans, Sylvanas was confident that it was a blow that they could overcome. After learning that Nathanos was going to return to the &lt;a href=\"Marris%20Stead\"&gt;Marris Stead&lt;/a&gt; to await further orders, Sylvanas told him to not remain idly, and she expected him to return to her with a means to prevent Bwonsamdi's meddling.\nMeanwhile, her actions have set in a series of events that threaten to upset the cosmic balance between life and death. Furthermore, she had no intention of saving the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; from what is to come.\nIt was revealed that it was during the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Edge%20of%20Night\"&gt;Edge of Night&lt;/a&gt;\", that Sylvanas' relationship with &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, an ancient evil who rules the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; of the Shadowlands, started. It was also revealed that she started the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; in order to kill as many people as possible in order to feed their souls to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; which allowed Sylvanas and the Jailer to both grow greater in strength.\nIn accordance with her alliance with the Jailer, the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; served at her command against their enemies. In a confrontation with the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas declared her disappointment with him, as she felt he had a narrow vision. She warned that she and her allies would find what they seek in another before departing. She later informed The Jailer of how the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Maw Walkers&lt;/a&gt; breached the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; and discovered &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;his&lt;/a&gt; warning. In response, he declared that while it was unfortunate, it was of little consequence.\nSometime following the liberation of &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas visited the imprisoned Anduin. She briefly toyed with Anduin's before agreeing to his request for her to stop playing games. She then declared that she would speak with no more secrets and no more lies, and revealed that she and The Jailer sought to use Anduin as a weapon to achieve their ends. Anduin immediately refused, and in response Sylvanas told him nothing was fair, not life, not death, and that they shall tear it all down. Anduin questioned the purpose of this, as destroying everything would never take away the pain of their suffering. Sylvanas then informed him that he had misunderstood their intent, and that they sought to break the current system of Death and replace for one that is just. Shocked by this Anduin questioned if Sylvanas really expected him to believe, &lt;a href=\"The%20Gathering\"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;after&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;everything&lt;/a&gt;, that she was fighting for justice. In response, she spoke of how their every decision was made for them and how the Jailer will give them control of fate. She then offered Anduin the choice to join them or be made to serve, causing Anduin to counter that she was denying him his free will, causing Sylvanas to inform him that they never had free will, but that was about to change.\nFollowing the defeat and capture of &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, she questioned the Jailer on their plans to recover him. In response, the Jailer merely declared that every soul had its purpose, and that Denathrius had fulfilled his. He then declared that it was time to forge their next weapon, causing her to remark that Anduin wasn't ready, and was subsequently reminded by her ally that they had gone too far already for her falter now.\nShe then approached Anduin, with a &lt;a href=\"mourneblade\"&gt;mourneblade&lt;/a&gt; in hand, and offered him one last chance to join them or be made to serve. However Anduin questioned why she kept giving the chance before deciding that she kept giving him one because it was the choice she never had. He then expressed his belief that there was still some shred of mortality haunting Sylvanas, as if the Banshee Queen hadn't entirely eclipsed the Ranger-General, that if she could make him give up hope, then she could too. After hearing this, an outraged Sylvanas declared \"Enough!\", pointed the mourneblade at him, ordered him to serve, and stated that he was making it harder on himself.\nHowever Anduin countered that he wasn't making it harder on himself, and then questioned what she would do with her power. In response, Sylvanas declared that she had come too far to falter now. This prompted Anduin to question why she hesitated and he further encouraged her to make her choice.\nChains of Domination.\nIn the end, Sylvanas made the choice to forcibly &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;dominate&lt;/a&gt; Anduin and turn him into the Jailer's vessel. The Jailer used his new champion to attack &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;Kyrestia the Firstborne&lt;/a&gt; and claim her &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;\u2014all five of which were required for him to complete his plan. Immediately after, Sylvanas personally lead the Mawsworn army as they attacked &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; in order to claim the next sigil, that of the &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt;. Several &lt;a href=\"night%20fae\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt; volunteered to act as decoys, disguising themselves as the queen in order to keep Sylvanas occupied until the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20Hunt\"&gt;Wild Hunt&lt;/a&gt;\u2014aided by the other covenants\u2014could push back the Mawsworn and focus their efforts on her, all while the real queen stayed behind to protect the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. After she killed one of the decoys, &lt;a href=\"Sparklepuff\"&gt;Sparklepuff&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas was confronted by the Maw Walkers, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne\"&gt;Lord Herne&lt;/a&gt;, and their allies, but fended them off by violently entering banshee form and heading to the Heart of the Forest.\nThe Mawsworn stole several of the &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt;s from the weald's groves, and Sylvanas threatened to destroy them\u2014and the souls within\u2014if the queen did not surrender her sigil. The Maw Walkers and the covenants managed to save the seeds, and Sylvanas instead began opening a Maw portal to summon reinforcements for a final assault. She managed to summon a massive &lt;a href=\"charred%20behemoth\"&gt;charred behemoth&lt;/a&gt;, but it was immediately killed by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, now fully empowered with the strength of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt;. The two elves launched into a duel, with Tyrande pushing the advantage. She told Sylvanas that she would take her head, just as she had taken &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt;'. Sylvanas had not realized that her champion was dead, and Tyrande mockingly told her that the Jailer was keeping secrets from her. As they continued fighting, the Wild Hunt retreated to the Heart to defend against the Mawsworn, distracting Tyrande long enough for Sylvanas to flee in banshee form. Tyrande called on &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s power to leap into the sky after her, colliding with her and sending them both crashing into the ground. With her hands around the Banshee Queen's throat, Tyrande attempted to snap Sylvanas' neck. In that moment, however, the Night Warrior's power suddenly waned and left her, allowing Sylvanas to escape the field. Though the Mawsworn were pushed back, Anduin managed to breach the Heart and steal the Winter Queen's sigil.\nAfter successfully claiming four of the five sigils, the Jailer began enacting his plan to escape the Maw and steal the final key from the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. Sylvanas personally commanded the Mawsworn defenses against the Maw Walkers who attempted to stop the Jailer by breaching his seat of power, the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;. She personally ordered her &lt;a href=\"The%20Nine\"&gt;nine Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, reborn in service to the Maw, to engage with the invaders, but they and the Jailer's other powerful lieutenants were gradually defeated until Sylvanas stood as the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;last line of defense&lt;/a&gt; at the pinnacle of the sanctum. Although unable to gain a clear advantage over the Maw Walkers and their allies\u2014&lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;\u2014she was able to stall them long enough for the Jailer to envelop Oribos in the Maw, ascend to the &lt;a href=\"Crucible%20%28Oribos%29\"&gt;Crucible&lt;/a&gt;, and rip the last sigil from the Arbiter, restoring him to his full strength and allowing him to open a portal to his objective. Sylvanas told him that they now had what they needed, but he revealed his actual goal: not to break the system of Death and give everyone free will, but to forge a new reality where all would be forced to serve him. Remembering similar statements by Arthas, and realizing that she herself was included in that statement, Sylvanas declared \"I will never 'serve'\" and fired a black arrow at the Jailer in defiance. He easily deflected it and told her that it was a \"pity\" that she was still \"chained by mortality\". However, he added that since she had helped him regain what was stolen from him, he would repay her in kind. He pulled a soul fragment out of a portal and launched it at her, restoring the fragment of her soul severed by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; many years prior\u2014and causing her red eyes to turn back to blue. With Sylvanas no longer of any use to him, the Jailer left her fate in the hands of the Maw Walkers and their allies before departing with Anduin through the portal. Overcome by the blow, Sylvanas staggered to her knees and attempted to warn her attackers that the Jailer must not reach a location, but passed out before stating what the location was. The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; subsequently took the unconscious Banshee Queen prisoner within Oribos in the hopes that they could interrogate her about the Jailer's plan.\nEternity's End.\n&lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, who'd suffered a fate similar to Sylvanas', examined her soul in Oribos and found that it was divided: the fragment that had been torn from her soul during her first death and represented the Ranger-General she'd been in life was now forced to endlessly relive the atrocities that the rest of her soul had gone on to commit after being raised into undeath. The Ranger-General did not believe that the Banshee Queen was the same person as her and instead thought her to be a separate being\u2014a monster wearing her face. As long as Sylvanas remained divided in this way, she couldn't wake up. Jaina, Thrall, and Baine believed that it was best if she remained unconscious since they'd never be able to trust her, but Bolvar reminded them that Sylvanas was the only one who could tell them about the Jailer's plan and how to save Anduin.\nUther got an idea and brought Sylvanas' hand to his own scar from Frostmourne, allowing him to enter her consciousness and speak to the Ranger-General fragment of her soul. He told her that the Banshee Queen was the same person as her, not a separate being. The Ranger-General refused to accept this at first, but Uther backed up his words by revealing how his own soul had also been split by Frostmourne. He then asked if Sylvanas would prove Zovaal right by allowing this realization to destroy her, or if she would accept the Banshee Queen's legacy as her own and tell the heroes of Azeroth how to stop the Jailer. The Ranger-General knew that the Banshee Queen's crimes were unforgivable and that she'd have to face the consequences for them. Uther replied that while they couldn't change the past and might never find forgiveness in the future, they would all be doomed if Sylvanas didn't make a choice and act soon. Uther retreated from Sylvanas' mind and stayed by her side in Oribos until finally, his efforts bore fruit and she awoke with a reunited soul.\nUther brought Sylvanas to meet up with Jaina and Bolvar at the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, which the Jailer had already breached. Sylvanas told them that they needed to find a way to resist the Jailer's &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; in order to defeat him and that Anduin might be the key. Uther believed that since Sylvanas had held Kingsmourne\u2014the mourneblade used to bind Anduin\u2014her presence might help free him from the Jailer's control. Jaina initially refused to trust her, but Uther convinced her to accept Sylvanas' help. The four then headed into the Sepulcher together.\nThe Maw Walkers eventually fought their way to &lt;a href=\"Domination%27s%20Grasp%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Domination's Grasp&lt;/a&gt; and confronted and defeated Anduin. Despite the Jailer's efforts, Anduin was able to free himself from Zovaal's control by splitting Kingsmourne in half. This also released the source of his Domination: the last, fading remnant of Arthas Menethil's soul. Sylvanas noted that there wasn't even enough left of him to receive a proper judgment. She stated in her pursuit of vengeance against her nemesis, she had ultimately become no better than him, and that she would have to answer for this. However, Arthas' own legacy was now at an end. She told the remnant that she hoped his name would be forgotten, and she and the others watched in silence as the last part of Arthas faded away.\nSylvanas later joined the now-freed Anduin and the others in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20First%20Reflection\"&gt;Chamber of First Reflection&lt;/a&gt;, where they sought a way of countering the Jailer's power by drawing out the memories of what had allowed them to resist Domination in the past and infusing that will into the shards of the Helm of Domination. Anduin volunteered for the ritual, but was overwhelmed by his memories of the Maw. Sylvanas recognized his struggle from her own experiences and asked to \"offer perspective\" by recounting how she had originally broken free of Arthas' control and sought absolution &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%27%20Farewell%20%28WC3%20Undead%29\"&gt;by trying to kill the death knight&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. She then infused her own resistance against Domination into one of the shards. Thanks to Sylvanas' input, Anduin could overcome the ritual and infuse the last of the shards. The group then returned to Torghast to meet with the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt;, who used the memories combined with the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; to reforge the Helm of Domination into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, an instrument allowing them all to become resistant to Domination.\nJudgment.\nWith the resistance granted by the Crown, the Maw Walkers managed to defeat the Jailer deep within the Sepulcher before he could complete his plan of remaking reality. Afterward, Sylvanas agreed to face the consequences for her crimes by facing judgment of the new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt;, in the Crucible atop Oribos. Uther and a Maw Walker brought her to the city and escorted her to the Crucible. Many souls and denizens of the Shadowlands gathered in the city to throw insults at her as she passed. The Arbiter allowed more covenant denizens and many Azerothians\u2014including Alleria and Vereesa and several leaders of the Alliance and Horde\u2014to gather in the Crucible itself to witness the trial.\nPelagos began the trial by noting that Sylvanas' actions showed signs of the Jailer's influence, but she replied that she'd been in control of her own actions and that she'd accept the consequences for them. The Arbiter replied that, if so, she knew who she had to answer to. She did, and willingly handed herself over to Tyrande Whisperwind's judgment. Tyrande initially assumed that this was a new deception by the Banshee Queen and threatened her with her glaive, but Sylvanas calmly responded that she didn't expect Tyrande to give her a merciful death. Tyrande stated that remorse couldn't erase Sylvanas' actions and that she wouldn't be allowed peace until there was peace for her victims' souls, and had &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; escort her down to the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt;. There, Sylvanas exchanged a brief farewell with Alleria and Vereesa, as well as with the Maw Walkers. She told Alliance members that she was glad Azeroth had them as her protectors. To Horde members who'd sided with Saurfang during the Fourth War, she said that she did not blame them if they chose to hate her, but that she hoped they'd continue defending the Horde no matter what. Finally, to Horde members who'd stayed loyal to her throughout the war, she said that she didn't know which fate awaited her, but that she knew she could call on them if she ever needed trusted allies.\nTyrande then decided on Sylvanas' fate: she declared that she would begin her penance by scouring the Maw, freeing all of its trapped souls and sending them back to the Arbiter so they could be judged with compassion, until every last soul was free and Sylvanas herself was all that remained. All the while, she would be watched by Tyrande's companion &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt;. This, Tyrande added, was how Sylvanas would bring renewal to her victims and to the night elves. Sylvanas accepted this and vowed that it would be done, no matter how long it took. After exchanging a last look with Alleria and Vereesa, she jumped into the Maw alongside Dori'thur to begin her work.\nOpinions on Sylvanas' fate differed. Uther noted that he might've followed a path similar to hers if he'd submitted to the darkness in his own heart, but that compassion can act as salvation from any darkness. &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; had once hated Sylvanas for what she did to him and the Horde, but he now believed that hatred would only lead to one's doom in the long run and that it was right that Sylvanas faced judgment for her actions. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; was not satisfied and believed he'd never know peace while the monster who took &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;his kingdom&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt; from him still existed. Maiev Shadowsong didn't know if Sylvanas' fate was justice, but she believed that it was right. Shandris Feathermoon opined that Sylvanas was right when she said that death would've been a mercy, and that her penance might prove more valuable than her execution. Finally, Alleria and Vereesa hoped that Sylvanas might one day complete her penance and return to them as their sister.\nAs she carried out her penance in the Maw, Sylvanas reflected that she was now neither ranger-general nor Banshee Queen\u2014only Sylvanas, whoever that might be now. She knew that her task was nearly impossible, since souls had been sent to the Maw since the very creation of the Shadowlands. However, she clung to the possibility that she might one day be reunited with her late family members and remained determined to find the soul of her beloved Nathanos. She suddenly heard the familiar but unexpected clanking sound of metal armor, suggesting that someone had arrived to aid her in her mission. She recalled what Anduin had told her about hope making things possible and, for the first time in very long, allowed herself to feel hope.\nThis figure turned out to be Anduin, who made the decision to enter the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; in order to aid Sylvanas in her mission. However, after some time, Sylvanas questioned why he was there, with so many people awaiting his return. Anduin admitted that while his friends believe his hands are clean, he doesn't feel that they are, causing Sylvanas to point out it was perilous to confuse \"what you are made to do with what you choose to do.\" However, Anduin countered that he couldn't help it, as it all blurred together into something horrific and exhilarating, that it sickened him that such satisfaction may have been his own. This allowed Sylvanas to realize that Anduin had arrived to aid her because he feared that he might not be who he thought he was. Anduin further revealed that he was afraid to call on the Light, worried that it wouldn't answer him. After Sylvanas reassured him about his own free will and choices, Anduin departed, as they each wished each other farewell.\nDragonflight.\nAfter the Forsaken defeated the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dori%27thur\"&gt;Dori'thur&lt;/a&gt; carried a message from Sylvanas, who was still within the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, to her &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20War%20Campaign\"&gt;Horde War Campaign&lt;/a&gt;. In this message, the Dark Lady admitted regret for her past actions and realized her days of leadership were over and considered the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; to be the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s rightful leaders and future. Before she left, she reminded the adventurer to be in allegiance to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, considering all of them \"more than arrows in her quiver\" and hoping to one day walk among them again. She then explained that there were many souls yet to be freed, including &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;one that was most dear to her&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas's quiver model was datamined in Patch 10.2.5, with a corresponding icon named 'Sylvanas,' signaling her potential return.\nTactics.\nBattle with the Dark Lady can prove disastrous if certain steps are not taken to ensure the raid's survivability. Sylvanas now pulls with her &lt;a href=\"Battlemaster\"&gt;Battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;s regardless of which side of her platform is taken, and she engages with a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Bat\"&gt;Forsaken Bat&lt;/a&gt; along with a scaled &lt;a href=\"Bragor%20Bloodfist\"&gt;Bragor Bloodfist&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Aleric%20Hawkins\"&gt;Aleric Hawkins&lt;/a&gt; as well as all of the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Dreadguard\"&gt;Royal Dreadguard&lt;/a&gt;s in the throne room. Though Hawkins is easily disposed of, her other allies in the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Quarter\"&gt;Royal Quarter&lt;/a&gt; are formidable and hit hard. The best tactic is to use two tanks, one to hold the Battlemasters and guard spawns and one to keep on Sylvanas and her &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Sylvanas%29\"&gt;skeleton minions&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas uses a variety of abilities- her multi-shot, regardless of range, is capable of hitting up to ten targets at once for a moderately powerful 55-64k. She can use a &lt;a href=\"DOT\"&gt;DOT&lt;/a&gt; curse (a special version of &lt;a href=\"Black%20Arrow\"&gt;Black Arrow&lt;/a&gt;), to inflict shadow damage over 30 seconds on a random target. The potency of her summon skeleton ability has been increased, and now brings forth five level 110 skeletons, but each has low health, so they are dispatched easily with AoE abilities. She has also retained her &lt;a href=\"vanish\"&gt;vanish&lt;/a&gt; ability, though even one application of &lt;a href=\"Faerie%20Fire\"&gt;Faerie Fire&lt;/a&gt; is enough to disallow her its use. When Sylvanas reappears after vanishing, she will begin using &lt;a href=\"Multi-Shot\"&gt;Multi-Shot&lt;/a&gt; on random targets until her tank picks her up again.\nDue to the large amount of enemies, speed is a key factor in downing the Dark Lady. If allowed to vanish and not picked up immediately after, there is an infrequent glitch where she will reset to 100% HP, wasting valuable time. Focusing on her over her allies, while a second tank holds them, is the best strategy to employ.\nSylvanas was often considered the most powerful &lt;a href=\"faction%20leader\"&gt;faction leader&lt;/a&gt;, having battled alongside &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; until \"Wrath of the Lich King\". More recently, this position has been disputed by the encounter with &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas' downfall is the objective of &lt;a href=\"Downing%20the%20Dark%20Lady\"&gt;Downing the Dark Lady&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas, like &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;most&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;leaders&lt;/a&gt;, has a 2-hour respawn timer after being killed by an Alliance raid. However, you may have to face the battlemasters more than once, as they have a respawn timer of 5-10 min.\nLore abilities.\nSylvanas has additional abilities to those she uses during her \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"%23Abilities\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nIn her early life, Sylvanas was a prodigious &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt;, proud and vain\u2014and pragmatic. As the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;ranger-general&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas, like many of the &lt;a href=\"quel%27dorei\"&gt;quel'dorei&lt;/a&gt;, held the belief that it was a mistake to teach &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"humanity\"&gt;humanity&lt;/a&gt;; though she was also of the opinion that &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; would do well to coexist with the other races of the world, and to practice tolerance. Sylvanas' ambiguous relationship with her pupil, the human &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt;, may have shaped this belief (or have been the result of it). Death, however, would give Sylvanas a highly different outlook on life. \nIn death, Sylvanas was motivated, for the most part, by revenge; and later, a drive to survive that would later evolve into a drive to conquest and empowerment. Sylvanas is a highly cunning and capable administrator, having built up a nation from nothing to one of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful (and feared) factions. Though she has forged alliances, she has consistently kept her allies ignorant of her true motives. Sometimes this provides an advantage when dealing with more &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;volatile allies&lt;/a&gt;, though it has contributed to her being blamed for &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;actions&lt;/a&gt; that were not her own. Sylvanas makes little distinction between friend and foe; if you do not stand with the Forsaken, you stand against them. She makes use of oratory skills to inspire her followers, be it rallying the liberated undead on a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;crusade of retribution&lt;/a&gt;, or motivating her people to war. Sylvanas is a cold ruler, placing value on few of her subjects beyond their use as tools, be it arrows to kill on her behalf or shields to protect her from her enemies. Even her own &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;homeland&lt;/a&gt; was not exempt to this; indeed, Sylvanas was willing to use it as a bargaining chip to secure more manpower in her quest for vengeance. Sylvanas is often brusque and dismissive, though is quick to feign respect around figures such as the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. She does, however, pay some amount of respect to her own soldiers, commemorating them through their insignia or attempting to rescue survivors of a battle.\nThe moment she was raised as a banshee, Sylvanas lost the ability to truly feel any emotion besides anger and hate, which now fuel her in undeath the way breathing or food fueled her in life, never abating save for when she is with &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas is a ruthless and creative military leader. She is not above using &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;hostages&lt;/a&gt;, explicitly banned &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;chemical weaponry&lt;/a&gt;, and enforcing &lt;a href=\"Undeath\"&gt;morally dubious choices&lt;/a&gt; to put the Forsaken ahead in warfare. The lines between Sylvanas and the Lich King are still present, primarily in that she won't enslave undead as the Scourge does, but she knows how to exploit the confusion of freshly-resurrected soldiers to use them against their former brothers in arms. She's also grown to put effort into maintaining prejudice from the Alliance towards the Forsaken as their resentment serves her purposes better.\nHints exist that Sylvanas has not been able to entirely cast aside her old life. She takes a special notice of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Thalassian\"&gt;Thalassian&lt;/a&gt;, sings a &lt;a href=\"Lament%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;melancholic tune&lt;/a&gt; regarding the fall of her homeland, and expresses genuine emotion in regards to &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;her sister&lt;/a&gt; after rediscovering a locket once gifted to Sylvanas by her elder sibling, which is still in the Dark Lady's possession. Similarly, she called off a planned assassination of Alleria and Vereesa after working with them to retake Windrunner Spire, due to the latter expressing forgiveness for her own actions at Garrosh's trial, and indicating she still loved both her sisters.\nIn \"\" she is shown to be more willing to help the Alliance, at least against a common enemy, even fighting alongside &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; whom she admits to having respected and even liked. On the other hand, her actions in Stormheim indicate she is as amoral and pragmatic as ever, once again hinting at a desire for Forsaken dominance by promising a 'new age' once she acquires new Val'kyr. In \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" this desire comes to fruition where she launches an assault aimed at toppling the Alliance as the first step towards Forsaken dominance. More than anything she has displayed immense arrogance throughout the Fourth War, to the pointing of viewing everyone as little more than pawns, and becoming enraged when Saurfang managed to land a single scratch on her.\nWhen her soul was reunited with her body thanks to the Jailer, Sylvanas had acknowledged that the crimes she committed were unforgivable. Initially, she refused but was convinced by Uther that while she cannot change the past nor can she be forgiven, she is willing to stand in judgment. She acknowledges that throughout the Fourth War, she had become no different than Arthas. Despite her hatred for him and her hunt for him, each selfish decision she made led her to become like him. She sought to become his judge and executioner in the belief she would be forgiven of the atrocities Arthas forced her to commit against her people, only to be denied that. \nAppearance.\nAs a living elf, Sylvanas had waist-length blonde hair that \"flowed like water\" and was \"translucent in the light of the sun\". She took great pride in her appearance: \"It wasn't good enough to be the best hunter in her family. She needed to take everyone's breath away as she ventured out. She was so very vain.\" Her eyes were \"more gray than green or blue.\" Even by high elven standards, the second of the three Windrunner sisters had been a rare beauty. Lords from countless noble houses had sought her hand. Even &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; was said to have desired it.\nRepossessing her body as a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas now has pale, blue-white skin. Though better preserved than most other undead, the flesh around her mouth cracks and peels like old snakeskin when she speaks. Her eyes glow with a white or silver light that turns red when she is agitated or furious(upon recovering the missing fragment of their soul they turned an icy blue). Her once-golden hair is now pale blonde or white-gold. Anduin described her to be beautiful and deadly, just like the flowers of the toxic herb &lt;a href=\"%3AMaiden%27s%20Anguish\"&gt;:Maiden's Anguish&lt;/a&gt;.\nSylvanas still wears the same outfit she was wearing when she died, though its coloration has darkened. Oddly, her body bears no scars from the innumerable wounds she received on the day she died. As in life, she has a preference for wearing her hood up. Her facial markings are tear stains that burned onto her skin when Arthas raised her. After her mok'gora with Saurfang, however, she gained a single scar across her eye that continued to persist by the time she assaulted Icecrown.\nSylvanas is an imposing figure, seemingly able to look down upon others &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;even if they are taller than her&lt;/a&gt;. Only &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was willing to look her in the eyes following her pact with the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, and what he saw there startled even him. &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; described her thusly: \"In the hall where she stood, the light seemed to fade; it was not that it dimmed or dulled but that it collapsed and sunk into the space she occupied, as if even sunshine faltered around her.\"\nSylvanas' &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; offers a more flattering view of her current appearance, describing her as resembling a queen in life and a \"goddess\" in undeath. He considers that while the classic elegance she once possessed has been lost in death, her undead form holds a dark allure that he finds captivating. Nathanos believes that some hypocritical rulers of Azeroth's mortal kingdoms, who publicly despise her, in truth hold the same private fascination.\nIn the RPG.\nAs the leader of the Forsaken and the Horde on the Eastern Kingdoms, Sylvanas is a military genius. Her name is also spelled as Sylvannas.\nUnder her leadership the Forsaken have managed to not only fend off the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, but also the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. She has a certain mastery of leadership, military strategy, and the bow. Sylvanas is the best archer on Azeroth. She wields &lt;a href=\"Sunstrider%27s%20Longbow\"&gt;Sunstrider's Longbow&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 once owned by &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, it was passed on to Sylvanas when she became Ranger-General. She wears &lt;a href=\"Robe%20of%20Elven%20Kings\"&gt;Robe of Elven Kings&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Undead%20Mastery\"&gt;Rod of Undead Mastery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Superior%20Boots%20of%20Elvenkind\"&gt;Superior Boots of Elvenkind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cloak%20of%20Writhing%20Shadows\"&gt;Cloak of Writhing Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, and girdle of giant strength.\nSylvanas succeeded in using her abilities as a banshee to repossess the body that belonged to her in life. Sylvanas was now a corporeal undead creature. Back in her physical body she realized that the natural world would never respond to her wishes again. Angered by this development, she turned to the arts that were becoming more and more natural to her: necromancy. She then altered her elven ranger teachings into a new form. Thus the &lt;a href=\"dark%20ranger\"&gt;dark ranger&lt;/a&gt;s were born.\nAs long as the Lich King survives, it is impossible to destroy Sylvanas' spirit completely. Her \"destroyed\" spirit restores itself within a few days. The only way to get rid of her for sure is first to destroy the Lich King and then destroy her. Her existence became linked to his during her initial creation as a banshee.\nQuotes.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nSpeak quickly; I don't have time to waste on idle chatter. The Forsaken have become a force to be reckoned with, but there is still much to do in a given day. This city doesn't run itself.\nScourge Invasion.\nI can feel Thrall's anger at Arthas, but it pales before my own. Were he as furious as any one of the Forsaken, the Horde's armies would unleash their rage upon Northrend and eradicate all Scourge from that cursed, frozen wasteland.\nBut I do not lead the Horde, and cannot give the command for war. Thrall wishes to weigh his options, despite this being a time of action. Still, our time will come... very soon.\nI'd choose your next words carefully if you value your life.\nSilence? How wise. Now destroy the Scourge!\nGossip.\nWe have no time to waste, &lt;class&gt;. Why do you delay here?\nI will delay here until more reinforcements arrive, but you must keep moving. Arthas will soon realize that we're here.\nStanding this close to the blade that ended my life... The pain... It is renewed.\nI cannot hold him for long, we must leave at once!\nWe are safe... for now. His strength has increased tenfold since our last battle. It will take a mighty army to destroy the Lich King. An army greater than even the Horde can rouse.\nCataclysm.\nForsaken High Command.\nIn death, we are reborn.\nLegion.\nGossip.\nBroken Shore was just the beginning. The Alliance will retaliate. Given the opportunity, they will strike when we are weak.\nWe will make the Legion pay for what they've done!\nAt long last, the ceaseless posturing between the Horde and the Alliance is coming to an end.\nThe time for war is at hand.\nIn Heroes of the Storm.\nSylvanas is a in \"&lt;a href=\"Heroes%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Heroes of the Storm&lt;/a&gt;\".\nNotes and trivia.\nLament of the Highborne.\nSylvanas sings the &lt;a href=\"Lament%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Lament of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt; in the Burning Crusade.\nAlternate timelines.\nIn a timeline where the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in bringing about the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas lingers as a &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Sylvanas\"&gt;maddened echo&lt;/a&gt; in the desolate remains of the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Ruby Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;. Having lost everything, she was left unable to find peace as she languished in hatred, aching for a chance to unleash her fury on anything living that comes near her.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Once players reach the end of the chain, they will be forced to make a one-time-only decision as to which faction they wish to ally with, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Once the decision has been made, players will not be able to change that decision via in-game means (though out-of-game tools like Faction Change still function).\nTraining with fire.\nPandaren start out life as &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Shang%20Xi%20Training%20Grounds\"&gt;Shang Xi Training Grounds&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; looking in the direction of . He quickly puts young pandaren through their paces in challenges of increasing difficulty. Confident that the adventuring pandaren can survive life outside the training grounds, the master sends them out to meet and in an effort to recover the four elemental spirits. The first spirit found is , the ancient spirit of fire, who is then quickly taken to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Five%20Dawns\"&gt;Temple of Five Dawns&lt;/a&gt; at the center of the Wandering Isle.\nMoving water and earth.\nMaster Shang Xi next sends adventuring pandaren east to the &lt;a href=\"Singing%20Pools\"&gt;Singing Pools&lt;/a&gt;, to find , the ancient spirit of water. Shu is sad that is no longer playing with him, so it is up to the adventurer to make friends with him. Once that has been accomplished, Aysa sends adventurers forward to Ji at the &lt;a href=\"Dai-Lo%20Farmstead\"&gt;Dai-Lo Farmstead&lt;/a&gt;, which has been overrun by &lt;a href=\"virmen\"&gt;virmen&lt;/a&gt;. After Ji's ideas fail to wake , the ancient spirit of earth, Shu lends some assistance.\nTo the air and beyond.\nNo time to rest at the temple as the master quickly launches adventurers upstairs where Ji leads them to the &lt;a href=\"Morning%20Breeze%20Village\"&gt;Morning Breeze Village&lt;/a&gt; to solve the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; problem once and for all. Not that slaughtering hozen has anything to do with finding , the ancient spirit of air. Aysa realizes that Dafeng has been driven into hiding by , who must be killed in order to ease Dafeng's fears. All four spirits recovered, Master Shang Xi has one final task for adventurers to accomplish by clearing the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20of%20Staves\"&gt;Wood of Staves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"sprite\"&gt;sprite&lt;/a&gt;s. That accomplished, he has one last piece of wisdom to impart on the young pandaren. Use that knowledge when riding the hot air balloon to speak with &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; and discover the source of his pain.\nFinding safety and strife.\nRealizing that the source of Shen-zin Su's pain is \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Skyseeker\"&gt;The Skyseeker&lt;/a&gt;\", a crashed gunship, the adventurer and Master Shang Xi's disciples head into the forbidden &lt;a href=\"Pei-Wu%20Forest\"&gt;Pei-Wu Forest&lt;/a&gt;. There, the party helps triage members of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, as well as fend off new horrors from the depths. This culminates in a boss fight with . Immediate threat taken care of, Ji decides to blow up what's left of the &lt;a href=\"Wreck%20of%20the%20Skyseeker\"&gt;\"Skyseeker\"&lt;/a&gt;! Shockingly, this plan actually works, to a point. Shen-zin Su now has a river of blood pouring into the sea and it's up to healers of both the Alliance and Horde to stitch him up, but not without what's left of the invading forces harassing the healers. Defend the healers long enough for them to do their job, then move on to the next problem\u2014the Alliance and Horde forces are at each other's throats!\nChoosing Alliance or Horde.\nBack at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Five%20Dawns\"&gt;Temple of Five Dawns&lt;/a&gt; for the last time, pandaren adventurers must now make the most important decision of their lives. The time has come to decide which faction to ally with. Upon completing A New Fate, adventurers will be whisked to their new capital city in order to meet their new leader.\nAlliance.\nAlliance members find themselves outside of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; along with and to meet :\nHorde.\nHorde members will find themselves at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; just outside the gates of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; alongside to meet :\nAdventurers then have the choice of any 10-20 leveling zone accessible to their new faction:"}

Where pandaren with the spirit of adventure gather to celebrate the first explorer to venture beyond the mists.\nIt's a time of contemplation and song. Thank you for joining us!"}

Lastly, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D138043\"&gt;Vengeful Spirit&lt;/a&gt; will summon a ghost that moves slowly but hits for massive damage.

People could not wake up, and were lost in nightmares, without any way to let them out. A strange mist spread through the lands, a herald of the Nightmare. Shadowy figures started appearing throughout the world, and eventually even attacking the people. Later, the sleepers themselves turned into sleepwalkers, attacking everybody nearby as they relived their worst nightmares.\nMeanwhile, the had turned a great part of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; into the Nightmare, and though nature's defenders did not stop in their attacks, they seemed to have no effect in stopping the corruption, while some became corrupted themselves. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; himself was trapped in the Nightmare, though with the help of some of his friends he was able to escape. Contacting every sentient and wild being that eluded the forceful slumber and remained awake in the physical world, Malfurion asked the survivors to fall asleep and lend their dreamforms to attack the Emerald Dream. The dreamform of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; led the troops.\nIn the Emerald Dream, the dreamform army battled against the Emerald Nightmare's army of corrupted Nightmare creatures. The dreamform army pressed on even when the Emerald Nightmare used a psychological tactic that had the enemy taking the forms of fallen comrades and loved ones of Azeroth's defenders. Yet things took a turn for the worse when the Emerald Nightmare started sending sleepwalkers to kill the dreamform armies' corporeal forms in the waking wold, causing their deaths in the Emerald Dream. The shrinking dreamform army could only hold on until Malfurion and his comrades were able to defeat the Nightmare Lord directly.\nOn the waking world, and with the help of several &lt;a href=\"druids\"&gt;druids&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion was eventually able to destroy the Nightmare Lord's power source, both on the Emerald Dream and in Azeroth. With him gone, the nature and dreamform armies were able to rout and defeat the Nightmare, though a small pocket of it remained unconquered.\nBut Azeroth was not able to be in peace for long, as soon after came the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;."}

His tyrannical leadership of the Horde has been ended by his many enemies, and he must answer for his crimes.\"\n\"Renowned leaders from across the world gather in Pandaria to witness Garrosh's trial.

Mounting tensions and rising enmity steer the court to the brink of chaos... as the world waits with bated breath for the verdict on the war crimes of Garrosh Hellscream.\"\nAudiobook edition.\nAn unabridged audiobook edition was released by Simon &amp; Schuster Audio in May 2014.

He also uses a warstomp, similar to Thunderclap, but reduces movement speed instead of &lt;a href=\"attack%20speed\"&gt;attack speed&lt;/a&gt;.\nMind Controlling the berserker in the previous room to tank Voone will not work. He loses the MC the moment he attacks Voone.\nAt 70.\nA well geared 70 can solo him but he will put up a fight so you will have to use all your Cooldowns, and pack a &lt;a href=\"Super%20Healing%20Potion\"&gt;Healing Potion&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Healthstone\"&gt;Healthstone&lt;/a&gt;, just remember that no stuns or disorient effects work so it will be a straight forward fight."}

If the participation is overwhelmingly one-sided, then the opposing faction will be offered the &lt;a href=\"Against%20Overwhelming%20Odds\"&gt;Against Overwhelming Odds&lt;/a&gt; quest as even further incentive to participate.\nAdditionally, activating War Mode enables &lt;a href=\"PvP%20talent\"&gt;PvP talent&lt;/a&gt;s in the open world.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, world PvP activities can reward a currency, &lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Tokens\"&gt;Bloody Tokens&lt;/a&gt;, that can be exchanged for gear.\nAir Drops.\nInfrequently, &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Machine%20%28War%20Mode%29\"&gt;flying machines&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zeppelin%20%28War%20Mode%29\"&gt;zeppelins&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; will make its way across the sky within a zone and will eventually drop a &lt;a href=\"War%20Supply%20Crate\"&gt;War Supply Crate&lt;/a&gt; where players can fight over and claim it for their faction, similar to the chest in the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Arena\"&gt;Gurubashi Arena&lt;/a&gt;. Once a faction has gained control of the crate, anyone of that faction who is within the area will have a short period to open it and collect a piece of &lt;a href=\"personal%20loot\"&gt;personal loot&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe time limit between each air drop is speculated to be around 20 minutes, but that hasn't always been the case.\nBounty Hunter System.\nKilling a certain number of players of the opposite faction, without dying awards the status of Assassin that increases damage and healing by 15%. The downside to this, the more players an Assassin kills, the more likely they will show up on the zone map for other players to target and to gain a bounty. Players who successfully kill an Assassin of the opposite faction will receive &lt;a href=\"Conquest%20Points\"&gt;Conquest points&lt;/a&gt; as well as other rewards. There can be three or possibly more Assassins on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; at a time, providing plenty of opportunity for players or groups of players to take their revenge on the opposite faction's Assassins. This system was available in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; limited-time event.\nThe following buff is applied upon entering &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; with War Mode enabled:\nUpon killing 10 players of the opposing faction, the Assassin buff will be applied.\nAfter killing multiple players of the opposing faction and obtaining the assassin buff, the opposing faction will place a bounty on the player with the &lt;a href=\"Bounty%20Hunted\"&gt;Bounty Hunted&lt;/a&gt; debuff with a zone-wide message:"}

The &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; of the planet caused by Deathwing's emergence from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; marked the beginning of this conflict, which ultimately ended with the &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;fall of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWith the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing fled to the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;, in Deepholm, to recover and prepare for his return to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. During his absence, his son, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; attempted to create a new, powerful dragonflight called the &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;Chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; with partial success before his defeat in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;. Some time later, &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; created the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. By the time the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; set sail for &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; ended its battle against &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, allying with the Firelord and &lt;a href=\"Al%27akir\"&gt;Ala'kir the Windlord&lt;/a&gt;. \nBy the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Deathwing had completely recovered from his defeat. Shortly after the heroes of Northrend returned home, Deathwing prepared for his return, sending earthquakes and shockwaves across the planet. Allying with Deathwing, the cultists of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; began spreading the word of doom and destruction to the races of Azeroth, leading up to an &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;attack&lt;/a&gt; of major cities by various elementals. Though the first attacks were stopped, Deathwing finally emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, destroying the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; in Deepholm and causing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Second Sundering&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance-Horde war.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt; caused by Deathwing's return reshaped the face of much of Azeroth. Entire areas were devastated, resources lost, and raging elementals attacked. The upheaval caused the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to fight each other for resources while battling the members of the Twilight Hammer wherever they could.\n&lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nFew places on Azeroth exemplify this ever-changing dynamic more than the Twilight Highlands of the Eastern Kingdoms. The Highlands have undergone constant upheaval throughout their history, with races and factions thriving, collapsing, and changing seemingly without pause. The fortress-city of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; has played host to no fewer than three potent factions: the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who abandoned their home after a &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron&lt;/a&gt; curse left it uninhabitable; the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, which was forced to fight for the Horde in the captivity of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw orcs&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;; and, of course, the Dragonmaw themselves, who were driven from Grim Batol when the red dragonflight was finally freed from their grasp.\nThe Dragonmaw now cling to the edges of the highlands. They're no less wild and difficult to deal with than when they ruled Grim Batol, but their knowledge of dragons and warfare is of unquestionable importance, especially amidst the chaos of the Cataclysm. The Wildhammer dwarves dwell in forested outposts among the highlands' mountains; though long friendly with the Alliance, they have only now begun to consider casting their lot in with Stormwind and Ironforge thanks to the entreaties of their cousins, the Bronzebeard clan. Even the mighty red dragonflight has suffered greatly in recent months: its members have been decimated by a frenzied, newly aggressive black dragonflight attacking relentlessly from the petrified &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Forest\"&gt;Obsidian Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Citadel\"&gt;Twilight Citadel&lt;/a&gt; which holds the entrance to the Bastion of Twilight, the Twilight's Hammer's stronghold. Amidst this upheaval, a new power has come to possess the highlands. Though the environment has been given many names throughout its history, it's only been dubbed \"Twilight\" thanks to the dominance of its current masters. The fanatical Twilight's Hammer cultists appreciate the name, but there are more functional features to the swath of land they've chosen as their headquarters. It's rimmed by massive mountain peaks that scrape at the sky like fingernails, making invasion by land nearly impossible, and the highlands' black-glass beaches ensure that marine assaults are fraught with terror; ships docking on the peninsula risk running aground.\nMore important to the cult, however, is the promise of worldly extinction and change that permeates the land. In the dimness of the highlands, shadows are deeper. The sun and the rest of Azeroth seem distant. The elements themselves are more pronounced: fires burn hotter; rain forces its way into the ground; and the heaves and shudders of the land call to mind some colossal being stirring beneath the earth. This doesn't frighten the members of the Twilight's Hammer; it lulls them to sleep.\nTheir dark work is done here in a manner that could never have been realized in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. The devoted of the Twilight's Hammer train in the halls of mighty fortresses, not tiny compounds and outposts. They summon dangerous, mercurial elementals who loathe each other to the point of outright war but still pause their feuds momentarily to work towards the destruction of the other races. Outside the highlands, the cult is fractious and divided. Here, it is guided on its mission of destruction by some of the cruelest and bloodiest names in history, yet the names associated with this cabal belie the true extent of its leadership.\nThese dark whisperers chose the highlands as their base of operations for a reason. They can feel the presence of the Old Gods in the air and see their victory in the darkness. The shifting landscape, battling factions, and wicked elements embody the cult's vision of what its world will become as it is finally purged of life and order. The rest of Azeroth will follow the Twilight Highlands into oblivion, one way or another.\nDominated by the Old Gods' forces, Grim Batol is under siege by the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and heroes of the Alliance and Horde. It is here that &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; decides the black dragonflight cannot be saved and finally decides to destroy the flight, later &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; take off to a fight in the air, mortally wounding Alexstrasza and weakening Deathwing. Alexstrasza would have died if not for her son, &lt;a href=\"Calen\"&gt;Calen&lt;/a&gt; distracting the black aspect. Some time later, the twilight citadel itself is attacked by forces of the Alliance and Horde. Eventually &lt;a href=\"Skullcrusher%20the%20Mountain\"&gt;Skullcrusher the Mountain&lt;/a&gt; is killed and eventually the leader of the Twilight's Hammer himself, &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;. It is further revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;Twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; are being created by &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Caverns\"&gt;Twilight Caverns&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. After being slain, Sintharia says: \"Deathwing, I have fallen, The brood has fallen\", which might mean that her death is the end of the Twilight dragonflight.\n&lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cataclysm brought the &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt; towers into Uldum which served as an entrance to &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;'s domain Skywall - the elemental plane of air. Al'Akir sent his elemental minions to convince the &lt;a href=\"Tol%27vir\"&gt;Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt; to join his new liege &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, even rewarding them by removing the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Those who dared to oppose suffered dire consequences, as shown by the &lt;a href=\"Orsis\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt; settlement. With the aid of the Alliance and the Horde, the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20tribe\"&gt;Ramkahen tribe&lt;/a&gt; were able to decimate the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset tribe&lt;/a&gt;. Al'Akir and his &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20Wind\"&gt;commanders&lt;/a&gt; were later defeated, ending the war against Deathwing's elemental forces in Uldum.\n&lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Planes&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile massive resources were spent on the war against the counterpart faction, the Alliance and Horde eventually turn their focus on the forces of the Twilight Hammer and Deathwing, directing forces to &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, where many forces of the Twilight Hammer rest.\nThe Defense of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point prior to the Cataclysm, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; awoke from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, leading the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; against the Twilight Hammer at Mount Hyjal. Ragnaros, after being banished in the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;, was resummoned to Azeroth by Deathwing in order to destroy the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, who also is active in the campaign against the Twilight Hammer, has adventurers reawaken other &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20guardian\"&gt;Ancient guardian&lt;/a&gt;s to aid in the battle.\nInvading &lt;a href=\"Vashj%27ir\"&gt;Vashj'ir&lt;/a&gt;.\nElsewhere, an island appeared off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, considered by both the Alliance and the Horde to be vital in their ongoing conflict. However, en route to the island, the ships were attacked and their passengers pulled into the sea by naga. It is eventually learned that the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, allied with Deathwing and the Twilight's Hammer, are waging a war against &lt;a href=\"Neptulon\"&gt;Neptulon the Tidehunter&lt;/a&gt;, in an effort to take control of the seas themselves. Rather than allowing the naga to take control of the powerful domain, the mortal races aid the Tidehunter repelling the naga. The naga are overall victorious, however, invading the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt; and forcing Neptulon into hiding/imprisonment. While heroes attempted to aid Neptulon as he cleansed the waters, the kraken &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt; pulled a weakened Neptulon away as it fled the battle.\nRepairing the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Cataclysm brought Azeroth closer to the Elemental Planes than it has ever been. The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt;, feeling the distress of the planet, work to repair the damage Deathwing caused. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; gave the title of Warchief of the Horde to &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, while he and other shamans like &lt;a href=\"Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muln\"&gt;Muln&lt;/a&gt; tried to stabilize the rift within the Maelstrom, keeping Azeroth from collapsing into Deepholm. Forces of the Alliance and Horde have joined forces with the Earthen Ring to repair the World Pillar but must battle the Twilight Hammer in Deepholm to recover the misses pieces. Rather than joining Ragnaros and Al'akir, &lt;a href=\"Therazane\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt; chose to side with the mortals in order to prevent her enemies from taking her realm, or even its eventual collapse.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Firelands%20Invasion\"&gt;Firelands Invasion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoth Ragnaros' forces and those of the Twilight's Hammer seek to burn the world tree Nordrassil. It is up to adventurers to push the foot soldiers back and interact with five Ancients: Goldrinn, Aviana, Aessina, Tortolla and Cenarius, and rescue the legendary commander Jarod Shadowsong. Once these five Ancients are back in the fight, Malfurion, Hamuul, and Cenarius lead a charge against Ragnaros in Sulfuron Spire, driving him back to the Firelands. After the lost of many warriors and the recruiting of many organizations, the &lt;a href=\"Avengers%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;Avengers of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; go to the Firelord's throne, killing him once and for all.\nTwilight of the Aspects.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; was attacked and taken over by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;'s consort &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly betrayed the Accord; destroying the sanctums underneath the temple and all of the unhatched eggs in the process. Distraught, the embittered Life-Binder officially disbanded the Accord and fled the scene. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, who was present to witness this, appears before &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in her kaldorei guise. Ysera asks Thrall to undertake a journey to relieve a small druid camp in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; of a rampant fire elemental. Thrall quickly accepts upon learning of his new companion's true identity. With Ysera's urging, Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Snowsong\"&gt;Snowsong&lt;/a&gt; set out to the find the camp and relieve its inhabitants. Thrall is surprised to see that the camp is inhabited mainly by night elf sentinels, though after some mutual hostility, Thrall converses with the fire elemental (its attitude reminiscent of those who had attacked Orgrimmar prior to the cataclysm) and convinces it to leave. Thrall's reputation with the gathered kaldorei increases immensely, and the former warchief spends the evening feasting and drinking with them as friends.\nHaving succeeded in his small task, an elf named &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt; approached Thrall and urges him to come into the local woodland. After speaking with the relieved ancients, Desharin reveals himself as a green dragon; informing Thrall that Ysera has a far more important task for him and him alone. Desharin takes Thrall to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, where they are admitted entry by the bronze dragons on Ysera's behalf. While there, the two are attacked by a mysterious human in eerily familiar armor. Desharin is beheaded by the assailant, and he and Thrall do battle. The bronze dragons relieve the battle, and Thrall is instructed to flee through a time portal. On the other end of the time portal, Thrall finds himself at a late point in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. However, Desharin\u2019s murderer makes a reappearance in this timeway - and attacks Thrall once more. He informs Thrall that his death is all that's on his agenda, and that killing him as a child will be far easier than his adult self. As Blackmoore approaches the infant, such as proper in the true timeline, Thrall grabs his attacker and hurls him into a neighboring river. The two struggle for a time, though after noticing a curious glittering of bronze scales, Thrall is taken to another point in time and his attacker disappears once more. Thrall comes face to face with a slightly older &lt;a href=\"Taretha\"&gt;Taretha&lt;/a&gt;; embittered by what appears to have been a far harsher life. After convincing her that he is who he says he is, Taretha informs him of some damning news - in this timeline, Thrall had died as a child. &lt;a href=\"Blackmoore\"&gt;Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;, robbed of his prized future-gladiator, did the unexpected: rather than fall further into drink and depression, he sobered up; conscripted mercenaries into his new army, and trained them all himself. Gaining huge support, Blackmoore led his army against &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and slew the Horde warchief in one-on-one combat. Rather than have the stunned orcs killed, however, Blackmoore engaged in a secret pact with them - to join him, and overthrow the Alliance usurping the kingdom of Lordaeron and deposing House &lt;a href=\"Menethil\"&gt;Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe and Taretha travel to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, where they are admitted to &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;' presence. The three come to realize that not only is their \"timeline\" false; but rather, \"time\" itself was the illusion here. The understanding shatters the apparent timeway, and Thrall finally finds the Aspect of Time, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, awaiting him. Nozdormu begins to piece together the various events occurring in both the alternate the true timeline. To Thrall\u2019s - and the onlooking bronze dragons\u2019 - immense shock, Nozdormu informs him that the great Aspect\u2019s retreat from the world was in order to discover the cause of a dire event destined to happen in the future and to avert it. This event would be Nozdormu founding and presiding over the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu also admits that, as such, he was also responsible for sending the assassin after Thrall. At this point, Thrall comes to realize his mysterious assailant\u2019s identity - the missing Blackmoore from the false timeline. Regardless of this pressing matter, Nozdormu thanks Thrall for giving him clarity; setting him another task: to find and lift Alexstrasza from her grief over Krasus\u2019 demise, and to convince the blue dragonflight to set aside its differences with the others and join forces against the impending darkness.\nThrall and &lt;a href=\"Tick\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; set out to confront the bereaved Life-Binder, and the two find her in the barren wasteland of &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. Though Alexstrasza rebukes his comfort and banishes him from her sight, Thrall does not give up hope for the Life-Binder just yet. Thrall then makes the journey to the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; is admitted audience with &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall learns that the blue dragonflight is in the process of electing its next &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, and that the two most likely candidates are &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;' ferocious son, Arygos himself, and none other than Kalecgos. An event known as the \"&lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;\" is set to occur shortly; a time where the two moons of Azeroth meet in what cosmetically appears to be the form of a mother embracing her child, hence the name. This sacred event heralds a celestial time for the blue dragons, and their best chance of truly empowering a new Aspect for their flight. To Thrall\u2019s great relief, and to Kalecgos\u2019 great bemusement, Kalecgos is chosen as the new Aspect. The flight as a whole are pleased with this decision and watch eagerly as their new leader is empowered by the titans\u2019 might. Arygos, enraged, curses the flight for fools; abandoning &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the flight begins to celebrate its new leader\u2019s ascension, &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragon\"&gt;twilight dragon&lt;/a&gt;s interrupt the ceremony. Thrall leaps atop Kalec's back, and the two prove a formidable fighting force. After disposing of several of the creatures, the blues give chase to the fleeing remainder. They arrive at the Wyrmrest Temple, and catch sight of the semi-functional &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, the blues press on; fighting back the twilight dragonflight with efficiency. However, Chromatus - now awakened with the blood of the murdered Arygos - engages in the battle, and cuts a swathe of destruction through the blues. Thrall is hurled off Kalec in the ensuing chaos and finds his footing in the snow. As he calls upon the aid of the elements, he is granted a peculiar vision of Krasus\u2019 final moments and resolves to inform the Life-Binder of the truth behind his demise. However, Thrall is brutally attacked by a newly-arrived Blackmoore. Wielding the Doomhammer in tandem with his powerful elemental skill, Thrall catches his mortal enemy off-guard. Blackmoore is lambasted by Thrall's summoned wind-vortex, and collapses on the floor before his former slave. As Thrall moves in to deal the final blow, Blackmoore begs for his life. Though Thrall takes no pleasure in the act, he refuses to relent; bringing the Doomhammer down upon Blackmoore and conquering the shadow he cast over Thrall's life for good.\nElsewhere, the blue dragons were beaten back by the powerful Chromatus. Kalec has Thrall rescued by one of his drakes, though the strain of leadership in the wake of their defeat begins to gnaw at the new Aspect of Magic. Thrall encourages Kalec to remain strong, and he leaves once more for Desolace. Thrall finds Alexstrasza in an even more shattered state. He shares with her the vision he was granted, and in solemn silence, the two witness Krasus' heroic sacrifice to protect the Wyrmrests' unhatched children from being born as chromatic beasts. Reinvigorated and regaining her confidence, the Life-Binder travels to the Nexus to join forces with the new Aspect of Magic.\nBefore long, the red, blue, and green dragonflights are reunited with their respective Aspects. With their might combined, they leave to do battle with the murderous Chromatus and his ilk. After a vicious battle, Chromatus reaches his full potential - and overpowers all three of the mighty Aspects. The downhill fight is turned by the arrival of Nozdormu and his bronze flight, and the Aspect of Time puts forward the notion that they will need to work together, in the most fundamental sense of the word, to defeat this creature that embodies all of their traits and powers. However, Chromatus has a head for each dragonflight, and there are no black dragons present to assist in this task - though Thrall, as a shaman, offers to take on that role. In their humanoid forms, the aspects open themselves along with Thrall to truly gain a sense of unity; and while he struggles to hold the ceremony together, Thrall succeeds in his role in Neltharion's stead. Knowing that he could never become as Aspect, he remains content with the notion that he could assist his allies in their hour of need. The four Aspects launch a volley of powerful abilities at the stunned Chromatus, who cannot bring himself to counter the volatile new powers at their disposal. The chromatic dragon is blasted downwards; the Twilight Father in tow. Chromatus' lifeless body is stored in a specifically-made arcane prison by the blue dragonflight, as it seems impossible to completely eradicate him.\nLater, the Aspects and Thrall meet on the top of Wyrmrest Temple, where Nozdormu informs the group of a plot by the Old Gods to destroy the dragonflights. The &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; was fast approaching and the Dragonflights, thanks to Thrall's help, will now be ready to face it. Thrall is given both the thanks and a scale each of the dragon aspects; in return for assistance asking only for a way to travel back to the Maelstrom.\nEnd of The Destroyer.\nAfter the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, the aspects gathered to discuss how to end Deathwing once and for all, and it became clear that they needed a weapon like none that had ever come before it, they would need the Dragon Soul, but the golden disc was no more, and so everything lay on Nozdormu's shoulders, would he allow mortals to travel 10.000 years back in time, and retrieve the disc? Alexstrasza managed to convince the bronze aspect to do so.\nWith the death of &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt; gateways to the past were open and Nozdormu was able again to transport adventurers to &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt;, where they witnessed one of the most catastrophic events in the War of the Ancients, dating back 10,000 years. While assisting the much younger Tyrande and Illidan in a battle against the Highborne and Burning Legion, adventurers stole the Dragon Soul hovering above the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. After recovering a version of the artifact from the Caverns of Time, Thrall and the allied dragonflights rallied at Wyrmrest Temple in a desperate bid to use its might to defeat Deathwing.\nSiege of Wyrmrest Temple.\n&lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; arrived nearby &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers began by attempting to relieve the beleaguered Aspects under siege by the Twilight's Hammer, the Twilight dragonflight and the Black dragonflight. Along with an army of mortal races and dragons led by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Devrestrasz\"&gt;Lord Devrestrasz&lt;/a&gt; adventurers battle their way through the army and stop an &lt;a href=\"Morchok\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt; at the base of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce inside Wyrmrest &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; explained that Deathwing has summoned extremely powerful Faceless ones to assault the Temple as well, and Maws of the Old Gods are erupting from the nearby earth. The Faceless ones were defeated, and the temple is all but reclaimed and the Aspects decide now its the time to strike. However upon meeting with them, Thrall explained that using the full power of the Dragon Soul would likely kill him in the process, but &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; suggested that they can use the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize it. The Twilight's Hammer knew about the weakness and sent several of their most powerful shamans under the leadership of to ambush the heroes at the Eye. Hagara was defeated and the Focusing Iris is taken back to Wrymrest. \nFall of Deathwing.\nAs the Aspects want to empower the Dragon Soul Deathwing realized what was happening and sent dozens of twilight drakes to stop them. Once the drakes were defeated the Aspects begin to empower the Dragon Soul with their own energies. With their focus on the Dragon Soul, Deathwing sent his ultimate minion to finish them off - the ultimate Twilight dragon experiment who is meant to cause the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; by slaying the Dragon Aspects at this juncture. Ultraxion was defeated and the Dragon Soul was fully charged and Thrall unleashed it at Deathwing, blowing one of the elementium plates off his back. Realizing that the battle is lost, Deathwing destroyed a &lt;a href=\"Gunship\"&gt;Horde Gunship&lt;/a&gt; and flew off to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; so that he can escape into the relative safety of Deepholm. The Aspects, the heroes, and the surviving crew boarded &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyfire\"&gt;The Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; and chase after Deathwing. On the way, Twilight's Hammer drake riders, led by the &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer Warmaster Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;, harry them. When the Skyfire caught up the drakes attacked the Skyfire's engines and allowed Deathwing to escape. The heroes managed to kill all of the drakes and Warmaster Blackhorn, then repair the engines and resume their chase.\nUpon catching up to Deathwing &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;they parachuted onto his back&lt;/a&gt; and began to rip off the armor plates and prying a hole big enough to give Thrall a clean shot with the Dragon Soul, this time burning a hole through his chest. Deathwing plummeted into the Maelstrom and was presumed dead. The adventurers and the Aspects land at the Maelstrom. As they celebrated the defeat of Deathwing, Nozdormu warns them to be quick and Deathwing re-emerges. The final stage of the war began when &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's deformed body&lt;/a&gt; rose out of the Maelstrom to face off against the adventurers in the final showdown with many phases. Adventurers jumped between the islands and detached Deathwing's mutated arms from each island. Once Deathwing was weakened the Aspects channeled all of their remaining powers into the Dragon Soul and fired it at Deathwing, completely \"unmaking\" him but also making them mortals. With the loss of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s powers, the Dragon Soul was returned back in time to the point where it was taken.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Only a few tolerated new neighbors. The rest launched endless raids into the humans' fledgeling hamlets and settlements, and attacked even the farmers and civilians. Not all of the Drust agreed with the war however, such as the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; who left the Drust to join Kul Tiran society.\nThe Drust assaults carried on for many years, until the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; decided something had to be done and began a war against the Drust. But though the Waycrests were hearty folk, the Drust death magic was strong and the humans began to lose the war. House Waycrest researched their magic and created the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; to fight them. To counter the Drust magic, the Order of Embers used weapons of &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn time the Drust would be forced to withdraw as they lost numbers to the human settlers. When their great leader &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; ran out of living warriors, he conducted a ritual to create &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;stone constructs&lt;/a&gt; to fight for him as part of his desperation to win. Colonel &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; (who would later become a Lord) led the humans' final assault on the last Drust stand at &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt; and stabbed Gorak Tul himself. As he was stabbed Gorak Tul's power was broken and with it his connection to his stone constructs, which shattered. But though wounded and broken, Gorak Tul did not die.\nIn modern times, the story has been warped. The modern Kul Tirans believe that the stone constructs were used for a longer period than just near the end of the war, that Arom had killed Gorak Tul, and that Gorak Tul's living army fell soon after his death instead of earlier on.\nThe Drust would live on as spirits, trying to return to the physical world. The Waycrests had wiped out the Drust, but could not destroy Gorak Tul. For countless years he waited to enact his vengeance, until &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; provided the means. In the present day, Gorak Tul taught the Drust's ancient death magic to Lady Waycrest, who in turn formed the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;. The coven's magic awakened the remaining stone constructs. However, Lady Waycrest was merely a vessel for his power and her death opened the &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20%28Waycrest%20Manor%29\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt;, the doorway for the Drust to enter Azeroth. At the Rupture, Gorak Tul was able to raise his people from the dead, but he was slain nonetheless. With his death, the Heartsbane Coven was broken and Drustvar was released from Gorak Tul's power.\nOther battles.\nOn one mission, Arom Waycrest found an injured &lt;a href=\"Athair\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt; that had been battling the Drust. Rather than killing it, he decided to heal it in hopes for it to continue its assault against his enemies. On that very night at their campsite, the Drust would take the Drustvar Militia by surprise and their defeat was assured. It was at that moment that the stag reappeared and helped them repel the aggressors. Grateful for its help, Arom thanked the stag and in returned the stag thanked him for his kindness."}

In the face of a number of aggressive actions conducted by a newly-resurgent undead Scourge, a number of organizations were established to bring an end to the threat of the Lich King once and for all. First among these was the formation of the Argent Crusade after the war's first conflict, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, which also cemented the independence of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, all of these factions immediately declaring war on, and mobilising to oppose, the Scourge.\nAt the same time, while the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were also preparing to attack the Scourge, the Lich King preemptively struck first. The Scourge simultaneously launched determined invasions of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, escalating the war by forcing the two factions to take direct action. Having repelled the Lich King's forces, the Horde and Alliance declared war on the Scourge and formally launched their campaigns to the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King's base of operations. At this time, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; also joined the conflict by moving their city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, in the center of Northrend; the city would go on to serve as a launching point for many of the actions against the Scourge.\nAs the Alliance and Horde began to consolidate the holdings they had gained on the continent, the Argent Crusade, under Highlord &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, began to bolster its forces and strike out against the Scourge. In the midst of the War against the Lich King, several other major threats presented themselves which drew the attention of the many factions. These included the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and its aftermath, the &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20Ulduar\"&gt;the awakening of Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. Despite these distractions, the Lich King's collective adversaries continued making gains against the Scourge, eventually taking the fight to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; itself.\nFollowing a brief intermission in major fighting as the Argent Crusade and &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;its champions&lt;/a&gt; tested and prepared themselves in the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt; in Icecrown, an assault on the Lich King's bastion\u2014&lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;\u2014was launched. The battle was a coordinated effort by the Crusade, the Knights of the Ebon Blade, the Horde, and Alliance (although they &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;came to blows&lt;/a&gt; during the event), with the goal of finally vanquishing the Lord of the Scourge. Though the Lich King, Arthas, was eventually defeated, it became apparent that the absence of a Lich King would lead to the Scourge becoming unrestrained, at which point it would eventually destroy &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Taking the burden upon himself, the once-thought-deceased &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; donned the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;helmet of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, in doing so becoming dormant on the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and binding the Scourge. This event marked the end of the campaign in Northrend, the united mortal races having achieved a decisive victory over the Undead Scourge (though it could not be fully vanquished), thereby saving the entire world from catastrophe.\nHistory.\nPrelude.\nAfter his defeat of &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; proceeded to ascend the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; and don the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, becoming the new &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; by merging with the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. Following this, the new Lich King sat frozen and dormant for a number of years, waging an internal conflict against the last remnants of his humanity. Eventually, Arthas overcame both the last vestiges of his former self \"and\" Ner'zhul's spirit, permanently becoming the dominant personality of the Lich King.\nWhen the Lich King finally awakened, he set out to rally the vast Undead Scourge, with which he would wage an unrelenting war against the living. First, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Sindragosa's Fall&lt;/a&gt; where he used his necromantic powers to raise the ancient &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;, once the prime-consort of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;, from the grave as a &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;. Having also assembled his mighty host of undead soldiers, which now contained his new, elite &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, he put his plans into action and began his war against the denizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLight's Hope.\nWhile the Lich King had been dormant atop the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, his forces had not been idle. His new death knights had been training and preparing themselves in their stronghold of for the coming conflict. The Lich King's first move of the war was to order these elite soldiers to assault the bastions of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Having attacked and annihilated the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt; from their floating necropolis, the Knights of Acherus now turned their attention on the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s of the Argent Dawn at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to even his own troops, however, was that the Lich King had no confidence in his death knights' success, fully realizing they would be defeated by the paladins.\nThe Lich King's true purpose for the assault was to draw out the renowned Highlord of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. During the brutal battle which became known as the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, around 10,000 Scourge soldiers (not all death knights) battle with some 300 defenders of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Despite their efforts, the death knights were defeated, their leader &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; being confronted by Tirion Fordring himself, who told him that Arthas had sent them on a suicide mission. After the appearance of a vision of Darion's father, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King himself arrived and cynically confirmed what Tirion had stated earlier.\nEnraged by the betrayal, Darion launched himself at Arthas, though the Lich King simply threw him back. As the Prince of Darkness then moved to confront Tirion, Darion threw his weapon, the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, to the paladin. Having purified the weapon, Tirion attacked the Lich King with it, driving him back. Leaving their battle for another day, Arthas fled back to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, though warning Tirion that they would meet again, but that next time it \"...wouldn't be on holy ground\". After the Lich King's departure, Fordring immediately issued a call for the Argent Dawn and Order of the Silver Hand to unite to form the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Together, he claimed they would pursue Arthas to Northrend, tear down the walls of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;his fortress&lt;/a&gt;, and end the Lich King.\nWith their free will now their own, Darion Mograine and the other Knights of Acherus pledged themselves to the same cause, giving their order the new name of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;. They promptly returned to their Ebon Hold, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Ebon%20Hold\"&gt;which they proceeded to seize&lt;/a&gt; from Scourge loyal to the Lich King. With their position secured, Mograine sent many of the now-free death knights to rejoin their people in either the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and to aid them in the coming war against the Scourge.\nThe Wrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the period immediately preceding the outbreak of the war, the major capital cities of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; began receiving large quantities of mysterious packages of grain. Having been manipulated into the food supply, they were ingested by much of the cities' populace. Those who consumed the infected grain subsequently turned into bloodthirsty &lt;a href=\"ghoul\"&gt;ghoul&lt;/a&gt;s, unless first treated by members of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, who attempted to prevent the spread and damage of the contagion. Before long, the major capitals of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were thrown into chaos and confusion, with authorities scrambling to deal with the impending catastrophe.\nDuring the disorganization, &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Necropolis\"&gt;necropoli&lt;/a&gt; began appearing around the world, instigating the second Scourge war. In order to face the invading undead, the Horde and Alliance struck a temporary alliance at &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;. While the Alliance and &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; worked toward finding a way to neutralize the necropoli, the Horde worked tirelessly in order to unlock the secrets of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt;. With great effort and sacrifice, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;forces&lt;/a&gt; of both the Horde and Alliance managed to succeed in repelling the advancing Scourge armies. Some semblance of order returned as the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s forces were halted before they could triumph.\nOutraged by these events and the perceived treachery, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow Horde leaders, as well as &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and his fellow Alliance leaders, (who had already been making preparations to oppose the Scourge) now planned an invasion of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;\u2014base of the Undead Scourge\u2014to end the threat that the Lich King and his armies posed once and for all.\nThe final act which forced the leaders' to act occurred when, soon afterwards, the Lich King launched direct and determined attacks on the capitals of both the Alliance and Horde. Two large Scourge armies consisting of &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s and various other undead assaulted &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; simultaneously. Both factions' leaders, as well as powerful &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt;, were once more successful in halting the Scourge's advance and driving it back. In the aftermath of these attacks, the Horde and Alliance formed the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Expedition\"&gt;Horde Expedition&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Vanguard\"&gt;Alliance Vanguard&lt;/a&gt; respectively, whose duty it was to organize and launch their faction's assault on the Lich King's icy domain.\nInvasion of Northrend.\nLaunching their invasion, the Horde sent a preliminary force, known as the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Offensive\"&gt;Warsong Offensive&lt;/a&gt;, to the continent of Northrend. This sub-faction would spearhead the Horde's efforts throughout the continent. The invasion fleet set sail, consisting mainly of ships built by &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s from nearby &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;, assembled near the &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt; coastline where they left for the &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;. Simultaneously, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; launched their own force, known as the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Hand of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;, from the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; bound for the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; on the far side of the continent to the Horde's other landing site. Upon reaching Northrend, these armies immediately began to establish footholds, constructing &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Hold\"&gt;Warsong Hold&lt;/a&gt; in Borean Tundra and &lt;a href=\"Vengeance%20Landing\"&gt;Vengeance Landing&lt;/a&gt; in Howling Fjord. Soon after arriving, Horde forces encountered the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;, long-lost cousins of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, who were fighting a losing war against the Lich King and the Scourge. The Horde proceeded to lend aid to the beleaguered taunka, saving them from extinction and gaining their allegiance in the process.\nMeanwhile, the Alliance had launched its own invasion of Northrend. Establishing the &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Expedition\"&gt;Valiance Expedition&lt;/a&gt; to lead their forces into the Scourge's frigid home, an Alliance fleet set from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, bound for the Borean Tundra. Similarly, a second fleet from &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; set off for the Howling Fjord where the Alliance also planned to enter the continent. Upon arriving in Northrend, the Valiance Expedition went about establishing bases of operation in the form of &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; in Borean Tundra and &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt; in Howling Fjord. Along with military forces, the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; also arrived with the Alliance invasion force, hoping to discover clues relating to the dwarves' past, as well as aiding in the fight against the Undead Scourge. In the region known as &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, they found a far-flung faction of dwarves known as the &lt;a href=\"Frostborn\"&gt;Frostborn&lt;/a&gt;, who were embroiled in conflict with the Scourge, as well as other threats. Having received aid from &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Alliance champions&lt;/a&gt;, as well as having befriended members of the Explorers' League, the Frostborn were persuaded to join with the Alliance, pledging to aid wherever they were able.\nDuring this time, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; also decided to relocate their base of operations to the continent of Northrend to better counter the increasing threat of both the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; (as part of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;) and the Scourge itself. The order used a great deal of its power in physically moving the freshly-reconstructed city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt; in the center of Northrend. The city subsequently served as a base of operations for many actions taken against the Scourge by both the Alliance and Horde, as well as the Kirin Tor itself. At this time, the &lt;a href=\"elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; factions of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; relocated to the city, representing the Alliance and Horde respectively. Both factions also took a direct part in the ongoing war against the Scourge.\nEarly battles.\nThe early battles of the war consisted mainly of the Horde and Alliance defending their newly-established bases on the continent. Both the Scourge and their &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; allies (the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20clan\"&gt;Dragonflayer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; clans) launched determined attacks on both factions' expeditions, causing massive casualties. The battles became ever more desperate as it became apparent that the expeditions would be driven back into the sea if they were unable to maintain these footholds. With a formidable defense, however, both the Alliance and Horde were successfully able to hold off the Lich King's attempts to rout them. The battle for &lt;a href=\"Icemist%20Village\"&gt;Icemist Village&lt;/a&gt;, the attack on Warsong Hold, and the raids on Valgarde and Valiance Keep represent the bulk of these early battles in the war against the Lich King. Though attempting it several times, the Scourge was ultimately unable to effectively force the invaders' from Northrend.\nThe Azjol-anak.\nWithin the ancient, sprawling underground kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, the undead &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, bound in service to the Lich King in undeath, occupied the reaches of their shattered nation. Although the vast majority of nerubians had been slain during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt; (and subsequently raised from the dead) years ago, a small group had remained alive; this group became known as the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-anak\"&gt;Azjol-anak&lt;/a&gt;. Now acting as a resistance to their undead brethren led by the fallen king &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Azjol-anak\"&gt;Azjol-anak&lt;/a&gt; accepted the aid of members of the Alliance and Horde who had recently arrived on the continent. Together, they were successful in slaying the mighty Anub'arak and eventually breaking much of the Scourge's power within the Spider Kingdom.\nEventually, the Azjol-anak revealed that they possessed vast stores of untouched eggs, which they planned on nurturing in the hope of rebuilding their empire. Upon expelling another grave threat, the &lt;a href=\"faceless%20one\"&gt;faceless one&lt;/a&gt;s, in &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27kahet\"&gt;Ahn'kahet&lt;/a&gt;, they began the process of hatching a large cocoon.\nCounter-attack.\nHaving firmly established themselves on the continent, and withstood all that the Scourge had thrown at them, the Alliance and Horde now began to launch their own offensives against the Lich King's forces. Both factions' expeditions pressed further into the continent, encountering fierce resistance from both the Scourge and its allies. A major threat that soon presented itself was that of the vrykul clans who had sworn themselves to the Lord of the Scourge. The Dragonflayer and Winterskorn clans subsequently became the focus of the two factions. One by one, the primary vrykul villages and bastions in Howling Fjord were conquered, culminating in an assault by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde and Alliance on &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, the seat of the Dragonflayer clan. There, the vrykul king &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; was slain, marking a serious blow to vrykul power on the continent.\nAt this time, champions from the two factions also began exploring the region known as &lt;a href=\"Sholazar%20Basin\"&gt;Sholazar Basin&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered that, with the failure of several ancient &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; pylons in the zone, ice and Scourge forces had begun to pour into the ordinarily-lush region. In aiding the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Freya\"&gt;Avatar of Freya&lt;/a&gt;, a guardian of the area, these agents eventually uncovered and made use of an ancient Titan weapon: the &lt;a href=\"Etymidian\"&gt;Etymidian&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful stone construct. Using its destructive power, the Avatar of Freya and her allies were successfully able to rout the massive Scourge army preparing to swarm across Sholazar, in doing so ending the threat of the Scourge in the region.\nPushing further inland from both ends of the continent, the Horde and Alliance now began to establish new strongholds from which they would drive the Scourge ever-farther toward its base of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Incidentally, the majority of both factions' resources were focused on the western thrust into the continent, carving a quicker path towards the Lich King's seat of power. As those battling the Scourge pressed on, however, resistance began to grow much stronger. Having established a large base known as &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in eastern &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; came under heavy attack from the Scourge necropolis of &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;. Similarly, to the west at &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde became cut off by Scourge &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s based from &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. At this point, the Lich King also began to attack the dragon shrines in the region, belonging to the various &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. The Scourge raised the corpses of slain &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, turning them into powerful undead &lt;a href=\"frost%20wyrm\"&gt;frost wyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"emberwyrm\"&gt;emberwyrm&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"magmawyrm\"&gt;magmawyrm&lt;/a&gt;s. Accepting aid from the Alliance and Horde, the dragonflights were eventually successful in temporarily stopping this threat, although their resources were severely stretched as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving repelled the Scourge's major assaults and defeated the majority of their forces in the region, both the Horde and Alliance now amassed most of their armies near &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, a barred entrance to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in northern Dragonblight, intending to face the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; in a direct confrontation.\nAngrathar the Wrathgate.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7bwvCgEtStY\"&gt;As the armies of the Alliance and Horde gathered in preparation for the assault on the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, a temporary truce was agreed between the two factions. Both recognized the Lich King and the Scourge as the ultimate threat and agreed to work together to defeat them. When the attack began, the Alliance, led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, was the first to assault the gate, engaging waves of undead as well as vrykul warriors. Soon, Horde forces led by &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; joined the fray, and the two sides began cutting through the Scourge. Having defeated their adversaries, Bolvar Fordragon demanded that Arthas show himself. In response, the Lich King emerged from the Wrathgate, challenging the gathered soldiers. Dranosh, charging the Lord of Icecrown, was quickly slain by him.\nBefore any further conflict was able to occur, however, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt;, chief of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt;, interrupted the exchange from a rise, claiming that the vengeance of the Forsaken was at hand. Putress and other Forsaken atop the rise then catapulted barrels of a &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;newly-developed plague&lt;/a&gt; at those below. Slaying Alliance, Horde, and Scourge alike, the plague quickly began to wipe out or rout all those gathered. The Lich King himself, nearly succumbing to its effects, barely managed to retreat back through the Wrathgate. Just as Bolvar began to die, he was able to see dragons of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;Red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; arrive, bathing the area in flames and incinerating the plague and its wielders (though Putress escaped).\nIt was revealed in the battle's aftermath that the Forsaken perpetrators were, in fact, a faction within the Forsaken, acting without the knowledge or approval of &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, led by the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;. In an ensuing coup, Putress and his allies seized control of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, leading Sylvanas and the rest of the Horde to launch an assault to retake it, sparking the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;; the Alliance also launching their own assault in order to exact retribution for the deaths of Bolvar and the many others. Eventually, with the insurrection crushed, the Undercity was occupied by the Horde once more, though not without conflict from the Alliance.\nThe battle and its outcome marked a catastrophic blow for those fighting the Scourge. It caused severe casualties for both factions, the Alliance alone losing nearly 5,000 soldiers in total. Perhaps worse still, the events of the battle veritably destroyed relations between the Alliance and Horde, with &lt;a href=\"King%20Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; fully blaming the Horde as a whole for the terrible events. Cooperation between the two factions virtually ceased for the remainder of the war, and they would proceed to clash on many occasions in the future.\nThe Wrath Gate broke a tenuous trust that had only just begun to form, and nearly ended the war against the Lich King before it had truly been joined. It was then the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; that took over the push for the Lich King's head, and kept both factions from forgetting entirely who the true enemy was.\nThe conflict continues.\nThe Wolfcult.\nNot long after the events of the Wrathgate, in the neighboring region of &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, an all-out war had finally broken out between the Alliance and the Horde, primarily over the rich supplies of lumber and minerals in the area. The Alliance proceeded to attempt to gain allies in the fight against the Horde by recruiting the region's local &lt;a href=\"trappers\"&gt;trappers&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde responding to this by attacking the native &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. In the midst of these actions, the Alliance, and eventually the Horde, uncovered that many of the region's inhabitants were, in fact, vicious &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. This also came with the discovery of the existence of a mysterious faction known as the &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt;. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Ruuna%20the%20Blind\"&gt;Ruuna the Blind&lt;/a&gt; and the trapper &lt;a href=\"Sasha\"&gt;Sasha&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;agents&lt;/a&gt; of the Alliance and Horde were able to learn the source of the curse and the organization. Having been slain in times past, the infamous &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; was reanimated on the orders of the Lich King. Now risen, the &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;Shade of Arugal&lt;/a&gt; was sent to Grizzly Hills to subvert its trapper communities, forging the second Wolfcult and placing it solely at the service of his dark master.\nThose of the two factions who had uncovered this terrible secret now ventured to the Wolfcult's bastion of &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmoon Isle&lt;/a&gt; with the intention of putting a stop to the group. After fighting and defeating Arugal's greatest lieutenants, the champions engaged the risen archmage himself. Ultimately, Arugal was slain after a fierce battle. With its leadership wiped out, the threat of the Wolfcult was effectively ended, signaling yet another failure for the Lich King's plans.\nThe Drakuru conflict.\nWith a new war on the continent brewing between the Horde and Alliance, and the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; embroiled in a battle on two fronts with the fight against &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos the Spellweaver&lt;/a&gt;, only the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; had remained fully dedicated to the war against the Scourge. The two neutral factions had rallied their forces and readied themselves to unleash a new offensive against the Lich King and his servants. Working in tandem with each other, the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s began by focusing their attention on &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;, entrenching themselves in the region.\nMeanwhile, following the defeat of the Wolfcult, the Alliance and Horde began to focus on crushing the hostile troll tribes to the north. Working with the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Drakuru\"&gt;Drakuru&lt;/a&gt;, champions from both factions succeeded in neutralizing all resistance in the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Unwittingly, however, the Horde and Alliance had handed the stronghold to the Scourge, as Drakuru showed his true colors and became empowered by the Lich King following the keep's fall. With his new powers and authority, Overlord Drakuru conquered the remaining &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; trolls in the immediate vicinity and eventually began subjugating the ravaged nation of Zul'Drak, delivering it to the Undead Scourge. This, in turn, brought Drakuru into direct conflict with the recently-arrived Argent Crusade and the Knights of the Ebon Blade.\nWorking with agents of both the Horde and Alliance, the Crusade and the Death Knights attempted to disrupt Drakuru's plans, which included using the plague to transform the ice troll inhabitants of Zul'Drak into undead minions of the Lich King. Uniquely effective at using the Scourge's own tactics against them, the Knights of the Ebon Blade were able to successfully plant &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;disguised agents&lt;/a&gt; inside Drakuru's forces, based in and around the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Voltarus\"&gt;Voltarus&lt;/a&gt; in western Zul'Drak. Having undermined much of the Scourge's activities and worked their way closer to Overlord Drakuru himself, these agents learned that he had begun to create an army of &lt;a href=\"Blightblood%20Troll\"&gt;Blightblood Troll&lt;/a&gt;s (once ice troll chieftains). Finally striking at the overlord, a vicious fight ensued atop Voltarus. Upon beginning to lose, Drakuru hastily used his power to summon the Lich King and informed him of the enemy agents' treachery. The Lich King, however, expressed disgust at Drakuru's failure, and amusement at the unusual duplicity. Quickly slaying Drakuru, the Lord of the Scourge allowed those who had infiltrated Drakuru's army to live, citing it as both a reward for amusing him, as well as in recognition of their apparent 'potential'.\nDrakuru's death ultimately marked the end of Scourge power in Zul'Drak, the Lich King's enemies continuing to push farther into Northrend.\nAdvance on Icecrown.\nWith the majority of preliminary threats behind them, the Argent Crusade and the Knights of the Ebon Blade now found themselves faced with the daunting prospect of invading &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;, the Scourge's base of operations. With towering cliffs on almost all sides, an attempt to penetrate the region had not been attempted since the disaster at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. Having mustered a large army to fight the Scourge, the Argent Crusade, led personally by &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, advanced into the region from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a stronghold\u2014the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Vanguard\"&gt;Argent Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;\u2014on Icecrown's outskirts. The Crusaders proceeded to create &lt;a href=\"Breach%20%28Icecrown%29\"&gt;a breach&lt;/a&gt; in the cliffs in the northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Echoes\"&gt;Valley of Echoes&lt;/a&gt;. Advancing through the gap into Icecrown proper, the Lich King's forces in &lt;a href=\"Scourgeholme\"&gt;Scourgeholme&lt;/a&gt; launched a massive retaliatory strike against the invaders, pushing them back through the gap to the Argent Vanguard.\nThe encampment immediately came under heavy attack by the Scourge, with waves of undead of every sort assaulting its battlements. The Argent Crusaders fought back with zeal, using melee weapons and cannons to repel each undead attack, aided also by some members of the Alliance and Horde (though the two factions themselves refused to take part). Withstanding even &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood%20Destroyer\"&gt;hosts of frost wyrms&lt;/a&gt;, the Argent Crusade succeeded in throwing the Lich King's minions back from the valley.\nNot pausing, the breach was reopened and the Argent Crusade began working to establish a foothold on the far side. To achieve this, however, the Crusade's leaders deemed in necessary to pacify the Scourge stronghold of Scourgeholme. Under the supervision of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, champions of the Crusade began to make forays into the fortress, targeting strategic areas of the Scourge's military structure, eventually striking at their commanders. With the lords of Scourgeholme slain, the garrison became unable to resist any further action by the invaders.\nPressing their advantage, heroes of the Crusade next assaulted the nearby height mockingly known as &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Crusaders' Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; and held the position against repeated Scourge counterattacks. Having sanctified the once-blighted ground, the Argent Crusade began construction of a new fortification, Justice Keep, atop the Pinnacle. The base would mark the Crusade's establishment inside the 'walls' of Icecrown, and stand in direct defiance to the Lich King and the Scourge.\nThe fight for Icecrown.\nWith Icecrown now breached, the numerous factions arrayed against the Scourge began to make their own individual sorties into the zone. Among them, the Alliance and Horde deployed their own &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s (of gnomish and goblin &lt;a href=\"engineering\"&gt;engineering&lt;/a&gt; respectively) to the region that, when not skirmishing with each other, served as mobile bases and launching points for attacks on strategic objectives against the Scourge.\nThe Alliance soon launched its own assault on one of the region's first obstacles: . Though both factions sought to seize the strategic fortification, the Alliance ultimately struck first, engaging the undead horde manning it. A large Horde reconnaissance party, however, spotted the Alliance force and proceeded to attack it from behind, surprising them and succeeding in breaking up some of their formation. The action served only to leave both sides open to the considerable Scourge army on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Front\"&gt;Broken Front&lt;/a&gt;. Forces of the Argent Crusade arrived late to the battle to discover that the three sides had mutually annihilated each other. The crusaders were only able to recover a portion of the wounded and dead, the Scourge remaining in control of the Death Gate.\nThe events of the battle of the Death Gate were treated by the Alliance as a despicable stab-in-the-back by the Horde, and further damaged the already tattered relations between the two factions. Although the Horde commander in Icecrown, &lt;a href=\"Sky-Reaver%20Korm%20Blackscar\"&gt;Sky-Reaver Korm Blackscar&lt;/a&gt;, notably praised the actions of the patrol (having undermined the Alliance war effort), he was later reprimanded and threatened with execution by &lt;a href=\"Warchief%20Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and Warsong commander &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, the Knights of the Ebon Blade set about securing their own base of operations in Icecrown, from which they could continue to wage their own war against the Lich King. Enlisting the aid of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; from the Alliance and Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Vault\"&gt;Shadow Vault&lt;/a&gt; in the far north of the region was chosen. The &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s assaulted the great fortification and succeeded in slaying the Vault's commander, &lt;a href=\"General%20Lightsbane\"&gt;General Lightsbane&lt;/a&gt;, though only after overcoming a ferocious defense. Once the stronghold was secure, the Knights of the Ebon Blade inhabited it fully, turning it into their headquarters in Icecrown. Although their position was under near-constant threat from the Scourge, the death knights began to conduct operations aimed at crippling the Lich King's forces in nearby areas. One of the main targets of the death knights was the nearby village of &lt;a href=\"Jotunheim\"&gt;Jotunheim&lt;/a&gt;, home to Scourge-allied &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to this, a nearby Scourge &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; mine in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Weeping%20Quarry\"&gt;Weeping Quarry&lt;/a&gt; became a major objective for the Ebon Knights. In time, and with the aid of the champions who first helped them to secure the Shadow Vault, each of these targets was neutralized; Jotunheim was attacked and driven into chaos, its ruler &lt;a href=\"Overthane%20Balargarde\"&gt;Overthane Balargarde&lt;/a&gt; slain, and work in the Weeping Quarry was sufficiently disrupted through sabotage and force.\nAdditionally, after establishing themselves at the &lt;a href=\"Blackwatch\"&gt;Blackwatch&lt;/a&gt; in the west of Icecrown, the Knights of the Ebon Blade worked to put out-of-action the &lt;a href=\"Fleshwerks\"&gt;Fleshwerks&lt;/a&gt;, the location of the Scourge's primary &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"flesh%20giant\"&gt;flesh giant&lt;/a&gt; factories. They succeeded in this endeavor, having done irreparable damage to the Fleshwerk's facilities, as well as slaying its mastermind, &lt;a href=\"Doctor%20Sabnok\"&gt;Doctor Sabnok&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the sole way for any kind of force to invade &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; would be to breach , and , each made almost entirely of saronite, near indestructible, and manned by massive Scourge constructs, the efforts of the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; working with the Alliance and the Horde was what allowed them to pass these defenses. From the &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\" and the \"&lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\", they directed heroes of both factions against the Scourge. Specifically, they targeted the activities of the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; at Aldur'thar: The Desolation Gate. They succeeded in bringing a halt to the cultists' plans in the area by killing many of them and vanquishing their leader, &lt;a href=\"Alumeth%20the%20Ascended\"&gt;Alumeth&lt;/a&gt;, before he and his followers could complete a vile and powerful ritual.\nIn addition to battling the Scourge, the Knights of the Ebon Blade also actively dealt with other threats, namely the presence of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt; to the west. Despite the Onslaught's goal of the destruction of the Lich King as well, they were identified as too great a threat, due to their ruthlessness and zeal. Almost all other factions, including the Argent Crusade, were known to greatly disapprove of their ways. On the orders of &lt;a href=\"Lord-Commander%20Arete\"&gt;Lord-Commander Arete&lt;/a&gt;, agents of the Ebon Blade attacked the harbor, causing great damage and assassinating much of its leadership. Ultimately, they confronted the Onslaught's leader\u2014&lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Grand Admiral Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;\u2014only to discover that it was, in fact, the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt; in disguise. Despite this disturbing turn of events, Mal'Ganis was nonetheless vanquished by his adversaries and the forces stationed at Onslaught Harbor were effectively knocked out of the fight.\nDuring the most intense phase of the battle in Icecrown, the Argent Crusade received information about the existence of the heart of Arthas Menethil. The heart, torn out of his own body by the Lich King upon awakening, could supposedly be used as a weapon against him, acting as the last remaining piece of the Lich King's long-lost humanity. With it, Tirion Fordring decided there could be a chance to make Arthas human again, redeeming him and ending the threat of the Lich King simultaneously. He planned to seize the frozen organ in an ambush as it was being transported from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Darkness\"&gt;Cathedral of Darkness&lt;/a&gt; a little to the northwest for destruction. As Tirion and his selected champions entered the Cathedral, disguised as cultists, the heart arrived.\nBefore the trap could be sprung, however, the Lich King himself appeared, immediately seeing through the paladins' trick and claiming that, unlike &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;last time&lt;/a&gt;, they would not be fighting on holy ground and Tirion would lose. After Tirion then threatened to destroy the heart, the Lich King called his bluff, citing that the paladin would never forsake the slight hope for Arthas's redemption that the heart represented. Tirion, however, claimed that he had since seen that there could be no redemption for Arthas, as there was no Arthas left to redeem. He then proceeded to strike the organ with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, critically injuring the Lich King and triggering an explosion that knocked Tirion unconscious. As the Argent champions moved to defend Tirion from the surrounding cultists, Darion Mograine and a force of Ebon Knights arrived, holding back the tide of Scourge forces. As the Lich King began to channel a spell to slay all present, Darion created a portal back to &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Crusaders' Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, allowing those gathered to escape.\nDespite having failed to redeem or slay the Lich King, Tirion still felt the foray was a success, stating that now he knew for certain that there remained no trace of Arthas Menethil any longer\u2014only the Lich King.\nSecrets of Ulduar.\nIn the midst of the battle against the Lich King in Icecrown and elsewhere, a threat emerged possibly greater than even the Scourge. The legendary explorer, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; had led an expedition deep into the ancient &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; complex of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, in the far north of the frigid &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. There they discovered an evil the likes of which &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; had not experienced for millennia. His followers nearly wiped out by Ulduar's titanic inhabitants, Brann fled back to the city of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to warn the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and all others of what he had discovered: the &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; was free from its prison.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DxEylX2LJ8c4\"&gt;In response, King Varian Wrynn and Lady Jaina Proudmoore of the Alliance, as well as Warchief Thrall and commander Garrosh Hellscream of the Horde, were immediately summoned to a meeting in the Violet Citadel by the Kirin Tor's leader, Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;. Arriving first, Varian and Jaina were briefed by Brann and Rhonin on the situation. Arriving not long afterwards, and unbeknownst to the Alliance, Thrall and Garrosh entered the room, to the surprise and rage of King Varian. Although both Jaina and Thrall attempted to defuse the situation, Varian and Garrosh inevitably came to blows after taunting each other. The fight was eventually broken up by Rhonin, who claimed that they must all be united in the face of the threat of &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;.\nVarian, citing the perceived treachery at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that previous truces with the Horde had led to the deaths of more Alliance soldiers than the casualties accrued from fighting against the Scourge. He subsequently refused to collaborate in any way, and left the meeting, to the despair of Jaina and Rhonin. The event further signified the toll the war against the Lich King had so far taken on relations between the two powerful factions.\nThe Argent Tournament.\nThe time taken to deal with the threat of Ulduar led to a lull in major conflict against the Lich King, though fighting in Icecrown continued. The Argent Crusade, recognizing that the time was fast approaching when they would be forced to finally deal with the Lich King, began to make preparations for the inevitable assault on the Scourge's greatest fortress: &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. To this end, the Crusade announced the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;, an event that would, among other things, attempt to create some semblance of order between the ever disparate Horde and Alliance.\nIn addition to uniting those who fought the Scourge, the tournament would also train this large army in preparation for an assault on the Lich King's bastion. More importantly, it would also serve to determine the very best fighters present, who would then be used to create a small strike force that would lead the charge into the Citadel. The reasoning behind using a small force to spearhead their assault lay in the fact that any great loss of life that they might suffer would only serve to reinforce the Scourge, and subsequently might leave the rest of the world open to attack.\nThough criticized by members of both factions, the tournament went ahead, &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;the ground chosen&lt;/a&gt; in the far northeast of Icecrown. The tournament achieved a good start, with both factions in full attendance (the Alliance championed by the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde by the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the Knights of the Ebon Blade. Both King Varian Wrynn and Warchief Thrall also made appearances and agreed to observe some of the tournament's trials in the &lt;a href=\"Crusaders%27%20Coliseum\"&gt;Crusaders' Coliseum&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Peacekeeper\"&gt;Argent Peacekeeper&lt;/a&gt;s maintained a constant vigil throughout the grounds, policing the tournament to ensure there was no conflict between the Horde and Alliance.\nSoon, however, the tournament drew the attention of the Lich King, who sent forces to disrupt it in a number of ways. Near the grounds itself, the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; established a forward base and began capturing aspirants taking part in the tournament. As part of the tournament's program of training its aspirants, potential champions were sent to rescue as many of the captured as possible, before they could be used in the Cult's dark rituals. Similarly, aspirants were also dispatched to the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt; in front of the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; in order to begin preliminary attacks on the Citadel's defenses. This involved launching forays against the &lt;a href=\"Boneguard\"&gt;Boneguard&lt;/a&gt;, an army of undead guarding the approaches to their master's fortress.\nIn addition to the Cult of the Damned, the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; also periodically launched attacks on the tournament grounds, partly in an attempt to free &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr%20Twins\"&gt;some of their kind&lt;/a&gt; which the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s had captured, though they were unable to inflict any lasting damage. Another major part of the Lich King's plans to disrupt the tournament was to infiltrate and destroy it from the inside. To accomplish this, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Knight\"&gt;Black Knight&lt;/a&gt; was dispatched to act as a contender in the tournament's events, secretly attempting to sabotage the war effort. Though the Black Knight's true nature was eventually discovered and the spy subsequently slain, he returned again in undeath and attacked during one of the tournament's major trials. The champion contestants, after a heated fight, succeeded in finally slaying the Black Knight once and for all, though the Scourge's plans to undermine the Argent Tournament had not been foiled yet.\nTowards the end, the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt; was held, the culmination of the entire Argent Tournament where the most promising champions singled out by the tournament's other events would be pitted against some of the fiercest adversaries the Argent Crusade could acquire. In attendance were leaders of both the Horde and Alliance, as well as &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; himself. Despite a brief interruption of violence between the Alliance and Horde, the trial continued as expected. Just as the event concluded, and Highlord Tirion announced the long-awaited attack on Icecrown Citadel, the Lich King himself appeared in the coliseum. Despite being outnumbered, he seemed unconcerned and reminded those gathered that the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; empire\u2014HIS empire\u2014extended far across and beneath the entire continent.\nThe Lich King then proceeded to shatter the very floor of the arena, dropping the Crusade's champions deep into a series of underground tunnels. There they were confronted by a resurrected &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; who attempted to slay them all. Despite the ambush, Anub'arak was vanquished by his adversaries after a lengthy battle. The act marked the conclusion of the Argent Tournament, and the beginning of the assault on Icecrown Citadel, where the Lich King would finally be forced to face the justice of his enemies.\nEndgame.\nThe Frozen Halls.\nAs armies began to prepare for the assault on &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; launched preliminary attacks on its defenses, two small forces of Alliance and Horde infiltrated the outer reaches of the Citadel, led by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; respectively. While each possessed a unique, personal interest in confronting the Lich King, the reason for the forays was in the rumor that in the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King's legendary &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; lay unguarded. Fighting their way through many of its defenses, the parties eventually reached the Lich King's inner sanctum, the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Reflection\"&gt;Halls of Reflection&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere, they discovered Frostmourne, at which point the force's leader attempted to commune with the spirits of Arthas's victims trapped within the blade. The spirit of &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas's former mentor, then appeared and spoke to them, delivering a dark warning. He revealed that the Lich King must be destroyed atop the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, where he was created, but that its death would not be enough. Uther, delivering the message quickly, claimed that there would always have to be a Lich King; under no circumstances could the position remained empty. Should such occur, the Scourge would be unrestrained and swarm relentlessly, unstoppable across the world. Uther claimed that the only thing preventing this happening already was the dwindling existence of Arthas's old self within the Lich King, fading as it was.\nWithout warning, the Lich King entered the room, silencing Uther's spirit and taunting those assembled. He then proceeded to summon more slain spirits to attack the members of the party while Sylvanas/Jaina pursued him deeper into the Halls of Reflection. Catching up after defeating the spirits, the group discovered the Lich King battling their leader and winning. Incapacitating the Lord of the Scourge briefly, the group immediately began to flee the Citadel, closely pursued by Arthas. Ultimately, they just succeeded in escaping via one of their faction's gunships which docked on a platform.\nThough they had survived, those who had braved the Lich King's sanctum now returned to their allies and informed them of the terrible information they had uncovered.\nAssault on the Citadel.\nIn the lead up to the final battle, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; forged a new alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, one which would lead the assault on the Icecrown Citadel's defenses, and shatter the Lich King's power once and for all. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Ashen%20Verdict\"&gt;Ashen Verdict&lt;/a&gt; was born; &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUY3oZH6Piz4\"&gt;united, they gathered in the mighty fortress's shadow to begin the assault&lt;/a&gt;.\nHaving swept aside opposition and seized the Citadel's entrance, the gates were battered down and the Ashen Verdict secured a foothold just inside the entrance, from which they would push deeper into the complex. The champions which had been picked and trained by the Argent Tournament now led the way into the Scourge's base. There they encountered the Lich King's most powerful servants and creations, each eventually falling before the relentless onslaught. As the invaders progressed further into the Citadel, it was revealed by the Lich King himself that &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Highlord Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt;, once thought slain at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, had survived and been recovered by the Scourge. Now in the Lich King's possessions, he was &lt;a href=\"Immolated%20Champion\"&gt;tortured mercilessly&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to break his will. Though Bolvar's capture came as a shock, Tirion Fordring and others concluded that rescuing Bolvar would go a long way to prevent upcoming conflict between the Horde and Alliance, and steeled themselves to make it so. \nFor the invaders, however, the conflict between the Alliance and Horde soon reared its ugly head. While ascending on their faction's gunships to a platform on the upper citadel, the two sides ultimately became embroiled in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;a ship-to-ship battle&lt;/a&gt;. Though neither side lost their ship (the Alliance's \"&lt;a href=\"Skybreaker\"&gt;Skybreaker&lt;/a&gt;\" and Horde's \"&lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\"), the engagement only served to distract the two factions from the fight in the Citadel. Regardless, the champions of the Argent Crusade pressed on, storming the upper reaches of Icecrown Citadel and fighting more of the Scourge's most powerful, including a reanimated &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%20Saurfang\"&gt;Dranosh Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde commander during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Battle of Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter a grueling battle, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; death knight was brought down and his father &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; tearfully recovered his body for a hero's burial. Another threat to be overcome revealed itself in the form of the chief of Scourge &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; research, &lt;a href=\"Professor%20Putricide\"&gt;Professor Putricide&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Plagueworks\"&gt;Plagueworks&lt;/a&gt;. The undead professor revealed to those gathered his recent success in developing a new plague capable of destroying all life on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Before anything further could occur, however, he was engaged in battle by the Citadel's invaders and eventually slain, though not before he attempted to use some of his experiments to his advantage.\nAlso encountered during this portion of the assault was the head of the Lich King's &lt;a href=\"San%27layn\"&gt;San'layn&lt;/a&gt;, a faction of fallen &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; who were slain and raised during and after &lt;a href=\"A%20Symphony%20of%20Frost%20and%20Flame\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage's failed attack on the Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. The faction was led by &lt;a href=\"Blood-Queen%20Lana%27thel\"&gt;Blood-Queen Lana'thel&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken the time to revive the three members of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Prince%20Council\"&gt;Blood Prince Council&lt;/a&gt; who had been slain when the Scourge's enemies invaded &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. In time, the San'layn too were defeated by the invaders, opening the way to the lair of one of the Lich King's first and most powerful: &lt;a href=\"Sindragosa\"&gt;Sindragosa&lt;/a&gt;, the Frost Queen.\nAssaulting Sindragosa and &lt;a href=\"Frostbrood\"&gt;her clutch&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Frostwing%20Halls\"&gt;Frostwing Halls&lt;/a&gt;, the champions fought a long and ferocious battle against the Queen of the Frostbrood herself. As with the Citadel's other challenges, Sindragosa was finally brought down under the onslaught, as she died expressing her gratitude at finally being free.\nWith all the fortress's defenses either defeated or engaged, and the way to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; open, it was decided that the time to strike at the head of the Scourge itself had finally come.\nThe Fall of the Lich King.\nThe champions, led by Tirion Fordring, now ascended the Citadel further to reach the very top, where the Frozen Throne and Lich King awaited. Upon reaching the location, Tirion ordered the attack on Arthas following a declaration that he would pay for the many thousands he had slain. Before Tirion could enter the battle, however, the Lich King cast a powerful spell on him, freezing and incapacitating him in a block of ice.\nThough outnumbered, the Lord of the Scourge used every resource at his disposal, summoning &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; and numerous undead to assail his adversaries as he himself lashed out with Frostmourne to great effect. He even went so far as to attempt to harvest the champions' souls, trapping them in his blade, where they encountered the spirit of Arthas's father &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;, who helped them to escape and weaken the blade from within. As the fight continued to become steadily more desperate, the Lich King began to destroy large portions of the platform in an attempt to throw his enemies from the zenith of the Citadel, though it did not succeed in defeating them.\nBecoming desperate and losing patience, the Lich King then called upon all of the fury contained within Frostmourne for a powerful spell which effectively finished off all of the Crusade's champions. Standing above the corpses of his foes, the Lich King, exultant, began to cast a spell to raise from the dead those he had slain. As he did so, he revealed that he had both foreseen and intended for all to happen as it did, that each challenge the champions had encountered since arriving on Northrend had been specifically placed by him in order to test them, and that now Tirion had delivered those who he now knew to be the most powerful in the world into his very hands. He would now raise these champions as lords of the Scourge, and they would usher in a new age of Scourge dominion on Azeroth.\nWith a prayer to the light asking for the power to escape from his bonds, Tirion, without warning, shattered his icy prison and leapt at the Lich King as he was in the midst of his spell. Glowing with light, and with one swing of the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, Tirion shattered Frostmourne, still in the hands of a stunned Lich King. Immediately, the souls of the many thousands slain by the blade escaped, swirling around Arthas, raising him into the air, and incapacitating him. Terenas's spirit, also released, used his remaining power to quickly resurrect Tirion's slain champions. Together with the Highlord and Arthas's father, they struck at the now-vulnerable Lich King, mortally wounding him. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqAIrj_Vqdfc\"&gt;The newly-freed spirit of Terenas Menethil comforted his son as he died, then reminded Tirion that someone must take Arthas's place as the Lich King in order to maintain control over the Scourge, before disappearing&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith Arthas's body at his feet, Tirion picked up the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, intending to take on the burden himself. At that moment, however, a voice spoke from the direction of the throne. It was that of Bolvar Fordragon, who had been horribly burned (if consequently saved) by the dragonfire during the massacre at the &lt;a href=\"Wrathgate\"&gt;Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;; the dragonfire had been all that had saved him from &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt;'s plague. He told Tirion that he no longer had any place among the living, that the paladin and his champions still had parts to play in the world. He insisted that he should be the one to make this ultimate sacrifice. Reluctantly, Tirion agreed and proceeded to place the helmet on Bolvar's head before stepping back. As the ice of the throne began to envelop him, Bolvar, his voice now changing to become that of the Lich King's, told Tirion to inform the world only that the Lich King had perished, and that Bolvar Fordragon had done so with him.\nAftermath.\nAfter the battle.\nArthas's death and Bolvar's ascension to the position of Lich King marked the conclusion of the war against the Lich King. Scourge forces on Northrend became pacified and the threat they once posed all but vanished. True to his word, Tirion kept hidden the truth of what had occurred atop Icecrown Citadel to all, save for Darion Mograine.\nThroughout the assault on the Citadel, Darion Mograine was involved in the creation of a new and powerful weapon known as &lt;a href=\"Shadowmourne\"&gt;Shadowmourne&lt;/a&gt;. Together with one of their champions, Darion directed the collection of various powerful reagents throughout the Citadel, culminating in his ordering the champion to use it to slay the Lich King, which they did. Following this success, Darion entrusted the weapon to his champion.\nWhen the Arthas was slain, a mysterious &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Chest\"&gt;sealed chest&lt;/a&gt; was discovered in his possession. One of the champions who vanquished the Lich King subsequently brought the chest to Darion Mograine afterwards in the hope that he might be able to open it. This he did, which revealed the contents to be an assortment of personal effects from Arthas's days before his becoming the Lich King. Items belonging to &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darion\"&gt;Darion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; proved that, despite his transformation into the Jailer of the Damned, a small piece of the old Arthas remained intact even to the end. Each of these items was eventually returned to the appropriate person, evoking different, but profound emotions in each recipient.\nPost-war period.\nWith the end of the war, and the defeat of the Lich King, the majority of Scourge forces on Azeroth were largely destroyed, either in the war or in its aftermath; those that remain were mostly made passive by Bolvar's will as he remained dormant in Icecrown. Such an outcome began to bring hope to areas ravaged by the Scourge, such as the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, which may now be set on a path to recovery. The members of the Ashen Verdict now pursued their own specific agendas, with the Argent Crusade relocating back to the Eastern Kingdoms' Plaguelands to begin healing any lingering traces of Scourge influence on the land. Meanwhile, members of the Knights of the Ebon Blade now began to take part in many of the world's conflict independently or as part of either the Alliance or Horde, though they still remained loyal to their neutral order that remained active.\nThe last remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; leadership, which had essentially been destroyed when the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href=\"Death%20knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, and were further devastated in the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend began to dissipate. The Crusade would go on to lose their holdings in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to the forces of &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, while Tirion Fordring and the Argent Crusade retook the stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of the Crusade itself then fled into the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; and took refuge at the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Palisade\"&gt;Scarlet Palisade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the major crisis over, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear trolls&lt;/a&gt; began work towards &lt;a href=\"Zalazane%27s%20Fall\"&gt;liberating the Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nSimilarly, High Tinker &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance, after calculating that only \"had a 12.7% chance of actually happening\", called for the launch of , the final assault to reclaim the gnomes' lost city of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe war between the Horde and the Alliance, which was declared during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, despite fighting in Northrend, did not explode into a full-scale war after the fall of the Lich King. Though with the occurrence of a while afterwards, tensions once again began to flare, reminded of the bitter actions during the war against the Scourge.\nThe war took a heavy toll on all involved, with the Alliance alone losing 20,000-50,000 lives. As a result of the war, many Alliance citizens were left homeless and unemployed, and would eventually move to the region of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; where they would take part in the recreation of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. This threat proved nearly disastrous for the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, which found itself unable to effectively prevent the Brotherhood's rebirth.\nFollowing the end of the Scourgewar, an unnamed Argent Crusader wrote a of all military operations made in pursuit of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nParticipants.\nHere are the various factions that fought in the conflict, including their sub-factions:\nFactions.\n &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

When the mists surrounding &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; vanished the Zandalari quickly sent aid to their ancient allies and former rulers of the continent, the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt;. The ultimate goal on Pandaria seems to be establishing themselves a new homeland.\nPrelude.\nThe days when great &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empires stretched across ancient &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; are long past. Millennia of war and internal strife have stripped these nations of their power, lands, and glory. As &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; recovers from the destruction of the Cataclysm, the world's divided troll populations face a bleak future. These dark times have spurred the trolls of the Zandalari, the historically wise and scholarly tribe from which all trolls originated, to take drastic action. They have embarked on a bold crusade to save their race by uniting trolls into a single mighty empire. With the Zandalari's aid, the fallen capitals of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; nations\u2014&lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;\u2014are already rebuilding, replenishing their forces for a bloody campaign to expand their territories.\nYet &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and his Darkspear trolls are not aligned with the Zandalari. They have sworn to stand with their Horde comrades\u2014and even work with the Alliance\u2014should the trolls ignite a new war on Azeroth. Soon, Vol'jin might be forced to act on his promise, for if the Gurubashi and Amani are left to their own devices, the world will know the legendary strength and savagery of the ancient troll empires once again. This event, however, is stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and the combined efforts of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Tribe\"&gt;Darkspear Tribe&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, but the Zandalari continued their efforts &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nSway over the Gurubashi.\nEmpowered by the Zandalari's offer the Gurubashi launched on all-out attack to claim &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; for themselves. In &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bambala\"&gt;Bambala&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Livingston\"&gt;Fort Livingston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nesingwary%27s%20Expedition\"&gt;Nesingwary's Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grom%27gol%20Base%20Camp\"&gt;Grom'gol Base Camp&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Camp\"&gt;Rebel Camp&lt;/a&gt; came under attack by &lt;a href=\"serpent\"&gt;serpent&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Kilnara\"&gt;High Priestess Kilnara&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;s to attack the Rebel Camp and Grom'gol while the panther &lt;a href=\"Mauti\"&gt;Mauti&lt;/a&gt; attacked the hunters at Nesingwary's Expedition. Both Grom'gol and the Rebel Camp later came under attack by Gurubashi trolls led by &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt;. After heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; beat back the Gurubashi attack, they were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Cape%20of%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Cape of Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt; which faced its own troubles.\n&lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil the Outcast&lt;/a&gt; aids the Gurubashi by turning the inhabitants of both &lt;a href=\"Hardwrench%20Hideaway\"&gt;Hardwrench Hideaway&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League%20Digsite\"&gt;Explorers' League Digsite&lt;/a&gt; into voodoo zombies by poisoning the food in each town. After saving their respective towns adventurers are sent to speak to Vol'jin who is warning &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Revilgaz\"&gt;Baron Revilgaz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; about the Gurubashi.\nDarkspear agents inside &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; have discovered that &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; is wrestling &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar the Soulflayer&lt;/a&gt; into submission, holding him by spirit chains and stripping out his power into himself. They enlist adventurers to put an end to Jin'do's mad plans once and for all. Upon destroying the spiritual chains holding the Soulflayer in place, Hakkar turns upon Jin'do, and utterly destroys him, leaving only the corpse of \"Jin'do the Broken\". Hakkar then returns the adventurers to the mortal realm, promising to deal with them another time, before vanishing. Though Hakkar is free, the Zandalari have been dealt a major defeat at Zul'Gurub.\nSway over the Amani.\nWith the aid of the Zandalari, a new troll empire was brewing, spearheaded by &lt;a href=\"Daakara\"&gt;Warlord Daakara&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Vol'jin has declined this offer, and instead joined forces with the Ranger-General of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halduron%20Brightwing\"&gt;Halduron Brightwing&lt;/a&gt;, and his &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; to counter the threat this new empire poses. In turn, Halduron has called upon &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her rangers to join the battle, and the three can be seen planning their next move on the outskirts of Zul'Aman.\nAfter deciding an appropriate battle plan Vol'jin personally leads a strike force into Zul'Aman and with the aid of adventurers puts an end to Daakara and the Zandalari's efforts within Zul'Aman.\nOther conflicts.\nIn Hinterlands the local Forest trolls of the Vilebranch and the Witherbark tribes had sided with the Amani and tried to expand their territories. However they were eventually defeated and lost much of their grounds both to the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Clan\"&gt;Wildhammer Clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; trolls who remained loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nRe-establishing the ties with mogu.\nLong before the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari had been allies of the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, the iron-fisted rulers of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and fought against the &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; when they overthrew their mogu overlords. Yet, the Zandalari lost access to the area when the mists appeared and sealed off the entirety of Pandaria from outsiders.\nNow, as the power of the mists has been weakened by Deathwing's upheaval, the Zandalari forces have returned to Pandaria, seemingly with the intention of coming to their aid of their ancient allies. But it seems that the Zandalari have other motives for returning besides aiding the mogu...\nRise of the Thunder King.\nWith the loss of the isle of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, the Zandalari have decided to change the course of their campaign to the land once ruled by their former &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt; allies, &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. The expedition comprising of all troll tribes united under the Zandalari banner arrived upon the northern shores of the mist-shrouded continent and quickly dispatched their representatives to reforge the old alliance. Zandalar spiritbinders quickly started to re-animate dormant terracotta statues to create an unstoppable army, but the true intention of the Zandalari is to resurrect the first emperor of the mogu, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, known also as the Thunder King to gain his help in conquering Pandaria for themselves and establish the new Mogu-Zandalari dominion on the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;. After his resurrection, he unites the Zandalari and most of the scattered mogu clans under his banner. Craving conquest, Lei Shen and his minions have launched a full-scale assault on Pandaria in a last attempt to restore mogu dominion.\nShadows of the Horde.\nWith Lei Shen once again among the living, a force of Zandalari led by &lt;a href=\"Khal%27ak\"&gt;Khal'ak&lt;/a&gt; moved to revive his warlords that rested within the &lt;a href=\"Tu%20Shen%20Burial%20Ground\"&gt;Tu Shen Burial Ground&lt;/a&gt;. They once again assaulted &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt; to secure a landing site for ships coming from the Isle of Thunder, but along the way found themselves fighting the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, a human named &lt;a href=\"Tyrathan%20Khort\"&gt;Tyrathan Khort&lt;/a&gt;, and most surprisingly of all, a fellow troll: &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;.\nKhal'ak attempted to sway Vol'jin to their side, and the Zandalari successfully revived &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Kao\"&gt;Warlord Kao&lt;/a&gt;. Kao and the Zandalari returned to the Isle of Thunder with Vol'jin, Tyrathan, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Cuo\"&gt;Brother Cuo&lt;/a&gt; as prisoners. But their prisoners escaped, in the process destroying a large section of the island's harbor.\nKhal'ak's forces returned to Kun-Lai Summit to attack their escaped prisoners. They found themselves facing &lt;a href=\"The%20Thirty-three\"&gt;The Thirty-three&lt;/a&gt;, and despite vastly outnumbering them the Zandalari fled when Vol'jin thrust his hand through Khal'ak's throat, killing her.\n&lt;a href=\"Blood%20in%20the%20Snow\"&gt;Blood in the Snow&lt;/a&gt;.\nSometime after the events at the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; have turned their focus on rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; against &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; but their plans were thwarted by &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. Scouts of the had noticed a massive army of the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; tribe seeking to lay siege to Ironforge. The trolls had tried to delay the Dark Iron's army by creating a frost storm preventing Moira's army from reaching the village but the King's champions managed to kill the troll sorcerer and thus ended the storm. When the storm ended, the Dark Iron's army charged into the village and slaughtered all the remaining trolls inside ending the Frostmane threat for good.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

While the botani, podlings and genesaur attempt to grow, spread and flourish like the plants they consist of, the gronn, goren and magnaron seek to expand into the jungle and kill its inhabitants for both food and for the fun of battle. &lt;a href=\"Durotan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; claims that this conflict has been waged since time immemorial and must continue, for if one side were to lose, all of Draenor would fall to the victor. \nThe battleground near the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Spine\"&gt;Broken Spine&lt;/a&gt; defines the line that separates the arid desert and the lush jungle. The Breakers' brute force and earth-based magic does little to stop many of the Primals' forces from simply regrowing in a few hours. This rapid regeneration, plus the Breakers' own resilience and persistence, ensures the battle continues on. The &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt; also charm or raise various wild animals and plant creatures to serve them in the battle against the Breakers, including &lt;a href=\"wasp\"&gt;wasp&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"ravager\"&gt;ravager&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"lasher\"&gt;lasher&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mandragora\"&gt;mandragora&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Despite the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s\u2019 attempts to keep this new race from claiming further territories, the night elves built up a mighty empire that expanded rapidly across &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.
