They are stone pools filled with silvery glowing water. Moonwells are bound to the magic of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and are known as places of healing for both the land around them and those who drink of their waters, possessing extraordinary restorative properties. Magi and other spellcasters can refresh their mana in these pools \u2014 a gift from Elune to Azeroth's other defenders.\nLittle is known about the first moon well or how the moon wells proliferated through Azeroth, despite the taboo on overt magical practice among the night elves.\nHistory and usage.\nMoon wells are hallowed repositories of the sacred waters of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;, the pool of energy that gives life to the mystical &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;. When additional water is added, these wells nourish the night elf troops with their life-sustaining waters. Additional moon wells become necessary as the night elf forces grow in number. The first step to establishing a moonwell is to gain the blessings of the local wildlife. It is their goodwill that enables night elves to peacefully coexist, and a moonwell thrives on such energies. After receiving the blessings they are combined into a ritual bundle and imbue the moonwell, followed by water added from a preexisting purified moonwell. Combined with &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;light&lt;/a&gt;, a moonwell can purify its surroundings for years.\nIt is said that &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; contributed to the creation of the moonwells, likely referring to his creation of the second Well of Eternity.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Tenaron%20Stormgrip\"&gt;Tenaron Stormgrip&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Aldrassil\"&gt;Aldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the water of the moonwell is brought from the Well of Eternity, and &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; revere them as shrines to Elune. The night elven &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s also take advantage of its properties. They can be commonly found in most &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Elune%20%28buildings%29\"&gt;Temples of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;, such as in Val'sharah and Darnassus, as well as throughout night elf settlements. In kaldorei society, they are widely revered by the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;, and the returned &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; alike. &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; even commented on how a single moonwell reminded him of the same beauty and purity as the original &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen a night elf dies, priestesses ritualistically cleanse the body in moonwells in preparation for burial. Moonwells are also used to bless food, offer protection against fire, and bless &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Arrow\"&gt;Warden's Arrow&lt;/a&gt;s. Some moonwells can apparently be used to create the \"&lt;a href=\"Liquid%20Fire%20of%20Elune\"&gt;liquid fire of Elune&lt;/a&gt;\", a substance that can be poured on animal corpses to cleanse them of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; taint. The waters of the moonwell that rests under the boughs of the &lt;a href=\"Oracle%20Tree\"&gt;Oracle Tree&lt;/a&gt; are said to possess the very essence of Elune's Powers. &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt; used waters from a moonwell, which have been blessed with the &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt; of Elune, to break the will of a &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"observer\"&gt;observer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Moonwell%20of%20Purity\"&gt;Moonwell of Purity&lt;/a&gt; is protected by Elune's power.\nWater from moonwells can be safely drunk, but the most efficacious use for them is to bathe in the sacred waters, optionally while clad in robes. This act eases feelings of pain, weariness, and grief according to &lt;a href=\"Astarii%20Starseeker\"&gt;Astarii Starseeker&lt;/a&gt;.\nCorrupted moonwells seem to have the ability to transform people into &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, night elf priestesses and druids built moonwells there to help restore the devastated land, but the extent of their effectiveness in healing the wound remains unclear.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the moonwell in &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Grove\"&gt;Twilight Grove&lt;/a&gt; was used by &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; to restore the &lt;a href=\"Torch%20of%20Holy%20Flame\"&gt;Torch of Holy Flame&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"unholy\"&gt;unholy&lt;/a&gt; corruption.\nIn-game uses of a Moonwell.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", moonwells are typically only cosmetic or quest and material-creation (like &lt;a href=\"mooncloth\"&gt;mooncloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"primal%20mooncloth\"&gt;primal mooncloth&lt;/a&gt;) related, located mostly in night elf areas. Some newer players used to sometimes be seen standing in a moonwell after combat, with the uninformed belief that it is healing them faster (As was similar in \"Warcraft III\").\nMoonwell locations.\nDraenor.\nNone of the moonwells in Draenor can be used in tailoring.\nBroken Isles.\nNone of the moonwells on the Broken Isles can be used in tailoring.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Well\"&gt;Moon Well&lt;/a&gt; was the night elven farm structure that also had the ability to heal friendly units, and it had mana that only recovered at night. \nIn the RPG.\nMoon wells were/are created by the night elves to harness the energy of the moon.\nMoon Wells.\nMoonglade.\nEnchanted pools throughout the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt; give the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; their spiritual power and feed the &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; that stands in &lt;a href=\"Hyjal%20Summit\"&gt;Hyjal Summit&lt;/a&gt;. The shimmering waters within give off a blue light, causing the moon wells to glow slightly in the night. They are scattered throughout the forest, often near giant standing stones covered in ancient runes.\nTheramore.\nThe &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;, having left mostly before the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, have formed a significant community in the city. They spend a great deal of time hunting the few &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Their exposure to the night elves has caused them to develop a great interest in moon wells, which they seek to find an alternative solution to their addiction. Even the presence of a hidden moon well 50 feet away is enough to replenish their mystical energies and makes meditation unnecessary.\nTheramore's high elves also have another interest in the continent. They have discussed privately the creation of their own realm on Kalimdor. The northern forests, full of moon wells and lush greenery are most attractive, but their control by the night elves is overly frustrating. High elven expeditions, claiming to be tracking undead, often search for suitable sites.\nSpeculation.\nThe night elf rogue &lt;a href=\"Rell%20Nightwind\"&gt;Rell Nightwind&lt;/a&gt; used a blue liquid to display a recorded message from &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Taylor\"&gt;Admiral Taylor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. It's possible that it was moonwell water, indicating it can be used to exchange messages across vast distances in times of great need."}

Moorabi, a &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;, is the former high prophet of &lt;a href=\"Mam%27toth\"&gt;Mam'toth&lt;/a&gt;, the Drakkari mammoth god. The Drakkari sacrificed Mam'toth along with their other animal gods to obtain their considerable power in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, who are swiftly encroaching upon Drakkari lands. The death of the god transferred the immense power of Mam'toth to the high prophet.\nFor a time, he, &lt;a href=\"Gal%27darah\"&gt;Gal'darah&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Slad%27ran\"&gt;Slad'ran&lt;/a&gt; held &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, but they were later felled by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The Drakkari sought to sacrifice Mam'toth for his powers, but instead the loa destroyed himself. Despite this act, Moorabi would not be denied his god-like powers. The high prophet drank of the loa's blood and will now stop at nothing to keep Zul'Drak firmly in troll hands.\"\nStrategies.\nThis boss is pretty straight-forward.\nWhen you pull the boss, he will activate a buff on himself, increasing his attackspeed by 25%. Beware of damage spikes on your tank.\nHe casts an AoE attack, Earth Shake, that increases in damage every time it's cast and stuns for 3 seconds.\nThe boss will try to transform into a Mammoth, but this can be interrupted.\nHe will transform at some point in the fight, and beware of more damage on the tank and even more Earth Shakes.\nHeroic Strategy.\nWith Heroic strategy the fight is typically the same. You will notice that in his normal form he will take moderate damage and dish out about the same. At 50% health he will transform into the mammoth (the cast timer quickens to the point were it cannot be interrupted). In Mammoth form he will dish out considerably more damage. However, his damage taken will be increased. It is suggested that you hold all cool-downs until this form. If your group is well geared and healer is fairly good, you might want to let him change forms right off the start and just smash him down fast.\nAchievement.\nIf your group interrupts all his transformation, so that he cannot turn into mammoth form for the whole fight, you will be awarded an achievement . This is also part of the meta achievement .\nThe easiest way to do this achievement is to have a mage in the group. Have the other members interrupt his cast until the boss is at 35% or less health then have the mage &lt;a href=\"counterspell\"&gt;counterspell&lt;/a&gt; him. You will have 8 seconds to burst him down before his next (almost instant cast).\nIn Hearthstone.\nMoorabi appears as for the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; class in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\"."}

Mor'Ladim's patrol includes a brief pause by his gravestone, hinting at the origin of his undead rebirth.\nBackground.\nMor'Ladim was formerly &lt;a href=\"Morgan%20Ladimore\"&gt;Morgan Ladimore&lt;/a&gt;, a great and noble knight. His objective in life was to fight for the innocent, poor and the afflicted. He was married to a young girl named Lys when he was eighteen.\nWhen Morgan was thirty-two, war broke out in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. He went to war fighting alongside &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt;, leaving his wife and three children at home. At the time of the war Morgan saw many horrific things, the disbanding of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the death of Uther and the spread of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; caused by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; and the demon lord &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the end of the war Morgan returned home, only to find that the lands he once loved had changed. His house was among many destroyed, and so he went to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Hamlet\"&gt;Grand Hamlet&lt;/a&gt;, now known as &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;, asking about his family. When he was told that he may find the absent family he sought in the graveyard, he refused. Instead he headed towards &lt;a href=\"Lakeshire\"&gt;Lakeshire&lt;/a&gt;. Despite his denial, something inside him compelled him go to Raven Hill Cemetery instead. There he looked for hours, finding the graves of many friends and companions, before he discovered the overgrown graves of his wife and two of his children; the third was absent, though he did not notice this in his grief. \nMourning became loathing as Ladimore, stripped of his sanity by grief, drew his blade and swung it at the gravestones. A group of cemetery attendants moved to intervene, and in his anger, Morgan viciously cut them down. When he returned to a more normal state, the knight found himself soaked in the blood of the innocent and, utterly despondent, he drew his knife from his waist and stabbed himself. \nThe next day, his corpse and those of the attendants were discovered. Perhaps seeking to avoid further darkness in the already-shattered community, the cemetery quickly and quietly buried Morgan in an obscure corner of the cemetery. \nSome days later, his grave was disturbed and his body missing. As a result of his unending grief and the deaths of Innocents upon his hands, Ladimore ascended from the grave as a semi-sentient member of the undead, roaming the tracts of land he had once fought to defend and shedding the blood of citizens and many a poor and inexperienced adventurer dispatched to stop him. \nAs a result of his further crimes against the denizens of Duskwood, Commander &lt;a href=\"Althea%20Ebonlocke\"&gt;Althea Ebonlocke&lt;/a&gt; wants Mor'Ladim to be returned once again to his grave."}

In &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, he appeared as Overlord Mor'ghor, leading the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt;-loyal Dragonmaw operations at &lt;a href=\"Netherwing%20Ledge\"&gt;Netherwing Ledge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, as well as having ties to &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, following the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, he traveled back to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to seize control of the Azerothian Dragonmaws, becoming known as Warchief Mor'ghor. Eventually, however, he was killed by &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Warlord Zaela&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;, and Zaela became the new leader of the Dragonmaw clan.\nBiography.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nOverlord Mor'ghor is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; on Netherwing Ledge in Shadowmoon Valley and oversees all operations that take place there. Mor'ghor serves under &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; and aids the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; in collecting valuable resources from the Netherwing Ledge, much to the dismay of the &lt;a href=\"Netherwing\"&gt;Netherwing&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, Mor'ghor still secretly serves the Black Dragonflight as is apparent from both his conversation with Lady Sinestra and the player's &lt;a href=\"Seeker%20of%20Truth%23Conversation%20with%20the%20Murkblood%20Overseer\"&gt;conversation with the Murkblood Overseer&lt;/a&gt; in the Netherwing Mines; although the Dragonmaw under Mor'ghor have been using much of the resources that they take from the Ledge to supply Illidan's armies, they have also been taking much of it for themselves and either selling it or giving it to the Black Dragonflight in return for mounts and the favor of the Dragonflight's master.\nHe offers two daily quests for the clan where the adventurer is tasked with raiding locations in Outland. However, the Aldor or Scryers will discreetly subvert one of them to trick Mor'ghor.\nCataclysm.\nMor'ghor, having fled from Outland, now resides in &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Port\"&gt;Dragonmaw Port&lt;/a&gt;, where he has become the new Warchief of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. He is unwilling to aid the Horde in the Twilight Highlands, which - in combination with his bloodthirsty nature - leads to a rebellion led by battlemaiden &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Zaela\"&gt;Zaela&lt;/a&gt; which ultimately results in his death.\nQuotes.\n&lt;Overlord Mor'ghor salutes.&gt;\nSpeculation.\nIt is presumed that he is &lt;a href=\"Zuluhed%20the%20Whacked\"&gt;Zuluhed the Whacked&lt;/a&gt;\u2019s second in command and is therefore the current Chieftain of the Dragonmaw when the player encounters him.\nFrom his meeting with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sinestra\"&gt;Lady Sinestra&lt;/a&gt;, we can assume that he was an orc of high standing during the Dragonmaw's stay at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and also an agent of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; during this time. It is possible that he supplied &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; with information on &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;'s whereabouts which eventually led to the events that took place in &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dragon\"&gt;Day of the Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. However, if this is the case, it means that Mor'ghor was either not present at the &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;The Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, having already traveled to Outland with his chieftain or he has only recently arrived there, which would mean that he survived the Dragon Queen's wrath and possibly served under &lt;a href=\"Chieftain%20Nek%27rosh\"&gt;Nek'rosh Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;. The latter theory is probably the more likely of the two, given Nek'rosh's connection with the Black Dragonflight. (See &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt;)"}

He was the first of the raiding company, &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Blade\"&gt;Veiled Blade&lt;/a&gt;, to die. The tauren druid fell down into the lower part of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; while fleeing from the Spectral Assassins. Later, it turned out that Mor survived the fall, but afterwards was tortured by the Tazz'Alaor trolls and their &lt;a href=\"War%20Master%20Voone\"&gt;War Master Voone&lt;/a&gt;. The job was completed by the Spectral Assassins, who killed him on the spot. He now haunts Voone's room.\nAlthough the questline was removed in \"Cataclysm\", players having &lt;a href=\"Brazier%20of%20Invocation\"&gt;Brazier of Invocation&lt;/a&gt; can still summon him.\nPrerequisites.\nNote: After completing the &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Bodley\"&gt;Return to Bodley&lt;/a&gt; you will receive the &lt;a href=\"Brazier%20of%20Invocation\"&gt;Brazier of Invocation&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to repeatedly summon any of the ghosts in the Dungeon Set 2 questline.\nAttacks and abilities.\nMor Grayhoof has several offensive abilities:\nMor's DEFENSIVE abilities are really what makes or breaks the fight. If you don't have the means to stop him from healing, you lose.\nStrategy.\nThe fight is straightforward. After killing Voone in LBRS, drop the brazier to summon. He shapeshifts into various forms (bear, sprite, etc). When he uses his hurricane spell, back up out of the AoE. He also periodically heals, which should be interrupted - if you have no way to interrupt these heals, you may not be able to kill him due to his large amount of mana.\nGroup Composition.\nHere's an example of a 5-man group that works well against Mor.\nAlternate Method: Druid (and optional rogue) Stealth Run.\nMany druids in our guild needed the Idol of Rejuvenation, which drops off Mor with a 25% drop rate. We decided to go, four druids and a rogue, to summon Mor and do continuous stealth kills on him.\nNotes.\nLater on we converted it to a raid, and had two rogues and 5 druids, so the fight went even faster after that; but let it be noted that this can be done (albeit very slowly) with only druids, and considerably faster if you have one rogue for kick.\nThe stealth run in total takes about 18 minutes to stealth in, kill Voone, kill the three trash mobs, kill Mor, and stealth out. A nice bonus is that you get two to three large brilliant shards per run. In addition, Mor drops a few nice Feral/Rogue pieces which is a nice touch, so by the end quite a few people had new feral junk. In about 10 runs we got three Idols of Rejuvenation. Also we got three or so of the Gemstone of Smolderthorn from Voone, which is part of the UBRS key quest chain."}

Thus, it is not a prerequisite, simply a guide to point you at\na quest series you might otherwise miss.\nThe Morbent Fel quest chain.\nAct 1: Witness Testimony.\n&lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt; tells you how he came to be in the rough wildwood camp where you encounter him: His family had been slaughtered by raiders from &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; while he was away.\nIn addition to the sign of the dark riders from deadwind pass, he saw someone skulking around near his barn, burying something. He didn't then (and doesn't now) have time to investigate, but perhaps you can.\nYou accept, of course. Why not?\nSo you head over to the farm, and right where Sven described it is a pile of loose dirt.\nA very little bit of digging later, and you recover a book - a journal of some sort. Apparently Sven isn't the only person around here to have problems.\nThe book relates that the author found a scythe in a pile of rubble in &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;. The moment he pulled it free, &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; descended upon his party, and only the author escaped.\nYou decide to bring the book back to Sven.\nWhoever wrote the book had witnessed the murder of Sven's family. Sven is eager to question the author,\nand asks you to take the book around &lt;a href=\"Darkshire\"&gt;Darkshire&lt;/a&gt; and see if anyone knows who might have written it.\nOne of your stops is &lt;a href=\"Madame%20Eva\"&gt;Madame Eva&lt;/a&gt;. She isn't able to tell you much about it, other than that it was\nrecently handled by someone motivated by revenge - Sven, you are sure. Well, two other things: the author was not a Darkshire native, but the book was purchased in town.\nYou continue your search.\n&lt;a href=\"Clerk%20Daltry\"&gt;Clerk Daltry&lt;/a&gt;, in the courthouse, occasionally sells journals to people, but not so many that he doesn't remember everyone he's sold to recently. He is able to tell you that the person he sold this book to\na shady person who was extremely nervous.\nClerk Daltry suggests you talk to the innkeeper, thinking that since the person\nwas from out of town, perhaps he may have stayed there for a bit.\nYou cross the road to the inn, and talk to &lt;a href=\"Tavernkeep%20Smitts\"&gt;Tavernkeep Smitts&lt;/a&gt;. He remembers the fellow\nalright, but whoever it was only stayed a few days, then left, heading west out of town. He had\nclaimed he was being hunted by ... something.\nAs the tavernkeeper says, the first place he would encounter, headed west\nalong the road, is &lt;a href=\"Raven%20Hill\"&gt;Raven Hill&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt this point, you've interviewed everyone in Darkshire who might have known\nabout the book, or about the figure. You know that he was here, but left to the west.\nEveryone you have talked to has noted that he was a very nervous sort of person;\nif you meet him, it should be obvious. And you know he's \"not from around here\"...\nTime to go to Raven Hill and see if he's still hiding around out there. Or got there\nin the first place.\nArriving at Raven Hill, you find Jitters pacing around the well. You confront him,\nand he admits to being the author of the journal. But it is incomplete!\nYou tell Jitters why you are there, and who sent you. Jitters completes the journal (more likely, provides you with Volume Two of the tale...) and asks you to take them to Sven, so he doesn't have to face him directly.\nYou head off back to Sven (finally) and deliver the journal.\nReading it, Sven connects the dark riders to &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt;, the wizard of &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Rowe\"&gt;Forlorn Rowe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnd so ends Act 1.\nAct 2: Forging the Necromancer's Bane.\n&lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt; knows the caliber of foe you would face in &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt;, and would not send you against him futilely. He asks you to show your skill in battle, to prove that he would not just be sending you to your death. He tasks you with the dispatching of a score of Morbent Fel's skeletal minions.\nSaid minions are not far away, and prove merely challenging, not fatal.\nSven asks you to take the &lt;a href=\"Jitters%27%20Completed%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Bishop%20Farthing\"&gt;Bishop Farthing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The military powers in Stormwind have given up attempting to defend Darkshire (see &lt;a href=\"Messenger%20to%20Darkshire\"&gt;Messenger to Darkshire&lt;/a&gt;), but the bishop may still be able to help.\nYou travel back to Stormwind, and visit the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;cathedral&lt;/a&gt; there. The bishop knows of Morbent Fel, that he has protected himself from physical attacks by fel magics. To defeat him, you will need to defeat the magics.\nYou will need a holy weapon, forged from &lt;a href=\"Lightforge%20Ingot\"&gt;Lightforge Iron&lt;/a&gt;, the bishop tells you. Lightforge Iron is\nhard to come by. Bishop Farthing knows that some time ago, a ship carrying it as cargo sank\nalong the coasts of the wetlands. He does not know where to look for it, but he can direct\nyou to someone who may: &lt;a href=\"Glorin%20Steelbrow\"&gt;Glorin Steelbrow&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOff to the Wetlands, then. You meet Glorin Steelbrow in the Menethil harbor inn, where he tells you\nthat yes, he can direct you to where the lightforge iron can be found. He can even point you to\nsomeone who can forge the weapon you will need.\nGlorin directs you to the wreckage of the &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Osprey\"&gt;Flying Osprey&lt;/a&gt;, an Elvish destroyer with a cargo of\nlightforge iron, sunk during the last great war.\nSouth of &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, you locate the wreckage, and find the chest that had held the ingots.\nOne ingot remains, proof that it had been here. Signs indicate that the local Murlocs have raided\nthe wreck, and carried away the iron.\nThe Bluegill Raiders in the neighborhood have the ingots alright, but aren't interested in simply\ngiving them up. You persuade them with extreme prejudice, and eventually collect four more ingots\nfrom them, and return with them to Glorin.\nGlorin boxes up the ingots for you, and sends you off to &lt;a href=\"Grimand%20Elmore\"&gt;Grimand Elmore&lt;/a&gt;, a weaponsmith in the\n&lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20District\"&gt;Dwarven District&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;.\nGrimand feels honored to work with &lt;a href=\"Lightforge%20Ingot\"&gt;Lightforge Iron&lt;/a&gt; again.\nWhile you wait, Grimand forges the weapon you need, &lt;a href=\"Morbent%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Morbent's Bane&lt;/a&gt;. Suitably armed, you return\nto &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou are ready to slay &lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt; and avenge his family, Sven tells you. Morbent Fel is in the house just over there, to the east.\n&lt;a href=\"Morbent%20Fel\"&gt;Morbent Fel&lt;/a&gt; has several guards, but between the lightforge iron weapon, your trusted companions, and your own prowess, you defeat him. At last, Duskwood is free of this villain!\nRewards.\nWith reputation spillover, you net"}

He also appears as a &lt;a href=\"rare%20elite\"&gt;rare elite&lt;/a&gt; mob in the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The most powerful &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; still under &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s sway, Morchok - once a passive guardian - is now convinced that his only respite will come with &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s demise. Morchok rages against the foundation of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Azeroth's last beacon of hope in the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nDragonflight.\nYears after his defeat in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Worldbreakers\"&gt;Worldbreakers&lt;/a&gt; summoned him to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, in their own attempt to start the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. After being summoned in a pool of lava in the &lt;a href=\"Slagmire\"&gt;Slagmire&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Waking%20Shores\"&gt;Waking Shores&lt;/a&gt;, he can be confronted by Azeroth's champions.\nAbilities.\nDragon Soul.\nMorchok has a 7 minute hard enrage timer.\nDragon Soul strategy.\nTwo tanks are required for this fight. Morchok will constantly use 'Crush Armor' on his current target. To remove this, simply have the off-tank taunt when the tank gets the first application and then just continue to tank-swap when the debuff fades off.\nEverybody in the group needs to stay close to the boss in order to spread his 'Stomp' ability's damage evenly, but the two tanks must ALWAYS be the closest to him as the two closest targets will take double damage.\nWhen Morchok spawns a Resonating Crystal, three players need to run up to the orb and wait there until it explodes. The laser that links the player to the orb will turn blue when the player is close enough to the orb. Make sure that the orb is close enough to the boss so that the stomp damage is still spread to everyone.\nAfter two Resonating Crystals explode, Morchok will engage Phase 2. Morchok will draw everyone to him, stunning everyone and dealing minor AoE damage. He will also drop spikes everywhere around him. Once the stun wears off, everyone must run to one of these spikes and hide behind them, making sure they stay out of the black blood he spreads everywhere. If you stand in this blood for too long, you will die. Once he finishes channeling the blood, he will immediately stomp, so no one should run back in until he casts this or players will very likely die. When he finishes his stomp, everyone should hug the boss (the two tanks still being closest to him) and repeat Phase 1.\nMorchok's attack pattern is very straight forward:\nStomp -&gt; Summon Crystal -&gt; Stomp -&gt; Crystal Explodes, Summon New Crystal -&gt; Stomp -&gt; Crystal Explodes -&gt; Black Blood Phase -&gt; Stomp -&gt; Repeat\nAt 20% health, Morchok will enrage and deal a lot more damage. All major cooldowns should be saved for this phase as the damage he deals becomes quite high.\nHeroic.\nShortly after the first stomp Morchok splits into two bosses (the new one is named Kohcrom, how imaginative). Since both bosses do Stomp and Resonating Crystal, it is best to separate them, with one 5-man team responsible for each of the two bosses. In order to have enough space for the fight you will have to clear some trash on either side of the lane that is usually ignored in normal mode.\nThe first resonating crystal \"belongs\" to the Morchok team. The Kohcrom tank should drag the boss out of range while the Morchok team deals with it.\nSplitting the raid also means that a non-tank will endure the enhanced Stomp damage from being closest to the tank. Assign a specific player with good movement ability and survivability the job of stacking on the tank so that the damage will be predictable. The other 3 members of the 5-man team will have to stack on the Resonating Crystal to minimize the damage. To make sure that all of the 5-man team is in range of the stomp, the tank should run toward the resonating crystal as soon as it spawns. Positioning the boss close to the crystal is necessary if there are any melee players in the team.\nThe bosses typically toss their resonating crystals farther and farther from the starting point of the battle. The black blood phase is a convenient time for the team to retreat to the center of the battlefield, reset Morchok's position, and prevent the battle from creeping into adds.\nDo not be afraid to experiment with a 3-healer or 4-healer setup.\nLoot.\nEach boss in the instance has their own drops and a table of shared items that can drop off any boss except for both &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; encounters.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

This titanic elemental is the physical embodiment of secret reservoir waters that were corrupted after the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Pride\"&gt;Sha of Pride&lt;/a&gt; was released.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The ancient inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; recognized the vital importance of the lifegiving Pools of Power, building an underground system of aqueducts to safeguard the waters and nurture life in the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt;. The touch of corruption has animated and twisted these waters, and Immerseus stands as an unnatural embodiment of the Vale's sorrow.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"The layout of this area and the visual framing of the boss as players enter the raid zone hearkens back to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Marrowgar\"&gt;Lord Marrowgar&lt;/a&gt; at the entrance to &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;\u2014we wanted to make sure that the first thing players saw when they entered the Raid was a huge and visually impressive foe. Long-time players (or pet collectors) may find the fight structure somewhat reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Viscidus\"&gt;Viscidus&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple of Ahn\u2019Qiraj.\"\nOverview.\nImmerseus begins with 100 Corruption, displayed as a visible power bar, and the objective of the encounter is to cleanse him by reducing his Corruption level to 0. Each time Immerseus is reduced to zero health, he will Split into a mix of dark Sha Puddles and watery Contaminated Puddles. As the Puddles move back towards the center of the chamber, damage-dealers must destroy Sha Puddles, while healers try to heal Contaminated Puddles in order to fully purify them, before they reach the central pool. Following each Split, Immerseus will reform with reduced health and Corruption depending on how successful the raid was in dealing with the two types of Puddles. This cycle will repeat until Immerseus is cleansed.\nAbilities.\nTears of the Vale.\nAs a water elemental, Immerseus attacks players directly.\nSplit.\nUpon reaching zero health, Immerseus becomes unstable and bursts into a shower of &lt;a href=\"Sha%20Puddle\"&gt;Sha Puddle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Contaminated%20Puddle\"&gt;Contaminated Puddle&lt;/a&gt;s, which will attempt to reform in the pool at the center of the chamber.\nFor each Sha puddle killed and each Contaminated Puddle healed to full, Immerseus's Corruption is reduces by one. When Immerseus reaches zero Corruption, he is cleansed of the Sha taint and becomes friendly.\nStrategy.\nImmerseus alternates between two phases: the \"normal\" phase and the \"corruption\" phase. The objective of the raid is to empty his corruption bar, which can only happen in the corruption phase; the raid must DPS Immerseus to zero HP in the normal phase to trigger the phase transition.\nImmerseus' enrage timer has been estimated at around 10 minutes , which should not be an issue for most groups, especially on normal mode.\nNormal Phase.\nTanks need to face Immerseus away from the raid (and away from each other) due to Corrosive Blast, and will need to regularly taunt off each other to avoid being one-shotted by this ability.\nThe rest of the raid will be periodically targeted by Sha Bolts. These leave a void zone and, with all void zones, players need to move out of them. The void zones persist until the phase transition, so players must carefully position the pools in such a way that they don't position themselves into a corner with no means of escape.\nWhen Immerseus casts Swirl, the raid must simply rotate ahead of the beam. This ability is reminiscent of &lt;a href=\"Durumu%20the%20Forgotten\"&gt;Durumu's&lt;/a&gt; Disintegration Beam and &lt;a href=\"Wise%20Mari\"&gt;Wise Mari's&lt;/a&gt; Wash Away.\nPlayers should take care not to enter Immerseus' circular puddle, as it cases both damage and a knockback.\nCorruption Phase.\nOnce Immerseus is brought down to zero HP in the normal phase, blobs of corruption will fly out of him. There are two types of blobs, Sha Puddles and Contaminated Puddles.\nDPS (with tanks contributing) will need to head after the Sha Puddles and burst them down one at a time. For each Sha Puddle killed, players within 10 yards will receive a stacking buff increasing damage to other Sha Puddles by 25%, and Immerseus' corruption bar will permanently decrease by 1.\nHealers will need to heal the Contaminated Puddles one at a time. The puddles slow down the more they are healed, and when healed to full, healers within 10 yards will receive 25% mana as well as 75% increased healing for 10 seconds. Healing a Contaminated Puddle to full health also permanently decreases the corruption bar by 1.\nAny puddles that reach the boss will deal raid wide damage, so the raid needs to kill/heal as many puddles as possible before the remaining puddles reach the boss, and use raid cooldowns to survive the damage when they do. Immerseus will then re-form with reduced health (corresponding to his corruption bar), and the raid will head back into the normal phase.\nThe fight will then alternate between the two phases until the raid kills/heals enough blobs to empty the boss's corruption bar. When this happens, Immerseus becomes friendly, and the fight is over.\nAchievement: No More Tears.\nTo earn &lt;a href=\"No%20More%20Tears\"&gt;No More Tears&lt;/a&gt;, the raid will need to attempt to stop Sha Puddles from ever reaching the boss during the Corruption Phase. The puddles are immune to &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Frost\"&gt;Ring of Frost&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Banish\"&gt;Banish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fear\"&gt;Fear&lt;/a&gt; and other forms of crowd control, but can be stunned, slowed, rooted and knocked back.\nAfter 30 seconds, Immerseus will return to the Normal Phase, and any Sha Puddles that have not reached the boss at this time will transform into Tears of the Vale. They have little health and do not need to be tanked, but cast a raid-wide AoE that can quickly overwhelm healers (even in Flexible Difficulty), so the raid will need to nuke them down as quickly as possible. Once 10 such Tears of the Vale has been killed, the raid can then proceed to defeating the encounter normally.\nAttempting the achievement will however bring the encounter's usually generous hard enrage timer into play; too many prolonged Corruption Phases can end in a wipe due to the enrage timer. The raid should aim for 3-4 Tears of the Vale per Corruption Phase until enough have been killed, or even 5 if the healers are confident."}

All five of the pylons in Dire Maul West must be cleared before Immol'thar can be fought.\nBackground.\nImmol'thar is an ancient &lt;a href=\"void%20terror\"&gt;void terror&lt;/a&gt; that is imprisoned within &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; many &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; slipped into lethargy. So it came pass that &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; ordered the building of five pylons. Those pylons created a force field that could imprison the mighty &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; Immol'thar. Hungry for magic, the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; quickly mastered siphoning the demonic energy from Immol'thar. The energy was then used to grant the elves immortality.\nCenturies later, the powers used to imprison Immol'thar and to control the pylons weakened. In order to maintain his vast power, Prince Tortheldrin turned upon his fellow Shen'dralar and began slaying them, draining their energies to replenish his own.\nIn Year 25, the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raided &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; and discovered the Shen'dralar elves feeding on Immol'thar. They banished him into the Twisting Nether. The Highborne had drained him to a husk, and all that remained from the beast was the &lt;a href=\"%3AEvil%20Eye%20Pendant\"&gt;:Evil Eye Pendant&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"In a desperate bid to restore the power and immortality they lost when the Well of Eternity was destroyed, the Shen'dralar summoned a demon into the western wing of Dire Maul and captured him within a force field, allowing them to use the void terror's energy for their own spells. Unable to fight back or even move for nearly 10,000 years, Immol'thar could only watch and wait for the day he might break free and rend the flesh of his captors.\"\nFreeing Immol'thar.\nTo slay the demon, you must first destroy the pylons maintaining his magical prison. There are five of these pylons, all located in Dire Maul West, and all are guarded by elite blue energy elementals called Arcane Torrents. Destroying all the arcane torrents by a pylon shuts down that pylon; you do not have to click on the pylon (it stops glowing and no longer projects a beam of light into the sky).\nMoving through this part of Dire Maul requires passing through several doors. It is quickest and easiest to use the west entrance rather than the north (though the two are connected by the Library and Immol'thar's prison chamber). The west entrance puts you at the Capital Gardens, a large green courtyard guarded by hostile elite trees. Ironbark Protectors patrol the paved area outside the grassy garden, walking alone or in pairs. These mobs are linked to &lt;a href=\"Tendris%20Warpwood\"&gt;Tendris Warpwood&lt;/a&gt; (who stands in the next courtyard); killing them here prevents them from helping him if you attack him later. Because the Ironbark Protectors are elementals, warlocks can banish them.\nOnce you clear the Ironbark Protectors, you can pull the Mana Remnants (blue arcane elemental creatures surrounding the pylon), which usually come solo or in pairs. Mana Remnants are elementals and are banishable by warlocks. There are eight guardians \u2014 make sure you get all eight before moving on.\nGo to the west side of the Gardens where there are three exits. The middle one leads to a ramp and a courtyard with Tendris Warpwood. The north and south ones lead to a balcony that surrounds Tendris' courtyard. Take the north exit onto the balcony and head counterclockwise around the courtyard. Be alert for visible and invisible undead highborne. On the north end of the courtyard is a room full of ghosts and a ramp leading upward to another balcony. Clear the ghosts near the ramp (you may have to clear them all, as they have a wide aggro radius) and climb it to the upper balcony.\nThe upper balcony has a pylon on the north end and one on the south, each guarded by Mana Remnants. In the way are hostile undead high elves. Clear these mobs, and the Mana Remnants, to shut down the north pylon.\nProceed clockwise and you eventually reach a Shen'dralar Ancient, a neutral highborne who gives the quest The Madness Within. As her quest requires you to kill Immol'thar, and you're here to do that anyway, you might as well accept it. Continue clockwise to the southern pylon and destroy the elementals guarding it.\nBeyond the southern pylon is another ramp leading to a ghost room (the southern counterpart to the north room you passed through), but it is easier to jump down to the lower balcony than to fight more ghosts. The southern end is also patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Illyanna%20Ravenoak\"&gt;Illyanna Ravenoak&lt;/a&gt; and her pet bear &lt;a href=\"Ferra\"&gt;Ferra&lt;/a&gt;, which is another reason to avoid it unless you have time and want extra loot.\nFrom the lower balcony you can jump down to the ramp that leads to Tendris, or jump directly into the safe northeast corner of his courtyard. If you killed all the Ironbark Protectors in the first courtyard, Tendris is an easy fight. You can safely move from the northeast corner to the neaby door without aggroing him.\nBeyond the door is a hallway with visible and invisible undead highborne patrolling. Once you clear those you can rest and prepare for the battles in the next room, Immol'thar's Prison.\nThe Prison is a large round chamber patrolled by arcane elementals; the center portion is blocked by a magic wall.\nSolo mobs in the circular outer portion are Residual Monstrosities; these have a strong knockback attack and when you kill them they spawn several non-elite arcane elementals that attack with multiple AOE attacks like a mage's arcane explosion. The best way to deal with them is to run away as the Residual Monstrosity dies and let them explode at a safe distance while killing them with AOE or ranged attacks (otherwise their multiple AOE attacks are very dangerous).\nGroup mobs are an elite Arcane Torrent surrounded by several smaller non-elite Arcane Feedback; it is easiest if a warlock banishes the elite so the group can kill the little ones and then tackle the elite without distractions. You'll want to clear many of these patrollers so they don't add while dealing with the pylon guardians.\nIf you need a safe place to rest, there is a corridor in the northeast that leads to the Library; once the Prison is out of sight, you are safe from all patrols. The Library has the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar%20Provisioner\"&gt;Shen'dralar Provisioner&lt;/a&gt; in the southeast corner, who can repair your gear.\nThere are two pylons in the Prison, one at 5:00 and one at 1:00. These fights work just like the other pylon fights. Once you power down these two pylons, the magic wall at the center of the Prison collapses and the &lt;a href=\"Highborne%20Summoner\"&gt;highborne&lt;/a&gt; maintaining it call out a warning.\nOnce the wall is down, the demon Immol'thar is free, but he attacks his highborne jailers first and doesn't leave the arena-like courtyard where he was imprisoned. If there are any elemental guardians patrolling the outer chamber you can run to the central arena; their aggro radius is small enough that once in the arena you should be safe from them. If one attacks, be sure to face toward or parallel to Immol'thar, otherwise they may knock you into him and start that fight early.\nSlaying Immol'thar.\nUse standard boss tactics. He spawns floating eyes that slow melee and spellcasting; it is best to have one character devoted to eliminating the eyes. The eyes can also heal him if left alone too long. Giving the tank &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20Arthas\"&gt;Gift of Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Demonslaying\"&gt;Elixir of Demonslaying&lt;/a&gt; helps.\nOnce you kill Immol'thar, don't forget to go into the Library and kill &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Tortheldrin\"&gt;Prince Tortheldrin&lt;/a&gt; for the Madness Within quest.

Immortality does not confer an immunity to injury nor death by unnatural means.\nOfficial Warcraft Encyclopedia.\nVerbatim from the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20Encyclopedia\"&gt;Warcraft Encyclopedia&lt;/a&gt;:\nNight elves.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; lore states they were once immortal, granted to them by the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. The early night elves gathered around the Well and its energies infused them as they built their civilization. They sacrificed the source of their immortality and power during their conflict with the demons of the Burning Legion during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the night elves lost their immortality due to the destruction of the Well of Eternity, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the Timeless &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, blessed the first &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, with the gift of immortality. As long as the tree stands, the night elves would forever have the chance to learn.\nNordrassil contained within it the truest, purest essence of &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt; energy on Azeroth. The &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20life\"&gt;trees of life&lt;/a&gt; were enchanted saplings of Nordrassil from which the night elves drew their life energies. These mysterious &lt;a href=\"ancient\"&gt;ancient&lt;/a&gt;s were the key to the night elves' immortality and harmonious coexistence with nature.\nWhen Nordrassil was severely damaged during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves again lost their immortality. Some wayward druids sought to reestablish the link between their spirits and the eternal world by planting a special tree. This second world tree, &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, did not allow the elves to regain their immortality. The promise of immortality associated with Teldrassil came primarily from &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and not from any divine beings. Nozdormu, perhaps tellingly, withheld his blessing due to Fandral's actions during the war against the &lt;a href=\"qiraji\"&gt;qiraji&lt;/a&gt;. Fandral's promise has yet to come true.\n&lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Vaeldrin\"&gt;Lorekeeper Vaeldrin&lt;/a&gt; found scrolls predating &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; and sought to find a power that would restore their immortality. This led his expedition to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Pools%20of%20Youth\"&gt;Pools of Youth&lt;/a&gt;, which was used during the &lt;a href=\"mogu%20empire\"&gt;mogu empire&lt;/a&gt; to extend the lives of the mogu.

He starts out utilizing controlling and suppressing effects to defeat his enemies. At 66% health remaining, Imonar backs up to a secondary platform, dropping several traps along the way. He then begins to use more lethal effects on enemies, calling in Legion ships to assist him. At 33% health remaining, Imonar leaps back to the primary platform, once more planting traps along the way. His weapons are now empowered and fully operational. In Mythic difficulty, these transitions occur every time Imonar loses 20% of his maximum health."}

Creatures of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;fire and trickery considered lowly among demons, they do not pose a large threat alone and are often underestimated due to their singular lack of toughness. However, when in a group they can quickly replace their fallen and overwhelm their opponents, and their real threat is in how difficult it is to kill every single one of them. Imps emerge from the stomachs of &lt;a href=\"imp%20mother\"&gt;imp mother&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDespite their lack of physical strength, imps possess powers and a cleverness that serve &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s well, and the simplest of the summoning spells a would-be warlock can learn is that of the imp. Before they are imparted to this, the warlock must prove that they have the necessary magical and physical ability.\nNot much is known about the imps' background or history, but at least some of them are known to dwell on the planet &lt;a href=\"Xoroth\"&gt;Xoroth&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Daglop\"&gt;Daglop&lt;/a&gt; claims that on \"[his] world\", imps are tortured for fun.\nImps can &lt;a href=\"Phase%20Shift%20%28imp%20ability%29\"&gt;phase shift&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. All imps are afraid of rainbows. Some imps speak exclusively in rhyme. Many imps prefer to bring their own cup with them. Some theorize that an ancient imp-like race revered their drinking vessels as something sacred, and part of that ritual remained even after they were indoctrinated into the Burning Legion. There is a legend claiming that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; may be home to ancestors of the imp race who never joined the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nFel imps.\nFel imps appear to be a larger and more powerful type of imp. They are easily distinguishable from their cousins by their wings and massive horns.\nThe fel imps of &lt;a href=\"Felspark%20Ravine\"&gt;Felspark Ravine&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; are remarkably chatty. They're just as easy to contract into service as their names are to learn. The ritual to summon one is trivial, at best.\nAs a warlock minion.\n&lt;a href=\"Summon%20Imp\"&gt;Summon Imp&lt;/a&gt; is a warlock ability used to summon a controllable imp to be your &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;minion&lt;/a&gt;. It is learned automatically upon character creation.\nThe imp can be customized with a number of colorations, some of which allow you to turn the flames surrounding the imp off. A warlock can further customize their imp by unlocking Fel imps as a customization option through the &lt;a href=\"Grimoire%20of%20the%20Fel%20Imp\"&gt;Grimoire of the Fel Imp&lt;/a&gt; and unlocking Fiends through the quest &lt;a href=\"When%20Revenge%20Burns%20Green\"&gt;When Revenge Burns Green&lt;/a&gt;.\nInspiration.\nIn Germanic folklore, s are mythological beings similar to diminutive fairies or demons but are often more mischievous than evil or harmful. Imps are commonly seen as the s of witches and sorcerers."}

As is common with demons, they have wings, hooves, and horns. Their method of locomotion is restrained to using their wings to fly. Imp Mothers are often found floating in pools of fel-lava. \nAbilities.\nDue to their limited physical capabilities, imp mothers typically use magic in combat. While they have typically been observed using fel-&lt;a href=\"fire\"&gt;fire&lt;/a&gt;, some use &lt;a href=\"disease\"&gt;disease&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"poison\"&gt;poison&lt;/a&gt; spells as well.\nTheir true power lies in their power of manipulation. Imp mothers can shapeshift into other forms, charm their enemies, and turn them against each other. At least one imp mother, &lt;a href=\"Agatha%20%28demon%29\"&gt;Agatha&lt;/a&gt;, showed enough power and authority to command the &lt;a href=\"sayaad\"&gt;sayaad&lt;/a&gt; in their mission to tear apart the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; from within."}

When the draenei had first begun to construct the city of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; atop the ruins of the ancient ogre city of &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;, there was an explosion of anger within the current ogre capital, &lt;a href=\"Highmaul\"&gt;Highmaul&lt;/a&gt;. It was seen as an unforgivable insult for these small, weak newcomers to build a city on the bones of the Gorian Empire's great capital, but Shattrath's sleek construction and otherworldly defenses gave the ogres pause. Nothing like their technology had ever been seen on Draenor before, and even their weakest apprentices had more refined and effective magical techniques than even the most advanced ogre sorcerers.\nHok'lon, himself a gifted &lt;a href=\"arcanist\"&gt;arcanist&lt;/a&gt;, seized control of Highmaul and declared that he would conquer Shattrath. He believed that the draenei had stolen their power using hidden knowledge left beneath the old capital. Hok'lon incited his people to wage war by publicly sneering at the draenei, which he called \"usurpers\", and promised that Highmaul would become the center of a new, enlightened Gorian Empire once the draenei had been slaughtered. The draenei had even already rebuilt their city for them. Highmaul's aristocracy, eager to claim the new city for themselves, threw their support behind Hok'lon.\nThe ogre army that marched on Shattrath vastly outnumbered the draenei, but the city's defenses easily repelled their first \u2014 and only \u2014 attack. As the ogres regrouped, &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s launched surprise attacks from multiple directions. The Vindicator &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; led an elite force of holy warriors that included two of his greatest followers, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Maraad&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;. They found and killed Hok'lon and his generals, leaving the ogre forces in disarray. Rather than slaughter their foes, the draenei then immediately returned to Shattrath. The draenei leader, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt;, appeared on Shattrath's ramparts, wreathed in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and speaking with a voice that rumbled through the heavens: \"Go home, and you will not be harmed\". The ogres fled. The grandiose war that was meant to revive the Gorian Empire had fallen after one attack, and the Highmaul ogres never attempted a frontal assault on the draenei again."}

In an attempt to maintain the ogres' waning grip on &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, he oversaw the creation of an army of half-ogre, half-&lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; halfbreeds known as the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal%20clan\"&gt;mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;. He was eventually killed by one of his own creations, the mok'nathal elder &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;, during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAfter battles with the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; and the rebellion of the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Hand%20clan\"&gt;Shattered Hand clan&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt; was losing power on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and their hold on &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; was broken forever. Imperator Kelgrok of the Bladespire clan was greatly troubled by these events and determined to keep his hold on Frostfire Ridge. He did not only mean to keep defenses up, but to expand. To make up for the ogres' low numbers, Bladespire sorcerers had conducted cruel experiments to create new creatures that could be used as labor, and the greatest result came from selective breeding between ogres and enslaved orcs. The children of these forced unions were called mok'nathal, possessing the strength of ogres and intelligence of orcs. The Bladespire kept the mok'nathal in chains and bred them together to create even more. To ensure their loyalty, the ogres threatened to kill entire families if even one of the members rebelled.\nImperator Kelgrok unshackled many of these mok'nathal and ordered them to make war on the orcs of Frostfire Ridge. The mok'nathal formed the bulk of the Bladespire army that rampaged across Frostfire, seizing many tracts of resource-rich land. Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Garad\"&gt;Garad&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; called upon the &lt;a href=\"Whiteclaw%20clan\"&gt;Whiteclaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thunderlord%20clan\"&gt;Thunderlord clan&lt;/a&gt;s that lived nearby to unite, but the Thunderlords - led by Garad's estranged son &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; - rejected the offer. Thunderlord orcs raided Bladespire settlements alone in the dead of night, slaughtering young and old alike. In the meantime, the united Frostwolf and Whiteclaw army fought the Bladespire and managed to capture a number of mok'nathal, including their elder &lt;a href=\"Leoroxx\"&gt;Leoroxx&lt;/a&gt;.\nGarad was surprised to learn that Leoroxx and the other mok'nathal were not willing servants but slaves. Garad and Leoroxx came to an agreement to help each other destroy the Bladespire clan forever. Leoroxx returned to Bladespire Hold and incited open rebellion among the mok'nathal. They rose up against their oppressors and set fire to the stronghold as the Frostwolves and Whiteclaws crashed into Bladespire's outer defenses. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Bladespire\"&gt;Battle of Bladespire&lt;/a&gt; dragged on for a full bloody day before the orcs and mok'nathal drove the ogres out. In the heart of the fortress, Leoroxx strangled Imperator Kelgrok with the chains he had worn for so much of his life."}

A few hours later saw the Iron Horde laying siege to Highmaul at his command. Not long after Imperator Mar'gok displeased that the Iron Horde could possible claim Highmaul sought peace with the Iron Horde and personally met with Grommash. During this meeting Imperator Mar'gok remarked even with their strength the Iron Horde was weak due to not containing the magic the ogres of Highmaul were capable of. The Imperator then remarked that even if the Iron Horde did claim Highmaul, they would lose an entire year in removing the bodies in order to successfully live within city. Grommash in response retorted that not only did they were winning, they did not want Highmaul but their lives. However he did acknowledge the might of their sorcery and ordered the Imperator to teach to them and in turn some of them may live. After a brief council Imperator Mar'gok tried to call to get Hellscream to call off the siege before teaching, pointing out each ogre death was one less person who could teach the orcs. However Hellscream was adamant that the ogres teach them the magic of the breakers immediately, and knowing he had no choice if he wished to save Highmaul Imperator Mar'gok conceded to his demands.\nAt Hellscream's command Imperator Mar'gok and his ogres fought orc warlocks who the Iron Horde had taken prisoner and after witnessing the ogres winning (despite the losses they suffered) Grommash ordered for the siege of Highmaul to stopped and that declared the ogres of Highmaul were now servants of the Iron Horde. Approaching the Imperator, the Warchief of the Iron ordered him to deliver all orc slaves in Highmaul to and warned that any attempt at treachery or rebellion would see them returning to claim his blood. When &lt;a href=\"Ko%27ragh\"&gt;Ko'ragh&lt;/a&gt; approached afterwards Mar'gok either wanted to take out his frustrations out on his servant or believing that he had hidden his ability to become to immune to magic beat Ko'ragh. \nOnce he returned to Highmaul Imperator Mar'gok remarked to himself that while he would serve the Iron Horde, they would do so \"for now\", showing his intention to eventually break free from the Iron Horde's control.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMar'gok appears in the Coliseum when the garrison commanders fight between themselves. He congratulates and rewards the last standing gladiator.\nThe Imperator arrives in Highmaul to watch Kargath Bladefist do battle in the arena once again even in his \"handicap\" status. After the orc is killed by the heroes from Azeroth, Cho'gall escapes from his prison cell through a void portal. The sorcerer king couldn't keep the traitorous under his control. The Highmaul guard attempts to stop Cho'gall by Mar'gok's command, but ultimately failed. The Imperator calls for sealing the gates from the incoming Pale orcs that the ogre magi summoned to the city, and proclaims that Highmaul will not fall to the likes of him before teleporting away.\nThe sorcerer king lends a hand to the &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Ogron\"&gt;Twin Ogron&lt;/a&gt; and Fel Breaker &lt;a href=\"Ko%27ragh\"&gt;Ko'ragh&lt;/a&gt; as the adventurers climbed up the city interior. In the throne room, &lt;a href=\"High%20Councilor%20Mal%27gris\"&gt;High Councilor Mal'gris&lt;/a&gt; tells him that Highmaul is lost and must abandon it. Mar'gok rejects his advisor's words that the Gorian Empire will not be overthrown by these \"peasants\". Mal'gris sees the adventurers enter the throne room and they seek the stones. The Imperator commands him and the other advisors to remove them in his presence, but they are all killed. The sorcerer king then engages the heroes himself and, despite using powers of the ancient relics from the Gorian Empire, is killed by the heroes and proclaims that he is still king.\nOn Mythic mode, when Mar'gok is about to defeated, arrives in the throne room with his Pale orcs, seizing the sorcerer king in a field of magic. Declaring that his reign has come to an end, Cho'gall draws the power of the relics from Mar'gok's body, killing him in the process.\nAt some point, his forces were victorious in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Red%20Spires\"&gt;Battle of Red Spires&lt;/a&gt;."}

His tampering with the &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; led to a war between the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s that ended with the complete destruction of the ogre capital, &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nAround 403 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; clans lived on the outskirts of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;. The ogres had little interest in (or fear of) the orcs and saw their practice of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;ism as little more than quaint trickery to make the wind blow a little harder or a fire to burn a little hotter. It wasn't until ogres witnessed an elder shaman turning away a flash flood that would otherwise have destroyed an orcish village that they began to realize the power of the elements. Rather than learning this power with the same humility as the orcs had, the ogres decided to take it by force. Imperator Molok, the ruler of the Gorian Empire, sent an army to drive away the orcs and claim the Throne of the Elements for the empire. The ogres eagerly and carelessly dissected the Throne with their &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; spellwork, ignorant to the mix of raw &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; and elemental power that lingered in the remains of the ancient giant &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;Grond&lt;/a&gt;. One day, the dissonance between the ogres' magic and Grond's residual energies ignited an explosion that blew apart the temple the orcs had carved from the giant's skull and killed every Gorian sorcerer inside the structure, leaving behind only a few standing stones. This disaster threw the elements out of balance all across Draenor, causing huge storms all across the world and causing Draenor's native spirits to descend into turmoil. However, Molok was not deterred in the slightest and simply sent more sorcerers to replace the ones that had been killed, for he now had proof of the elements' true power and was determined to claim it for himself.\nThe next year's orcish &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival was marked by mourning for the incident at the Throne. The &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon&lt;/a&gt; elder shaman, &lt;a href=\"Nelgarm\"&gt;Nelgarm&lt;/a&gt;, pleaded for action, lest all of the clans suffer disastrous famines as a result of the elements' imbalance. The clans agreed to join together, and Nelgarm called upon the elements to bless them with their protection. The united orc army first fell upon the Throne of the Elements. Surprised by the attack, the Gorian sorcerers retreated with little bloodshed, but Imperator Molok was quick to retaliate. The Gorian armies moved en masse, and total war engulfed Draenor, and now every orcish male, female and child had to be prepared to fight. The ogres imagined that this merciless tactic would strike terror into the hearts of the orcs, but the clans rose to the challenge and small, mobile groups of raiders slowly dismantled the Gorian Empire's network of fortresses and outposts, pushing the ogre armies back to their capital: Goria.\nThe orcs kept their distance on the hills surrounding the city, content to starve their enemy out. As the siege progressed and the ogres found maintaining their empire to be increasingly unsustainable, Molok and his &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s revisited their &lt;a href=\"Apexis%20Crystal\"&gt;Apexis crystals&lt;/a&gt;, searching for a way to break the siege. In time, they discovered the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;n legend about the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Sethe\"&gt;Curse of Sethe&lt;/a&gt;, and began experimenting with ways to create a similar affliction among the orcs. They succeeded, and soon the so-called &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; spread like wildfire through the orcs' encampments, culling vast amounts of the orcish combatants.\nNelgarm and his fellow shaman, realizing that the pox was an unseen attack from the ogres and that the siege was now doomed to fail, beseeched the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Goria. The orcs and the elemental spirits both understood that Molok would resume meddling with the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; if the orcs failed, and so the spirits unleashed their fury upon Goria. Over hours, lightning, fire and earthquakes ravaged the ogre capital until nothing but ash and rubble remained, before the earth itself wrenched open like a giant maw to swallow Molok and the remains of his great city whole."}

He is first seen in &lt;a href=\"The%20Empress%27%20Gambit\"&gt;The Empress' Gambit&lt;/a&gt; where he is challenged by and kills the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paragon\"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malik%20the%20Unscathed\"&gt;Malik the Unscathed&lt;/a&gt;. He guarded the way into the Dread Approach until killed by Klaxxi-aligned &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;adventurers&lt;/a&gt;. \nZor'lok is the first boss of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt;. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Zor'lok shrieks his proclamations so they're heard throughout the sprawling mantid palace. He is the Voice of the Empress, and his words alone inspire the &lt;a href=\"insectoid\"&gt;insectoid&lt;/a&gt; race's warriors to give their lives without question. Unwaveringly loyal, Zor'lok will stop at nothing to defend his &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;beloved matriarch&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of the corruption within her.\"\nSpells and Abilities.\nStage 1: Her Gifts are Many.\nImperial Vizier Zor'lok flies to a random platform in the room, then attacks the players from there. When Zor'lok loses 20% of his total health, he changes positions to a different platform. Imperial Vizier Zor'lok gains one ability while at each platform, but loses that ability when he moves to a different platform.\nStage 2: We Will Not Disappoint Her.\nWhen Imperial Vizier Zor'lok reaches 40% remaining health, he flies to the center of the chamber and inhales the Pheromones of Zeal. Imperial Vizier Zor'lok now uses all of his abilities from Stage One.\nStrategy.\nStart the encounter with a &lt;a href=\"Stampeding%20Roar\"&gt;Stampeding Roar&lt;/a&gt;, then attack the boss to see which platform he flies to first. The entire lower floor is covered in pheromones which tick for 19,000 Nature damage every second and silences all units inside it, so getting to a platform quickly is imperative. In non-Heroic mode difficulties, Zor'lok can choose either the left or right platform to start the fight. Every 20% health lost, he will move to another platform. Heal up and get shielded before entering the pheromones to cross to join him.\nAttenuation.\nThe left platform grants Zor'lok Attenuation. Attenuation is a large set of sonic rings traveling outward from the center of the platform in a spiral pattern in a straight line, before splitting near the outer wall. The rings will spawn in either a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction. To avoid attenuation, the most fool proof way is to swing the camera from above and follow the movement of the spiral. Don't be too far out. Don't be too far in. And don't run too fast!\nForce and Verve.\nThe right platform grants Force and Verve. Zor'lok will spawn three Noise Cancelling zones randomly around the platform, which look like the turtle pet ability &lt;a href=\"Shell%20Shield\"&gt;Shell Shield&lt;/a&gt;. In most difficulties, there is a limit to the number of players who can benefit from the shields to prevent the entire raid from stacking in one bubble. The first shield will be cast in melee range, then the second a few yards away from the boss, and the third out at range. Thus, melee and the tank should move to the first shield spawned, healers should look to the second, and ranged attackers should find themselves under the third.\nConvert.\nAt 60% health, Zor'lok will fly to the back platform and start Converting players. Converted players are &lt;a href=\"mind%20control\"&gt;mind control&lt;/a&gt;led and have their health and damage outputs increased dramatically. Converted players will revert back to normal below 50% health, but may break out early each time they take spell damage. It is important not to kill converted players with &lt;a href=\"damage%20over%20time\"&gt;damage over time&lt;/a&gt; abilities!\nFinal phase.\nAt 40% health, Zor'lok will fly from the third platform to the center of the room and inhale all of the pheromones, then &lt;a href=\"Death%20Grip\"&gt;Death Grip&lt;/a&gt; all members of the raid to his location. He will then start using all of his phase one abilities at the same time. This is thus a burn phase, so pop &lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; and all other cooldowns to quickly burn him down, all the while dancing through Attenuation, running under the shields for Force and Verve, and freeing Converted players.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

As such it was protected by the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Guard%20%28Lordaeron%29\"&gt;King's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. The chamber has silken curtains, golden chandeliers, and a pure white marble floor which has intricate designs with concentric circles and a triangle in the middle. At the center of the triangle is another circle with the golden seal of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The high domed ceiling, with the octagonal window at the apex, let in plenty of natural light. Terenas entertained honored guests here at times, especially &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Prestor\"&gt;Lord Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, and organized war councils here as well with &lt;a href=\"ambassador\"&gt;ambassador&lt;/a&gt;s from Lordaeron's kingdoms, positioned on the many balconies that overlook the throne room. It is on his own throne that Terenas was assassinated by his son, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nSecond War.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Seven%20Nations\"&gt;Council of Seven Nations&lt;/a&gt; first met in Lordaeron's throne room. While they were not invited to the meeting, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; sneaked in one of the room's upper balconies to secretly listen to it.\nThird War.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;mysterious prophet&lt;/a&gt; flew in and warned &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and the present ambassadors about a &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;coming danger&lt;/a&gt; and that they should leave Lordaeron for &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. However, Terenas dismissed him. Some time later, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; slew his father Terenas in Lordaeron's throne room, and ransacked the city.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; seized the control of Capital City from &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, she entered the chamber. She did not desire the chamber's throne or the lost &lt;a href=\"bloodied%20crown\"&gt;bloodied crown&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;city below it&lt;/a&gt;. Lost in thoughts, the Banshee Queen was approached by a &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; who introduced himself as &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt; and told her his plan about the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;new plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe imperial chamber is still part of the entryway into the catacombs, expanded to become the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;. One can spot the dried blood of Terenas on his throne, and his final words still faintly echo through the chamber.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; launched an assault to reclaim the lost kingdom in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and his allies stepped inside the Throne Room, shortly before &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; triggered her trap and &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; the entire Keep."}

With its rich history and ancient by stately decor, the hall cast an aura of tremendous significance upon any discussion taking place there. An elaborately decorated ivory table stands in the center of the room. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s grandfather had received it as a gift from his northern vassals after his successful negotiations with the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; over the borders there.

Not to mention the humiliation and surprise of being transformed into an ugly leper gnome.

{"id": "87946", "revid": "49848256", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=87946", "title": "Working the Auction House", "text": "Below is a guide to working the Auction House; how to make tons of wicked cash off it.\nBuying/Reselling.\nIf you're ever browsing the Auction House and you see an item cheaper than usual (i.e. &lt;a href=\"Black%20Malice\"&gt;Black Malice&lt;/a&gt; normally goes for ~10g, but you see it for 6g) buy it and re-sell it on the Auction House for the proper price.\nThings to remember:\nFarming/Selling.\nThere are many items of value that can be farmed from npc's, either in bulk or a single drop. Some examples of the most coveted items to farm:\nWhen farming, remember that it is a painstaking process that requires patience and perseverance. Sometimes, to get the item you want, you may have to farm for days or, if you are extremely patient, perhaps weeks at a time! On the plus side, almost all enemies worth farming also give XP and drop other loot as well (also money), so you never know what's going to pop up in your next loot window!\nSuggested Areas to Farm, and the Loot:\nPricing an Item.\nIt's important to understand the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; mechanics when posting items.\nBare Minimum.\nIf you just want to experiment, and do not want to lose money, do the following:\nIn Retrospect....\nObviously, for some items, you may find after several expirations, it would have been better to have just sold it to the vendor outright. However, you will likely find that this is very rarely the case, if you are simply selling drops. \nIf you are doing more advanced auction house techniques like buying and reselling, either from vendors or the auction house itself, you need to be more cognizant of profit margins.\nStaying in the Green.\nIf I list an item at the suggested auction house price, how many times can it expire before I lose money? \nBreaking Even.\nAssuming your item does not expire, or does not have a listing fee (such as with &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt; dusts or shards), you must sell the item for a minimum 5% markup of the vendor value. Obviously items that can be sold on the auction house for 50%, 100%, 300%, or even higher markups are much more profitable. The higher that markup, the more room you have for a few expirations.\nPrice Comparison.\nCompare your item. The best way to do this is with price statistics. Some people using the median or average price statistics on &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.allakhazam.com/\"&gt;Allakhazam&lt;/a&gt;. Others use addons such as &lt;a href=\"Auctioneer%20%28AddOn%29\"&gt;Auctioneer (AddOn)&lt;/a&gt; that gather historic prices you have seen on your server. It is important to understand local economy of the realm you are playing on, since item values can differ greatly. There are several sites online dedicated specifically for tracking realm economy and item prices (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Wowuction\"&gt;Wowuction&lt;/a&gt;) and you can use those to find profitable niches for your realm.\nAdvanced Topics.\nBuyer Mentality.\nExplanation.\nSuccess as a merchant comes down to understanding your buyers' needs and state of mind, then using that information to make a profit. This is not necessarily manipulation - think of it as providing a convenience service to your buyers. If they do not like your price, they will not bid on the item. Since we're all online gaming, buyers have all of the same online resources and add-ons (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.allakhazam.com/\"&gt;Allakhazam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/\"&gt;Thottbot&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/\"&gt;WoWHead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse.com\"&gt;Curse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowuction.com\"&gt;WoWuction&lt;/a&gt;, etc.) available to them that sellers have, so it's all fair.\nAs the goblins say, \"Time is money.\" This is true both for the players and their characters; a high-level character could kill low-level mobs for Light Leather or fly around the world find the one vendor who sells a certain schematic, or they could pay a small premium on the Auction House and save their time for more profitable and entertaining activities. Buyers like instant satisfaction, and buyers love convenience. This is why auction houses work, why they are linked between cities, why we have the &lt;a href=\"Trading%20channel\"&gt;Trading channel&lt;/a&gt;, and why we have buyout.\nProfiting.\nThe main form of using this concept for profit is buying and re-selling. Whether your source is a vendor or the auction house, you are ultimately utilizing this concept. With the principle of lazy, instant satisfaction, and convenience in mind, you should almost always be successful with the following techniques:\nFarming the Auction House.\nAnyone who has used the auction house as experienced this, whether they realize it or not. Especially after the release of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; with it's nearly 12G &lt;a href=\"daily%20quest\"&gt;daily quest&lt;/a&gt;s, there are a lot of characters with a lot of disposable income. \nSmall Scale Example.\nFor the casual farmer, let's give an example. Say your &lt;a href=\"realm\"&gt;realm&lt;/a&gt; has 50 stacks of &lt;a href=\"Wool%20Cloth\"&gt;Wool Cloth&lt;/a&gt; for sale typically at any given time. Maybe one or two have a buyout for 1G, and several more have bids for 1G. The other prices are significantly higher, maybe a few at 2.5G, some at 3, 3.5, 4, and the occasional 4.5G for the desperate crowd.\nManipulating Prices.\nThere are two different approaches to large scale price manipulation or even monopolization of a market. Let market be defined as an item with high demand and high volume, such as gems or cloth. The first approach is the classic buy-it-all, re-sell much higher. This is not only expensive, but it's committing. You actually have all of the items and you must sell them to profit. However, you have the most control, and while risky, if it works, you can make a lot of money by deciding your profit margin, rather than squeezing it into an existing market.\nThe second approach is manipulating the bottom of a market. The manipulator raises the minimum bids, therefore making his price nearer to the bottom of the pile. By removing only the super cheap, and by also raising every minimum bid, the bottom of the market is raised. By raising the minimum bid, the manipulator may actually type in more than is required by the minimum bid, paying a little more for the item if it is won, but also removing this price as an option to other prospective buyers.\nThis approach is safer because it is committing only to cash, but not to actual items. For example, assume all of your bids are eventually outbid. While they were still on the auction house, your money was temporarily not available (much like a real world investment). However in the end, you didn't lose anything because all of your bids are returned at no cost (no penalty bidding). On the contrary if you did win all of the items, by leaving a fair amount of pricier items, unlike the first example, and at the same time removing the bottom of the market, your listings are actually closer to the top and seem less extreme. Theoretically, you make more money, or at least have a less risky investment."}

The gnomes were also responsible for perfecting the technique of extracting various chemical compounds out of &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; to make gunpowder and explosives.

The first and most vulnerable stage of a titan's life, world-souls originate as masses of energy spun out into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond%23Origin\"&gt;moment of its creation&lt;/a&gt;, eventually finding comfort in the warmth of a sun. In time, a planet coalesces around the newly-formed world-soul, protecting it as it grows. The soul slumbers for ages within the planet's fiery core, suffusing the planet with their energies as generations of life live and die upon it before eventually awakening as a living world. World-souls only exist within a small number of planets scattered throughout the Great Dark.\nSpeaking to a world-soul is not like speaking to a mortal, which is why &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; needs &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; as her Speaker. Magni says that Azeroth does not speak to him in words but in feelings, like the feeling of a crumbling mountain range, a deep dark sea, or a sunrise.\nHistory.\nThe first known world-soul to awaken was &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;. When he awoke, he set out to find others of his kind, rousing them from their slumber until they matured into full-fledged titans and joined him in his search. Aman'Thul and his siblings would become known as the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, and together they would order countless worlds in the hopes of finding more of their kind. Despite their efforts, the titans discovered fewer and fewer world-souls during their travels. They were not disheartened, however, for they knew that they had only explored but a small corner of the immeasurably vast &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"void%20lord\"&gt;void lord&lt;/a&gt;s, jealous of the titans' power, had always wanted to corrupt one of them and make it their own. However, the titans were too powerful and completely oblivious to their efforts of corruption, which proved futile. The void lords instead decided to go after titans when they were still in their most fragile, vulnerable state when they were still slumbering world-souls. They pooled their energy to create the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, charged to find and corrupt nascent titans throughout the Great Dark. Not knowing which planets contained world-souls, the void lords hurled their creations out into the cosmos in the hopes that some would smash into a planet that contained one.\nDistinction.\nOn each world they encountered, the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; employed techniques to ascertain whether a world-soul was present.\nOrdering process.\nInert or not, the Pantheon had vowed to maintain and protect all &lt;a href=\"Planet\"&gt;worlds&lt;/a&gt; they visited. To do so, they empowered primitive life-forms to uphold the integrity of their ordered worlds. The Pantheon also embedded colossal machines in the surface of these worlds. Through these devices, the titans could monitor them, and purge them of life should their evolutionary paths succumb to disorder.\nTo aid the Pantheon, &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt; called upon a mysterious race known as the &lt;a href=\"constellar\"&gt;constellar&lt;/a&gt;. These celestial beings observed the many worlds ordered by the titans, staying vigilant for any sign of instability. When it was necessary, the constellar could initiate a fail-safe procedure to scour life from a world in the hopes of resetting its evolutionary process.\nCorruption.\nSargeras and the corrupted world-soul.\nTraveling in a cold corner of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, the titan &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; stumbled upon a world-soul. To his horror, he saw that the planet had been almost completely infested by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Unnamed%20world-soul\"&gt;nascent titan's&lt;/a&gt; tranquil dreams had turned into horrific nightmares. After learning of the void lords' plans from the world's &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; inhabitants \u2014 that if the Old Gods succeeded in corrupting a world-soul, it would awaken as an unspeakably dark creature who would devour all of creation \u2014 Sargeras cleaved the corrupted world in two, instantly killing the nascent titan within.\nWhen he returned to the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to tell of his discovery, Sargeras was chastised by his brethren, who insisted that they may have been able to save the world-soul without killing it. It was this event that later led Sargeras to form the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to prevent the void lords from ever spawning a &lt;a href=\"dark%20titan\"&gt;dark titan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Sargeras' departure, his colleague, &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, continued his work. One day, as he was wandering in the Great Dark, Aggramar heard the tranquil dreams of the most powerful world-soul yet discovered: &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. To his horror, he discovered that the planet had already been claimed by the Old Gods, though the defenseless titan within remained as yet untouched. After Aggramar and &lt;a href=\"Eonar\"&gt;Eonar&lt;/a&gt; convinced their brethren to save Azeroth from corruption, the Pantheon crafted the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; to do battle against the Old Gods, before eventually imprisoning them deep beneath the surface of the planet.\nStar Augur Etraeus.\n&lt;a href=\"Star%20Augur%20Etraeus\"&gt;Star Augur Etraeus&lt;/a&gt; showed the &lt;a href=\"Class%20Order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; armies, who led the assault on the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, the monstrosities of the universe. He used his stellar observatory to project desolate regions of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark%20Beyond\"&gt;Great Dark Beyond&lt;/a&gt;, where at least three planets entirely consumed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; could be seen (see the picture above). These are not necessarily planets with world-souls, as the Old Gods were sent to as many worlds as possible in order to find one containing a soul.\nArgus.\nIt's not only the Void who sought the corruption of a world-soul for their own purposes. The Jailer, an entity of Death, also sought the use of a world-soul as a weapon. In this case, though, his intention was to have it disable the Arbiter of the Shadowlands and allow a steady stream of souls to flow into his prison, the Maw. To this end he had his ally Denathrius command his most loyal minions, the nathrezim, to convince Sargeras to corrupt the world-soul Argus with the power of Death. For Sargeras, this offered him greater control over the regenerative abilities of demons killed outside the Nether. But for the Jailer it was just another step in his ages long plan to reforge reality. Ultimately the nathrezim were successful in their task and, upon his death at the hands of mortals, Argus' death corruption prevented him from returning to the Plane of Order and instead sent him into the Shadowlands, where he disabled the Arbiter.\nThe nathrezim, for their part, further planned to convert Argus into an Eternal One to serve under the Jailer forever, but their plot was foiled by the Maw Walker and the covenants.\nOther uses.\nIt was also demonstrated by Zovaal that world-souls have other uses besides creating titans, corrupt or otherwise. They are a source of immense power, with the particularly potent world-soul Azeroth being of greatest interest to others. It was shown that Azeroth, at least, contained enough energy to power the Machine of Origination in Zereth Mortis' Sepulcher of the First Ones. This device of the mysterious First Ones was used in the original ordering of the cosmos after their creation, and Zovaal sought its use in recreating reality to serve his will. Though the plot was foiled by the Maw Walkers, it gives some insight into other potential uses world-souls have."}

They can be obtained by calling the or API functions, or from the tables below. These values can be passed to the and API functions, or used as a locale-independent way to identify zones.\nThis list may require updating from time to time. Please consider adding or correcting data in this list. The simplest way to get the MapID for the zone you are currently in is to enter \"/dump C_Map.GetBestMapForUnit(\"player\")\" into the chat window. Also, beware that -all- MapIDs will change in Battle for Azeroth.\nNote that 'MapID' is a very misleading term. Though often used in the WoW API community (and even in a few regrettable cases by the Blizzard UI Team itself), the correct term is 'WorldMapAreaID' (or for Battle For Azeroth onwards, UIMapID). 'MapID' (sometimes called 'InstanceID' in the API) in the game files is -extensively- used to refer to actual physical levels of the world (i.e. there is a map for Kalimdor, but none for any subzone of it, because Kalimdor is a single entity in the world). There are also two other types of related IDs which you may see in the API: 'AreaTableID' (sometimes called AreaID) and 'DungeonMapID'. Those are both separate entries from 'WorldMapAreaID' and 'MapID'.\nDespite the misleading nature of the term, its widespread adoption means that whenever you hear somebody in the community mention a 'MapID', 99% of the time they will be referring to a 'WorldMapAreaID' (including this page)."}

Additionally, the player becomes &lt;a href=\"The%20True%20Maw%20Walker\"&gt;The True Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, regaining access to all ground mounts in the Maw.\nFocusing the Eye.\nVe'nari has the Maw Walker set up an &lt;a href=\"Animaflow%20Teleporter\"&gt;Animaflow Teleporter&lt;/a&gt; back to &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;her refuge&lt;/a&gt;, then tests out some new items she found. One of them sends the Maw Walker to &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; have holed up. After saving a &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walker and the Val'kyr return to &lt;a href=\"Skyhold\"&gt;Skyhold&lt;/a&gt; and gain the Wrath of Odyn, then use that newfound power to permanently fend off the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;Eye of the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, ending &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Jailer%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;that mechanic&lt;/a&gt; for players.\nThe Last Sigil.\nAt Renown 44 and with the &lt;a href=\"patch%209.0\"&gt;patch 9.0&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Covenant%20Campaign\"&gt;Covenant Campaign&lt;/a&gt; complete:\nRealizing that three of the five &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt;s have been taken by &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tal-Galan\"&gt;Tal-Galan&lt;/a&gt; and a few members of the Necrolord Covenant set out to recover the Sigil of &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;the Primus&lt;/a&gt;. They discover the Primus hid it in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Secrets\"&gt;Vault of Secrets&lt;/a&gt;, which has been besieged by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; forces. Clear a path through, open the way to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Sigil\"&gt;Chamber of the Sigil&lt;/a&gt;, and recover the sigil.\nUpon completion of this chapter, players will be granted the &lt;a href=\"Memories%20of%20Sunless%20Skies\"&gt;Memories of Sunless Skies&lt;/a&gt;, which unlocks flight account-wide in the four level-up zones of &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAn Army of Bone and Steel.\nAt Renown 47:\nThe covenants' hold on &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; is tenuous, so long as &lt;a href=\"Vyraz\"&gt;Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; are next door in &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;, so the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; sends &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; to cut the head off of the snake. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; shows up, and wants to tag along. The party fend off Helsworn forces, summon in the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt;, and defeat Vyraz. The Primus also banishes Helya back to &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Unseen Guests.\nAt Renown 50:\n&lt;a href=\"Vashj\"&gt;Baroness Vashj&lt;/a&gt; attempts to start a quest at &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;, but is quickly revealed as a &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; by the real Vashj! This starts a sequence of events sending the Maw Walker and Vashj to &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt; to ally with &lt;a href=\"The%20Stonewright\"&gt;The Stonewright&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; comes along for the ride. Dreadlords are everywhere, and it's time to clear them out. With the Stonewright pledging her Stone Legion to join Korthia's efforts, Revendreth was free to craft a new sigil.\nThe Power of Night.\nAt Renown 52:\n&lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; reaches out to the player, urgently requesting help for &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;. The power of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; is about to take over, and &lt;a href=\"Huln%20Highmountain\"&gt;Huln Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; has been sent on a hunt to find night warriors in the other realms. He identifies warriors in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, so the Maw Walker has been tasked with collecting them. The party then gathers in the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt; to complete the ritual. With the Heart of the Forest healed, the Winter Queen was able to restore Ardenweald's sigil.\nA New Path.\nAt Renown 56:\nIn an attempt to bring the &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; back into the fold, &lt;a href=\"Thenios\"&gt;Thenios&lt;/a&gt; checks in with &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt;, and hands the Maw Walker an &lt;a href=\"Attuned%20Shard\"&gt;Attuned Shard&lt;/a&gt; to find the other half of &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;'s soul. After recovering the &lt;a href=\"Remnant%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Remnant of Justice&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast, Tower of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; Thenios uses his soul mirror at the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Temple of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; to help Uther work through his memories of becoming a paladin and the purging of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, making &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; a paladin, and reliving his death in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. After that, &lt;a href=\"Polemarch%20Adrestes\"&gt;Polemarch Adrestes&lt;/a&gt;, Uther, and &lt;a href=\"Nikolon\"&gt;Fallen Disciple Nikolon&lt;/a&gt; work to retake the Citadel of Loyalty. For his efforts, Adrestes is promoted to Paragon, and the now-full complement of five paragons plus the Archon create another sigil.\nWhat Lies Ahead.\nAt Renown 58:\nAfter the events of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Sanctum of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall and Jaina return to Keeper's Respite to relay that the Jailer managed to claim the final sigil from the Arbiter and escaped through a portal with Anduin in tow. After Jaina and company uncover a farewell message that Anduin left behind for them, the covenants present their remade sigils to the Primus, who explains that he needs them\u2014along with a replacement for the Arbiter's sigil\u2014in order to follow the Jailer to his destination: the &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;land of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. He tells the Maw Walker that he'll call for them when the key is ready, marking the end of the campaign.\nAlthough this chapter chronologically takes place after the Sanctum of Domination, the player does not need to have completed any part of the raid to access the chapter.\nSide quests.\nOutside of the main campaign, a few side quests are also available.\nArchivists of Korthia.\nAfter \"Charge of the Covenants\", the Maw Walker comes across the &lt;a href=\"Researching%20Korthian%20Relics%20%28item%29\"&gt;Researching Korthian Relics (item)&lt;/a&gt; item, leading them to &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Roh-Suir\"&gt;Scholar Roh-Suir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Seeker%27s%20Quorum\"&gt;Seeker's Quorum&lt;/a&gt;. He is desperately trying to save &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Roh-Senara\"&gt;Archivist Roh-Senara&lt;/a&gt; from the Mawsworn. The attendants ask the Maw Walker to recover the &lt;a href=\"%3ALodestaff\"&gt;:Lodestaff&lt;/a&gt;, a Shadowlands relic. This unlocks the &lt;a href=\"Archivists%27%20Codex\"&gt;Archivists' Codex&lt;/a&gt; reputation faction, and &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Fragment\"&gt;Relic Fragment&lt;/a&gt; drops from rares, treasures, and vignettes in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of the time spent on the quest chain will be grinding out reputation by turning in Relic Fragment-containing items and recovering more artifacts at reputation milestones. Players can expect over a month of gathering relic fragments to reach rank six with the Archivists' Codex.\nThey Could Be Anyone.\nAfter \"Good News, Everyone!\", &lt;a href=\"Pathscribe%20Roh-Vess\"&gt;Pathscribe Roh-Vess&lt;/a&gt; asks the Maw Walker to locate &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Kalo\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Kalo&lt;/a&gt;, who has not been seen since the Jailer's attack on Korthia. Alongside the attendant &lt;a href=\"Caretaker%20Kah-Than\"&gt;Caretaker Kah-Than&lt;/a&gt;, the Maw Walker retraces Roh-Kalo's last steps.\nTazavesh, the Veiled Market.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Idyllia\"&gt;Idyllia&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, the innkeeper has a message for the Maw Walker, starting a questline to unlock the megadungeon &lt;a href=\"Tazavesh%2C%20the%20Veiled%20Market\"&gt;Tazavesh, the Veiled Market&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Box of Many Things.\nAfter unlocking a foothold in Korthia, a short quest line unlocks &lt;a href=\"The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things\"&gt;The Box of Many Things&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as a significant boost to the player's power in &lt;a href=\"Torghast%2C%20Tower%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Torghast&lt;/a&gt;. It also grants &lt;a href=\"The%20Box%20of%20Many%20Things%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;The Box of Many Things (achievement)&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nMaw events.\nCovenant assaults.\nAfter completing \"Good News, Everyone!\", covenant assaults unlock. Twice a week, one of the four covenants will take charge on an assault of one of the hubs in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;:\nThe assaults are a great source of reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Advance\"&gt;Death's Advance&lt;/a&gt; and the covenant factions taking part in the assault, and have a number of achievements associated with them, including:\nAdditionally, assaults will award an &lt;a href=\"Emblem%20of%20Renown\"&gt;Emblem of Renown&lt;/a&gt; for players who are catching up.\nTormentors of Torghast.\nEvery two hours, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; sends out one of the &lt;a href=\"Tormentors%20of%20Torghast\"&gt;Tormentors of Torghast&lt;/a&gt; to attack an area in the Maw. Take out the minions and lieutenants to fill the bar, then defeat the Tormentor of Torghast for 10% progress in &lt;a href=\"Shaping%20Fate\"&gt;Shaping Fate&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Tormentor%27s%20Cache\"&gt;Tormentor's Cache&lt;/a&gt;, and likely an item drop or two.\nOnce a week, players can complete the &lt;a href=\"Phantasmagoria\"&gt;Phantasmagoria&lt;/a&gt; quest, which starts from the &lt;a href=\"Warped%20Phantasma\"&gt;Warped Phantasma&lt;/a&gt; found inside the Tormentor's Cache.\nDefeat all of the bosses to earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"Minions%20of%20the%20Cold%20Dark\"&gt;Minions of the Cold Dark&lt;/a&gt;.\nKorthia dailies.\nAfter completing \"Good News, Everyone!\", four or five daily quests open up in &lt;a href=\"Keeper%27s%20Respite\"&gt;Keeper's Respite&lt;/a&gt; each day:\nAdditionally, a weekly elite &lt;a href=\"world%20quest\"&gt;world quest&lt;/a&gt; appears in &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; after completing chapter five of the campaign:"}

During the &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;battle&lt;/a&gt; against him in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, he can use an ability called Chains of Kel'Thuzad. This ability dominates the target's mind, charming them for 20 seconds. In addition, the target's damage is increased by 200% and their healing is increased by 500%.\nIn the RPG.\nThe chains of Kel'Thuzad are a specially crafted set of seven magical spiked chains, given to him by &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;. The owner must wrap this artifact around his body to activate it, at which point the chains animate and move lazily to and fro in the air when not being commanded. Each chain has a slightly different power. The chains only function as a set; a chain separated from the set causes all chains to cease functioning until restored. \nThree of the chains are animated to attack on their own. Once a chain has been commanded to attack a target, it continues to attack that target whenever possible. If the target is not in reach, then the chain attacks a random creature. The wearer is free to perform other actions while the chains continue attacking. Two more chains are animated to grapple and constrict foes. One chain wraps itself around the vital parts of the wearer, as appropriate, and provides defensive benefits. One chain wraps around the wearer's waist and drags on the ground, granting levitation as long as it remains in contact with the ground. It is ultimately 20 feet long, but only drags a few feet of chain unless commanded otherwise. This means the wearer continually hovers a foot or so above the ground, but upon command can levitate as high as 20 feet.\nIf the wearer would fall into a pit or be forcibly moved, the chains automatically reach out to grab on to anything they can and help prevent the wearer from being moved."}

The vineyard specializes nearly exclusively in the creation of arcwine, an alcoholic beverage imbued with the energies of the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, and consumed by the entire nightborne population in order to satisfy their addiction to magic. As such, the facility's importance to the city is exceptional, for if a nightborne is starved of the energies provided by the arcwine, they will &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; away and begin to lose their very minds.\nThe vineyards are responsible for the entire process of arcwine production, from the cultivation of the fruits involved to the fermentation of the ingredients to produce the actual alcoholic beverage. The Twilight Vineyards are thus highly extensive in the facilities available on site and employ a very large number of laborers and other specialists to ensure a constant output.\nIn total, the vineyards housed two primary orchards; the eastern one provided the majority of the fruit for arcwine production, while the westernmost orchard produced an extra sweet fruit to make for a sweeter vintage.\nControl of the Twilight Vineyards inevitably bestow immense power; this was used to great extent at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; by Suramar's ruler, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, in order to keep many of her subjects in line. The intentional rationing of the arcwine produced by the vineyards subsequently led to great suffering among the city's less affluent districts. At the outset of the civil war, the facility was managed by the vintner &lt;a href=\"Margaux\"&gt;Margaux&lt;/a&gt;, and monitored closely by the Grand Magistrix through &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Durant\"&gt;Overseer Durant&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nArcwine addiction.\nWhen the city of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; was shut off from the world under an arcane shield during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, the power provided for this massive barrier came from the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt;, a font of incredible energy created using the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;. During their 10,000 year-long period of isolation, the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; were sustained by the Nightwell, which provided for their entire civilization and allowed it to flourish. This power would come with a price, however. The nightborne dependence on the Nightwell quickly became an addiction, and just as its power could nourish and sustain their people, so too could being cut off from its power cause them to &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; and descend into insanity.\nIn order to deliver the energies of the Nightwell to each of Suramar's multitude of citizens, a method was discovered to imbue this magical power into a simple alcoholic beverage, which would become known as &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, many variations of arcwine were developed, dependent upon the ingredients used in production, though almost all are based upon manafruit and/or shadowberries. The fruits used in the creation of arcwine are all grown on site, with numerous orchards located around the vineyard.\nThe picked fruit is then processed in the juicing veranda, where certain ingredients are added as the fruit itself is crushed in a large vat (often by physical force, such as by foot). The juice is then extracted from the vat for the next step.\nThough the time required for the juice to ferment would ordinarily be a major obstacle in the way of mass-producing such a product, nightborne vintners are able to bypass this. The Aging Chamber located in the vineyard has been altered using powerful time magic to rapidly speed up the passing of time for everything within it. Thus, casks of would-be-arcwine may be placed within the chamber to drastically shorten the time required for fermentation to fully occur.\nThe most important step involves actually imbuing the wine with the Nightwell's power, thereby allowing it to properly feed the addiction of the shal'dorei. An energy vessel was traditionally used to catch delicate falling dewdrops of the energy from the Nightwell (this method allows the catcher to safely manage the essence). The contents of the vessel are then simply poured a cask of unfortified wine, which then is officially termed \"arcwine\". The amount of times the beverage is actually distilled with Nightwell essence has a direct impact on its strength.\nFinally, the liquid was sent to the vineyard's bottling facilities, where each bottle is sealed using magic to ensure none of the Nightwell's essence imbued in the arcwine fades, allowing it to last for hundreds of years. At this point, the arcwine is either placed in storage or exported to another part of the city. Additional ingredients were frequently added during production to give specific flavors to the vintage, and have been known to include: walnuts, melon, nightsap, shadefruit, silver jasmine, various berry types, honey, and nectar. This highlights the fact that while the primary use of arcwine was to satiate the nightborne addiction to magic, it also served as a valued recreational drink, in the same way ordinary wine would be.\nThough the arcwine produced in the Twilight Vineyards was historically available to virtually all members of nightborne society in some form or another (save those exiled from the city) the most arcwine, as well as that of the finest quality, could only be procured by the rich nobility.\nRebellion.\nThe Twilight Vineyards successfully kept the people of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; supplied with &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt; for thousands of years during the millennia-long isolation of the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; from the world. At the time the city's arcane shield was lowered, the vintner known as &lt;a href=\"Margaux\"&gt;Margaux&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of overseeing the vineyard's continued productivity.\nShortly afterward, the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; would erupt within nightborne society, with an &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;insurgent faction&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; seeking to overthrow the regime of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and expel the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from Suramar. In response to the unrest, Elisande and her allies adopted the tactic of arcwine rationing, hoping to keep the citizenry obedient. As part of this, the Twilight Vineyards were placed under intense security, with access restricted to specially-approved persons.\nWithin the vineyards themselves, &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; security treated the facility's workers with notorious cruelty, often abusing them physically if they wavered at all in their grueling labor. Shipments of arcwine coming from the vineyards were heavily guarded, though the flow of product to the Noble District and the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; were not rationed. The artificial shortage of arcwine in Suramar's western districts, where the poorer citizens resided, caused great suffering, though many were saved thanks to the intervention of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen resistance&lt;/a&gt; who distributed stolen arcwine freely.\nIn the rebel base of &lt;a href=\"Shal%27Aran\"&gt;Shal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; outside the city, the Nightfallen had carefully been cultivating the growing power of an &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; tree. This tree, however, had recently become endangered by a type of insect. To counteract this, the rebel leaders decided to acquire &lt;a href=\"Shadescale%20Flyeater\"&gt;shadescale flyeaters&lt;/a&gt;, native to the Twilight Vineyards, where they were used to keep the orchards pest-free. With the aid of &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lady Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, Nightfallen agents prepared to infiltrate the vineyards in disguise to procure some of the creatures.\nThe rebels made contact with the vineyard production manager, &lt;a href=\"Margaux\"&gt;Margaux&lt;/a&gt;, who remained secretly sympathetic to the Nightfallen cause. The disguised agents were subsequently able to get past the facility's security, acting under the pretense of touring the plantation. After the 'tour' was completed, a rebel agent discreetly took possession of several of the flyeaters and prepared to return to Shal'Aran. Before this could come to pass, however, &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Durant\"&gt;Overseer Durant&lt;/a&gt; with guards abruptly arrived at the vineyard and confronted Margaux. Accusing her of treason, Durant had the vintner summarily executed on the spot by order of the Grand Magistrix.\nThe overseer then released the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; on the vineyard to fully secure the location. After slaying many of the Duskwatch, The Nightfallen operative made it back to Shal'Aran with the creatures they were dispatched for. The rebels were outraged by the sudden murder of Margaux, and would set out to exact vengeance. Eventually, they would succeed in assassinating her killer, Overseer Durant.\nEven after Margaux's death, the Nightfallen rebels remained active within the Twilight Vineyards, mainly through &lt;a href=\"Sylverin\"&gt;Sylverin&lt;/a&gt;, apprentice to Margaux. They periodically had to procure more &lt;a href=\"Shadescale%20Flyeater\"&gt;shadescale flyeaters&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; and also helped keep the infestation of &lt;a href=\"Tattered%20Silkwing\"&gt;tattered silkwings&lt;/a&gt; under control. Rebels secretly even personally helped with the production of arcwine; if the vineyard's production quotas were not met, it would be the ordinary citizens who would suffer most.\nA daily shipment was dispatched from the vineyard under heavy guard to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; for the Grand Magistrix herself. On one occasion, Nightfallen rebels ambushed the convoy led by &lt;a href=\"Spellsinger%20Quiris\"&gt;Spellsinger Quiris&lt;/a&gt; just as it was leaving the vineyards and seized the high quality &lt;a href=\"arcwine\"&gt;arcwine&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the vineyards were left relatively unaffected when the Nightfallen and their allies eventually marched on the city, the insurgents did raid the facility for food and water supplies in preparation for the invasion.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the death of the Nightwell and the nightborne joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, arcwine continues to be produced in the Twilight Vineyards under &lt;a href=\"Vintner%20Iltheux\"&gt;Vintner Iltheux&lt;/a&gt;'s oversight, with the nightborne now apparently exporting the wine to other Horde races. Shortly after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; sent assistants\u2014&lt;a href=\"Micah%20Broadhoof\"&gt;Micah Broadhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kazit\"&gt;Kazit&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nomi\"&gt;Nomi&lt;/a&gt;\u2014to the the vineyards in order to speed up the process. However, this ended up having the opposite effect since Iltheux assigned the workers to roles they were completely unsuited for. In the hopes of allowing the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; to join the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the vineyards and reassigned the workers to new roles, allowing them to resume production and create a new vintage that Iltheux approved of."}

Using ancient dragon artifacts and the powers of the &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, Sintharia created a new breed of dragons that feed vampirically on all forms of mystical energy. The first encounter of these dragons with the outside world was by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalec&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;ess &lt;a href=\"Iridi\"&gt;Iridi&lt;/a&gt;. Iridi thought of their appearance not as a shadow, but more akin to the day turning to night, like twilight as experienced on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. She thus dubbed them twilight dragons.\nWhile Sintharia's experiments resulted in very &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;unstable&lt;/a&gt; twilight drakes, and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian's&lt;/a&gt; experiments resulted in infertile or deformed &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragons&lt;/a&gt;, their efforts paved the way for &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; to perfect the process of breeding and artificially aging twilight dragons. These draconic aberrations were first seen in-game in ', and became major antagonists in '.\nThe twilight dragonflight was thought nearly extinct, most being killed in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20Deathwing\"&gt;war against Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, it was discovered that the twilight dragonflight survived, with a mature drake named &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt; leading them. While Zeryxia was later killed, more twilight dragons were discovered within &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and elsewhere, as &lt;a href=\"stone%20trogg\"&gt;stone trogg&lt;/a&gt;s unearthed deeper caverns wherein thousands more eggs had been laid.\nTypes.\nThe twilight dragonflight includes the twilight dragons themselves as well as all other twilight dragonkin such as dragonspawn and drakonids.\nHistory.\nNight of the Dragon.\nThe twilight dragonflight was first created by &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, the prime-consort of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, who had been secretly manipulated to do so by the dark aspect. Eager to succeed where her hated mate had failed and create a new breed of dragon that would rule the world, Sintharia used a &lt;a href=\"nether%20dragon\"&gt;nether dragon&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Zzeraku\"&gt;Zzeraku&lt;/a&gt;, which she captured with a &lt;a href=\"chrysalun%20chamber\"&gt;chrysalun chamber&lt;/a&gt;, together with two draconic artifacts, to alter several dragon eggs from various &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. The artifacts were an ancient &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragon\"&gt;blue dragon&lt;/a&gt; relic known as &lt;a href=\"Balacgos%27s%20Bane\"&gt;Balacgos's Bane&lt;/a&gt;, and shards of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Thought destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, Sintharia gathered several fragments of the Demon Soul and used the power within them to carry out her designs.\nSintharia's earliest creations proved unstable and were destroyed by Krasus and Kalec. However, they still displayed considerable power, having the ability to vampirically drain magical energy from any source. Sintharia's subsequent creation, &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt;, proved even more powerful and far more cunning. Dargonax proved too ambitious and strong for Sintharia to completely control, even with fragments of the Demon Soul in her possession. Only the sacrifice of the nether dragon Zzeraku enabled Dargonax to be defeated, and in his death throes he seemingly destroyed Sintharia as well.\nAlthough Sintharia and her creations were all slain, several of her unhatched twilight dragon eggs were taken from her lair in Grim Batol by Deathwing himself. Hiding in tunnels deep beneath Grim Batol, caverns older than any the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; had ever constructed, Deathwing had whispered his urgings to the unsuspecting former consort, making her believe that everything was according to her own designs. Even the name \"twilight dragonflight\" had been suggested to her by Deathwing, who actually got the idea from his Old God masters. He safely stored the twilight dragon eggs and began his plans to perfect the new dragonflight, intending to erase the failures of his family and use the newest breed of dragon for his own designs.\nBeneath Wyrmrest Temple.\nObsidian Sanctum.\nDeathwing's continued absence led many to assume that Sintharia had been acting alone at Grim Batol, and that all her eggs had been destroyed. However, during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt; a clutch of twilight eggs was discovered within the black dragonflight's volcanic chamber, the &lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Sanctum\"&gt;Obsidian Sanctum&lt;/a&gt;, protected by the black dragon &lt;a href=\"Sartharion\"&gt;Sartharion&lt;/a&gt;. With the red dragonflight already committed heavily to battling &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; sent word of the twilight eggs to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; in the hope that adventurers could be found to deal with the situation. As he had hoped, a band of heroes was deployed in short order. After reaching the Sanctum, they had to fight not only Sartharion but also three twilight drakes: , , and . They were able to vanquish all the guardians, and the twilight eggs were destroyed. The incident went without fanfare, mention, or acknowledgment; and for a time, seemingly without retribution.\nRuby Sanctum.\nIn order to shatter the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Accord\"&gt;Wyrmrest Accord&lt;/a&gt; and to crush those that would stand in the way of their &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;master&lt;/a&gt;'s reemergence into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful war party of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;Black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, led by the fearsome twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt; and his lieutenants &lt;a href=\"Saviana%20Ragefire\"&gt;Saviana Ragefire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baltharus%20the%20Warborn\"&gt;Baltharus the Warborn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Zarithrian\"&gt;General Zarithrian&lt;/a&gt;, launched an assault upon the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Sanctum\"&gt;Ruby Sanctum&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. A survivor of the initial attack, &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Guardian%20Xerestrasza\"&gt;Sanctum Guardian Xerestrasza&lt;/a&gt; believed the true focus of their interest seemed to be the eggs kept there in the Sanctum. However, the heroes stopped them before they were allowed to succeed.\nCataclysm.\nThe story of the twilight dragonflight is expanded in \"\", in the region known as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, east of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. They appear as an elite guard within &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt;'s ranks and their drakes are used as mounts by their mortal followers.\nTwilight dragons are usually raised from stolen eggs from other dragonflights, which are then modified through dark magic. However, &lt;a href=\"Pure%20Twilight%20Egg\"&gt;a \"natural\" egg&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; revealed that one of their matriarchs, &lt;a href=\"Desperiona\"&gt;Desperiona&lt;/a&gt;, has become a viable broodmother.\nIt is further revealed that more dragons of the Twilight Brood were being created by a reanimated &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Caverns\"&gt;Twilight Caverns&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Bastion%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Bastion of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. After being slain, Sintharia says: \"Deathwing, I have fallen, the brood has fallen\".\nAt some point, twilight dragons led by &lt;a href=\"Thyrinar\"&gt;Thyrinar&lt;/a&gt; attacked the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Coldarra\"&gt;Coldarra&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons were defeated, and a vision of &lt;a href=\"Arygos\"&gt;Arygos&lt;/a&gt;' betrayal was shown.\nDuring the events of &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Soul\"&gt;the Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;, the twilight dragonflight appears to be nearly extinct. Though once vast in number, only a few dozen twilight dragons now remain. Astride these hardened survivors are the last vestiges of the Twilight's Hammer's army: the elite drake riders of Deathwing's personal escort. Led by the insidious &lt;a href=\"Warmaster%20Blackhorn\"&gt;Warmaster Blackhorn&lt;/a&gt;, they move with unholy purpose, driven to protect their dark master. Though adventurers seemingly brought down these last vestiges of the flight while pursuing Deathwing, and Blackhorn was slain, it's perhaps notable that his mount, &lt;a href=\"Goriona\"&gt;Goriona&lt;/a&gt;, escaped.\nHeroes who proved their might in the gladiatorial arenas during the Cataclysm were awarded the most &lt;a href=\"Arena%20mounts%23Twilight%20drakes\"&gt;exceptional&lt;/a&gt; of the twilight drake broods.\nLegion.\nThe remnants of the twilight dragonflight rejoined the Twilight's Hammer in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Depths\"&gt;Twilight Depths&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;. They were led by the dragon &lt;a href=\"Zeryxia\"&gt;Zeryxia&lt;/a&gt;, who answered to &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;'s whispers from beyond the grave. Zeryxia had stored a huge cache of Twilight dragon eggs in the tunnels, which were also filled with young whelps and drakes. However, they were defeated by an attack led by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Farseer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muln%20Earthfury\"&gt;Muln Earthfury&lt;/a&gt;, where Zeryxia was killed.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, numerous twilight dragons, drakes, and dragonkin can appear on &lt;a href=\"Island%20Expedition\"&gt;Island Expedition&lt;/a&gt;s, apparently drawn by the &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; being mined by the Horde and Alliance. An &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; can bring a &lt;a href=\"Battered%20Twilight%20Scale\"&gt;Battered Twilight Scale&lt;/a&gt; to an agent of the red dragonflight, &lt;a href=\"Eryna\"&gt;Eryna&lt;/a&gt;, who reveals that the &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s dug too deep and disturbed a previously-unknown massive cache of twilight dragon eggs below &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. Eryna claims that she can sense thousands of heartbeats below Grim Batol, but she has no idea how many are truly down there, or where other caches might exist. She also saw them coming out of the citadel, being mobilized by someone.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Vermillion%20Redoubt\"&gt;Vermillion Redoubt&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, Void-twisted twilight dragonkin have surrounded &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, but a champion and &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; arrived and helped subdue the invaders. A twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt; is confronted in front of Grim Batol who before fleeing states \"Your pathetic dragonflights will fall. If you will not serve the master, then I will find one who will\". &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Whelpling\"&gt;Twilight Whelpling&lt;/a&gt;s re-emerged outside of Grim Batol.\nVisions of N'Zoth.\nVexiona, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Velinaria\"&gt;Velinaria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreliana\"&gt;Dreliana&lt;/a&gt;, leads a band of &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper\"&gt;Darkwhisper&lt;/a&gt; cultists in an assault on &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to lure in and capture &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, with the hopes of using his essence in a ritual to raise &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; as servants of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;. Not all Twilight Drakes seem to hold their master's favor, as when &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; descended into Blackwing Descent, he found a &lt;a href=\"Failed%20Experiment%20%28Blackwing%20Descent%29\"&gt;drake&lt;/a&gt;, nearly dead from maiming by the Old Gods' forces by their experiments to augment them. This drake later aided the group against their former masters, going as far as to ferry the bearer of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Azeroth\"&gt;Heart of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; back to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Heart\"&gt;Chamber of the Heart&lt;/a&gt; after they had destroyed the remains of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt; and forced Vexiona and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Inquisitor%20Xanesh\"&gt;Dark Inquisitor Xanesh&lt;/a&gt; to retreat to &lt;a href=\"Ny%27alotha\"&gt;Ny'alotha&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe twilight dragonflight has had a fractured past and now has an uncertain future. Vexiona's clutch of eggs was kept in a chamber inside the &lt;a href=\"Carapace%20of%20N%27Zoth\"&gt;Carapace of N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, exposing them to N'Zoth's corruption from a young age and driving them even more mad than other twilight dragons. After N'Zoth's defeat, one of them had their mind cleared by &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;.\nDescription.\nTwilight dragons resemble black dragons, but they glow with a greenish, red, or, more commonly, amethyst light. The earliest twilight dragons created by Sintharia had the ability to feed off of magical energy, particularly enemy dragons. The later dragons, those raised by Deathwing, may have similar abilities.\nTwilight dragons also possess the ability to turn incorporeal at will, allowing attacks to pass through their bodies without harming them, though they cannot remain incorporeal indefinitely. This incorporeality is caused by them shifting into another plane known as the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Realm\"&gt;Twilight Realm&lt;/a&gt;. Strong twilight dragons such as &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Halion\"&gt;Halion&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valiona%20and%20Theralion\"&gt;Valiona and Theralion&lt;/a&gt; are also able to pull other people into the Twilight Realm with them."}

(Some individuals conjecture that these are the stumps of what were once trees that have since eroded and become indiscernible from the surrounding rock and dirt)\nThe two mesas are one of the most striking landmarks of the area and inspire awe in whoever beholds them.\n&lt;a href=\"Gregan%20Brewspewer\"&gt;Gregan Brewspewer&lt;/a&gt; witnessed a giant &lt;a href=\"makura\"&gt;makura&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Diamond%20Head\"&gt;Diamond Head&lt;/a&gt; claw its way up the top of the eastern mountain. He can now be found there in a small but deep pond.\nBefore the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the eastern colossal was accessible by the quest &lt;a href=\"To%20the%20Top\"&gt;To the Top&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Marli%20Wishrunner\"&gt;Marli Wishrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who still resides at the base of the western colossal. Both mountains are only accessible by asking an NPC in the respective Alliance and Horde camps near the bottom of each mountains for a teleport up to the top or with a flying mount.\nAt the top, there is a good view of the surrounding area, a small lake where one can fish, and a night elf male, &lt;a href=\"Kalin%20Windflight\"&gt;Kalin Windflight&lt;/a&gt;, who sells &lt;a href=\"Colossal%20Parachute\"&gt;Colossal Parachute&lt;/a&gt; which enables the player to safely leave the mountain for 20 silver each.\nSubzone.\nA massive subzone is named after the twin mountains in the area. It contains most of northwestern Feralas, extending out to the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Coast\"&gt;Forgotten Coast&lt;/a&gt;.\nWithin the area, a night elf &lt;a href=\"moonwell\"&gt;moonwell&lt;/a&gt; that has been corrupted (likely by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;) sits northwest of &lt;a href=\"Rage%20Scar%20Hold\"&gt;Rage Scar Hold&lt;/a&gt;. A rare &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mordei%20the%20Earthrender\"&gt;Mordei the Earthrender&lt;/a&gt;, patrols around it. To the far west, the once hostile &lt;a href=\"Cliff%20Giant\"&gt;Cliff Giant&lt;/a&gt;s, now friendly, fight &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Cliff%20Giant\"&gt;Corrupted Cliff Giant&lt;/a&gt;s."}

Tank the Twins together and just dps them down, burning through their self heals. Any casters can be assigned to dealing with the bugs. A caster tank is recommended, but not necessary. Shadow bolts hit for approx. 5-6k. And on a 25k+ player it is easily healable. An alternate strategy, and one I have not personally tested, is if your group is caster heavy, you will need a rogue who has wound poison attempting to keep the poison (which deals nature damage) on the caster Emperor. Once either of the Emperors die, one of two things will happen.\n1: The opposite Emperor also dies.\n2: The opposite Emperor is reduced to &lt;10% health. And with no healing, it is very easy to finish him off.\nTo make any headway in this setup, your raid needs more than 15,000 DPS.\nNotes.\nThings everyone needs to constantly watch out for:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Determined to safeguard his reign, &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; keeps his loyalists close and their combined arsenal against interlopers closer.\"\nEncounter Design.\n\"Players may have noticed the complete absence of any female mogu in their exploration of the continent of Pandaria. Players who look closely at the models of these celestial twins will note that they seem quite literally carved out of stone. Indeed, these were specifically created by Lei Shen and empowered to serve and guard him, and they are a direct reflection of his will rather than any broader sense of mogu culture as a whole. An earlier version of the concept for the fight had them actually being spirits of the Sun and Moon, but that didn\u2019t feel quite right (and we all know that the only true spirit of the Moon is &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and clearly she was not locked away by the Thunder King).\"\nSpells and abilities.\nDarkness Falls: Lu'lin's Luminosity.\nAs night falls upon the Twin Empyreans' chamber, Lu'lin is empowered and fully active, while Suen plays a more limited role.\nBlazing Daylight: Suen's Fury.\nAs Day breaks within the Twin Empyreans' chamber, Suen is empowered and fully active, while Lu'lin plays a more limited role.\nBreak of Dusk: The Dance of the Empyreans.\nDuring the Dusk, both Twins are active, each retaining some of their abilities, and gaining the following new abilities.\nLu'lin, Mistress of Solitude.\nIf Lu'lin perishes, Dusk ends and Day begins anew, fully empowering Suen. During Day, Suen once again burns brightly with Blazing Radiance.\nSuen, Mistress of Solitude.\nIf Suen perishes, Dusk ends and Night begins anew, fully empowering Lu'lin. During Night, Moon Lotuses once again bloom, and Beasts of Nightmares once again spawn.\nCelestial Aid.\nA player may choose to invoke the spirit of any Celestial by selecting his or her faded image. Upon doing so, the player must trace that Celestial's constellation. Upon completion, the Celestial appears and gives aid to the players:\nStrategy.\nThere are four phases corresponding to the active bosses (Lu'lin, Suen, both, and then whichever is left). For the DPS and tanks it's mostly tank and spank with minor environmental awareness, though ranged players will want to spread out and healers will be under pressure from raid damage at times. The twist is the optional use of Celestials to aid the raid.\nAll phases: The Celestials' Blessings.\nThe 4 Celestials appear as faded images atop statues around the room. Each can be used twice, since they are reset at the Break of Dusk (phase 3). Each provides a specific bonus for the raid - Xuen's Celerity (allows hyper-quick projectile dodging) is most helpful against falling stars in Phase 1; Yu'lon's Vitality (HoT &amp; MoT) and Niuzao's Fortitude (health boost) help survive Suen in Phase 2, and Chi-Ji (damage blast) can be used in any phase (although Suen is usually considered more dangerous, so Phase 2 is recommended). All are useful in phase 3. Only one may be active at a time and lasts up to 30 seconds, so plan out usage across each phase.\nTo activate a statue, a single player (typically a ranged damage dealer, ideally one with a speed boost) interacts with it, and will be phased to a parallel universe that is empty except for a set of 7 stars in the center of the room, arranged in a hexagon-and-center pattern. One star will be highlighted with white light, and the player must trace the correct constellation starting from there by running from star to star - the required pattern will appear above the player's head. Once a correct constellation segment is traced, a starbeam will connect the two points; an incorrect star will flash red when entered. A failed tracing can be re-attempted as often as desired, though the raid will obviously lose that player's contributions during that time.\nUse of the Celestials is helpful but completely optional.\nPhase 1: Darkness Falls.\nLu'lin, the blue/dark empyrean, will be active in the first phase. Tanks will need to deal with an unusual swap mechanic: the current tank will be fixated upon by a summoned Beast of Nightmares, which will need to be killed by the tank and only the tank - the raid can't attack it. Heals upon the tank fighting his Nightmares will corrupt the healer with a stacking DoT, so the other tank must taunt the boss off immediately, the Nightmare tank should use cooldowns to reduce healing pressure (and kill the add quickly), and healers should restrict themselves to a few big heals on that tank.\nThe raid's primary responsibility is to not get put to sleep by the increasing numbers of Slumber Spores, green clouds drifting slowly in straight lines, released by Moon Lotuses. The sleep should be dispelled if it does hit. The raid should also spread to avoid splash damage from the Light of Day and primarily Cosmic Barrage, stars that will crash down upon 4 or 8 random players at the end of the cast. Optionally, a raid member may also use Xuen's Celerity to put the raid into hyperspeed and allow it to dodge the stars entirely. Suen will appear periodically during this phase to deal unavoidable raid damage. While she is channeling Tears of the Sun, she is attackable, so raid members may make use of multi-DoTs and cleaves.\nHighly geared damage dealers should avoid killing Lu'lin unless they and their healers are \"very\" high geared indeed, since that would skip straight to phase 4 with Suen still at 100%. Otherwise, after about 3 minutes, the sun rises with Suen.\n\"Summary:\" Dodge clouds, spread out, taunt boss of Nightmare tanks, use few/big heals on Nightmare tanks, don't kill the boss. Use Xuen to dodge stars.\nPhase 2: Blazing Daylight.\nSuen, the red/fiery empyrean, ceases to be shrouded by shadows in this phase, while Lu'lin veils herself in darkness and becomes unattackable. Sleep Spore clouds burn away, and Suen will begin emitting increasing amounts of raid-wide damage. This damage must be reduced by pulling Suen near an Icy Comet, blue objects cast on players by Lu'lin (unless Lu'lin is dead, in which case the raid must burn down Suen before the damage overwhelms the healers). The Comet cannot be attacked, but will melt as it brings Suen's damage stacks down, so the process must be repeated with new Comets. Comets also create Icy Shadows that protect the raid from significant Fire damage, but reduce action speed by 75% (in normal mode). Tanks \"may\" stand in the Shadows if their threat is secure; otherwise only dying players should stand there.\nSuen will periodically charge a raider with Flames of Passion, and leave a fire trail while returning to the tank. If Suen charged through the melee group, the tank may step sideways so the return trip does not leave fire underneath them. The raid should again spread somewhat to avoid splash damage from Ice Comets, Light of Day, and Flames of Passion, though not too far, to reduce the length of fire trails and travel distance to Ice Comets. The tanks must swap due to a standard stacking debuff, at about 2 stacks. Healers should top off the raid when a new Comet is incoming. Optionally, raiders may activate Yu'lon's and Niuzao's blessings to improve survivability, and Chi'Ji's Rush of Cranes for a faster kill. If Suen is not dead, Dusk will fall after about 3 minutes.\n\"Summary:\" Fight boss near Comets, don't stand in Shadows, don't stand in fire, spread out, and swap tanks. Use the remaining Celestials.\nPhase 3: Break of Dusk.\nAt Dusk both bosses will be active. They should be tanked somewhat apart from each other; tank swap mechanics will not be used. Lu'lin gains an additional ability: Tidal Force, which fires very fast waves of damaging water in random directions. Ranged players may want to roughly distribute themselves around Lu'lin, while the Suen tank forms a right angle between the two bosses to avoid getting themselves and the melee group Tidal Waved at the same time. Like the stars, these waves are undodgeable unless Xuen has sped up the players' reflexes. Lu'lin is also unhittable while channeling this ability. Both bosses will use all their previous abilities except for the tank swaps and sleep clouds, so spreading out is crucial, as is pulling Suen to Ice Comets. One boss should be chosen to focus down (see Phase 4), ending Dusk with either's death.\nCelestial blessings are reset at the start of the phase, and all are useful but optional. Chi-Ji will hit both bosses and speed the phase transition, Niuzao and Yu'lon once again aid survivability, and Xuen's \"speed boost\" is helpful against stars, waves and comets.\n\"Summary:\" Tank bosses with medium separation, pull Suen to comets, don't stand in shadows, don't stand in fire, spread out. Burn Suen. Use all Celestials, including Xuen to dodge waves stars and comets.\nPhase 4: Night Falls Again / Dusk Changes Its Mind.\nThis phase begins as soon as there is only one boss alive - if either boss is killed in phase 1 or 2, Dusk will be skipped and this phase will begin immediately. It is nearly identical to one of the first two phases, depending which boss is left alive:\nHeroic mode.\nDuring the night phase, Lu'lin will summon Lurkers in the Night that cannot be seen or targeted by players normally (you can, however, spot their location if you watch for where the darkness bolts are coming from) and will regularly deal damage to the raid. The tank who is NOT tanking the boss should taunt Suen while she is casting Tears of the Sun and kite her around the room to reveal and kill the adds so the raid is not overwhelmed by them. The adds, after being revealed, just have a normal threat table and melee their targets. Xuen's buff should be used on this phase to allow the raid to dodge the Cosmic Barrage, as a combo of Cosmic Barrage along with the Lurkers' darkness bolts can easily kill players not topped off.\nThe Sun Phase plays exactly the same as Normal; the only difference is that every 30 seconds Suen will cast Nuclear Inferno, and the raid needs to stack behind an Ice Comet to take reduced damage from it. Tanks should also should make sure to keep one Comet alive and unused to allow the raid to mitigate the Inferno damage during the whole cast. You should use Nuizao and Yu'lon's buffs during the final Nuclear Inferno casts to restore mana and give some breath to the healers.\nThe Break of Dusk plays the same way as normal mode, and you will want to use &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Time%20Warp\"&gt;Time Warp&lt;/a&gt; and Chi-Ji's buff to kill Suen fast while doing as much damage as possible to Lu'lin, as well as Xuen's buff to allow the raid to dodge the Tidal Force waves.\nThe final phase plays very much the same as Normal mode, but your raid will not have Suen to reveal the Lurkers that will keep spawning, and raid damage will get increasingly high as the phase proceeds. Your raid will need to finish off Lu'lin before it becomes overwhelmed.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

As a 10 vs 10 capture-the-flag battleground, the first faction to capture three flags is victorious. Lend your strength as both factions struggle to take control of this critical high ground!\"\nOverview.\nLocated within the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Highlands\"&gt;Twilight Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Twin Peaks remains a crucial point of high ground for staging effective and debilitating attacks against the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, who dominate this foreboding environment. And now, two previous occupants of the nearby city of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; vie once again for control of the peaks' defenses. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, architects and original owners of the once-great fortress city, maintains some operations in forested outposts of the highlands. The Wildhammers now call upon heroes of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; to help claim the peaks and fend off the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw\"&gt;Dragonmaw&lt;/a&gt; orcs. The Dragonmaw clan, having spent years working to enslave &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, once again provides strategic importance to the Horde. As the Dragonmaw and Wildhammers fight for territory they once called home, the Alliance and Horde carry out the struggle to control the Twin Peaks.\nCapture the Flag.\nTwin Peaks is a new 10 vs. 10, &lt;a href=\"capture%20the%20flag\"&gt;capture the flag&lt;/a&gt;-style battleground. Much like in &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, players must work to dominate variable terrain, infiltrate the enemy base, and steal the enemy flag, returning it to their fortress while remaining in control of their own flag. The first faction to capture three enemy flags before time expires will win the battle. If the game ends in a tie, the team that capped the last flag will win. If neither side caps a flag, the game will end in a draw, equal to a loss for both sides.\nThe Battle.\nThose who seek to control Twin Peaks will face an intense battle. The lands surrounding this ever-troubled location are key strategic strongholds of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and all of his followers. The Twilight Highlands are as rich with history as they are fraught with disaster and tragedy. Will the Dragonmaw clan, reinforced by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s Horde, take control? Or will it be the Wildhammer dwarves, reunited with their &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; brethren and accepted into the Alliance, who seize the peaks?\nDominating the Terrain.\nAlthough the Wildhammer and Dragonmaw bases are virtually identical, the terrain surrounding each base is not. Players will need to work to control an asymmetrical field where the mountain peaks are divided by a valley river. A single bridge over the river serves as a choke point in the center of the map; although deep, the river can be crossed. On either side of the river sits an outpost where temporary character enhancements can be claimed. In addition, tree stumps and rocks throughout the valley create strategic points for you to use line of sight to your advantage. To prevent absolute domination by one faction through its control of the enemy graveyard, the Horde and Alliance players resurrected in Twin Peaks will spawn from one of two graveyards per faction.\nWildhammer Longhouse.\n&lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold%20%28Twin%20Peaks%29\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; serves as the Alliance base in the north, hovering above the valley, atop a series of plateaus. With three entrances to the complex, players have two primary means of reaching the longhouse: scaling the plateaus to the northwest, or using the stairwell up the middle in order to access any of the three openings. Be careful, though, falling or being knocked off the cliff can not only cause damage, but it can also hinder a successful offensive against or defense of the base.\nDragonmaw Clan Compound.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Forge\"&gt;Dragonmaw Forge&lt;/a&gt; acts as the Horde base in the south, sitting over a body of water into which the valley's river feeds. With three entrances to the compound, players have a few means of getting inside. One entrance on the southeast side requires riding up an incline and crossing a knee-deep river.

As a commander, Twinbraid was presumably the one who ordered the attack on the tauren tribe.\nTwinbraid also exiled &lt;a href=\"Feegly%20the%20Exiled\"&gt;Feegly&lt;/a&gt; from the keep after the &lt;a href=\"Tear%20of%20the%20Moons\"&gt;Tear of the Moons&lt;/a&gt; had been found. Mad Feegly then asked the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to retrieve the tear contained in &lt;a href=\"General%20Twinbraid%27s%20Strongbox\"&gt;General Twinbraid's Strongbox&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThe general was now found at &lt;a href=\"Twinbraid%27s%20Patrol\"&gt;Twinbraid's Patrol&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by several &lt;a href=\"Twinbraid%27s%20Bodyguard%20%28Southern%20Barrens%29\"&gt;bodyguards&lt;/a&gt;. He was a staunch ally to the Alliance when they launched their invasion campaign of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; with the intent of creating a military supply chain between &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; and night elf territory.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Bael%27dun%20Keep\"&gt;Bael'dun Keep&lt;/a&gt; was blown up by the Horde, Twinbraid survived its destruction by being away, but was furious at the death of his son &lt;a href=\"Marley%20Twinbraid\"&gt;Marley&lt;/a&gt;, a military scout and amateur archaeologist who was killed in a plane crash when Bael'dun Keep was destroyed. After this, Twinbraid decided the Horde had made things personal.\nAn Alliance adventurer found the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Weezil%20Slipshadow\"&gt;Weezil Slipshadow&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; goblin, in the ruins of Bael'dun Keep. Concluding that the Cartel was responsible for his people being massacred at Bael Modan, Twinbraid sent the adventurer to exterminate every goblin worker they could find in &lt;a href=\"Frazzlecraz%20Motherlode\"&gt;Frazzlecraz Motherlode&lt;/a&gt; in order to teach them what it means to be a part of the Horde. Afterwards, he had his agent blow up the mine there to have the goblins suffer like his people, burying them alive in their lode, and to prevent the Horde from having its resources. Following &lt;a href=\"General%20Hawthorne\"&gt;General Hawthorne&lt;/a&gt;'s death, General Twinbraid took command of the Alliance armies in &lt;a href=\"Fort%20Triumph\"&gt;Fort Triumph&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Horde questing of the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens%20storyline\"&gt;Southern Barrens storyline&lt;/a&gt;, it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Gann%20Stonespire\"&gt;Gann Stonespire&lt;/a&gt;, a tauren who parted ways with the Horde to seek vengeance against the dwarves for all the damage they had done and the destruction of &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt;, and Horde player, were behind the destruction of Bael'dun Keep; Weezil had agreed to aid Gann in his cause.\nMists of Pandaria.\nFor his service in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; campaign, Twinbraid was promoted to High Marshal and became the head general of &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Lion's Landing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. According to his &lt;a href=\"Journal%20of%20High%20Marshal%20Twinbraid\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt;, Twinbraid claimed that stopping the Horde would save the lives of innocent young &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; from dying by Horde violence as his son did, and so he was hunting &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Bloodhilt\"&gt;Warlord Bloodhilt&lt;/a&gt; whom he mistakenly blamed for the death of his son. He also relished his chance at vengeance against the Horde.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Lion%27s%20Landing%20%28scenario%29\"&gt;Lion's Landing scenario&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde attacked the base and Twinbraid, &lt;a href=\"Taylor\"&gt;Taylor&lt;/a&gt;, the rescue team, and Alliance adventurers successfully repelled the Horde invasion.

Twinks are mainly used in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; fighting and &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;. Twinks obtain their items through rare drops, drops off of bosses in &lt;a href=\"instances\"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt;, rewards from quests that are difficult to complete at their level, and from the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;. Twink items on the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; can be expensive and twink enchantments can only be performed by high-level characters. Therefore, twinking usually requires significant assistance from high-level &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt;s, friends, and/or &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; members. However, there are examples of self-made twinks that generate the necessary gold from &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; trading or other in-game methods.\nTwinking is common in &lt;a href=\"MMORPG\"&gt;MMORPG&lt;/a&gt;s, including &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, though many mechanisms are in place that limit a &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;'s ability to equip a character with gear beyond its level. Although Blizzard remains neutral on the subject and has confirmed that they neither endorse nor oppose twinking, the topic continues to be very controversial in the game. While some argue that twinking a character requires considerable effort and is a legitimate goal and facet of game-play, others argue that twinking is an inappropriate use of gold, and that they have an unfair advantage against regular players in PVP. Levels of twinks and \"twinking\" in World of Warcraft are commonly associated with PVP brackets for battlegrounds. One common rationalization is that \"they just stop leveling\", while another states that twinks have essentially finished the game because they have the best gear possible for their level and no longer need to worry about such things as raids and end-game content.\nExamples.\nTwinking is most often done in order for a character to compete in a certain &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt; bracket. Two popular classes for twinks in World of Warcraft are &lt;a href=\"rogues\"&gt;rogues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"hunters\"&gt;hunters&lt;/a&gt;. Hunters do well in &lt;a href=\"battlegrounds\"&gt;battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;, especially at low levels since many melee classes have no way to stop a hunter who can &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;. Their damage is largely affected by the gear they have, so they can go above and beyond what other classes could twink to.\nGame design.\nWorld of Warcraft has several mechanisms in place to reduce twinking, including:\nNoticeably absent from this list is a minimum level requirement for pre-&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;enchantments&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcana\"&gt;Arcana&lt;/a&gt;, with the exception of librams formerly used to give a head (or leg) enchant which now have a level 55 minimum limit placed upon them in order to function.\nOn the flip side, patch 2.3 was arguably the best pro-twink patch in WoW history, encouraging players to solo level (by reducing the experience needed to do so) and increasing experience awarded, while at the same time upgrading most or all dungeon loot and even adding in an &lt;a href=\"Deadman%27s%20Hand\"&gt;epic ring&lt;/a&gt; requiring level 29, the high end of one of the popular twink brackets.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%202.2\"&gt;patch 2.2&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard made gear a factor in matching BG groups/players, so twinked players are more likely to face twinks and characters passing through a given level are more likely to face others like themselves. Also, max level raid geared players will tend to get opponents in epics and casual players in green/blue gear will face gear similar to their own.\nTwinking developments.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.0\"&gt;patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, a feature was introduced that allowed players to disable experience gains in exchange for 10g. Battlegrounds were then altered to force xp-off characters to face only other xp-off characters. Battleground XP was enabled for all other characters. \nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3\"&gt;patch 4.0.3&lt;/a&gt; all battlegroups were merged into one large region wide battlegroup (US and Oceanic servers are in the same region). This means that battlegrounds will launch for all brackets regardless of your server.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.2\"&gt;Patch 5.2&lt;/a&gt; changed battleground brackets so that a character\u2019s effective level is scaled up to the top of the bracket; &lt;a href=\"health\"&gt;health&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"heirloom\"&gt;heirloom&lt;/a&gt; items are normalized to the maximum level of the bracket. This means a twink does not have the same mechanical advantage against the weakest characters in the bracket anymore; e.g. level 19 versus 15, although lower level characters can still be weaker because of inferior gear and less abilities and talents at their disposal.\nExpansion-cap twinking.\nA player without one or more expansions will be level-capped by their client (as opposed to the \"no-xp\" option). They will remain at 60 (for a classic WoW account), 70 (with Burning Crusade), or 80 (with Wrath of the Lich King) until further expansions are added to their account.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, expansion capped players are moved into the same bracket as those with XP disabled.\nExploit twinking.\nSince March 2011, players can enter regular Battlegrounds with XP disabled by using &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php%3Fid%3D205147\"&gt;an exploit&lt;/a&gt;. According to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4015352384%3Fpage%3D1\"&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard has no plan to fix the exploit."}

It requires at lease two separate accounts, each having a twink. With one twink, you would queue for a battleground and join. Once the battleground is filled, you would then queue for that specific battleground with your second twink. You then play the battleground normally with your first twink. Before your team captures the enemy flag, you leave the battleground. This in turn, makes a slot open for your second twink to join.\nFailure to leave the battleground before capping the flag will result in gaining experience, which twinks do not want. It is ideal for pvp guilds since a guild mate can verify if the flag was capped or not before joining the battleground with your second twink."}

Willow (the quest giver and finisher) can be found in &lt;a href=\"Kormek%27s%20Hut\"&gt;Kormek's Hut&lt;/a&gt;, NE of the &lt;a href=\"Kodo%20Graveyard\"&gt;Kodo Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;, outside of the walled area on the map.\nIf you are doing other Maraudon quests anyway, this should be no problem and you can complete as you go, as the drop off many of the creatures of Maraudon. For those looking for the fastest/easiest way to get this quest done, the &lt;a href=\"Nameless%20Prophet\"&gt;Nameless Prophet&lt;/a&gt; drops these 100%, and respawns almost instantly in one of four or five locations. Another good strategy is to kill the group of imps just inside the purple entrance to the instance, loot, leave the instance, reset and repeat &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.thottbot.com/q7028\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Note that there is a limit to how many times you can enter the instance in one hour.\nFor more information on tactics and groups for this instance, see the main &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt; article."}

The battle is preceded by killing his four instructors, each of whom have one of his techniques. When fought, Ta'yak utilizes all four abilities in a combination of strength, steel, speed and wind. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Ta'yak is known for his patience and intelligence. In battle, he is a master at discovering his opponent's weaknesses and awaiting the perfect opportunity to strike. Ta'yak's skill with a blade is unmatched, and he cherishes imparting his martial knowledge on young mantid warriors.\"\nSpells and Abilities.\nTa'yak has an enrage timer of around 8 minutes.\nStage 2.\nStage 2 begins once Blade Lord Ta'yak reaches 20% health.\nStrategy.\nThe first phase of the encounter is all about positioning. First, spread out to limit damage taken from Wind Steps. Second, collapse the entire raid on top of players who have been targeted for an Unseen Strike. Finally, keep spread out while avoiding the circling tornadoes that are frequently spawned. As the fight progresses, it may become necessary to move the boss to another part of the room to get clear of the tornadoes.\nAt 20% health, Ta'yak will trap all members of the raid in tornadoes and send them to one side of the long hall, while he takes up position at the other. This is a platforming mechanic -- run forward toward Ta'yak while strafing left or right to steer clear of the tornadoes. Up close to the wall behind Ta'yak is safe from tornadoes, so adventurers can stand still and attack the boss. Ta'yak will jump to the opposite side of the hall at 10%, repeating the tornado-dodging exercise.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;\nTrivia.\nTa'yak is voiced by &lt;a href=\"David%20Blue\"&gt;David Blue&lt;/a&gt;."}

The blade barrel seems to be the most popular measure of the moment, a stunningly intimidating contraption. Goblin dock wardens place blade barrels among shipments of precious goods.\nThe device is a deterrent to theft. Triggered by proximity or movement, the blade barrel unfolds, and up to 10 articulated arms slide out of hidden panels. Each of these arms terminates in a scalpel-sharp dagger blade capable of slicing bone. These arms hover like serpents waiting for any sign of movement. Clockwork sensors and &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt;-directed vanes detect motion near the blade barrel, and anything larger than a rat is subject to a lethal series of attacks. Blade barrels appear to be normal barrels of goods or warehouse crates. Cruel or malicious goblins often tip the dagger arms with venom to mark anyone that the blade barrels daggers slash. The blade barrel lashes out at anything that stumbles within its 10-foot reach.\nDisarming the trap requires a special whistle, which deactivates it when blown. A smart goblin will blow the whistle from 30 feet away and then have the barrel removed by a &lt;a href=\"junk%20golem\"&gt;junk golem&lt;/a&gt;."}

Head to the far western edge of Tirisfal, in the mountains west of &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt;. At &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; have set up a small camp, inhabited by &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Bladetwister\"&gt;Twilight Bladetwister&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Shadowcaster\"&gt;Twilight Shadowcaster&lt;/a&gt;s. A &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Void%20Ravener\"&gt;Greater Void Ravener&lt;/a&gt; is floating in the middle of the camp. When you arrive at the area, you are automatically placed in a single-player scenario.\nStage 1: The Twilight Camp.\nThe camp's mobs include &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Bladetwister\"&gt;Twilight Bladetwister&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Shadowcaster\"&gt;Twilight Shadowcaster&lt;/a&gt;s, and a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Void%20Ravener\"&gt;Greater Void Ravener&lt;/a&gt;.\n, the first clue, is found in a wagon in the southern end of the camp. \n, the second clue, is sitting on top of a crate inside the tent in the norhtwestern part of the camp. \n, the third clue, is sitting on top of a larger crate in the northeastern part of the camp, near the water. \nStage 2: Raiding the Tomb Raiders.\nSwim down into the center of the large lake. Enter the &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20Passage\"&gt;Underwater Passage&lt;/a&gt; and keep swimming until you reach the &lt;a href=\"Vestibule%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Vestibule of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nStage 3: The Desecrated Tomb.\nA Bladetwister and Shadowcaster are guarding the entrance, but by the time you get out of the water Slaghammer has already begun fighting them. After helping him defeat the cultists, he says the following:\nStage 5: Reconsecration.\nFour &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Ritualist%20%28Tirisfal%20Glades%29\"&gt;Twilight Ritualist&lt;/a&gt;s are channeling dark energy into four wards spread around the central platform of the tomb. Killing them will cause the dark energy they're channeling to explode, causing packs of &lt;a href=\"Flesh%20Spawn\"&gt;Flesh Spawn&lt;/a&gt; to appear. After killing all four, the floor of the chamber becomes covered with shadow energy and &lt;a href=\"Amassing%20Darkness\"&gt;Amassing Darkness&lt;/a&gt;, an elite &lt;a href=\"voidwraith\"&gt;voidwraith&lt;/a&gt;, appears on the central platform and begins channeling \"Armageddon\".\nStage 6: Don't Fear the Reaper.\nYou can either choose to kill the Amassing Darkness, or simply to let it finish channeling Armageddon, which will deal around 15% of your health in damage and knock you backwards while also killing the voidwraith in the process.\nStage 7: Dark Passage.\nThe entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Darkwalk\"&gt;Darkwalk&lt;/a&gt; has opened, but &lt;a href=\"Borgoth%20the%20Master%20Reaver\"&gt;Borgoth the Master Reaver&lt;/a&gt; and a Twilight Bladetwister have emerged to hinder your passage. After killing them, continue down into the Darkwalk, which is inhabited by another pack of Flesh Spawn and another Twilight Bladetwister. A round chamber about halfway down the passage is filled with &lt;a href=\"Void%20Tendril%20%28Tirisfal%20Glades%29\"&gt;Void Tendrils&lt;/a&gt;, which elicits the following comment from Slaghammer:\nAfter dispelling or defeating the tendrils, proceed into the final chamber: the &lt;a href=\"Grave-Prison%20of%20Zakajz\"&gt;Grave-Prison of Zakajz&lt;/a&gt;. When you enter the area, a short cutscene begins.\nStage 8: Death to the Deacon.\nTwo &lt;a href=\"n%27raqi\"&gt;faceless ones&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20Corrupter\"&gt;Faceless Corrupter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Faceless%20Guardian%20%28Tirisfal%20Glades%29\"&gt;Faceless Guardian&lt;/a&gt; appear to the left and right sides of Farthing. As you begin to walk into the chamber, Slaghammer turns around and runs back to the entrance of the Grave-Prison.\nSeveral Bladetwisters and Shadowcasters run down towards the chamber from the Darkwalk but are stopped by a shadowy barrier put up by Slaghammer. Be careful not to run back into the Darkwalk before Slaghammer puts up the barrier, as it is impossible to get past it and you will get stuck, forcing you to restart the scenario from stage 1.\nWhile Slaghammer puts up the barrier, the two faceless ones move closer to you and are now standing right on the other side of the chasm that forms the dividing line between you and Slaghammer and Farthing. When you aggro them:\nAfter dealing with the faceless ones, proceed to Farthing. Upon aggroing him, he says:\nFarthing will occasionally summon Void Tendrils, as well as \"Shadow Images\" of himself. Summoning Void Tendrils:\nAt around 50%, he summons a large amount of Tendrils which all begin casting &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Flay\"&gt;Mind Flay&lt;/a&gt; on you.\nWhen you get Farthing to 1% health, Xal'atath escapes from his grasp and flies over to levitate next to Zakajz while Farthing himself becomes stunned and ceases to attack you.\nFinal Stage: The True Death of Zakajz.\nUpon entering the final stage, you are given the \"Dark Drain\" spell:\nUsing it causes you to channel the essence of Zakajz into yourself for 10 seconds, after which the Corruptor's corpse vanishes into thin air and marks the conclusion of the scenario. Slaghammer runs into the room to congratulate you.\nWhen you arrive in Dalaran, head northwest to the &lt;a href=\"Antonidas%20Memorial\"&gt;Antonidas Memorial&lt;/a&gt;, where Moira Thaurissan, Alonsus Faol and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; are waiting for you.\nSpeak with Moira to turn in the quest."}

It was created by the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; and acts as a key to his sanctum, the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nBefore his disappearance, the Primus hid an unfinished blade with no hilt inside a standing rock in a lava pool in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;, along with a message stating that the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; would fall into darkness, frayed bonds had to be restored, and \"the key [would] honor the worthy\". He etched five runes into the blade corresponding to five runes covering the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Door\"&gt;sanctum door&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, each representing one of the traits of the ideal &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxi&lt;/a&gt; soldier: ambition, might, guile, insight, and the relentless pursuit of victory. As a test of the potential forger's skill, he also enchanted the blade by trapping a number of &lt;a href=\"soul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt;s inside it.\nReaching the standing stone became a trial of endurance for the most renowned members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt;. However, although many souls succeeded in reaching it, none discovered what the rock contained until the &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;, whose touch activated the Primus' message and revealed the blade. &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; sent the Maw Walker to the Primus' apprentice, &lt;a href=\"Bonesmith%20Heirmir\"&gt;Bonesmith Heirmir&lt;/a&gt;, who decided the object had to be turned into a proper weapon. With hide scraps from the land itself as raw materials and the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;-infused bones of &lt;a href=\"Marrowjaw\"&gt;Marrowjaw&lt;/a&gt; as the hilt, Heirmir forged the unfinished blade into a proper sword while the Maw Walker held off the soul guardians that emerged from it. As soon as the weapon was finished, Heirmir was knocked away by a blast of energy and commented that the Maw Walker was evidently the only one meant to wield it. When the hero took up the weapon, they activated its first rune, the Rune of Ambition.\n&lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Krexus\"&gt;Margrave Krexus&lt;/a&gt; deduced that the sword's runes were the same as the ones on the Seat of the Primus\u2014which had been sealed since the Primus' disappearance\u2014and sent the Maw Walker there with Baroness Draka and &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Vyraz\"&gt;Baron Vyraz&lt;/a&gt; to see what would happen. When the Maw Walker held up the blade to the entrance, the Rune of Ambition transferred its power to the sanctum door. However, Vyraz insisted that accessing the Seat would do them no good if the Chosen fell in battle against the traitorous &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker was tasked with recruiting new allies to the war, but these efforts awakened three more of the blade's runes in the process:\nIt was eventually revealed that Vyraz was in league with the House of Constructs and House of Rituals and had betrayed and killed Margrave Krexus. When the Maw Walker confronted Vyraz alongside &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, they awakened the fifth and final rune, the Rune of the Relentless. When Vyraz saw that the runeblade had been completed, he declared that he would take it from the hero's corpse. However, the duel was interrupted when Draka arrived to bring the Maw Walker and Alexandros back to the Seat to defend it from an assault by Vyraz's forces. While the Maw Walker's allies held the line, the hero used their runeblade to open the door into the Seat and cause the Primus' power to cut a swath of destruction through the traitorous Maldraxxi, forcing them to retreat. When the hero entered the Seat and approached a &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Altar\"&gt;stone altar&lt;/a&gt;, the runeblade began glowing brighter. The Maw Walker planted the blade in the altar, triggering a dire warning from the Primus: the &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20Ones\"&gt;Eternal Ones&lt;/a&gt; had to stand together once more to prevent &lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; from escaping his imprisonment in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Draka concluded that the message must have been put there to await one who proved worthy of hearing it. The Maw Walker subsequently returned to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the warning to the other Eternal Ones.\nMaw Walkers who returned to Maldraxxus to join the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; brandished the Blade of the Primus as part of the ceremony to join the covenant and receive the power of the Primus. Later, during the Necrolord and &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Covenant\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; assault on the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros devised a plan to deal with &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bilebloat%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Bilebloat Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt;s by using the runeblade. First, he instructed Maw Walkers to kill Gharmal's empowered forces in the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt; and absorb their essence into the blade. Then, he and the heroes mounted his &lt;a href=\"deathroc\"&gt;deathroc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Marrow%20%28roc%29\"&gt;Marrow&lt;/a&gt;, headed into the sky above the Stitchyard, and unleashed the blade's power in a flurry of necrotic bolts that destroyed the juggernauts."}

Shortly after flying over the border into the desert, however, the group are noticed by Jakra'zet and his &lt;a href=\"Faithless\"&gt;Faithless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sethrak\"&gt;sethrak&lt;/a&gt; ally &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Korthek\"&gt;Emperor Korthek&lt;/a&gt;, who shoots Kaja and Jorana's &lt;a href=\"pterrordax\"&gt;pterrordax&lt;/a&gt; mounts out of the sky with his lightning magic.\nKaja is nearly killed by the lightning strike, but is found by the &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Meerah\"&gt;Meerah&lt;/a&gt; and taken to the &lt;a href=\"Vulpera%20Hideaway\"&gt;Vulpera Hideaway&lt;/a&gt;, where the adventurer soon reunites with her and helps Meerah and &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; restore her to health. After investigating the fate of Jorana and Tarkaj (one is dead, the other missing), Kaja and the adventurer follow the lead provided by Rakera's &lt;a href=\"Rakera%27s%20Journal\"&gt;journal&lt;/a&gt; and travel south on Meerah's &lt;a href=\"Meerah%27s%20Caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;. At the &lt;a href=\"Withering%20Gulch\"&gt;Withering Gulch&lt;/a&gt;, they encounter &lt;a href=\"Jorak\"&gt;Jorak&lt;/a&gt;, an exile whose life was saved by Rakera. After battling some of Jakra'zet's nearby forces, the group continues to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Akunda\"&gt;Temple of Akunda&lt;/a&gt; in southern Vol'dun.\nAfter the adventurer gains entry into the temple from &lt;a href=\"Akunda%20the%20Exalted\"&gt;Akunda the Exalted&lt;/a&gt;, Kaja discovers that Rakera has been deprived of her memories and become one of &lt;a href=\"Akunda\"&gt;Akunda&lt;/a&gt;'s followers at the temple. Once the champion defeats Akunda the Exalted and frees Akunda, allowing the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; to restore his follower's memories, Rakera reverts to her old self and informs Kaja and the hero that Jakra'zet's soldiers are searching Vol'dun for some kind of weapon capable of destroying &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer, Kaja, Rakera, and Meerah continue to the ruined city of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Ahjin\"&gt;Zul'Ahjin&lt;/a&gt; to meet up with Rakera's old friend &lt;a href=\"Julwaba\"&gt;Julwaba&lt;/a&gt;, surviving an attack from Jakra'zet's assassins along the way. At Zul'Ahjin, they encounter the vulpera Kiro and &lt;a href=\"Nisha\"&gt;Nisha&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Julwaba and her friend &lt;a href=\"Serrik\"&gt;Serrik&lt;/a&gt;, a sethrak who is dying from &lt;a href=\"scorpid\"&gt;scorpashi&lt;/a&gt; venom. After Kiro and the adventurer save Serrik with antivenom, the champion travels into Zul'Ahjin and discovers a &lt;a href=\"Sulthis%27%20Stone\"&gt;special stone&lt;/a&gt;. At Serrik's urging, the adventurer, Kaja, and Rakera accompany him to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20the%20Devoted\"&gt;Sanctuary of the Devoted&lt;/a&gt; to deliver the stone to &lt;a href=\"Vorrik\"&gt;Vorrik&lt;/a&gt;. Vorrik explains to the hero, Kaja, and Rakera the history of how &lt;a href=\"Sethraliss\"&gt;Sethraliss&lt;/a&gt; defeated &lt;a href=\"Mythrax\"&gt;Mythrax&lt;/a&gt; and how the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20%28sethrak%29\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; Vorrik, Korthek, and &lt;a href=\"Sulthis\"&gt;Sulthis&lt;/a&gt; created three keystones to keep Mythrax entombed within &lt;a href=\"Atul%27Aman\"&gt;Atul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. Rakera realizes that Mythrax must be the weapon that Jakra'zet is searching for.\nShortly after, Vorrik and the adventurer leave to confront Korthek directly. Vorrik asks Kaja and Rakera to protect his and Sulthis' keystones while he is away, and they promise to protect Vorrik's people as their own. Vorrik, the hero, and their vulpera allies ultimately manage to defeat Korthek, but meanwhile, Jakra'zet and his troops attack the Sanctuary of the Devoted and steal the keystones. Kaja and Rakera pursue the general into the crypts below Atul'Aman but they both end up being ensnared by tentacles in the &lt;a href=\"Fetid%20Crypt\"&gt;Fetid Crypt&lt;/a&gt; below the pyramid. Vorrik and the adventurer eventually catch up with and free the two Zandalari. The group then confronts Jakra'zet deeper in the crypt. After a battle, the general is mortally wounded, and Rakera tells Kaja to give him a clean death. However, before Kaja has a chance to kill Jakra'zet, he instead leaps into the nearby pit, killing himself and providing the final blood sacrifice needed to resurrect Mythrax. The group barely escapes with their lives and returns to the Sanctuary of the Devoted, where Kaja and Rakera then remain with Vorrik.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt;, Mythrax, and their armies attacked Zuldazar, Rakera urgently asked Meerah to transport her and Kaja to the city. Once they arrived, Kaja accompanied Rakera, Meerah, and Talanji through the &lt;a href=\"Zocalo\"&gt;Zocalo&lt;/a&gt; and helped fend off Mythrax while the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; went to confront Zul.\nTides of Vengeance.\nKaja participates in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, storming the &lt;a href=\"Zocalo\"&gt;Zocalo&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Talanji&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race%20recruitment%20quests%23Zandalari%20trolls\"&gt;coronation&lt;/a&gt;, she appeared sitting in a &lt;a href=\"Ceremonial%20Brutosaur\"&gt;Ceremonial Brutosaur&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Zocalo\"&gt;Zocalo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zanchul\"&gt;Zanchul&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\n&lt;Bladeguard Kaja is deep in conversation with General Rakera.&gt;"}

Judging by the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Blademaster\"&gt;Ancient Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;, the way of the blademaster was already an ancient one years before the forming of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The blademaster &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; was notably amongst the old Horde forces that invaded &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, where he would serve under both &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second Wars&lt;/a&gt;, before returning to home.\nThird War.\nThough their numbers are few, the seasoned blademasters represent an elite fighting force within the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. These skilled swordsmen were once part of the ill-fated &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; which consumed itself in the throes of demonic corruption. With their clan scattered and broken, the proud blademasters swore a grim oath to free themselves and their brethren from demonic control once and for all. Under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s command, the blademasters once again joined the Horde and came to serve as the young Warchief's personal honor guard. Though blademasters are masters of stealth and guile, they value personal honor above all else.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Scouts\"&gt;Blackrock Scouts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Warriors\"&gt;Blackrock Warriors&lt;/a&gt;, sub-groups of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, were also led by blademasters.\nOutland.\nFel blademasters were numerous in the forces of &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; and were the chieftains of each of his bloodthirsty sub-legions. Each of the four great fel orc fortifications on the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, guarding the dark portals, was led by a blademaster. In the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; under the control of Magtheridon, several blademasters led legions of fel orcs in defense. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; had great battles against the fel orc blademasters both in and outside of the temple.\nCataclysm.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, at least some blademasters remained loyal to the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Ronakada\"&gt;Blademaster Ronakada&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; informed adventurers that while the blademasters' oath of freeing their people from &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic control had been fulfilled, his own honor remains unsatisfied.

Garrosh also recruited so-called &lt;a href=\"Blind%20Blademaster\"&gt;Blind Blademaster&lt;/a&gt;s into his &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nOn the where the orc clans rallied into the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; as a result of Garrosh's actions, the , led by a blademaster known as &lt;a href=\"Azuka%20Bladefury\"&gt;Azuka Bladefury&lt;/a&gt;, willingly joined. Following 's takeover of the Iron Horde, a blademaster called &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20Jubei%27thos\"&gt;Jubei'thos&lt;/a&gt; became a member of his &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20High%20Council\"&gt;Hellfire High Council&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nDuring the first Azerothian &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival, &lt;a href=\"Lantresor%20of%20the%20Blade\"&gt;Lantresor of the Blade&lt;/a&gt; assumed leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20clan\"&gt;Burning Blade clan&lt;/a&gt; by virtue of being the eldest surviving blademaster.\nBurning Blade customs.\nThe blade is not the only important item a blademaster carries. Once they had passed their final tests in the &lt;a href=\"Masters%27%20Cavern\"&gt;Masters' Cavern&lt;/a&gt;s, the blademaster was given the honor of wearing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;'s banner. The banners carried by blademasters are described as cumbersome, and it's hard to believe that they don't affect the blademasters' ability to fight. In \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", blademasters are shown to be capable of manipulating fire, with many of them using abilities such as \"Blazing Coil\".\nSticky, smelly, and highly flammable, &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Blazegrease\"&gt;blazegrease&lt;/a&gt; is liberally applied to the swords and axes of the Burning Blade clan before battle. Though some warriors choose to ignite their weapons before battle, most let the inevitable contact of blades and armor spark the blazegrease for unpredictable intimidation.\nIn the RPG.\nAmong the Horde, orcs with the &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt; class are known as blademasters.\nBlademasters lead their people into melee combat, unhesitatingly seeking the most vulnerable enemy champions \u2014 magi, druids and the like. Blademasters willingly go toe-to-toe with other melee experts as well, drawing from ages of tradition to fuel their combat prowess. Their banners allow their troops to identify them on the battlefield and move to where the action is thickest. Many act as bodyguards for other Horde champions. &lt;a href=\"Banner%20of%20the%20Black%20Wolf\"&gt;Banner of the Black Wolf&lt;/a&gt; is in the same style as those worn by orcish blademasters.\nChieftain of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20clan\"&gt;Warsong clan&lt;/a&gt; and an orc legend, &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; is a blademaster of the old traditions. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; is also a blademaster."}

These skilled swordsmen were once part of the ill-fated &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade%20Clan\"&gt;Burning Blade Clan&lt;/a&gt; which consumed itself in the throes of Demonic corruption. With their Clan scattered and broken, the proud Blademasters swore a grim oath to free themselves and their brethren from Demonic control once and for all. Under &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s command, the Blademasters have once again joined the Horde and serve as the young &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;'s personal honor guard.\nHero names.\nTojara, Nikoro, Kajind, Mikasa, &lt;a href=\"Samuro%20%28blademaster%29\"&gt;Samuro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Akinos\"&gt;Akinos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mazuru\"&gt;Mazuru&lt;/a&gt;, Yozshura, Daisho, Kigami, Arashicage, &lt;a href=\"Moogul%20the%20Sly\"&gt;Moogul the Sly&lt;/a&gt;, Jubei.\nInformation.\nThe Blademaster is a favorite Hero of many Orc commanders. Though he lacks any hero killing skills like the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;, he makes up for it with one of the fastest attack speeds for a Hero combined with high damage. \nThe Blademaster is one of the most powerful melee Heroes when combined with &lt;a href=\"%23Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Critical%20Strike%20%28Passive%29\"&gt;Critical Strike&lt;/a&gt;. Blademasters can quickly destroy enemy units and buildings when they are powered up with items and levels. The Blademaster's greatest advantage is Mirror Image, which confuses the enemy and focuses their attention on fake copies of the Blademaster. Critical Strike allows the Blademaster to deal very high damage and essentially serves as his \"nuke\" ability. &lt;a href=\"%23Wind%20Walk\"&gt;Wind Walk&lt;/a&gt; can allow the Blademaster to go invisible and run away when he's about to die or sneak into enemy towns. The Blademaster's &lt;a href=\"%23Bladestorm%20%28Ultimate%29\"&gt;Bladestorm&lt;/a&gt; ultimate ability can do serious damage if left unchecked.\nThere are many point spending strategies with the Blademaster. Most players generally prefer Wind Walk over Mirror Image (due to its numerous cons early game), followed by Critical Strike to conserve the Blademaster's mana for more Wind Walks. \nBuy attack speed boosting items at the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Merchant\"&gt;Goblin Merchant&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marketplace\"&gt;Marketplace&lt;/a&gt; to further enhance the Blademaster's power.\nDuring early game, try to discourage Blademaster rushes before they can cause too much havoc on your base. Mid/late-game, try to target him before he can unleash his attacks and pick out your core units. \nSpells and abilities.\nind Walk.\nNotes: Cooldown occurs when Wind Walk breaks. During Wind Walk the Blademaster can walk through units and is able to exceed 400 speed limit and reach 522 speed limit.\n&lt;a href=\"Invisibility%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Detect Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. Undead and Night Elf players arguably have it the easiest, because both races' shops have access to the Dust of Appearance item, allowing them to detect any invisible unit in its range when activated. Night Elf players may alternatively Detonate their &lt;a href=\"Wisp%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt;s, though this should only be done if the Wisp is about to die.\nMirro Image.\nMirror Image is a very effective spell because he is invulnerable for a brief second when activated to make the clones. This also breaks any focused attempts on him.\nWhen used, the player and allies can discern the real Blademaster from illusions as the latter will be colored blue; for the enemy, they will see the exact copy of the Blademaster. Illusions cannot use items, and cannot utilize spells. However, as they're still considered summoned units, they can be used to trap stunned enemies. If the Blademaster levels up with illusions created from this spell, the illusions will level up with him. \nUnlike the Wand of Illusion, the Blademaster's illusions deal 20% damage and will also level up with the Blademaster if he does do so while they are active, making it harder to discern the real Blademaster.\nWhen using the spell, control the Blademaster and his illusions. If the player becomes careless and only directs the actual Blademaster, then enemy players can quickly discern the real Blademaster and go for him instead. To confuse the average player more, use beneficial spells on a mirror image and control it more than the actual Blademaster to fool the enemy into thinking it is the actual Blademaster.\nDespite this, Mirror Image takes low priority.\nAs summoned units, illusions can be quickly destroyed by any sort of dispel magic.\nIf the Blademaster and his illusions attack at different speeds, then an observant player can quickly determine the actual Blademaster by holding the \"Alt\" button or having their health bar settings always show. When the actual Blademaster strikes, the target will lose more health, making it quite obvious as to who is real.\nritical Strike (Passive).\nThere are few players that pass up Critical Strike. Critical Strike can allow for some very high damage attacks as the Blademaster gets equipment and levels.\nWhen activated, the Blademaster swings his katana down towards the unfortunate target with heavy force. Red numbers will also appear indicating a Critical Strike and how much damage he has dealt from the attack.\nCritical Strike does not work on buildings.\nCritical Strike does not receive damage from the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Keeper of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Thorns%20Aura\"&gt;Thorns Aura&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Blademaster's base attack associated with a Critical Strike still interacts with Thorns appropriately.\nladestorm (Ultimate).\nThe Blademaster is not invulnerable while casting Bladestorm, but has Spell Immunity.\nBladestorm does equal damage to all of the units in its area.\nBladestorm is great against low hit point buildings such as Towers and &lt;a href=\"Farm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Farm&lt;/a&gt;s. Use it on a group of lined up buildings to quickly destroy them. You can use them on any buildings you want to kill quickly.\nIt's best to use Bladestorm against units that are all lined up. The enemy will typically (if they are good) start running away from the Bladestorm which means you will have to control it very carefully so the Blademaster is always attacking something.\nBefore using Bladestorm make sure there isn't anything in the way that will prevent the Blademaster from reaching the enemy while he's doing his Bladestorm. A common mistake is to cast Bladestorm then to become trapped, unable to reach the enemy before the timer runs out. \nFor maximum usage, use Wind Walk, run up to a cluster of enemies, trigger the Wind Walk damage and then cast Bladestorm. This works extremely well if the enemy doesn't have any units capable of detecting invisibility.\nThe best defense against Bladestorm is to run away until it is over."}

The &lt;a href=\"ankoan\"&gt;ankoan&lt;/a&gt; had battled the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; for some time, but this proved to be the final straw. As the new head of his clan, Blademaster Okani led the Waveblade into the home of their enemies, &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; itself. Though they were severely outmatched, the Waveblade resigned themselves to vengeance or an honorable death.\nDespite the odds, Okani and his people established themselves at &lt;a href=\"Mezzamere\"&gt;Mezzamere&lt;/a&gt;.

Recognizing their common goals, Blademaster Okani offered to join with the Alliance forces, bringing them back to Mezzamere and safety.\nWith their new allies, the Waveblade began to push back against the naga and deal blows to Queen Azshara's plans. The Blademaster continued working alongside the Alliance's &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; and leaders, and accompanied them when they secured the &lt;a href=\"%3ATidestone%20of%20Golganneth\"&gt;:Tidestone of Golganneth&lt;/a&gt; from the enemy.

He was in charge of communicating with his clan's demon masters.\nBiography.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; and the prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; proceeded to defend the town, while the paladin &lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther the Lightbringer&lt;/a&gt; went to attack the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Camp\"&gt;Blackrock Camp&lt;/a&gt;. During the defense of the town the orcs sent prisoners to the Blackrock clan where the Blademaster of the Blackrock clan was located. After Arthas killed the &lt;a href=\"Slave%20Master\"&gt;Slave Master&lt;/a&gt; he moved on to &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;'s base, who was waiting for two knights that were sent to parley with the Blademaster of the Blackrock Clan, but the blademaster killed the knights and sent just the horses in return.\nThe Blademaster then sent orcs and forest trolls to invade Uther's base. After some time he used the &lt;a href=\"Blademaster%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Mirror%20Image\"&gt;Mirror Image&lt;/a&gt; ability and sent his image to speak with Uther, he told him that the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Warlocks\"&gt;warlocks of the Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; had spoken and that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt; would &lt;a href=\"Infernal\"&gt;rain from the sky&lt;/a&gt; and that the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; would burn. Uther attacked the image but realized that it was an illusion. Meanwhile the real Blademaster of the Blackrock Clan sacrificed the captured prisoners to appease his demon masters.\n&lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; was angered by the Blademaster's actions and commanded his troops to slay the blademaster, before he had a chance to communicate with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. After a battle, Arthas destroyed the orc encampment and killed the Blademaster of the Blackrock Clan. In the end, it was a sound victory and the orcs were defeated but still active. With the Blademaster dead, the Alliance went home and many orcs were still alive and led by &lt;a href=\"Jubei%27Thos\"&gt;Jubei'Thos&lt;/a&gt;.\nStats.\nNormal.\nHero Level: 2\nHard.\nHero Level: 6"}

It was also to be borne by a Kaldorei Warrior, though the process required to finish the primsatic blade was likely halted by the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Sundering\"&gt;The Sundering&lt;/a&gt; thereafter. The Blade, in its more raw state, was kept by the &lt;a href=\"Shen%27dralar\"&gt;Shen'dralar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Athenaeum\"&gt;Athenaeum&lt;/a&gt;, until much later when the player character delivers &lt;a href=\"Nostro%27s%20Compendium%20of%20Dragon%20Slaying\"&gt;Nostro's Compendium of Dragon Slaying&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Lydros\"&gt;Lorekeeper Lydros&lt;/a&gt;. Afterwards, players may complete the forging of the Prismatic Blade by having &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; breath fire into the blade, then plunging the sword into the dragon's corpse so that its blood may treat the heated blade. &lt;a href=\"Lorekeeper%20Lydros\"&gt;Lorekeeper Lydros&lt;/a&gt; will then reward the player with &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Serrar\"&gt;Quel'Serrar&lt;/a&gt;. \nTwin Prismatic Blades.\nThe Quel'Serrar Skyborn Blade, alongside the Quel'Serrar Fireborn Blade were the first of the Prismatic Blades. These two were forged by &lt;a href=\"Luminarian\"&gt;Luminarian&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, the Quel'Serrar Skyborn Blade is referenced to be the first of the Prismatic Blades, predating even &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Serrar\"&gt;Quel'Serrar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlade of Lathar'Lazal.\nThe Quel'Serrar Seaborn Blade was again forged by &lt;a href=\"Luminarian\"&gt;Luminarian&lt;/a&gt;, but is not considered a Prismatic Blade (based purely on flavour text). Instead, it was quenched in the enchanted pools of Lathar'Lazal of the Old &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, nowadays known as &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhispering Temple Blade.\nThe Whispering Temple Blade bears a striking similarity to the other Quel'Serrar blades, but it's not associated by name with them. Thematically, it's linked to Silithus, the Scarab Wall and the Scarab Gong, which could indicate that this blade saw battle during &lt;a href=\"The%20War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;The War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;. The identity of its creator is unknown.\nUnnamed Sixth Blade.\nAnother Blade of Quel'Serrar is yet to be revealed."}
