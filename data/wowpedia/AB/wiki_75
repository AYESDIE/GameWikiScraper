{"id": "750593", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=750593", "title": "Koroleth", "text": "Koroleth is a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; leader of the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; and one of the two main antagonists in the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains%20storyline\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains storyline&lt;/a&gt; (the other being &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt;). A servant of &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth the Storm-Eater&lt;/a&gt;, she led a Primalist army to attack the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt; and struck an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to lay claim to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nShortly after the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and their leader &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; returned to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Gardens\"&gt;Emerald Gardens&lt;/a&gt;, Koroleth's Primalist army attacked the area in an attempt to reach the portal to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Bough\"&gt;Ancient Bough&lt;/a&gt;. The dragons repelled them repeatedly, and the Primalists knew they needed the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;'s aid to win. Koroleth easily recruited &lt;a href=\"Balakar%20Khan\"&gt;Balakar Khan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; and introduced them to forbidden storm magic. She also personally visited &lt;a href=\"Timberstep%20Outpost\"&gt;Timberstep Outpost&lt;/a&gt; to try to recruit &lt;a href=\"Sansok%20Khan\"&gt;Sansok Khan&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Shikaar\"&gt;Clan Shikaar&lt;/a&gt;. She argued that the dragons (who had been gone for ten thousand years) were invaders on centaur land, and that the Shikaar should accept the strength and aid the Primalists offered. Sansok rejected the offer.\nKoroleth accompanied Balakar to the Nokhud encampment in &lt;a href=\"Maruukai\"&gt;Maruukai&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Khural\"&gt;Khural&lt;/a&gt; gathering. Balakar's &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Ohn%27ir\"&gt;Ohn'ir&lt;/a&gt; advisor, &lt;a href=\"Windsage%20Garuman\"&gt;Windsage Garuman&lt;/a&gt;, protested against Koroleth's presence. In response, Koroleth egged the khan on into killing the windsage. Koroleth accompanied Balakar when he revealed his alliance with the Primalists to the other centaur and killed the green dragons' emissary &lt;a href=\"Gemisath\"&gt;Gemisath&lt;/a&gt;, starting off a war with the other clans.\nKoroleth ordered her subordinate &lt;a href=\"Shela%20the%20Windbinder\"&gt;Shela the Windbinder&lt;/a&gt; to help the Nokhud attack the Ohn'ir at &lt;a href=\"Ridgewater%20Retreat\"&gt;Ridgewater Retreat&lt;/a&gt; and capture their totems and sacred &lt;a href=\"ohuna\"&gt;ohuna&lt;/a&gt;, which the Primalists then used to create bolts for the Nokhud's &lt;a href=\"dragonkiller%20ballista\"&gt;dragonkiller ballista&lt;/a&gt;e. Meanwhile, Koroleth led the Primalists in an attack on &lt;a href=\"Windsong%20Rise\"&gt;Windsong Rise&lt;/a&gt; and used storm magic to imprison &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt; herself, though she was only able to just barely restrain the &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;Wild God&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; and the Ohn'ir initiate &lt;a href=\"Boku\"&gt;Boku&lt;/a&gt; tried to dispel Koroleth's binding runes to free Ohn'ahra, but Koroleth stopped their efforts by knocking them off a cliff with her magic.\nShortly after, Balakar and the Nokhud attacked the &lt;a href=\"Horn%20of%20Drusahl\"&gt;Horn of Drusahl&lt;/a&gt;. Koroleth brought the captive Ohn'ahra to the Horn and forced her to bless Balakar, allowing him to blow the Horn and lure Merithra and her fellow dragons &lt;a href=\"Gerithus\"&gt;Gerithus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solethus\"&gt;Solethus&lt;/a&gt; into a trap. The Nokhud tried to kill Merithra with a dragonkiller ballista, but Solethus absorbed the bolt instead. Undeterred, Koroleth forced Ohn'ahra to teleport her and Balakar away.\nWith the help of the Nokhud and their ballistae, Koroleth's army broke the Emerald Gardens' defenses, and she led a massive invasion force onto the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Scar\"&gt;Storm Scar&lt;/a&gt; near the Ancient Bough. Riding a &lt;a href=\"Stormbound%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Stormbound Proto-Drake&lt;/a&gt; and empowered by &lt;a href=\"Primalist%20Pylon\"&gt;magical pylons&lt;/a&gt;, she tried to destroy one of the pillars that maintained the magical shield around the Bough. However, the greens allied with the other centaur clans and met the Primalists and Nokhud in battle. The adventurer and the &lt;a href=\"Khanam%20Matra%20Sarest\"&gt;Khanam Matra Sarest&lt;/a&gt; helped Merithra destroy the pylons, then engaged Koroleth. The latter was confident that she could still reach the Emerald Dream and drained the strength from her proto-drake to empower herself, but the adventurer and Khanam Matra killed her. With their leader defeated, the remaining Primalists scattered."}

He was sent by the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; to represent the trolls as a &lt;a href=\"fighter\"&gt;fighter&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Amphitheater of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormerly, Korrak controlled the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Field of Strife&lt;/a&gt; in the middle of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. Later on, he left and took up residence near a troll &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt; after an avalanche nearly killed his tribe. There, he was potentially killed and raised several times.\nHistory.\nThe Winterax trolls have been invading the valleys of Alterac and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; and were fighting the dwarves of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlterac Valley.\nHis tribe once inhabited &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; within an area known as &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20Hold\"&gt;Winterax Hold&lt;/a&gt;. He and his band of &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20tribe\"&gt;Winterax tribe&lt;/a&gt;, also once controlled the &lt;a href=\"Snowfall%20Graveyard\"&gt;Snowfall Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; at the start of every Alterac Valley &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;. Tomes from the Winterax stated that Korrak preferred to stay hidden unless absolutely necessary. It was said that his death would spell the end of the Winterax Tribe. Despite this, the troll was slain multiple times, resurrected by his people. Both the Horde and Alliance sought the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Korrak\"&gt;Skull of Korrak&lt;/a&gt; to put him down for good, but neither were ultimately successful.\nOne day, Korrak and his people simply disappeared, along with most of their belongings and supplies. The mystified orcs and dwarves concluded that the trolls had at last given up their home, which, after all, had devolved into little more than a bloody battlefield, and left in search of greener pastures. \nAmphitheater of Anguish.\nKorrak makes a triumphant return in \"\" as the fifth (of six) boss in the &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Amphitheater of Anguish&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Blood\"&gt;Ring of Blood&lt;/a&gt;-style quest chain in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. He was sent as a 'power move' by the Drakkari, having been empowered by the Loa. There, he claimed the Amphitheater for the Winterax, as he would for Snowfall in Alterac, only to be defeated once again. It is unknown if his death was final or if his tribe simply resurrected him once again. \n&lt;a href=\"Winterax%20Speaker\"&gt;Winterax Speaker&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; after the downfall of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;, potentially meaning that he may still yet live; as it was stated previously that the Winterax would fall apart without him.\nTactics.\nAlterac Valley.\nIn most Alterac Valley battles, Korrak was simply trained away from the graveyard by a player while another one tried to capture it. In &lt;a href=\"patch%201.5\"&gt;patch 1.5&lt;/a&gt;, Korrak became a rather easy battle, since he had little armor, little health, little strength and no resistance. Afterwards, he was drastically improved to the point at which many people decided it was useless to engage him. Players still willing had better had a good amount of people focused on him instead of the battle. Once engaged him with enough people it usually proved to be a rather simple fight.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%201.10\"&gt;patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt;, Korrak was removed from Alterac Valley, along with most of the other non-&lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &amp; non-&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"NPCs\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; (though &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"kobold\"&gt;kobold&lt;/a&gt;s still exist).\nQuotes.\nHis quotes are references to once being in Alterac Valley."}

Similar to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, Korthia is inhabited by &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s but also its own strange creatures, and the area contains many mysteries and secrets of the &lt;a href=\"First%20Ones\"&gt;First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The Jailer is searching for these secrets in the hopes of finding the key to fulfill his twisted vision for the Shadowlands. Korthia was hidden away in the In-Between to hide things that the races of the Shadowlands didn't want people like the Jailer to find.\nKorthia was controlled by the &lt;a href=\"Fatescribe%20Roh-Kalo\"&gt;Fatescribe Roh-Kalo&lt;/a&gt; and an Archivist who kept track of the records. The Archivist, currently &lt;a href=\"Archivist%20Roh-Suir\"&gt;Archivist Roh-Suir&lt;/a&gt;, wields a &lt;a href=\"%3ALodestaff\"&gt;:Lodestaff&lt;/a&gt; capable of locating any artifact, usually powered by &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Netherstar\"&gt;:the Netherstar&lt;/a&gt;. Korthia being stolen by the Jailer has torn the very fabric of the Shadowlands. Before the &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; was taken by the Jailer, he had entrusted his sigil to Korthia.\nGetting there.\nPlayers initially access Korthia via the &lt;a href=\"Beastwarrens\"&gt;Beastwarrens&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;, southeast of &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;. They quickly unlock a &lt;a href=\"Waystone%20to%20Oribos%20%28Korthia%29\"&gt;Waystone to Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, which activates its pair in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an &lt;a href=\"Animaflow%20Teleporter\"&gt;Animaflow Teleporter&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Ve'nari's Refuge&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nWhen compared to the Maw, Korthia is a traditional zone, with multiple quest chains and a daily quest hub.\nPlayers travel to Korthia alongside &lt;a href=\"Ve%27nari\"&gt;Ve'nari&lt;/a&gt; to unlock access to a new &lt;a href=\"Waystone%20to%20Oribos%20%28Korthia%29\"&gt;Waystone to Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the covenant combatants to freely cross over to the zone and back.\nLater, they go on some exploration and recovery missions to locate the missing fatescribe and recover a Shadowlands relic.\nWildlife.\nThree new types of wildlife have been found in Korthia, as well as two new types of &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s:\nRares and treasures.\nA great number of daily-lootable rares and containers, and one-time lootable treasures are found in &lt;a href=\"Korthia\"&gt;Korthia&lt;/a&gt; (as well as next door in the Maw...).\nRares.\nFour rares in Korthia are on a rotation, and may or may not spawn each day: &lt;a href=\"Consumption%20%28Korthia%29\"&gt;Consumption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kroke%20the%20Tormented\"&gt;Kroke the Tormented&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Reliwik%20the%20Defiant\"&gt;Reliwik the Defiant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zelnithop\"&gt;Zelnithop&lt;/a&gt;. Not all rares in the table below are actually in Korthia - several are also in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;.\nTreasures.\nThere are ten one-time lootable treasures in Korthia and &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt; of the Maw, all required for &lt;a href=\"Treasures%20of%20Korthia\"&gt;Treasures of Korthia&lt;/a&gt;.\nRelic Fragment lootables.\nPlayers can repeatedly loot &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Fragment\"&gt;Relic Fragment&lt;/a&gt;-containing lootables once a day per spawn. Some lootable types (like &lt;a href=\"Invasive%20Mawshroom\"&gt;Invasive Mawshroom&lt;/a&gt;s) have multiple spawn locations each day, so players will be able to loot more than one of some types.\nReputations.\nTwo reputation factions are based in Korthia: &lt;a href=\"Death%27s%20Advance\"&gt;Death's Advance&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Archivists%27%20Codex\"&gt;Archivists' Codex&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Death's Advance represents the combined might of the four covenants after coming through to Korthia. Reputation is gained by completing &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign%23Korthia%20dailies\"&gt;three to five daily quests&lt;/a&gt; from a large set of rotating questgivers.\nThe Archivists' Codex is comprised of Korthian attendants devoted to collecting and storing the many relics found in the Shadowlands over the eons. Reputation gains derive from turning in &lt;a href=\"Relic%20Fragment\"&gt;Relic Fragment&lt;/a&gt;-containing items, found on the corpses of rare enemies and inside lootable objects in the zone.\nCollectables.\nA number of mounts and combat pets are found in Korthia:\nMounts.\nTo check progress on the three repeatable mounts, use these macros:\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

This mastery also extends to his fighting style, which uses magic based around amber to harm others and protect himself from death.\nBiography.\nKorven the Prime was the first of the &lt;a href=\"Klaxxi\"&gt;Klaxxi&lt;/a&gt; to become a &lt;a href=\"paragon\"&gt;paragon&lt;/a&gt;, having first suggested the idea, and invented the preservation chamber that utilizes kypari amber to enable the preservation process. Not only that, but he was also known for his prowess on the battlefield; such was his skill that it was said that he could cheat death itself. He was thus bestowed with the title of \"Prime\".\nAs the creator of the process, Korven knew that the sustaining properties of the amber, while it would last for generations, is in fact finite, and the preserved subject runs the risk of death if not released from stasis before the power of the amber is depleted. However, he also felt that the potential gain, namely protecting their species, outweighed the risks.\nDuring the development of the chamber, Korven carefully documented his work, which apparently was kept for posterity. The later paragon &lt;a href=\"Kaz%27tik%20the%20Manipulator\"&gt;Kaz'tik the Manipulator&lt;/a&gt; used the extensive notes to create his own modified version to preserve &lt;a href=\"Kovok\"&gt;Kovok&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"kunchong\"&gt;kunchong&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore he was chosen to become the first paragon, Korven was given the honor of planting &lt;a href=\"Kypari%20Zar\"&gt;Kypari Zar&lt;/a&gt;. He apparently has a certain fondness for this tree, and after being revived he takes steps to ease its suffering once he discovers that it is dying.\nWhen freed, he offers the Painkillers augmentation, a buff that brings you to full health upon being hit with a fatal attack.\nSome time later after he was awakened by the &lt;a href=\"%3AWakener\"&gt;:Wakener&lt;/a&gt;, he joined &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;, who obtained the heart of &lt;a href=\"Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt;."}

For centuries, the Kosh'harg was held twice each year near the holy mountain of &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt; on the orcs' homeworld of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. The tradition was one of many that were lost during the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, but was revived decades later on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; on the initiative of &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenor.\nOn Draenor, the orc clans were generally insular and independent due to vast differences in culture, dress, religious dogma, and dialects. However, the elders of all clans recognized the importance of meeting to discuss various matters, and thus the Kosh'harg was created and honored. The Kosh'harg began as a biannual gathering of &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the orcs first learned the arts of shamanism, around 800 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;. However, it soon grew to include all orcs.\nThe Kosh'harg took place twice a year, once during the spring and once the autumn, in honor of the time when day and night are the same length. It was mostly held in the shadow of &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, the \"Mountain of Spirits\" in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;. Any violence or vendettas pursued during the event was strictly forbidden and held grave consequences, since Nagrand was considered holy ground. The length of the festival depended on how many pressing concerns needed to be addressed, but such matters were a rarity, and the gathering shifted much more to the mood of a festival rather than a commune. Many Kosh'hargs were simply meet-and-greets to catch up and see old faces once more, becoming a rare time when the clans could put aside their rivalries, share news, foster ties, and feast in friendship.\nThe center piece of every Kosh'harg was a great feast placed at an altar within view of Oshu'gun, meant to draw the spirits of the ancestors and make them feel included in the festivities. Every attending clan could contribute a meal of their own making to the feast, to bring honor to themselves in the ancestors' eyes. Sometimes, specific favorite foods of the deceased were placed in order to summon them. Along with food, ale and other alcohol was also traditionally included. The cook &lt;a href=\"Barasha\"&gt;Barasha&lt;/a&gt; collected recipes from all the clans at each Kosh'harg in her cookbook, \"&lt;a href=\"%3ASpoons%20and%20Forks\"&gt;:Spoons and Forks&lt;/a&gt;\".\nBefore the reformation, &lt;a href=\"half-breed\"&gt;half-breed&lt;/a&gt;s like &lt;a href=\"half-draenei\"&gt;half-draenei&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27nathal\"&gt;Mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt; were not welcome at the Kosh'harg as they were considered lesser than true orcs.\nNotable Kosh'hargs.\nAfter centuries of practice, the Kosh'harg tradition eventually died out with Draenor's destruction.\nRevival on Azeroth.\nFollowing the formation of &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; felt that although the orcs had found a place on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, they had lost their way as a people due to the loss of their old traditions. Long before the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, he began to wish for the Kosh'harg's return, but &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; told him that \"This is no time for dead traditions\".\nIn 40 &lt;a href=\"ADP\"&gt;ADP&lt;/a&gt;, after the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg felt that the time was right and went to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; with an orc &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to speak to &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt; about reviving the Kosh'harg. At the same time, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aggralan\"&gt;Aggralan&lt;/a&gt;, and their children happened to be visiting Drek'Thar. Drek'Thar agreed with Eitrigg's suggestion, and Aggralan suggested that they could offer the orcs more than just a reunion by simultaneously introducing a new rite of passage, the &lt;a href=\"om%27gora\"&gt;om'gora&lt;/a&gt;, to replace the old &lt;a href=\"om%27riggor\"&gt;om'riggor&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer was chosen to be the first to undergo the om'gora, and Drek'Thar appointed Aggralan as the one who would preside over the Kosh'harg and judge the hero's rite.\nThe first Kosh'harg of Azeroth was held in &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall and Eitrigg assembled the clans and invited many orcs from all across Azeroth and &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, including groups who'd had a troubled history with the Horde (like the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;) and ones who were normally not invited to such events (like the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27nathal\"&gt;Mok'nathal&lt;/a&gt;). The festival was enough of a standout event to bring even reclusive individuals like &lt;a href=\"Shokia\"&gt;Shokia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; out of hiding. As part of their om'gora, the adventurer created a &lt;a href=\"Feast%20for%20the%20Ancestors\"&gt;feast for the ancestors&lt;/a&gt;, summoning the spirits of Varok Saurfang and other famous orcs of recent history to give their blessing.\nOnce the hero completed the rite, the Kosh'harg transitioned into a feast in their honor, with plenty of eating, drinking, and drunken brawling. Thrall then held a speech to the crowd to celebrate the adventurer's accomplishment, after which Aggralan performed the ceremony to bring the festival to a close. Altogether, the first Kosh'harg of Azeroth was deemed to be a great success, one that inspired hope of a new, bright age for the orcs as a people."}

However during the battle, Kova and Miles almost quarreled. After this, they went to Gadgetzan. While Kova was getting information about the directions, Miles stayed in an inn.

Williden warned them to watch out of animals, especially &lt;a href=\"King%20Mosh\"&gt;King Mosh&lt;/a&gt;. The two continued to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;Fire Plume Ridge&lt;/a&gt; and as they were about to enter, a human rogue from Gadgetzan, Bellthazor, caught Miles. Bellthazor mocked at them, because he knew about their quest. Miles was able to free himself but Bellthazor escaped. The two then continued atop of the ridge, to a cave, where they found Dhambeela. After they got down from the ridge, they were attacked by both, &lt;a href=\"King%20Mosh\"&gt;King Mosh&lt;/a&gt; and Bellthazor, who kidnapped Dhambeela and escaped with her. Kova had to fight him alone, because Mosh had stunned Miles. However, her shamanistic powers were not enough for the beast. Thankfully, Miles showed up and defeated Mosh. Dhambeela showed up, being freed of Bellthazor.\nAfter this, Kova thanked Miles for saving her life and returned to the base of Thunder Bluff where &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; happened to be there. There Dhambeela reunited with Magatha and Kova thanked Magatha that she could realize that there is nothing wrong with accepting a help."}

Despite the corruption, he still cares about their safety even if he cannot remove the corruption.\nHistory.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nKrag'wa's followers used to bring him offerings of meat from around the Frogmarsh. Long ago, when the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt; first began listening to &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;the whispering darkness&lt;/a&gt;, Krag'wa stored some of his power in the totems that surround his lair for future keeping.\nAs Krag'wa was unwilling to bend to the will of &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt;, the great frog came under attack by the &lt;a href=\"blood%20troll\"&gt;blood troll&lt;/a&gt;s. They drained his children of their blood and planned to sacrifice Krag'wa himself. They slew every last one of his worshipers in Nazmir. From all of this, Krag'wa was greatly weakened and had to be made strong again. After restoring his power by eating a feast and releasing the power sealed in his totems, Krag'wa unleashed his fury on the blood trolls.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; also attacked Krag'wa and his children, seeking to sate their addiction to magic by draining them and his champions. After the naga were dealt with, he accepted &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Hunter%20Narez\"&gt;Shadow Hunter Narez&lt;/a&gt; as his follower.\nKrag'wa participated in the final charge against the blood trolls led by &lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt;. He cleared through many blood trolls, opening the way to their leader &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Ma%27da%20Ateena\"&gt;Grand Ma'da Ateena&lt;/a&gt;. He also participated in the defense of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and his forces sought to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Seal\"&gt;Great Seal&lt;/a&gt;. He held off blood trolls coming from the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Gate\"&gt;Blood Gate&lt;/a&gt;.\nTides of Vengeance.\nThe loa assisted the &lt;a href=\"Conclave%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;Conclave of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn accordance of the ritual of queens and kings, Talanji sought the judgment of the loa. During the trial, Krag'wa tested how far Talanji would go to sacrifice for her people and her commitment to defend the weak.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nYou are a friend to the frogs.

The first type are &lt;a href=\"giant%20squid\"&gt;giant squid&lt;/a&gt;-like creatures with tentacles. The second type are more &lt;a href=\"fish\"&gt;fish&lt;/a&gt;-like with giant fins and smaller in size.\nAside from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, there are also kraken on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nSquid-like.\nOne version of the kraken are huge squid-like creatures with four eyes and eight appendages, often referred to as leviathans around &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. They are servants of &lt;a href=\"Neptulon%20the%20Tidehunter\"&gt;Neptulon the Tidehunter&lt;/a&gt; and normally dwell in the &lt;a href=\"Abyssal%20Maw\"&gt;Abyssal Maw&lt;/a&gt; and not on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;; however, fossils and tales suggest that the mighty creatures have been visiting Azeroth for millennia. &lt;a href=\"Ozumat\"&gt;Ozumat&lt;/a&gt; is the patriarch of all kraken. Not much is known about them, although &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Leviathan\"&gt;Ancient Leviathan&lt;/a&gt;s can be found at various points in the seas of &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible they are one of the squid-like krakken mentioned in &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Legends\"&gt;troll legends&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Depths\"&gt;Forlorn Depths&lt;/a&gt; outside the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; are a massive breeding ground for kraken, filled with large, incubating kraken eggs.\nFish-like.\nThe second type of kraken are more fish-like, with armored hides, giant fins, large mouths, dorsal spikes, and a horizontal tail reminiscent of whale flukes. They have scales, but do not appear to have visible gills. Little lore has been given about them.\nFollowing their reappearance in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; sought to free the kraken &lt;a href=\"Leviroth\"&gt;Leviroth&lt;/a&gt; imprisoned five hundred years ago by &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. The kvaldir were trying to use it on the naga of Riplash, or on the tuskarr of the coast, or possibly on any living things that happen to be standing in the way. Far in the upper reaches of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, north of the newly constructed &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament%20Grounds\"&gt;Argent Tournament Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, was once the fishing village of &lt;a href=\"Tualiq\"&gt;Tualiq&lt;/a&gt;. This small tuskarr village was also attacked by the kvaldir and was quickly overrun, the bodies of slain Tualiq villagers littering the icy beaches. &lt;a href=\"Drottinn%20Hrothgar\"&gt;Drottinn Hrothgar&lt;/a&gt; led the kvaldir in this region, and the kvaldir seem to have one motive in mind - to summon a kraken from the depths of the Northrend seas. The ships of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; on these waters fought the &lt;a href=\"kvaldir\"&gt;kvaldir&lt;/a&gt; back from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;'s main shore and had to slay the &lt;a href=\"North%20Sea%20Kraken\"&gt;kraken&lt;/a&gt; they kept summoning, with the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Following the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that the &lt;a href=\"Hrothgar%27s%20Landing\"&gt;Hrothgar's Landing&lt;/a&gt; is still under the control of the kvaldir, and their &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir%20Deepcaller\"&gt;deepcallers&lt;/a&gt; are still bringing up krakens to attack any ship that tries to pass through the strait.\nAnother kraken is in an unlikely location - just off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt;, where the beam from the lighthouse disrupts its rest. If the lighthouse is lit, &lt;a href=\"Tethyr\"&gt;Tethyr&lt;/a&gt; will rise from the depths and attack the city. Players can kill Tethyr and ensure that Theramore remains undisturbed.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lurker%20Below\"&gt;The Lurker Below&lt;/a&gt; that is found in Serpentshrine Cavern is another kraken, though how he got to the shattered remains of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; is unexplained. This kraken appears to serve as a guard for &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, and it is entirely possible the beast is simply under Vashj's control.\nAnother \"kraken\" - or rather, kraken model - is the sea goddess &lt;a href=\"Oacha%27noa\"&gt;Oacha'noa&lt;/a&gt;, a possible &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; spirit that the tuskarr revere. Players are sent to ask for Oacha'noa's guidance in regards to the problems plaguing the tuskarr village of &lt;a href=\"Indu%27le\"&gt;Indu'le&lt;/a&gt; - which is the fault of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;' tamperings with ley lines. Oacha'noa asks players to deliver a message that the tuskarr must stand and fight alongside &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; against Malygos and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;; otherwise, the spirits of the tuskarr will be destroyed by the evil rising in Northrend. Oacha'noa seems to have nothing to do with the other kraken - she's simply a sea goddess that took on kraken form.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Manta\"&gt;Manta&lt;/a&gt; may have been a giant kraken."}

His fame began when he posted a thread called \"Warlock staff users\" in the Warlock Forums of the &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; website May 16, &lt;a href=\"2005\"&gt;2005&lt;/a&gt;. The post asked readers to post information about the two-handed staff they preferred to use in the game. This idea was nothing new, however the manner in which Kralnor asked the readers to post was original.\nSince his last post, he has become a level 48 warlock, but has not logged in for some time.\nSimilar posts include &lt;a href=\"Alamo\"&gt;Alamo&lt;/a&gt; for druids, for paladins, and for shamans.\nThe original post.\nThe original post was fraught with grammar and spelling errors. It was also extremely vague and alluded to Kralnor getting in trouble somehow by being reported. It lacked any information about his own staff, yet did contain a comment about proofreading. The original post is as follows:\n\"I dont like to stress the fact that the warlock rocks, but he jus does,So, for all you staff users out there, feel free to come in and post, my staff is a good one, but here is how it goes\"\n\"1. post message in the room \"\n\"2. LOOK IT OVER \"\n\"3. dont report anything, i might get in trouble :) \"\n\"and 4. Have fun!!!\"\nThis simple post spawned a long thread of replies. At first, readers didn\u2019t know how to respond to this post. Several posted their staff and simply moved on. Many flamed Kralnor for his spelling and the post\u2019s lack of meaning or sense. \nKralnor later responded to all the questions with:\n\"ok, guys, how simple can you be? ITS A !&amp;$%ING TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS, if your not a staff user, \nGET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!!!! Jesus!!!!\"\nThe thread generated over 100 pages of posts. Once the thread hit 46 pages, many readers were unable to view any following pages due to a bug in the forum. This did not prevent users from posting or simply \"bumping\" the thread to the main page of the forum. Warlocks composed songs and poems, speculated about the poster, made websites and even T-shirts. Kralnor never posted to the thread again after his initial \"GET... OUT\" reply. When the thread was finally deleted from the forum, it had been responded to well over 1,200 times.

I must heavily credit Havoq who wrote the original site (no longer hosted), \"The Book of Kralnor\" who's work I borrowed from liberally, rewrote portions of and drew from as an inspiration. Thank you!\nBackground.\nKralnor, or as his followers call him \"The great and mystic Lord Kralnor,\" is a warlock of legend among the denizens of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. He was a gifted orator and powerful seer, well versed in the arts of demoncraft, who arose at a time when the warlocks at large needed a leader. \nLife in these un-dark times was a bitter struggle for those magick-users who had chosen the Fel Path, training and practicing their craft in secrecy, shunned from all societies bar the Forsaken. Their powers were also stifled by frequent and barbaric restrictions imposed on warlocks worldwide at this time, by the brutal overlords. \nSome claim these restrictions (legislated as the Notion of Energy-based-magic Restrictions (-Fel) of 0.6.1 or 'NERF') were an attempt to prevent those hardy souls from reaching their full and terrifying potential, outlined in the conspiracy theory \"Warlocks - R Ovrpowerd lol\" (which is still widely thought to be fact by many, who frequently bombard warlock publications with cries of NERF LOCKS. Warlock theorists propose the idea that these are intended as cruel reminders of the Un-Dark Ages, a threat to warlocks to toe the line lest the NERF Act be invoked again.)\nIt was into this downhearted and tumultuous climate that Kralnor appeared, with words of wisdom to hearten and give courage to his fellow casters. His first declaration to his colleagues has become known as the Post of Enlightenment, the first of his two (recognized) works. (See &lt;a href=\"Kralnor%20%28alternative%29%23Recent%20Findings\"&gt;Recent Findings&lt;/a&gt;.)\nSo ahead of his time was he, that many mocked or dismissed his proclamations to the warlock community with rallying cries of \"WTF?!\" \nThis roughly translates from Demonic as \"Your words are too confusing for my mind to comprehend, please elaborate?!\" Yet Kralnor did not see fit to explain further at this time, leaving his children in turmoil, locked in furious debates over his meaning.\nHowever, after deep meditation and thought, some courageous pioneers of the community broke through the walls of self-doubt and confusion in their nether-twisted minds and saw the un-Light. Here they witnessed the work of a truly enlightened being, a hero to lead and guide the warlock community. An &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; to their dark crusade.\nNowadays Kralnoricism (the name given to the followers of Kralnor) has become one of the most widely recognised sects in the world. Like any great following, there have been troubled times, including the Great Schism of 0.8 (when the Church of the Staves broke off from the main group following the controversial and divisive translation known as [NGV] or \"New Gutterspeak Version\" of Kralnor's writings was produced.) as well as the \"Get Your Ass Out!!\" Purges of 1.1.02. \n=The Book of Kralnor=\nA Guide to Warlock Staff - The Book of Kralnor.\n\"To staff of warlock none compare\"\n\"Leaves its enemies seeing double\"\n\"To defy its power none would dare\"\n\"Don't report anything, I might get in trouble\"\nIn the history of Azeroth, few mighty spell casters have wielded the warlock's staff with more mastery than the great Kralnor. His epic level 11 staff was one of such great power, than any mortal who even heard its name would be stricken with blindness and boils, suffering greatly before dying of a crushed mind.\nKralnor, in his great wisdom, saw fit to save us from this terrible death by omitting the name of his great staff from the now legendary writings of the Book of Kralnor. This first revelation, now known as the Post of Enlightenment, was seen by many as foolishness at first. The complexity of the wisdom it held confounded and confused even the most gifted of minds, leaving many to dismiss it as foolishness. But, over time and with much study, the true brilliance of the Post of Enlightenment was finally beheld and a new era of warlock staff was born into existence.\nHis second revelation, known as the Post of Deeper Thought, was to follow some time after.\nHere follows the original un-translated Post of Enlightenment, followed by a brief synopsis to help those of a lesser mind comprehend its full meaning...\n\" \"I dont like to stress the fact that the warlock rocks, but he jus does. So, for all you staff users out there, feel free to come in and post, my staff is a good one, but here is how it goes \"\nNow viewed as the guidelines for warlock staff usage, the Four Commandments of the Post of Enlightenment may baffle the reader at first. Let us take it step by step and unlock the deeper secrets of this great wisdom.\nKralnor's preamble to The Post.\n\" \"I don't like to stress the fact that the warlock rocks, but he jus does\" \"\nKralnor starts his revelation by showing great humility and at the same moment, great strength. He obviously shows us that the thought that a warlock \"rocks\" is not just an opinion, but rather \"fact\". Still, even in the light of that fact, he doesn't like to stress it. \nMany view this as the Teacher giving us an example for daily warlock life. Humility is not a trait often naturally cultivated by warlocks, so Kralnor encourages us here to follow his example. Clearly warlocks \"rock\" but don't stress it. This ideal is held by some Kralnoric scholars to be one of his most influential teachings, and at the same time, one of the harder for his disciples to follow.\nInstead he describes his feelings using the demonic tongue. \"But he jus does\" is regarded as the most perfect phrase ever uttered by any warlock teacher. The words \"he jus\" is a demonic phrase that translates into orcish, quite literally as \"they\".\nSo, in its common tongue, the sentence would read \"I don't like to stress the fact that the warlock rock, but they does\". Most scholars agree that it is acceptable to overlook the seemingly poor grammar of this sentence as Kralnor's passion and wisdom make up for it.\nNow, onto the commandments:\nThe First Commandment.\n\"1. post message in the room\"\nScholars agree that \"the room\" refers to the warlock state of mind. So, with that, we can plainly see that Kralnor's intent was that we \"post\" (keep) his great message in our constant and collective consciousness. The First Commandment could be paraphrased as \"Remember my teachings and spread the word.\"\nMany warlocks tattoo the text of the Post of Enlightenment on their body (apart from the Forsaken warlocks, for whom that would be an exercise in futility. They instead opt to embroider their robes with passages from the text.) in an effort to obey the First Commandment. While others choose to chant portions of the Book as a mantra, hoping that by \"posting\" his message in their consciousness or \"room\" they can take on Kralnor's wisdom sub-consciously also.\nKralnoric ikons or talismans are popular items in markets and tourist hot-spots in both Horde and Alliance towns and often contain popular passages from his works inscribed on miniature staves or STAFFS.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/%3Fnpc%3D5173%23comments\"&gt;Alexander Calder&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge has made a veritable fortune hawking Kralnoric trinkets for years to hapless tourists and fresh-faced young warlocks who have just arrived in \"The Big Smoke\" from outlying regions such as Elwynn and Coldridge Valley.\n\"These kids will pay good gold for any old hunk o'shite if I write '2. LOOK IT OVER' on it\" - Alexander Calder boasts unabashedly about his booming trade.\nThe Second Commandment.\n\"2. LOOK IT OVER\"\nThe second commandment is often confused as simply a restatement of the first. This is not so. It is in fact referring to the staff of Kralnor and his desire for us to behold it. However, as stated before, this knowledge would surely kill us. So, to protect the readers, Kralnor omitted the name of his great staff, instead prompting us to look at the blank space below his words and contemplate the deeper meaning of staves. Also note the use of capital letters in this commandment. This holds the reader's attention, making them read the commandment over and over, searching for deeper meaning. This meditation is intentional and should be seen as progress toward better staff usage.\nIt is also interesting to note that in the NGV [New Gutterspeak Version] of the Book of Kralnor, this capitalization was removed in favour of what was seen as \"correct\" punctuation. The affects of this change were catastrophic as it caused a rift in the fellowship of Kralnor. Followers of the original text felt that the loss of capitalization caused readers to skip the meditation and proceeded to the 3rd commandment far too quickly. Readers of the NGV argued that the new version was easier to read and recite and that minor changes to make the language more \"modern\" didn't change the writing message. To this day the traditional temples of Kralnoricism still use the original version while those who split to form the \"Church of the Staves\" prefer the NGV. Still, most scholars agree that the message behind the text is very similar in both translations and the differences between the two religious sects are simply a denominational disagreement.\nThe Third Commandment.\n\"3. dont report anything, i might get in trouble :)\"\nOften seen as the breaking point for many followers, the 3rd commandment is by far the hardest to grapple. Lord Halibethor of the Church of Staves in Undercity, wrote an excellent (yet controversial) book entitled \"The 3rd Commandment of Kralnor: Reporters Among Us\". In this, Halibethor contests that the 3rd commandment is in fact a coded message designed to be deciphered in conjunction with prophecy. He cites that the words alone hold a deep meaning, yet arranged as they are in this sentence, seem to be meaningless. Halibethor claims that the key to unlocking this secret coded message lies with Kralnor's illegitimate son who's existence has been kept under wraps for years by the \"government\" within the Kralnoric church. He believes that only when the followers demand that the church reveal these secrets will the mystery of the 3rd commandment truly be understood.\nMore traditional scholars simply attest that the 3rd commandment warns warlock followers about the danger of telling others about the great staff of Kralnor and its power. Most followers are satisfied by this explanation as it is an easy commandment to follow.\nThe Fourth Commandment.\n\"and 4. Have fun!!!\"\nBy far the most exciting of the commandments, the 4th tells us to have fun. Kralnor is encouraging his followers to experiment with their own staves (while at the same time not using them too much) and to share our excitement with each other. Most readers agree that this ends the Post of Enlightenment on a high-note and leaves you with a general sense of well-being and hope for the future.\nThe Post of Deeper Thought.\nKralnor's second proclammation, known as the Post of Deeper Thought, it is also sometimes referred to as the \"Message of Anger\". This message was issued after a time of great discussion, confusion and in the case of many, intolerable ignorance on the part of the warlock community. Few if any were able to perceive of the true meaning behind Kralnor's words. Although they struggled hard to come to terms with it, and many were willing, few were able. The community cried out for further wisdom from their leader and finally Kralnor obliged in the Post of Deeper Thought.\nThe words of the Post of Deeper Thought offer guidance on how to find, and follow, the path to true staff usage. Kralnor is clearly frustrated with the ignorance of the warlocks, but thankfully he is both wise and forgiving, and encourages his audience to delve deep within their own minds for the seed of understanding.\nHere is the original text of the Post of Deeper Thought...\n\" \"ok, guys, how simple can you be? ITS A !&amp;$%ING TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS, if your not a staff user, GET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!!!! Jesus!!!!\" \"\nThis, for years, had been accepted by many as the definitive version of this great document. However, more recently, the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens%20Chat\"&gt;Barrens Tablet&lt;/a&gt; has helped Kralnorian scholars translate hitherto unreadable portions of the writings, giving us a complete translation, and therefore a more full understanding of Kralnor's message. This tablet may offer many clues as to the origins and meaning of many unintelligible words found in ancient scriptures, not just those of Kralnoric origins.\nThe full translation is: (new portions in bold)\n\" \"ok, guys, how simple can you be? ITS A FUCKING TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS, if your not a staff user,\nGET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!!!! Jesus!!!!\" \"\nNotice that the word once thought to be \"!&amp;$%ING\" is in fact \"FUCKING\". This changes much of what we thought we understood from this post. \nBelow you will see one interpretation of this text, by the much respected Orc warlock Zuphinkra...\n\"...In the Post of Deeper Thought, Kralnor is asking us to face our own limitation and rise above them. He's asking us \"how simple can we be\" or in other words \"why do we not understand the power of the staff\"? He proceeds to tell us \"it's a fucking topic about staff users\". He realizes our minds were too shallow to fully grasp the wisdom of his first revelation so he's chosen to reiterate that fact. Finally, he calls for an unholy purge of the warlock religion, casting out all those who do not aspire to the greatness of the staff by saying \"if your not a staff user, GET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!!!!\". Its also interesting to see that he names one specific non-staff user that must be removed from the warlock fellowship: \"Jesus!!!!\". We're still not sure who he's talking about.\"\nAs for the second half of the second post:\nGET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!!!! Jesus!!!!\" \"\nOver the lifetime of Kralnoricism, many have attempted this great \"purge\". Temples and churches all over Azeroth have held \"Get your ass out\" tent meetings. The most successful was one held by Kralnorvangelist Dhruktar in which over 1000 warlocks laid down their daggers to pick up staves instead. Many were asked what was said that made them finally see the error of their ways and the most common answer was, \"when Dhruktar pointed out that holding your dagger was a sin it just made sense. We'd never looked at it that way before, but he was right.\"\nHowever, this author, having studied the Kralnoric texts for many years proposes a new, and admittedly controversial, interpretation of the first portion of the message.\nBy \" \"ok, guys, how simple can you be?\" \" the great one is not admonishing us for our ignorance, but rather challenging us to clear our minds, and take on the simplicity of a Zen-like state. It is a literal question, not a rhetorical one.\nHow simple can you be? Can you be simpler? He is guiding us along the path, and the next step we must take along the way to becoming great staff users is to empty our minds, and become like newbies or level 1s. \"Let the little ones come to me\" he says. Given that Lord Kralnor had achieved this mastery of staff wielding and wondrous wisdom at the tender age of lvl 11, it shows that one need not be lvl 60 to \"rock\" as all warlocks possess the necessary tools, known as the B's:\nThis author claims evidence for this interpretation (tentatively titled \"The Simplicity Challenge of the Post of Deeper Thought\") can be seen in his opening words \" \"ok, guys,\" \" obviously meant to be friendly and welcoming. This shows that this first sentence is meant for his devotees. It also gives us insight into Kralnor's view on gender discrimination. We are all created equal, man and woman, (allowing of course for racial talents and base stat differences) therefore by \" \"guys\" \" he means all, not just male warlocks.\n=After the Post=\nAfter posting this final message to his followers, Kralnor was never heard from again (though recent findings may change this, see Recent Findings). There has been rampant speculation as to his activities after the final post but no conclusive results. Many attempts were made to find the hermit warlock, but even the special forces groups such as Armory have been unable to locate him. This process is further convoluted by the massive influx of new warlocks sporting the name Kralnor in honor of their wise leader. However, there has been some evidence as to his activities.\nA picture depicting Kralnor was found in a cavern in the southern Barrens. This matches up with official speculation: as a level 11 Orc, Kralnor would likely have traveled in the Barrens. Though the image depicts Kralnor holding a staff, it is unlikely that this is HIS staff as many others are seen around him. In fact, many believe that the image depicts a staff making ceremony over which Kralnor was presiding. To the average warlock, having the great Kralnor enchant your staffs would of course be an action worth recording, hence the creation of this image to remember the event.\nAnother image depicting an Orc warlock was soon found. This image shows the Orc standing over a defeated gnome and wielding a staff of indistinguishable design. Many Kralnoricists have speculated that this Orc is indeed their great leader. Research was made into the Arena records and it was discovered that an Orc warlock by the name of Kralnor did indeed register in the tournament. However, critics claim that this is not substantial proof; there are many orc warlocks who have taken Kralnor's name.\n=The Book of Kralnor 4th Edition=\nThe Book of Kralnor 4th Edition was complied by Havoq under the supervision of the Unholy Seminary of Kralnoristic Thought. It presents the original translation of our great lord Kralnor\u2019s words as given to Orcdom in the Post of Enlightenment and Post of Deeper Thought.\nPreface by its author, The Lesser Prophet Havoq.\nThough none of us may ever fully realize the brilliance of what Kralnor was trying to tell us, we can take comfort in the knowledge that through his unholy words we may find the gift of true warlockdom. His perfect logic and sometimes god-like wisdom bend the minds of us mere mortals. But, perhaps by striving to be more like Kralnor we will find that we\u2019ve made a better version of ourselves; a version that understands the mysteries of life. We can become warlocks who can proudly say, \u201cmy staff is a good one, but here is how it goes.\u201d\n=Recent Findings=\nFor years the Book of Kralnor has been presented as the complete and definitive works of Kralnor, however there is recently discovered evidence to suggest that he did in fact issue a third proclamation.\nScrolls were uncovered in a small cave by the goats of the author, whilst living near the coast of the Great Sea.\nDubbed by some as the Great Sea Books or Great Sea Papers, the fragile papyrus scraps were stored carefully in clay pots or jars, thus preserving the astonishing writings within.\nThis author worked feverishly for many minutes months to translate the scrolls, and can now reveal the contents of them here for the first time.\nKralnor writes:\n\" \"wow, just wow. i didnt know people could be SOOO simple. ITS A TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS, IF YOU DONT HAVE A STAFF, OR ARE NOT A FAN OF STAFFS, GET THE HECK OUT OF MY TOPIC!!!!!!!!\" \"\nSo important was this revelation to Kralnor that he felt it necessary to issue it not once, but twice to the warlock community in quick succession. See &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.saichotictech.net/Others/Kralnor/Kralnorp5.htm\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (posts 91 &amp; 92.)\nWarlockian scholars predict this finding could shake the very foundations of Kralnoricism as well as cause lengthy debates within the Church of the Staves, who may see this as a call for a second Purge of non-staff users from warlock ranks.\nHowever modern Kralnorists believe the Church wants to suppress these writings (also known as the Simultaneously Third &amp; Fourth Gospels of Kralnor) because of the inclusive statement:\n\"OR ARE NOT A FAN OF STAFFS\"\nTraditionalist Kralnoristic temples and conservative members of the Church of the Staves are united in their disdain of \"fence-sitters\" (warlocks who enjoy staves but don't necessarily use one themselves) and feel that in this edict Kralnor gives solace to these lost souls, inviting them to be included in his \"TOPIC.\"\nYounger more radical members of the Church of the Staves have even proposed changing its name to \"THE TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS\" rather than \"Church of the Staves\" in deference to Kralnor's own words. Nowhere in any of his decrees does he ever refer to the plural of \"staff\" as \"staves\", therefore they believe that this introduction of the word \"staves\" to be heresy.\nOne warlock writes:\n\"Who are we to give our own name to Kralnoricism. Only Lord Kralnor may truly define us, as our omniscient and mystic leader. If he calls this a TOPIC, it is not for me to disagree!\" -Anonymous Warlock on the naming of the Sect\nAnother theory stands that perhaps Kralnor was warning the church or TOPIC that there are unfaithful among them. \"By specifically mentioning those who are not \"A FAN OF STAFFS\", he implies that there are Warlocks among us that do not truly accept the staff as the correct method, but merely wield one to appear devout. In this statement, Kralnor is cementing the notion that in order to be a true follower of Kralnoricism one must embrace the staff fully, not merely because he is told or because it serves him best. He is warning his followers that dagger and sword users hide among them pretending to be staff users, and that these people must be purged from the TOPIC.\" \n-Scholar on the Great Sea Papers.\nFearing another schism, high ranking leaders of both Kralnoristic temples and the Church of the Staves have commissioned further research and scholastic study of the texts, to ascertain if in fact they are of Kralnor himself, and for the possible purposes of including them in The Book of Kralnor.\nRecently a schematic for a staff of great power was found in a cave in the Barrens. The cave held the remnants of powerful rituals and demonic residue, leading many to believe that it once housed a coven, or rather, a TOPIC of warlocks. The design for the powerful staff had many notes scribbled in the margins, among which was the note \"This is a good one\". Many take this as a design of Kralnor's staff, others scoff at the idea, as no mortal mind could conceive of the staff. Therefore, they consider this Kralnor's last and most powerful legacy, a staff he designed for his mortal followers. However, others believe that this is merely an attempt by devout Kralnoricists at creating a staff worthy of Kralnor. Despite which may be true, it is agreed that this hypothetical staff would be more powerful than any seen before.\nMore information as it comes to hand on these exciting developments.\n=Addendums=\nAddendum One: The First Hymn of Kralnor.\nFollowers of the staff have written their own thoughts and interpretations of the teachings of Kralnor. While this author personally feels this hymn is better suited to the Under Level 10 School , they will faithfully represent it here, as one of the few published.\nThe First Hymn of Kralnor\n\"Shadows!\"\n\"Elements!\"\n\"Tongues!\"\n\"Weakness!\"\n\"Agony!\"\n\"GOOOO Kralnor!\"\n\"With your powers combined I am Captain Kralnor!\"\n\"Captain Kralnor, he's our hero,\"\n\"Gonna take the daggers down to zero,\"\n\"he's our curses, amplified,\"\n\"And he's fighting on the warlock side\"\n\"Captain Kralnor, he's our hero,\"\n\"Gonna take the off-hands down to zero,\"\n\"Gonna help him put us asunder,\"\n\"Bad guys who like to go report him.\"\n\" \"You'll pay for this Captain Kralnor!\" \"\n\"(chanting)\"\n\"We are the warlocks,\"\n\"You can be one too!\"\n\" 'Cause using cool staves is the thing to do,\"\n\"Off-hands and daggers is not the way,\"\n\"Hear what Captain Kralnor has to say:\"\n\"LOOK IT OVER!!\"\n\"Thank you.\"\nAddendum Two: The Lesser Prophets: Vaaleglo, Canto, Havoq and Blaq.\nThe Word of Vaaleglo:.\n\"Warlocks are not a good class because they ar\" -Vaaleglo\nThis recent revelation has rocked the followers of Kralnor causing much confusion and disagreement among the brethren. To date, the best attempt at clarity over the Word of Vaaleglo is found in the writing of Mastema...\n\"Warlocks are not a good class because they ar[e]. I take this to mean that simply by existing, warlocks are \"not a good class.\" This is not to say we are bad. We could be the average class, or perhaps even the great class.\nIndeed, by leaving us, the viewing public, with such a phrase, the OP has continued one of the most primal debates in WoW; that is, where does each class stack?\nBut in order to answer this, one must first ask, \"What does one use to compare classes?\" Are we stacking in terms of PvE, Duelling, or group PvP?\nIt seems that this question could be answered a number of ways. Yet, we know two fundamental things to be certain.\nNow, if we were to combine these two truths, we would see the supreme and final truth:\nWarlocks are not a good class because they are a rocking one.\"\nThe frustration brought on by the Word of Vaaleglo is also voiced in this almost poetic outcry from Canto...\nThe Cry of Canto:.\n\"I'll assume that it's supposed to end with \"are\"\nSo, Warlocks are not a good class because they are. Is this supposed to spur a discussion, or is it simply a statement of the creator's opinion? I'll go with the second. And thus, it raises quite the conundrum.\n\"I think, therefor I am\"\n\"We think, therefor we ar\"\nSo, we aren't a good class because we exist. Perhaps we do lead a flawed existence \u2014 we've been nerfed more than all the other classes combined. Yet, the opposite cannot be true \u2014 that is, we are a good class if we don't exist. For how can a light be on if it does not exist?\nPlease, O wise warrior, what is your philosophical statement trying to tell us? I must know!\"\nThe Poem of Havoq:.\nSome saw fit to express their feelings through poetry, and while they were exiled shortly after by their peers for being mages, their fervour lives on. Here is a reproduction of one such poetic expression by Havoq.\n\"The Staff shall not be broken,\"\n\"and the warlocks not be slain,\"\n\" 'Tis we who melt thine faces,\"\n\"Our staves shall be thy pain!\"\nThe Interpretation of Blaq:.\nThis piece of writing was discovered by The Church of Staves while restoring a Kralnoric Temple, which had been attacked by a violent sect of non-staff users.\n\"Bah. I have reached the point in my meditations on Kralnor now where i need not use a staff, for I *am* my staff. Truly, the route to enlightenment is becoming one with your staff and seeing that the true power comes not from any ordinary stave you may wield, but the \"good one\" inside yourself - a staff of unbreakable power, providing the backbone for a warlock to suffer the slings and arrows of a wildly flailing nerfbat...\n\"After all, is it not so that we cannot wield staves initially, but must seek training in the major cities in order to do so? Kralnor saw this and realised that the true staff was the warlock himself - how else are lvl 1 warlocks supposed to have fun? Thus he acheived enlightenment. And hence the commandment to \"Look it over\" - overlook the material, the simplistic Staff or dagger you choose to wield, and see instead the inner staff, the spiritual staff which you must seek to become - unbending, unbreakable, and all powerful. Did kralnor himself not say \"my staff is a good one\"? Truly the words of a noble and enlightened master.\n\"Have fun,\n\"Look it over,\n\"Don't report anyone.\n\"Peace out :) \nThis writing presents a new, unique view on Kralnor's commandments, and how we are to carry on his legacy. The Unknown Prophet is assumed to have been killed with the attack on the Temple. This is unfortunate news to Kralnoric supporters, many of whom believe the Unknown Prophet was of a similar intellectual and spiritual level to Kralnor himself (or possibly in spiritual contact with Kralnor). Some also believe that the Unknown Prophet was to be the warlock's next Messiah, to save them from the increasing effects of the Notion of Energy-based-magic Restrictions (-Fel).\n=The Followers of Kralnor=\nThough the world may shun them or try to silence their voices, the staff users are strong. The followers of the teachings of Kralnor shall never be broken or cast aside by those \"unbelievers\". \nKralnor be praised! May your staves be strong!\nWinning converts to Kralnorism.\nFrom very early on after Kralnor's initial Post of Enlightenment many converts have been won for Kralnorism, both orthodox and those belonging to the Church of the Staves.\nOne of the earliest contributors to Kralnoric discussion was Aimee, a low level Forsaken priest, who's writings demonstrate a fervent remorse for his/her past mistakes (i.e. rolling a priest) and an admirable desire to rectify these wrongs by becoming a warlock staff user:\n\"\"I have picture of staff and warlock on my pillow in house. :&lt;0 My face has moustache. - \"Aimee\" - &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.saichotictech.net/Others/Kralnor/Kralnorp2.htm\"&gt;post 34&lt;/a&gt;\"\nThis gives us all hope that no matter what class we may have initially rolled, Kralnor will forgive us and accept us as a newly rolled warlock, even if our face has moustache.\nWarlock Apparel.\nWhile most Kralnor-fearing warlocks wear sensible ankle-length robes, one enterprising young 'lock (Slang for Warlock) who clearly has 300 skill in &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt; has designed &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.cafepress.com/angel23\"&gt;these garments&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to have them sanctioned as official apparel of the Church. However given the lack of good stats, no plus to crit OR hit and a shameful revealing quality, this author thinks it unlikely.\n\"These garments are shamefully revealing, why, I can see that warlocks's general shape! No self-respecting warlock would be caught dead (or undead) in anything less than a good long robe!! For shame!\" - Conservative and Anonymous Warlock Trainer on \"Staff User\" apparel.\n=Links="}

The show is set to be released sometime in 2010/2011, but scripts are being made. &lt;a href=\"Apt-T%20Productions\"&gt;Apt-T Productions&lt;/a&gt; has said that if the show is good, they will sign up and also release it in their name. The theme tune will be Jonathan Coulton \u2014 Code Monkey. The show revolves around an 18-year-old warrior who starts his journey around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but soon meets a Conscience and agrees to take it back to its owner.\nPlot.\nKran, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, has not long turned 18. When somebody turns 18, they may enter Azeroth to begin their journey to become a champion of their class. When he accidentally ends up in a &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; battle, he meets a conscience named Cryss, an idiotic &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;. Cryss has the ability to give the one he links with two choices when asked a question. He also has the abilities of a priest and the stealth of a rogue, but can also give the person he touches stealth mode too. When Kran learns that Cryss' owner has suddenly left Warsong Gulch, it's up to Kran to find Cryss' owner.\nEpisodes.\nEpisode One: Of Rats and Retards.\nKran is about to start his journey into Azeroth and leaves his home in Goldshire. He arrives in Stormwind, which he has never been to before. He decides to have a bit of fun, but soon, he crashes into Ironforge by the tramline. When he tries to ask a night elf where he is, he soon ends up in a Warsong Gulch battle, where he meets Cryss, a conscience. Cryss' owner leaves the battle without him, leaving Kran to find his owner for him.\nConsciences in Kran &amp; Conscience.\nA Conscience is a lot different in Azeroth to what they are in our time. In our time, a conscience is something in the persons mind who has a rhectorical question on their mind, which involves two choices. The good choice and the bad choice.\nIn Kran &amp; Conscience however, a conscience is a solid figure and is a very rare gift to be given. So rare, that only a few people in the universe has one. They give the person they are linked to, two choices on any question they are given. The good choice and the bad choice. E.G. \"Do I travel North, South, East or West?\" and say the correct answer would be North, then the conscience would answer South (a wrong answer) and North (the correct answer). Also, every conscience has the power of a priest and the stealth of a rogue. However, with the power of the Heart of Stone, a Consciences powers can be improved, and can break the link between the conscience and their owner, meaning the Consciences powers can be used without the conscience being linked to anybody.\nA conscience is created when somebody finds a Heart of Diamond and touches it.\nQuestions.\n- It's a little bit similar. Kran is sane, sort of like Dave, and Cryss is a little bit insane, but Phil is 100% insane. It has comedy, action but also has a little bit of Drama too. Like in Dude, Where's My Mount, there is a villian, but instead of the villian being a woman, it is a dark male figure who is out to warn Cryss about Kran and talk him into what he \"really is\".\n- Well currently, I, (Charlie Murray) am in sixth form, and I will try to use my EMA to buy a brand new 500gb computer, thus giving me some extra features. I can also buy programs such as Adobe Pro and things like that, so not for a little while. But the scripts for episode one has been made, and I am currently writing all the scripts, with a few helpers of course. If all goes well, I will plan on looking for a 2010 release or earlier if possible.\n- 15 in Season One, if you must know.\n- I haven't really made that decision yet. I have got a few people already to help me with voices if they are needed, but right now I do not need anything. If I am in such need however, I will post the help on the Machinima Forums.\n- Silvermoon EU server. Yes, I am a British... If, however, you would like to come and meet me, thats if I am on, which isn't very often now, my character name is and I am in the raiding guild named Celtic Leaf Army."}

Nowadays, the wilds are still a dangerous place, roaming saurok ambushers, wildlife and the increasing &lt;a href=\"Sha\"&gt;Sha&lt;/a&gt; presence pose a serious threat to anyone that will find himself wandering through this beautiful, yet treacherous place.\nGetting there.\nKrasarang Wilds can be accessed on foot via &lt;a href=\"Zhu%27s%20Descent\"&gt;Zhu's Descent&lt;/a&gt; from the eastern side of the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20the%20Four%20Winds\"&gt;Valley of the Four Winds&lt;/a&gt;, via &lt;a href=\"Dustback%20Gorge\"&gt;Dustback Gorge&lt;/a&gt; in the shadow of the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; on the west side of the valley, or by swimming across from &lt;a href=\"Paw%27don%20Village\"&gt;Paw'don Village&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nThe only true grasslands to be found are just down the slope from the Valley of the Four Winds, near Zhu's Watch. These gently rolling hills soon dissolve as they are overtaken by the thick jungle that blankets most of the inland region. Thick trees draped with vines can be found around every corner, and a handful of rivers wind their way through the moss and ruins that dot the landscape. The Cliffs of Despair serve as the northern border to the Wilds, while sparkling beaches and island-studded waters comprise the south. "}

{"id": "362814", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=362814", "title": "Faction pride", "text": "Faction pride is the sentiment of pride or patriotism toward one of the playable &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s: the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Faction pride can lead to friendly rivalries, expressions of patriotic feeling, and on occasion more aggressive conflicts between players, such as on forums. Faction pride is often expressed in the battle-cry of each faction - \"For the Alliance!\" or \"For the Horde!\". Faction pride and a healthy rivalry between the Alliance and the Horde was one of the earliest design goals for \"World of Warcraft\", and &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard has often encouraged faction pride through events and activities such as the \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" launch events.\nFaction pride may for some be seen as an enjoyable part of playing \"World of Warcraft\"; an entertaining but non-serious form of participation; an important element of &lt;a href=\"roleplaying\"&gt;roleplaying&lt;/a&gt;, especially on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20realm\"&gt;PvP realm&lt;/a&gt;s; a way of strengthening player pride, engagement and identification with their characters and the game in general; a natural part of competitive play, especially in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;; or an opportunity for aggression and inappropriate behavior comparable to . Many of the arguments for and against faction pride are similar to those regarding taking pride in one's nation, home town or favored sports team. Faction pride can similarly be seen to share many of the advantages and disadvantages of these behaviors.\nCommentary.\nFaction pride is a behavior frequently exhibited by those with strong feelings of loyalty to their faction, whether because of lore, the experience of having played that faction for a long time, perceptions\u00a0(accurate or inaccurate) of differences between the players of each faction, or simply because that faction is their \"side\". Dislike of the opposite faction may be increased by negative experiences in &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, especially &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;, where players may be repeatedly &lt;a href=\"gank\"&gt;gank&lt;/a&gt;ed or otherwise feel victimized by players of the opposite faction. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s continually pitch players against those of the opposite faction, and such repeated conflict can quickly foster a sense of dislike toward the opposite faction and its races. PvP experiences may also cause players to bond with their own faction, sharing their victories and losses with their faction teammates, and becoming accustomed to working with and fighting alongside the other races of their faction. Faction pride may be far more prevalent on &lt;a href=\"PvP%20realm\"&gt;PvP realm&lt;/a&gt;s, where players frequently clash in &lt;a href=\"world%20PvP\"&gt;world PvP&lt;/a&gt;, and may also have a larger proportion of players dedicated to PvP in general.\nSome players will assert that the players of the opposite faction are somehow inferior to their own, whether due to lack of skill or to bad behavior such as repeated &lt;a href=\"ganking\"&gt;ganking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"emote\"&gt;emote&lt;/a&gt; spamming. However, while individual realm populations do vary, this perception is largely attributable to the bias of experience; players in PvP will frequently find themselves defeated and mistreated by those of the opposite faction, and this is considered by many to be equally present in both factions. In addition, players do not generally have the opportunity to witness the behavior of their own faction from the perspective of the opposition, and are arguably less likely to remember indecent behavior when it is not directed at themselves or their faction.\nSeparation between factions is significantly increased by numerous in-game measures designed to separate Alliance and Horde players, and engender a sense of factional identity. Characters can only talk, group, and create guilds with players from their own faction. Although the introduction of systems such as &lt;a href=\"Real%20ID\"&gt;Real ID&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"BattleTag\"&gt;BattleTag&lt;/a&gt;s has made it possible for friends to send messages to each other regardless of faction, communication between factions is still largely prevented.\nBecause of this, one common venue for cross-faction conflict is forum posts, where patriotic players may at times good-naturedly insult the other faction's honor, and at others may become embroiled in bitter arguments. Insulting or demonizing faction-specific characters or races (or indeed an entire faction) is a common form of &lt;a href=\"trolling\"&gt;trolling&lt;/a&gt; on some forums.\nFaction pride is greatly encouraged through storyline and questing experiences. Numerous NPCs express varying degrees of animosity, disrespect and hatred toward the opposite faction; numerous quests involve fighting the opposing faction's NPCs and participating in attacks and missions against the opposite faction; and players will spend most of their time in faction-specific locations, surrounded by faction-specific iconography. However, many NPCs are found to be more open-minded about the opposing faction. Additionally, there are areas and towns where faction difference is put aside, and sanctuaries such as &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; where cross-faction violence is entirely prevented. There are numerous examples of cross-faction friendships between NPCs in-game, and organizations such as the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; involve members of both factions, working together for a greater good. This can be considered to provide players with an alternative attitude toward faction conflict.\nThere are also numerous examples of characters who, while loyal to their faction, exhibit behaviour that will likely be considered immoral or detestable. These characters' behavior may be considered intentionally abhorrent, such as encouraging atrocities or resorting to demonic methods to ensure their faction's victory. It could be argued that these characters are designed to encourage players to question their loyalties, and how far they are willing to go in support of their faction.\nA special example of this would be &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who quickly earned the dislike of many Horde players after being installed as the Horde &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;\". Determined to conquer the whole of Azeroth in the name of the Horde, Garrosh is willing to do whatever it takes to triumph, including the use of dark and unthinkable magics. While a successful military leader, Garrosh's overly aggressive attitude toward the Alliance and boundless ambition for conquest may prompt Horde players to question their loyalties, and what price they are willing to pay in order to triumph over the Alliance. As the other leaders of the Horde begin to turn against him, Garrosh has been confirmed as the final boss in &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, with the expansion's climax featuring a raid on Orgrimmar that will end his reign as warchief.\nFaction icons are featured prominently throughout the game, encouraging a strong sense of identification with the character's faction. These icons have gained substantial popularity among fans, and can be found on a variety of merchandise items, such as clothing, keychains, mouse-mats and even cell phone cases.\nAlthough presumably rare, instances of real life conflict due to faction pride have been reported. These incidents can be considered comparable to those common between supporters of opposing sports teams, although presumably far less serious and frequent.\nBlizzard and faction pride.\n&lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard have often encouraged faction pride in players. As stated by Lead Quest Designer &lt;a href=\"Dave%20Kosak\"&gt;Dave Kosak&lt;/a&gt;:\nFaction pride in its more positive forms has often been encouraged by Blizzard, such as at the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; digital launch events, where players around the world were encouraged to shout their faction's battle-cry in unison, in \"the largest \"For the Horde!\" and \"For the Alliance!\" yell the world has ever seen\". Other activities, such as asking players to submit images of themselves featuring the icon of their chosen faction, have also been promoted by Blizzard.\nBlizzard's efforts to encourage faction pride have at times been controversial. The 2011 &lt;a href=\"Blizzcon\"&gt;Blizzcon&lt;/a&gt; featured a closing concert by &lt;a href=\"Elite%20Tauren%20Chieftain\"&gt;Elite Tauren Chieftain&lt;/a&gt; that involved expressions of anti-Alliance sentiment (including numerous profanities) which many fans found offensive. Numerous threads were created on the topic on the official forums, sparking further controversy and debate. Both &lt;a href=\"Mike%20Morhaime\"&gt;Mike Morhaime&lt;/a&gt; and Elite Tauren Chieftain subsequently released apologies.\nBlizzard's implementation of this design in-game can be considered to have several sound motivations, strengthening players' attachment to their characters, increasing playing pleasure, strengthening ties within communities, and motivating players to compete in PvP. The promotion of such sentiment is common in the world of sports, as well as to varying degrees in some towns, cities and nations.\nFavoritism.\nBlizzard has often been accused by players of faction favoritism, most often toward the Horde, and the issue is a frequent matter of debate on the official forums. This perspective is often the result of players feeling dissatisfied with their faction's story lines, or the fate of some of the faction's key characters. Blizzard maintain that they remain neutral, but that the fortunes of each faction will continue to rise and fall as storylines develop, guaranteeing \"unfair and inequitable treatment of both factions for now and in the foreseeable future.\""}

Those without the patience to grind a single faction exclusively often end up allocating many bag slots to store left-over tokens for when they resume the grind. In cataloging the astounding diversity of these tokens, we can come to grip with the bag-pocalypse confronting the packrats in the community.\nThis page is for items which have no use other than as faction currency or repeatable reputation quests.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBlizzard seems to have realized the absurdity of the token situation with the release of Wrath. Almost all grinds revolve around daily quests or tabards, and almost every faction currency is in a currency tab instead of taking bag space.\nClassic WoW.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, many of these items became obsolete. \nArgent Dawn.\nThese were used for &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; reputation quests prior to Cataclysm. When the quests were removed, many of the associated items were either deprecated or outright removed. Others remained unchanged, but no longer serve a purpose.\nDarkmoon Faire.\nThese were used for &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; quests prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.3.0\"&gt;Patch 4.3.0&lt;/a&gt;. Previously items, they were converted to quality when the quests were removed (with the exception of the prize ticket)."}

As such, they are immune to magic. Attacks land and air units.\nInformation.\nThe Faerie Dragon is an anti-spellcaster unit that also doubles as both a ground and air attacking unit. Generally in such cases, &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryph Riders&lt;/a&gt; would fulfill the role of ground and air attackers better due to their higher health and rate of fire.\nMana Flare is their best spell and should always be in use when numerous spellcasters are used by the enemy. While the Faerie Dragon cannot attack in this state, any spells cast in its range prompts the Faerie Dragon to blast them with a bolt of magic which possesses AoE capabilities, and it also has an additional 12 armor while in this state. Though it can only affect a single unit every 12 seconds, numerous spellcasters mean that Mana Flare will continually go off and kill groups of spellcasters with ease.\nFaerie Dragons are also spell immune, protecting them from &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gryphon Riders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrms&lt;/a&gt;, who would otherwise kill them extremely fast. This doesn't keep them safe from other units however, who can easily focus them down even through the increased armor given from Mana Flare.\nSpells and abilities.\nPhas Shift (Autocast).\nThis spell is automatic by default. Keep it so that the Faerie Dragon won't get mowed down easily by anti-air units.\nMana lare.\nThe damage is 4 per mana point the unit currently has, up to a maximum of 80, or 1/mana point with a max of 50 (before spell damage reduction) for heroes.\nThe damage has a splash radius of 20 that only affects spellcasters.\nA given unit can only be hit every 0.75 seconds by the faerie dragon casting this spell.\nHave your anti-air units focus on any Faerie Dragons using Mana Flare to kill them off and protect your spellcasters."}

{"id": "15832", "revid": "53720870", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15832", "title": "Faerie dragon", "text": "Faerie dragons (also known as sprites, sprite darters, blink dragons, fey dragons, fae dragons, or fey drakes) are diminutive, intelligent creatures that look like flying lizards (much like a chameleon with butterfly wings). Though not actual &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, these mystical looking creatures police the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; from magic. As such they are immune to magic.\nThe night elves used fey dragons, including &lt;a href=\"Flicka\"&gt;Flicka&lt;/a&gt;, against the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Priestess%20Lasara\"&gt;Moon Priestess Lasara&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Altar of Elders&lt;/a&gt; to transform &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; players into faerie dragons at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe faerie dragons of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; are known for their playful demeanor, seemingly disappearing on a whim. The more mischievous ones will often materialize out of nowhere to save their allies, or simply to mock their foes. One wouldn't know it from looking at them, but the lovely faerie dragons can be truly fearsome if trained properly. They can do amazing things to magical energy: absorb it, redirect it, even nullify it entirely. They're nearly harmless alone, but in large numbers, they can have a stunning effect on a battle. Faerie dragons can speak, but few of them choose to do so. The faerie dragons that dwell near &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; can see through enemy illusions. They are quite intelligent and able to speak, albeit with broken grammar.\nThis creature resembles a dragon in some respects, but feathery antennae sprout from its head and its wings are moth-like. Its turquoise scales shimmer in the sparkles that dance from its body. It turns its head to look at you with a beady black eye before emitting a small keen. They have a powerful natural defense against magic and the unique ability to phase out of reality. Their defense seems to work by the dragon encasing itself within a strong energy shield that repels most magic and conventional attacks. While in this form they can siphon the unused magical energy wasted in basic spell casting, and then focus, amplify, and direct it back at the unfortunate caster in a sort of \"feedback\" attack. This ability is very powerful but requires a great deal of effort, and can only be used sporadically, requiring the dragon to rest between uses. For this reason, the faerie dragons often travel in packs. \nAfter the &lt;a href=\"second%20invasion\"&gt;second invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; summoned faerie dragons from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; to help purge the night elf forests of demonic magics. The creatures were also briefly called into service during the night elves' hunt for &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. However, the faerie dragons were not part of the actual military hierarchy of the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. The faerie dragons and &lt;a href=\"chimaera\"&gt;chimaera&lt;/a&gt; are simply somewhat intelligent animals with ties to the Emerald Dream and &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. These beings all assisted the night elves not due to a desire to help them in particular, but because the night elves were the largest local force who opposed the Burning Legion. Short of a planetary threat, it is rare to see &lt;a href=\"mountain%20giant\"&gt;mountain giant&lt;/a&gt;s, faerie dragons or chimaera fighting with a mortal army. In any case, the vast majority of the faerie dragons have since returned to the Emerald Dream, with only a few populations left on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nLarger breeds of faerie dragons have been seen that resemble traditional dragonkin. They seem to share the same abilities of their smaller counterparts, albeit in greater power. A number of them were used as mounts by the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, but they have also been seen on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and as defenders of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. A breed of faerie dragons known as Whimsydrakes were used as companions by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s during the incursion of the dream by the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;primal incarnate&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. These playful protectors of the Emerald Dream may be larger than their relatives, the faerie dragons, but they are no less mischievous. Whimsydrakes have a tendency to phase out of reality when mounted by a rider they dislike.\nLocations.\nThe only large population left on Azeroth is located in the untainted forests of &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;. Many also live in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. However, they seem to lack the powers that a normal dragon has, possibly attributed to their lack of connection with the Emerald Dream. The &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Grimtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; has recently been endangering the group in Feralas, capturing them for experimental use. There have also been reports of the faerie dragons in the &lt;a href=\"Talon%20Den\"&gt;Talon Den&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. It is likely that when the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s of the den awoke from the Emerald Dream, the dragons came with them in some way. One notable is &lt;a href=\"Nal%27taszar\"&gt;Nal'taszar&lt;/a&gt;. \nThese creatures have also been found in &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;'s west wing. It appears in their instinctual duties of policing magic, these hapless dragons wandered into the wing in an attempt to disrupt the corrupting energies pulsing through the ruins, but fell prey to the ghostly &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and now serve them as &lt;a href=\"Eldreth%20Darter\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;. One faerie dragon can also be found in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, inside the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. Altered by the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, this one is called a &lt;a href=\"Deviate%20Faerie%20Dragon\"&gt;\"Deviate\" Faerie Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. It counts as a rare boss, with players having a small chance of encountering it when visiting the dungeon. \nFaerie dragons can also be found in the &lt;a href=\"Whispering%20Forest\"&gt;Whispering Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, where they converge around the mushroom ring at regular intervals to sing to one another, lighting up the forest with their strange ritual. Some can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, and even in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. The of an alternate Draenor's past also features wild faerie dragons, found on the &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Moor\"&gt;Shimmer Moor&lt;/a&gt;.\nDraenor.\nEnormous faerie dragons are also found in on the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, where they serve as mounts for the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them dwell in the &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Moor\"&gt;Shimmer Moor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Draakorium\"&gt;Draakorium&lt;/a&gt; is a draenei town where the dragons are raised and trained to become mounts.\nIt is unknown how there can be faerie dragons on Draenor, considering the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azerothian&lt;/a&gt; faerie dragons are closely tied to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, which was created specifically for Azeroth.\nAs a hunter pet.\nIn the expansion they are tamable as part of the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Dragonkin\"&gt;Lesser Dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; hunter pet family.\nIn the RPG.\nFaerie dragons are not related to true dragons, though they share similar traits in appearance. They are mystic creatures that protect the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; from hostile &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, occasionally they join their &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; allies in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s battles as well. Faerie dragons are thought to be unable to speak."}

If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired).\nLevels 10-20 in the Eastern Kingdoms.\nThis guide works with the &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Loch Modan questing guide&lt;/a&gt;.

Both zones offer a variety of quests and the most efficient method of reaching level 20 requires visiting both. First visit the other starting zone to grab some easy quests and level 12. See &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Dun Morogh questing guide&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Elwynn Forest questing guide&lt;/a&gt;. Next choose either Loch Modan or Westfall, do as many easy quests as possible. Third, visit the other zone and do the same. By this time you can return to the other zone ready to tackle the next bunch of quests. Eventually you'll visit &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and also hit &lt;a href=\"The%20Deadmines\"&gt;The Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; instance as you near level 20.\n&lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; are recommended to stay in Kalimdor and follow similar questing in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible to reach these zones at level 10, but it isn't easy nor efficient.\nWestfall quests.\nTrip to Stormwind City.\nWhenever you make Level 14, you'll want to visit &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; for your class trainers. Now's the time to revisit the flight path by Sentinel Hill.\nCoast Work.\nNow might be another good time to revisit &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere to go from here.\nAfter the easy and efficient questing is done in &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, you'll want to review the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Redridge Mountains questing guide&lt;/a&gt;. Sometime soon you'll want to hit &lt;a href=\"The%20Deadmines\"&gt;The Deadmines&lt;/a&gt; instance and there are preparatory quests you'll want to gather for that.

Seeing their city irremediably tainted and uninhabitable, the majority of the Wildhammers turned north to settle in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, while the rest settled in the region of &lt;a href=\"Northeron\"&gt;Northeron&lt;/a&gt;, not far from their cursed former home. After the war the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; sought to retain relations and trade with their Wildhammer cousins and built the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; to bridge the gap between &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and to serve as both an economic and a symbolic bridge between the dwarven territories.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; started several dwarven clans numbering hundreds of members lived in the area of the Wetlands. &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; chose &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;a small island&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt; to be the place where his invasion fleet would be built. Sailing straight to the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; would let the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; avoid the ground defenses of the nascent &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; was left behind to guard the &lt;a href=\"Oil%20refinery\"&gt;refinement operations&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde, while &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; established itself in Grim Batol. The region suffered greatly from this occupation: wildlife became scarce as both the orcs and their dragons thrived heavily on fresh meat, and despoiled badlands become more common as plants themselves suffered. The dwarves that could fled, those that couldn't like &lt;a href=\"Rom%27s%20clan\"&gt;Rom's clan&lt;/a&gt; hid underground and started resisting. Dragonmaw clan was eventually subject to the wrath of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who, when freed of their enslavement from the orcs, attacked them. The orcs who survived the onslaught fled south to the mountains, where they live to this day.\nAfter the Second War the area was reconquered and Doomhammer's port was rebuilt as an Alliance settlement named &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in honor of the king of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. The forces of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; later attacked the harbor in order to steal ships and set sail for the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Grim Batol itself was taken by the Red dragonflight who patrolled its area.\nThe fanatical &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, under service of &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; himself and the malevolent &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s, has seized the fortress of Grim Batol as part of their expansion within the highlands on the east, brutally pushing back the red flight's forces.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; caused a flood of the western part of the Wetlands and of &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, sweeping a good number of ocean dwellers with it.\nThe flood from &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Loch\"&gt;Loch&lt;/a&gt; distressed with local wildlife's and brought &lt;a href=\"threshadon\"&gt;threshadon&lt;/a&gt;s as well.\nGeography.\nThere are currently no dungeons or battlegrounds in this area.\nMaps and subregions.\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.gamepressure.com/map.asp%3FID%3D6\"&gt;A topographic map of the pre-Cataclysm Wetlands.&lt;/a&gt;\nQuests.\nAdventurers help the Alliance outposts of the Wetlands get back on their feet after the disastrous land-altering effects of the &lt;a href=\"Shattering\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;. Play courier via ram, uncover a ghostly mystery, do archaeology by beating up skeletal raptors, and deal a final blow against the Dark Iron on the Thandol Span.\nIn Cataclysm.\nThe Wetlands became a 25-30 zone. Between the tidal effects of the Cataclysm and the destruction of the Stonewrought Dam, large portions of this zone have became flooded, including &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAreas affected:\nIn Warcraft III.\nA \"\" map exists called Wetlands. A once thriving metropolis has all but been covered by the jungle.\nIn the RPG.\nCold and drear, the Wetlands is &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;'s northernmost realm. It can be found after crossing through &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz%20Gate\"&gt;Dun Algaz Gate&lt;/a&gt;. Once dominated by &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; strongholds, the Wetlands suffered grievously in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s. The strongholds have fallen, and wild creatures, &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;s and renegade &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s claim the land. The Wetlands is little more than a thoroughfare for travelers moving to and from &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, the only safe settlement in the area. This marsh is not nearly as cheerful as Loch Modan.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces devastated the Wetlands in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s, forcing the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; dwarves to retreat to Loch Modan and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces have since established &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, but the area is still wild and untamed. The Wetlands is a buffer zone between the inhabited Khaz Modan and Scourge-infested &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nMenethil Harbor, on the west coast, is the only Alliance settlement in the Wetlands. Menethil's people are tense and wary, as orcs and other creatures attack the walls constantly. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; claimed the fallen city of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt;, in the north, as their own, while the renegade orcish &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, defeated shortly after the Second War, fled to this land. The orcs, still flying their white &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; banners, refuse to ally with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and raid Menethil Harbor repeatedly.\nDisputed ruins dot the landscape, and murlocs, &lt;a href=\"bog%20beast\"&gt;bog beast&lt;/a&gt;s and other creatures are perfect hunting targets. Menethil Harbor would be indebted to any intrepid individuals who eliminated the Dragonmaw threat.\nThe Dark Iron dwarves of Dun Modr uncovered ancient writings in their ruined fortress that spoke of an artifact called &lt;a href=\"Ironbeard%27s%20Axe\"&gt;Ironbeard's Axe&lt;/a&gt;. They leaked this information to both Menethil Harbor and the Dragonmaw orcs, and later planed to incite both factions to race to &lt;a href=\"Ironbeard%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Ironbeard's Tomb&lt;/a&gt;, fighting &lt;a href=\"ooze\"&gt;ooze&lt;/a&gt;s and each other in the process. In the aftermath, Dark Iron agents ambushed the victors on their way out, thereby claiming the magical axe for themselves.\nGeography.\nThe Wetlands is one vast, cold swamp stretching to Khaz Modan's northern coast. Gray mist cloaks the ground, giving the area an eerie, isolated feel, while the skies are constantly overcast. To the south are a series of one thousand stone steps carved into the rock, at the top of which is Dun Algaz Gate and the entrance to Loch Modan. To the north is Lordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Ruined dwarven fortresses can be seen, thrusting their bones up from the surrounding filth. Elevation rises to the east to the mountain fortress of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, and to the south toward Loch Modan. As if rebel orcs and Dark Iron dwarves were not bad enough, &lt;a href=\"Bluegill%20tribe\"&gt;Bluegill murlocs&lt;/a&gt;, bog beasts and oozes roam the murky landscape.\nMenethil Harbor is the only safe settlement in the Wetlands, though wrecked strongholds and other ruins draw treasure seekers to this bleak land. Many shipwrecks line the coast. Curious explorers could find many intriguing items in these shattered hulks. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; found a fork.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}
{"id": "14035", "revid": "49740203", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14035", "title": "Wetlands (Classic)", "text": "The Wetlands is a large, wet zone below &lt;a href=\"Stonewrought%20Dam\"&gt;Stonewrought Dam&lt;/a&gt; and north of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;, covered with small rivers, lakes, and ponds. Bordered on three sides by mountains, the Wetlands are open to the ocean to the west. Adventurers seeking a route to the Wetlands must either come through sieged &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Algaz\"&gt;Dun Algaz&lt;/a&gt; from Loch Modan or cross the damaged &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The northern slopes of Wetlands are generally classed within mountains of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wetlands is a vast, cold swamp. Mists cloak the ground, and the overcast sky makes the land a uniform gray. Many Ironforge strongholds once stood in this region, but war has reduced them to rubble. Wild creatures, murlocs and renegade orcs now control the land. Menethil Harbor, a city on the west coast, is the Alliance\u2019s only presence in this dreary region.\nHistory.\nThe Wetlands have been the site of many a battle through the times. Nestled among the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and open to the ocean as it is, it is a prime location for invading forces. It was historically part of the original &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; kingdom while the three tribes were united, but after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, it fell under control of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Clan\"&gt;Wildhammer Clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Dark Irons invaded &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; and almost succeeded in taking full control of it, but were driven back at the last minute. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the bastion finally fell prey to the invading orcs, most notably by those of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw Clan&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlthough the orcs took possession of Grim Batol for a time, they were subject to the wrath of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; who, when freed of their enslavement from the orcs, destroyed their bases and burned their &lt;a href=\"catapult\"&gt;catapult&lt;/a&gt;s, killing orcs en masse. The orcs who survived the onslaught fled south to the mountains, where they live to this day. Horde and Scourge forces devastated the Wetlands in the Second and Third Wars, forcing the Ironforge dwarves to retreat to Loch Modan and Dun Morogh. \nGrim Batol is now under the control of the red dragonflight, who fiercely defend their lair from outsiders. Alliance forces have since established Menethil Harbor, but the area is still wild and untamed. The dwarves and allied humans built the port city on an island in Baradin Bay, which they named after King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt;. The Wetlands is a buffer zone between inhabited Khaz Modan and Scourge-infested Lordaeron.\nGeography.\nThere are currently no instanced dungeons in the area, but the two &lt;a href=\"Dungeon\"&gt;micro dungeons&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20Gates\"&gt;Dragonmaw Gates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Modr\"&gt;Dun Modr&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this zone.

This area has a series of small &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farmland&lt;/a&gt; plots around a pond at the base of a tall waterfall. Each farmland plot has haystacks and &lt;a href=\"cow\"&gt;cow&lt;/a&gt;s with a nearby &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;-style house set into the hillside. The area itself is on a plateau above normal Wetlands areas. There are a few &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, some animals, &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20Farmer\"&gt;dwarven farmers&lt;/a&gt; and some guards in the area.

Rather, it is meant to show a player an efficient way to complete many quests available for a particular zone. If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired).\nLevels 20-30 in the Eastern Kingdoms.\nAdventurers that have reached level 20 they more choices in where to go next than they did at level 10. &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; both are logical next steps in the Eastern Kingdoms, while &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; provide a coutner balance in Kalimdor. Both pairs of zones offer a variety of quests and the most efficient method of reaching level 30 requires visiting all four. It once had been recommended to explore the nearest pair before taking the boat to the opposite continent, but with the opening of Stormwind's harbor such constraint is unnecessary. Hit each zone, run through a few quests and bounce on to another.

Not even the unnamed leviathans that lurk in the ocean's depths are beyond the tuskarr's reach.\"\nIn Battle for Azeroth.\nPlayers can use the &lt;a href=\"Secret%20Fish%20Goggles\"&gt;Secret Fish Goggles&lt;/a&gt; to find a &lt;a href=\"Very%20Tiny%20Whale\"&gt;Very Tiny Whale&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeached whales.\nMany sea creatures can be found dead on various shores in World of Warcraft, including &lt;a href=\"giant%20turtle\"&gt;giant turtle&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"threshadon\"&gt;threshadon&lt;/a&gt;s. Two of these creatures, which have only been seen dead, have been identified as unknown types of whales. One is a large creature resembling a threshadon, and the other is a creature with legs and four eyes that is found around &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.

They can be summoned by a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; in aquatic or watery environments as a nature's ally. Some varieties of these seagoing mammals are among the largest animals known. Relatively small whales (such as the &lt;a href=\"orca\"&gt;orca&lt;/a&gt;) can be vicious predators, attacking virtually anything they detect. Whales can \"see\" by emitting high-frequency sounds, inaudible to most other creatures, that allow them to locate objects and creatures within 120 feet. A silence spell negates this and forces the whale to rely on its vision, which is approximately as good as a human's. A whale can hold its breath for a long time before it risks drowning. The &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; can point out every kind of whale imaginable and a few that may not be real, and they hunt all of them. Whales are considered a delicacy among magnataur, and those who are able to catch them frequently are highly respected.\nSpecies.\nA plankton-feeding whale between 30 and 60 feet long, such as gray, humpback, and right whales.

They prey on &lt;a href=\"giant%20squid\"&gt;giant squid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThese ferocious creatures, also called killer whales, are about 30 feet long.

Although they are classified as Humanoids, they are NOT intelligent. If you ever ask a Gnoll to open a package for you, it will (likely) either:\nThey have, though, made out that if you grab four sticks and stab them into the ground and put a hide over it, you will not get wet when standing under it in rain. Despite this, they have yet to find out how it works.\nGnoll physics.\nThe Gnoll's body is composed of bones, flesh, ewwy green goo and muscles. These each serve their own purpose. This is why gnolls sometimes go into spasms: Their body simply refuses to work together. The green goo exists purely for making adventurerers vomit, and it does its job quite well. The legs are just so short that the gnoll does not act as a tunnel drill when smashed by a mace. Its head is reasonably fit for an ugly cap with feathers on. No one knows why. Gnolls can not corpse-run as their souls simply refuse to leave their body out of stupidity. It takes the average gnoll three days to realize it is dead.\nCulture.\nThe gnolls are extremely violent. However, their violence usually revolves around 2 things: Random prey and random other gnolls.\nThey are in fact lorded over by a great leader who is given the title \"Hogger\" when they are elected.\nTribe specifics.\nThe gnoll tribes are very different. The Shadowhide Gnolls in Redridge Mountains have made out that the best solution to a rather strong, evil mage commanding you around is to simply obey. This tends to keep you alive longer. The Mosshides in the Wetlands have found that the best way to entertain yourself is to call the whole tribe when a non-gnoll comes by and meaninglessly amass him/her. When non-gnolls are in short stock (Which happens quite often. People HATE that place) They tend to do this against Gnolls instead. The Palemanes in Mulgore have found it fun to annoy Tauren. Recording all the differencies on Gnoll tribes would take forever, so I'll just move along...\nList of questions that Gnolls have a chance of answering.\nNo more. More soon from the extremely silly Compendium of Gnoll Facts!"}

When encountered, the &lt;a href=\"Anub%27ar\"&gt;Anub'ar&lt;/a&gt; are attacking him as the players enter the room. It seems like the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces here are trying to catch the huge spider and perhaps convert it to an &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to use as a weapon, similar to &lt;a href=\"Maexxna\"&gt;Maexxna&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"During the fall of Azjol-Nerub, nerubian viziers released a single spider that would one day grow to challenge the unyielding forces of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Hadronox was instilled with a desire to avenge the fallen and reclaim its home from any that dare threaten it.\"\nTactics.\nThe Pull - Start by pulling the Crusher and two elites to the side. Kill them with the party near the wall. The crushers have a knock-up effect that is mitigated somewhat by the wall surface as it won't throw you very high. This starts the entire chain of events with Hadronox. Hadronox will begin coming up through the web and takes about 2\u20133 minutes before he gets topside. It is considerably easier for the group to take out the two non-Elites before taking down the Crusher.\nAfter the initial Crusher is pulled, two other Crusher groups will appear where there was only one. If you want to play it safe, pull the closest to the same spot by shooting the elite closest to the party. This will prevent the other Crusher group from coming over as well. If you prefer to get it done, just pull both groups and AOE the little elites. Tanks concentrate on the Crushers.\nThe Boss - As the final crusher is killed, wait alongside the round platform you entered the webbing at. Have the tank stay down just a little way into the webbing. Hadronox will be killing minions along the way. Do not actually pull Hadronox, let him finish off all the adds (he will web up the doorways they spawn from then finish killing the rest \u2014 \"in fact there is an achievement for killing him on Heroic Mode before he does this\"). This fight is extremely easy if you have someone in the group that can clean poison. Hadronox's main ability is called \"Leech Poison\" and it will hurt those affected (large AOE area) and heal Hadronox. Any healing done to a person poisoned also heals Hadronox so de-poisoning helps. If your DPS is high, you can dps through it. Leech Poison is cast very often and lasts until nearly the next casting time. If cleansed, Hadronox doesn't get healed.\nHaving a shaman in your group, regardless of the role he or she is playing, is the easiest way to do this boss. Placing a &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Totem%20%28shaman%20ability%29\"&gt;Cleansing Totem&lt;/a&gt; rids the entire group of poison every 5 seconds. This effectively turns Hadronox into a tank and spank fight.\nNote: &lt;a href=\"Cleanse\"&gt;Cleanse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Purify%20%28paladin%20ability%29\"&gt;Purify (paladin ability)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Anti-Venom\"&gt;Anti-Venom&lt;/a&gt; do not remove the \"clouds\" on the ground; you must move out of them."}

This can either be achieved by jumping off the bridge or if a hunter/rogue/night elf/mage is in the group the hunter/rogue/night elf/mage can pull the Crushers that usually initiate the fight and &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Shadowmeld\"&gt;Shadowmeld&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt;. The use of Feign Death/Vanish/Shadowmeld will cause the crushers to de-spawn and the party can simply walk down the tunnel to confront Hadronox as the fight re-sets.\nIt is important to avoid the mobs that constantly run down the tunnel to fight Hadronox, however they do not continuously spawn so it is possible to reach Hadronox without aggroing them. When you pull Hadronox it is imperative not to aggro the mobs in any way, thus any form of AOE should be avoided. The fight is very simple and in fact easier than the regular fight since the mobs help kill Hadronox.\nIf any member of the group does accidentally aggro the mobs then it it effectively means a wipe, not only will they attack you rather than Hadronox, when they die they will heal Hadronox. In such a case, the only option is to have a party member capable of high-threat instant &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; such as a mage or paladin immediately aggro the adds and kite them away from Hadronox while the rest of the group kills him.\nAlternative Stategy.\nWait until Hadronox ascends. Pull him before he wraps the doors. There will be lots and lots of small mobs; have your Tank tank them all.\nThe DDs must burst down Hadronox before your Healer runs out of mana. Works almost always."}

But in her undisciplined attempts to bind &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s into servitude, she was ensnared and twisted by the Windlord, &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;. Now fiercely loyal to the Twilight's Hammer, Hagara binds others for her elemental masters to torment.\"\nAbilities.\nHagara the Stormbinder carries a 8 minutes enrage timer in Normal/raid finder difficult and a 10 minutes enrage on heroic difficult.\nStrategy.\nRequirements.\nFor this fight you will need: 1 Tank, 3 Healers and 6 DPS.\nOverview.\nThis boss has a main phase and two special phases; lightning phase and ice phase. This boss is fairly easy to clear as long as everyone follows the instructions correctly and does the right thing in the special phases. \nMain Phase.\nThe key to this phase is DPSing down the Ice Tombs quickly. The players who are trapped inside cannot be healed and will die unless the tombs are killed quickly.\nPlayers affected by Ice Lance should make sure to be at least 3 yards away from other raid members. It is advantageous for ranged casters to walk into the path of the ice lance to prevent the missiles from detonating in melee range (which would debuff multiple people).\nShattered Ice can be dispelled to remove the slow effect. \nThe way to stop Focused Assault is to get out of melee range and force the boss to move. A tank with a boss cooldown tracker can andicipate the Focused Assault and strafe away a fraction of a second before it is cast, resulting in no damage. Backing away from the Focused Assault is a slower way to escape it and you will take significant damage. Running through the boss and out the other side is even less effective since you can be hit from behind.\nLightning Phase.\nAt the start of the phase Hagara summons 4 Crystal Conductors, that are spaced out around the platform. She also summons a Bound Lightning Elemental. When the elemental dies it will overload whichever Crystal Conductor is nearest. The raid should prepare for this and spread out into a swarm that stretches from the doomed conductor to another conductor to speed up the the subsequent overload phase.\nOnce overloaded, the player nearest the Crystal Conductor becomes a Lightning Conduit. The lightning will chain to other nearby players. This is actually necessary because the goal of this phase is to overload the other 3 conductors by chaining the lightning from overloaded conductors to intact conductors. The most common tactic is for the entire raid to run from conductor to conductor in a strung-out swarm. The lighting usually bounces around the swarm, but occasionally fizzles out, forcing the swarm to turn around and re-establish a circuit from the overloaded conductor.\nVery coordinated teams can send half the raid in each direction to overload the conductors more quickly, although the reduced number of players on each team increases the risk that the lightning will peter out.\nWhen this phase ends, Hagara is debuffed and takes 100% more damage for 15 seconds.\nIce Phase.\nAt the start of the phase, Hagara fills the center part of the platform with water (which can quickly kill players and pets who do not move to the edge), and summons 4 Binding Crystals. Shortly after the Binding Crystals spawn, 4 equally spaced waves of ice appear and begin to rotate around the platform in a clockwise direction. The phase ends when all 4 Binding Crystals have been destroyed. Throughout the phase Icicles randomly drop onto the outer part of the platform, damaging players and knocking them back.\nThe raid should divide itself evenly between the 4 crystals and destroy them. If the ice waves activate before the crystals are destroyed, run ahead of the wave to finish off the crystal left behind by the team in front of you. Powerful teams that split optimally can destroy all 4 crystals before the ice waves start rotating. If the raid does not divide its DPS evenly, this phase will last longer as the strongest team rotates to mop up the crystals left behind by the weaker teams.\nNotes.\nIt is possible to predict which special phase will be first by examining Hagara's weapons. If they are wreathed in lightning then a lightning phase will be first. If they are wreathed in frost, then a frost phase will be first.\nHeroic.\nFocused Assault can not be stopped. The healers and tank just have to be powerful enough to outlast it.\nIce Lance becomes fantastically dangerous. Instead of slowing melee attacks it stacks a debuff that increases frost damage suffered. A tank can sometimes survive 15 stacks, but normal players should try to avoid more than 3, because 6 is sometimes fatal. One tactic is to assign teams of two that take turns suffering the ice lance to let the debuff fall off. This is sometimes frustrated when both members of a team become Ice Lance targets.\nShattered Ice can kill a player who has enough Ice Lance debuff stacks. The tank should remain still so that all the other players can hide behind Hagara.\nFrozen Tempest (frost phase) adds Frostflake. A player with Frostflake is progressively slowed until they are immobile. If the player dies while affected by Frostflake they leave behind a patch of frost that slows all players and lasts until all binding crystals are destroyed. A player who is dispelled outside the Watery Entrenchment also leaves a frost patch. It is very important to delay the dispel of Frostflake until the the player is inside the Watery Entrenchment sphere to prevent accumulation of frost patches. Dying inside the Watery Entrenchment creates a frost patch. Do not let anyone die. Fortunately skilled players can avoid most of the damage in this phase.\nIt is common to divide the raid into two teams that are on opposite sides of Hagara. This means that any players forced to fall behind by Frostflake can be picked up by the other team's healer.\nLightning Storm is more powerful in heroic mode and there are 8 conductors instead of 4. There is also a Storm Pillar which is foreshadowed by a faded rune circle on the ground; get out. To avoid massive raid-wide damage from Lightning Conduit, most of the raid will pile up in the middle next to Hagara while two teams of two players chain the lightning from conductor to conductor. One team will move clockwise, the other will move counterclockwise. \nWith fewer players the quirks of the chaining algorithm and network lag will be more obvious. It \"appears\" that the lightning propagation involves a bit of \"momentum\" in that cutting corners can prevent lightning propagation. It can be very hard to establish a lightning chain with immobile playes, but players moving in a straight line can easily chain lightning. This could be related to network lag and motion estimation.\nIf the lightning phase drags on too long the raid-wide debuff stacking on the raid will cause players to be 1-shot by Lightning Conduit or the Lightning Storm. Healers usually spend a lot of mana keeping the raid alive during lightning phase.\nSolo Strategy.\nWhen soloing Hagara at level 100 (or higher), the biggest obstacle is the lightning phase, since it requires multiple players to chain the lightning between the crystals.

She notably serves as the ultimate boss encounter in the single-player experience.\nNot much is known about Hagatha's true nature. It's not clear if she is indeed the rumored source of the curse that has befallen the Blackwald, or merely one of its victims. She may have been the survivor of some great battle who dragged herself deep into the forest and fell prey to dark magic, a wicked manifestation of the forest's anger, or an unusually skilled shaman whose ambition and desire for vengeance have outstripped all good sense. Somewhere on a swamp bank in the depths of the forest, she waits. When she speaks, every malignant thing in the woods bends an ear to listen. When she breathes, coils of glowing mist drift between tangled branches, and restless spirits wake from timeless slumber. When she rages, gnarled trees with jagged grins uproot themselves, and whole hillsides rise to lumber into the night. When she dreams, the people of Gilneas have recurring nightmares of a great serpent that threatens to devour the moon. In her despair, the vile and bizarre &lt;a href=\"Shudderwock\"&gt;Shudderwock&lt;/a&gt; stalks the land. While terrifying, Hagatha isn't a mindless force of nature, nor is she all-powerful. It's unknown why she hates Gilneas and its people, or if she even truly does \u2014 Gilneas may simply be an obstable to a larger goal. Whatever Hagatha's ultimate motive, the curse is already closing its claws around the city, and she will not stop until it is lost to the Witchwood."}

In addition, he gains approximately 50,000 health per priest that remains alive.\nStrategy.\nThe fight revolves around the Blood Siphon. You need to ensure that the entire raid is poisoned by a &lt;a href=\"Son%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Son of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;'s poison cloud before each Siphon. To enable this, you will need one person to pull a fast re-spawning Son from the left and right platforms to the raid so it can be killed. The entire raid should get the poison from the ensuing cloud while ensuring that the entire raid is not poisoned for too long, due to the damage caused. There are two common strategies for this.\nHakkar himself needs to be held by 2 or 3 tanks due to him Mind Controlling the current tank, which will cause him to switch to the next person on the aggro list. Hakkar's Mind Control is technically considered to be a Charm effect, so druid tanks are not immune to it. When a tank is Mind Controlled, he should be sheeped by a mage to prevent him from causing too much damage to the raid. This sheep should be dispelled when Mind Control fades. Additionally, due to this Mind Control, it is necessary to have warriors burn their Intimidating Shout as soon as it cools down to prevent the raid being feared. Hakkar will also frequently spit Corrupted Blood at members of the raid, dealing a large amount of shadow damage. Spreading the raid to limit the number of people who can be hit can help but also causes problems collapsing back to receive the poison. The best strategy is to keep the priests in the center rear, so they don't have to move around to get the poison and spread the ranged DPS out to both sides, and closer to Hakkar. As with many boss fights, limiting the damage the AoE attack does it crucial. The Corrupted Blood attack does about 2000 points of damage to a player in total, and if 15 people get corrupted this means a total of 15,000-30,000 HP (depending on how fast it gets cleansed) which need to be healed. Since this happens every 20\u201330 seconds, this puts a massive load on the healers. \nThe fight itself requires relatively little DPS, although there is a 10 min Enrage. Hakkar has about 745804 HP. He will do around 1/4 of the damage himself via Blood Siphon assuming everyone in the raid gets the &lt;a href=\"Poisonous%20Blood\"&gt;Poisonous Blood&lt;/a&gt; each Siphon. As a worst case scenario, no more than 3 people can be without the poison, or Hakkar will heal each Siphon.\nThis goes without saying, but if at any time you're left with one tank, and the boss isn't at very low HP, a wipe is inevitable. Reset by running down the stairs. Hakkar's the first boss you'll come across that's un-tauntable, therefore it's impossible for a just-resurrected tank to gain enough aggro to tank him - and, of course, he hits hard enough to make healing any randoms that get aggro during mind control into a nightmare. In order to prevent tank death, it is advisable to have at least 6 main healers in the raid. The majority of failures on Hakkar happen because of tank death.\nNote that Hakkar can be reset by pulling him down the stairs.\nHelpful macros.\nMage sheeping of Mind Controlled tanks.\nTargets both Main Tanks and sheeps whichever is Mind Controlled.\n /tar MT1\n /cast [harm] Polymorph(Rank 1)\n /tar MT2\n /cast [harm] Polymorph(Rank 1)\nPlace the names of your 2 tanks in for \"MT1\" and \"MT2\" (if you have more than 2 tanks then add additional lines for them)\nPriest/Paladin dispel of sheeped tanks.\nThis must be pressed twice. Once before the sheep breaks, and once after.\nNOTE: \u00abUNTESTED\u00bb \u00abThis will mess up your current target\u00bb\n /cast [target=focus,exists,help] Dispel Magic\n /clearfocus [target=focus,exists,help]\n /tar MT1\n /focus [harm]\n /tar MT2\n /focus [harm]\nIf you are a paladin, replace \"Dispel Magic\" with \"Cleanse\" and it will work.\nAgain, place the names of your MTs in there, and add additional lines if you have additional MTs.\nBeyond level 60.\nAt level 70.\nIt's possible, with a small raid and high DPS, to DPS through his Blood Siphon without the need for poisoning the raid. However, this does make the fight much more difficult.\nAt level 80.\nA small team of moderately-geared characters can rather easily kill a full-strength Hakkar (without killing any other bosses).\nA feral druid can easily solo this by hunkering down in &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; and keeping a steady &lt;a href=\"Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt; to heal themselves. This was done after soloing the 5 \"main\" bosses in ZG. Warrior in a passive unhittable set can solo this without a problem. Also a Death Knight, Paladin or Shaman can solo it with &lt;a href=\"Death%20Strike\"&gt;Death Strike&lt;/a&gt; and self-healing. Though, you have to have the damage to get him down before 10min enrage or you will die and it does take about 8-10mins to solo him. It will only take you about 4mins in current high-end PVE gear.\nWarlocks and Hunters, while able to be mind controlled, can still solo this boss. The Mind Control effect causes the afflicted target to use low-end spells, meaning that an MC'ed Warlock/Hunter will not kill their pet during a full duration MC and can, therefore, heal their pets up between MCs. It's highly suggested for a Warlock to use a passive, Phase-Shifted Imp during this fight, as they will still gain Soul Link (but they will \"not\" be Mind Controlled as long as the Imp stays phased).\nTip for DK's - Make sure you aren't spec'd for Bloodworms, and make sure you don't use a ghoul or Army of the Dead while fighting Hakkar. If you are the only one fighting Hakkar he won't use his MC ability. If Bloodworms or a ghoul is active, he WILL use his MC, and you will kill it(them) before the duration of the MC is up, thus causing him to reset, and fully heal.\nLoot.\nSeason of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Hakkar will always drop a &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari%20Idol\"&gt;Primal Hakkari Idol&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, if any of the High Priests have not yet been killed, Hakkar will drop an additional piece of loot from the loot table of each surviving High Priest."}

He supervised the portal's growth with &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and returned to create a powerful breed of mage-hunter felhounds during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWar of the Ancients.\nHakkar was one of the primary lieutenants of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. He was the first member of the Legion to set foot upon &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and was described as a huge flaming, fleshless skeletal knight with a horned skull. He was sent through the portal created from the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to assist &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt; in strengthening the portal, preparing for the rest of the Burning Legion to come forth. Hakkar's primary weapon was a whip which could be used to summon a seemingly limitless supply of &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s to do Hakkar's bidding. Hakkar attempted to remove &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; from the resistance, but quick intervention by the &lt;a href=\"Sisters%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisters of Elune&lt;/a&gt; saved the wayward pair. Hakkar was about to murder &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; stepped in to prevent his love from being destroyed, calling down a fierce lightning storm to vanquish the Houndmaster.\nLegion.\nHakkar is one of the many demons summoned by in front of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to attack the forces of Azeroth in the climactic, disastrous &lt;a href=\"battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; where he remained for some time, being guarded by &lt;a href=\"soulstalker\"&gt;soulstalker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWhile on the trail of missing mages, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; find Hakkar in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, where he intervenes before his &lt;a href=\"felhound\"&gt;felhound&lt;/a&gt;s can be stopped from feeding on the mages. Hakkar plans on feeding his hounds until they are strong enough to feed on every mage in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, and since Hakkar and his hounds are immune to most spells Khadgar asks the hunters of the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt; to help. Hakkar's breeding grounds are on the island of &lt;a href=\"Faronaar\"&gt;Faronaar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;, where he breeds his hounds to be resistant to physical attacks just as much as magical ones. The Unseen Path travels there to capture one of the young beasts so that the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kira%20Iresoul\"&gt;Kira Iresoul&lt;/a&gt; can examine it for weaknesses. The Unseen Path rallies the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Covenant\"&gt;Silver Covenant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; to set a trap for Hakkar and his powerful felhounds in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;, and after defeating his favorite felhounds &lt;a href=\"Kreenam\"&gt;Kreenam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Czaadym\"&gt;Czaadym&lt;/a&gt; send him back once again to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nOriginal timeline.\nIn the original &lt;a href=\"time\"&gt;time&lt;/a&gt;line, Hakkar survived the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and was killed during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; warped time and space in an effort to escape their prison, the timeline was altered in a variety of ways, among them &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s efforts to stop them, which in turn altered the course (though not the outcome) of the War of the Ancients. Hakkar's death at the hand of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; was one result of this, signifying that the old timeline was being overwritten, not relived.\nLegacy.\nHakkar's disciple, &lt;a href=\"Omor%20the%20Unscarred\"&gt;Omor the Unscarred&lt;/a&gt;, took charge his remaining felhounds after his death during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nHoundmaster and Soulflayer.\nAccording to an interview with &lt;a href=\"Richard%20A.%20Knaak\"&gt;Richard A.

He at one point controlled the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;'s fallen capital of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;.\nHakkar the Soulflayer was the &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;final boss&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Zul'Gurub raid&lt;/a&gt; until it was removed with and Zul'Gurub was turned into an ordinary subzone of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. Though the world believed Hakkar to be dead, there were rumors that the god might return one day. These ultimately proved true when the troll &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; brought back his spirit in order to drain the blood god's powers into himself.\nHakkar's blood is very potent. A small amount of his blood obtained by &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an%20the%20Prophet\"&gt;Jammal'an the Prophet&lt;/a&gt; was injected into &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to use their bodies to produce the massive quantities of blood necessary to summon Hakkar into the world through a dark ritual that was thwarted by a group of heroic &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s assaulting the temple. Farmed like livestock, the evil that grew within them was then harvested. Hakkar's blood had devastating effects on the dragons. These former jailors of the Atal'ai were corrupted by its presence in their bodies and became creatures of &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Even &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;Eranikus&lt;/a&gt;, one of the greatest green dragons, infused with the largest quantities of blood, became twisted beyond imagination.\nHakkar serves as a supporting antagonist in classic \"World of Warcraft\", , and .\nBiography.\nAncient times.\nThe origins of Hakkar remain unknown, and there are no mentions of him in any &lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt; records.\nA foolish troll attempted to summon Hakkar on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; many millennia ago. While his attempt was stopped, it led to the breakout of a &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20corrupted%20blood\"&gt;plague of corrupted blood&lt;/a&gt; which tore through the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, killing thousands of trolls and leading to one of the most terrifying periods in the island's history. &lt;a href=\"The%20Golden%20Serpent\"&gt;The Golden Serpent&lt;/a&gt; was created by the Zandalari to protect &lt;a href=\"Kings%27%20Rest\"&gt;Kings' Rest&lt;/a&gt; from Hakkar.\nAround 1,500 years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; trolls, driven to desperate ends because of famine and terror which were commonplace within the broken troll kingdoms, sought aid from ancient, mystical forces. The troll kingdoms shared a central belief in a great pantheon of &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;primitive gods&lt;/a&gt;, and the Gurubashi fell under the sway of the darkest one.\nHakkar the Soulflayer, a vile, bloodthirsty spirit, heard the trolls' call and decided to aid them. Hakkar gave his secrets of blood to the Gurubashi and helped them extend their civilization across most of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; and certain islands of the South Seas. Though he brought them great power, Hakkar wanted more and more for his efforts. He filled his adherents with murderous rage and reveled in their dark emotions. The carnage that invariably followed Hakkar suited him perfectly, for having consumed blood, he had developed a taste for it. Worse, he became more powerful as he consumed the blood that was shed in his name, and his tie to the world that was feeding him grew stronger.\nThe bloodthirsty god demanded souls be sacrificed to him daily. He dreamed of gaining access to the physical world so he could devour the blood of all mortal creatures. In time the Gurubashi realized what kind of creature they had courted with \u2014 and turned against him. The strongest tribes rose up against Hakkar and his loyal priests \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt first, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s on the isle of Zandalar were glad for the fellow trolls' prosperity. However, as &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; continued to expand, the Zandalari's pleased surprise turned to disquiet. They consulted myths and delved into historical accounts. What they learned horrified them: Hakkar was also known as the \"Soulflayer\", a name he had richly earned. The Gurubashi Empire was already in a state of civil unrest due to the numerous sacrifices that Hakkar was demanding. With the Zandalari's news, the &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s banded together with the Zandalari and rose up in open revolt against the bloodthirsty Soulflayer.\nThe terrible war that ensued between Hakkar's followers and the rest of the Gurubashi tribes is spoken of only in whispers. The budding empire was shattered by the magic unleashed between the angry god and his rebel children. Just as the battle seemed most hopeless, the trolls succeeded in destroying Hakkar's avatar and banishing him from the world. Even his Atal'ai priests were eventually driven from the capital of Zul'Gurub. After his defeat, the various troll tribes of the jungle began battling each other and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; left the continent and settled on the islands known as the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThough the Atal'ai priests were defeated and ultimately exiled, the great troll empire buckled in upon itself. The exiled priests fled far to the north, into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. There they erected a &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;great temple to Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 where they could prepare for his arrival into the physical world. The great &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, learned of the Atal'ai's plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's drowned ruins are guarded by the green dragons who prevent anyone from getting in or out. However, it is believed that some of the fanatical Atal'ai may have survived Ysera's wrath \u2014 and recommitted themselves to the dark service of Hakkar.\nModern times.\nEven centuries later, only 18-19 years before the Dark Portal opened, some of the Gurubashi would continue to use Hakkar's &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;blood magic&lt;/a&gt;, especially in their &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, far to the north in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, also worshiped Hakkar. &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Priestess%20Hexx\"&gt;Vile Priestess Hexx&lt;/a&gt; sacrificed people to him. Dark vessels of his tainted blood radiated the foul magic of Hakkar, woven by Vile Priestess Hexx, empowering the Vilebranch and also driving them to madness.\nTemple of Atal'Hakkar.\nThe green dragons that had been left by Ysera to guard the Temple of Atal'Hakkar had succumbed to another force, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. The descendants of the Atal'ai returned to the Sunken Temple to find that its guardians were disoriented and vulnerable. Both the Nightmare and the trolls dragged the dragons down into the depths of madness and corruption. In firm control of the temple, the Atal'ai began their gruesome rituals to summon Hakkar into the world. The Atal'ai's spiritual leader, &lt;a href=\"Jammal%27an\"&gt;Jammal'an&lt;/a&gt;, had what he called a prophecy. He believed the summoning of Hakkar will bring the Atal'ai immortality. A green dragon named &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Itharius&lt;/a&gt; called for help from the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, who in turn sent an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; force to cleanse the temple and put an end to the Atal'ai's efforts.\n&lt;a href=\"Yeh%27kinya\"&gt;Yeh'kinya&lt;/a&gt; tricked adventurers into taking an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Egg\"&gt;Ancient Egg&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Jintha%27Alor\"&gt;Jintha'Alor&lt;/a&gt; and infusing it with the essence of the defeated &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Avatar of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; into a &lt;a href=\"Filled%20Egg%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;Filled Egg of Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Ironboot\"&gt;Prospector Ironboot&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Yeh'kinya wasn't about to keep the world safe, but to bring the god Hakkar back. When confronted to hand over the egg, the troll laughed that it is too late as Hakkar has already reborn in Zul'Gurub and the adventurers helped bring the Soulflayer back.\nZul'Gurub.\nThe Zandalari trolls were shocked to learn of the attempt to summon Hakkar in the Sunken Temple and believed the loa's return would herald a dark time for trolls. They were pleased to hear that the Atal'ai had been defeated in the temple, but their relief soon turned to horror. Some of Hakkar's adherents survived, and they were continuing their quest. In time, the Atal'ai priests discovered that Hakkar's physical form could only be summoned within the ancient capital of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, the priests met with success in their quest to call forth Hakkar \u2014 reports confirm the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the Gurubashi ruins.\nIn order to quell the blood god, the trolls of the land banded together and sent a contingent of High Priests into the ancient city. Each priest was a powerful champion of the &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Primal Gods&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Hir%27eek\"&gt;Bat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bethekk\"&gt;Panther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shirvallah\"&gt;Tiger&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Spider&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hethiss\"&gt;Snake&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 but despite their best efforts, they fell under the sway of Hakkar. Now the champions and their Primal God aspects fed the awesome power of the Soulflayer. Any adventurers brave enough to venture into the foreboding ruins had to overcome the High Priests if they were to have any hope of confronting the mighty blood god.\nThe Zandalari knew that they did not have the resources to scour the Atal'ai and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do%20the%20Hexxer\"&gt;Jin'do the Hexxer&lt;/a&gt;, from Zul'Gurub. They sent word through the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; needed to act immediately for Hakkar being successfully summoned would throw the world into chaos. A large Horde strike force was sent to Zul'Gurub in turn. The Horde charged into the temple city, and though they killed the priests and Jin'do they were too late to stop Hakkar's summoning. Manifesting as a force of death and insanity, Hakkar poisoned the blood of the Horde's champions and tried to drag their thoughts into absolute madness. Yet it was Hakkar's own power that proved to be his undoing. In desperation, the Horde forces allowed themselves to be poisoned, and then let Hakkar feed on their corrupted blood. In his frenzied state, with every thought filled with the urge to consume blood, Hakkar paid little heed to the tactics of his seemingly harmless enemies. He was unaware of the poison entering his veins until it was too late, and in the end Hakkar was consumed by his own dark magic.\nAfter the Soulflayer was defeated &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Hakkar\"&gt;his cursed heart&lt;/a&gt;, the still-burning kernel of Hakkar's power, was brought to &lt;a href=\"Molthor\"&gt;Molthor&lt;/a&gt; in the hope the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s would know how to destroy it. The heart was banished.\nCataclysm.\nSeveral years after the defeat of Hakkar in Zul'Gurub, the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20the%20Fallen%20God\"&gt;Sanctum of the Fallen God&lt;/a&gt; have recovered a significant portion of his skeleton and seek to restore Hakkar back to life. Already his children have begun to show up in the area. Although the Avatar of Hakkar was once again defeated in the Sunken Temple the Atal'ai transported most of the blood they produced to Zul'Gurub, where the Hakkari work to summon the Blood God there. Meanwhile the &lt;a href=\"Vilebranch%20tribe\"&gt;Vilebranch tribe&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; had left Hakkar in favor of &lt;a href=\"Shadra\"&gt;Shadra&lt;/a&gt;.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt; recovered the body of two high priests, &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Jeklik\"&gt;High Priestess Jeklik&lt;/a&gt;, and then enlisted the aid of &lt;a href=\"Zanzil%20the%20Outcast\"&gt;Zanzil the Outcast&lt;/a&gt; to resurrect them in the service of Hakkar. Though adventurers working for the Zandalari trolls &lt;a href=\"Maywiki\"&gt;Maywiki&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chabal\"&gt;Chabal&lt;/a&gt; attempted to stop both rituals, they only succeeded in destroying Jeklik's body. It's unclear exactly why, but Jin'do required &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt; to summon Hakkar, while Mandokir required &lt;a href=\"Ohgan%27aka\"&gt;Ohgan'aka&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of &lt;a href=\"Ohgan\"&gt;Ohgan&lt;/a&gt;, his closest and most trusted friend.\nSome time later, the Zandalari trolls under &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; united most of the tribes and aided in restoring Zul'Gurub to its former glory for the purpose of rebuilding the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;old troll empire&lt;/a&gt;. They hoped to use Hakkar in order to wage war on the other races of Azeroth, to save their kind from destruction.\nAdventurers in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; can witness Jin'do, now going by the name \"the Godbreaker,\" holding Hakkar in submission in the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; and stripping out his power to infuse into himself. To stop the invincible Jin'do, adventurers will have to release the captive upon the captor. Upon destroying the spiritual chains holding the Soulflayer in place, Hakkar turns upon Jin'do, and utterly destroys him, leaving only the corpse of Jin'do the Broken. Hakkar then returned the adventurers to the mortal realm, promising to deal with them another time, before vanishing.\nShadowlands.\nAt an unknown point in time, Hakkar passed on to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where he was sent to &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; and came to reside within a &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; to start his rebirthing process. His wildseed was later stolen by &lt;a href=\"Mueh%27zala\"&gt;Mueh'zala&lt;/a&gt; loyalists led by &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rakazodu\"&gt;High Priest Rakazodu&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to resurrect him and &lt;a href=\"Dambala\"&gt;Dambala&lt;/a&gt; to serve in their master's army. However while Dambala fought and died under Mueh'zala's banner, Hakkar left Ardenweald for &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;.\nNo longer content with being the loa of blood, Hakkar sought to become the loa of Blood and Death. To that end, within &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;, he called upon the souls of his &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai%20Devoted\"&gt;Atal'ai Devoted&lt;/a&gt; for war. However, &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;, who claimed he and Hakkar made a deal in which the former handed over some &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; for Hakkar's rituals, decided it was time for Hakkar to pay his debts. Thus Hakkar was once more beaten by the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;mortals&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth. After his defeat, Bwonsamdi remarked Hakkar will return sooner or later.\nQuests.\nCurrently, the following quests involve Hakkar:\nBefore \"Cataclysm\", the following quests dealt with the attempts to resurrect or defeat him:\nIn Hearthstone.\nHakkar appears as in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\", where he has the ability to shuffle into both players' decks as a reference to the original \"World of Warcraft\" debuff (see below). Hakkar was originally planned to have his own gladiator team in the expansion, much like the other loa featured in the set, with Hakkar's team being known as \"Hakkar's Soulflayers\" and being the subject of some of the earliest concept art created for the expansion. However, the \"Hearthstone\" developers eventually changed their mind, since they deemed Hakkar so evil that he would likely just eat his own team, and instead made him a neutral card that shows up to the rumble to \"crash the party\" even though he's \"not invited\". His flavor text reads: \"ATTENTION: Do not enter any major city while infected with the Corrupted Blood!\"\nIn February 2019, Blizzard released the \"Mark of Hakkar\" , which can spread from player to player as another reference to the Corrupted Blood incident. Any time a player faces off against another player with the card back equipped, their opponent will also automatically unlock and equip it. Its flavor text reads: \"Look out! This card back's gone viral!\"\nNotes and trivia.\nCorrupted Blood incident.\nShortly after Zul'Gurub's original release, several players across many servers found that the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Blood%20%28debuff%29\"&gt;Corrupted Blood&lt;/a&gt; debuff, which took away health and spread to other players, could be carried out of the instance through warlock or hunter pets. The debuff would then spread from the pets to the players outside of the instance, creating a massive, in-game epidemic that killed low-level players in seconds and allowed higher levels enough time to corrupt others. &lt;a href=\"Blizz\"&gt;Blizz&lt;/a&gt;ard, who didn't see it coming at first, eventually reset all the servers and made it impossible for pets to carry the debuff outside the instance."}

Hakkar brought the trolls great power, but in return the bloodthirsty god required that souls be sacrificed to him. His demands quickly escalated, and he grew impatient with his loyal priests, the Hakkari. He told them to find a way to summon him physically into the world, so that he might directly drain the blood of his victims. Most of the Hakkari were horrified at the idea, but the &lt;a href=\"Atal%27ai\"&gt;Atal'ai&lt;/a&gt;, a small extremist faction of the Hakkari, decided to do as Hakkar wished.\nBefore the Atal'ai could complete the summoning, the other jungle trolls, including the Hakkari, rose up in open revolt against the cruel god. Even the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; were drawn into the conflict, which finally ended with the destruction of Hakkar's avatar. Driven from the jungles, the Atal'ai was hunted nearly to extinction. Yet a small group of Atal'ai escaped into the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, where they secretly built a great temple to their god: the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;.\nExiled.\nThe Hakkari, too, were killed or exiled for the evil deeds they had done in Hakkar's name, despite the fact that they had fought the Atal'ai. In great bitterness and despair, the surviving Hakkari tracked the Atal'ai to the Swamp of Sorrows and pledged to help the Atal'ai summon Hakkar into Azeroth. Pleased by the Hakkari's obvious suffering, the Atal'ai welcomed their former brethren into the temple. Even so, Hakkar had not forgotten that the Hakkari had betrayed him in opposing his first entry into Azeroth, and so the hungry god would always regard the faithful Atal'ai with greater favor. Both groups bent all their efforts toward bringing about Hakkar's entry into the physical world. \nRecent history.\nThe green Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; the Dreamer, soon learned of the evil priests' plans and smashed the temple beneath the marshes. To this day, the temple's ruins are guarded by mighty green dragons. What much of Azeroth does not know, however, is that the dragons are actually guarding the wrong location. In recent years the exiled Atal'ai have discovered that Hakkar's physical form can only be summoned within the ancient capital of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;, Zul'Gurub. Jammal'an the Prophet, leader of the Atal'ai, told his people that if they succeeded in bringing Hakkar physically into Azeroth, then Hakkar would grant the Atal'ai immortality. The Atal'ai and Hakkari lost no time in dispatching a number of their most skilled priests to Zul'Gurub, where their efforts met with success at last. Numerous spies have confirmed the presence of the dreaded Soulflayer in the heart of the ruins. According to several reports, Hakkar has enthralled five high priests of the trolls' primal gods. Unable to oppose his will, the priests are channeling the power of their gods into Hakkar. Only their deaths can sever the connections that are vastly increasing Hakkar's might while draining the other gods of power. Word of Hakkar's presence reached the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the South Seas, who were even more horrified to discover the enslavement of their kindred, the Zandalari high priests. &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt; has therefore sent emissaries from the island of Zandalar to the Eastern Kingdoms, where the trolls recruit champions from Azeroth's many races in the hope that Hakkar will once again be defeated. \nCataclysm.\nAfter Hakkar was &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;defeated&lt;/a&gt; the Hakkari and the Atal'ai lost control of Zul'Gurub with &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt;'s defection. Despite this they were able to recover a significant portion of Hakkar's skeleton that allowed them to call forth Hakkar's avatar into the world once more. &lt;a href=\"Itharius\"&gt;Lord Itharius&lt;/a&gt; sends adventurers to put an end to the Atal'ai, the Hakkari, and destroy Hakkar's new avatar.\nSometime after wanting to stop Jin'do from summoning Hakkar, the Zandalari trolls unite most of the tribes and aid in restoring &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; to its former glory. They hope to use Hakkar in order to wage war of the other races of Azeroth, to save their kind from destruction. Adventurers in Zul'Gurub can witness &lt;a href=\"Jin%27do\"&gt;Jin'do&lt;/a&gt;, now going by name \"the Godbreaker,\" holding Hakkar in submission and stripping out his power to infuse into himself. To stop the invincible Jin'do, adventurers will have to release the captive upon the captor. Upon destroying the spiritual chains holding the Soulflayer in place, Hakkar turns upon Jin'do, and utterly destroys him, leaving only the corpse of Jin'do the Broken. Hakkar then returns the adventurers to the mortal realm, promising to deal with them another time, before vanishing.\nNaming.\n\"Hakkari\" is the group name for several &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Hakkari\"&gt;Primal Hakkari&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s (see for example, &lt;a href=\"Bijou\"&gt;Bijou&lt;/a&gt;). These items are found in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nSmall in number but vicious, Hakkar's followers battle zealously to keep their ruined temple and city free of invaders. The Hakkari provide much of the priests' military magic and are a strange group: All of them are willing and ready to battle their enemies, and thus all could be considered members of their military. In addition, just about all Hakkari are priests of at least some talent, so invaders are up against a lot of magical pain. In addition, undead Atal'ai, returned to a semblance of life through god-granted necromancy, supplement the ranks.\nThe Hakkari don't like taking chances; they want nothing to disturb Hakkar, now that he is manifest. Thus, priests patrol halls in teams of 2 or 3. If they run into trouble, they do not hesitate to call for reinforcements, so intruders soon find themselves facing a small army of angry troll priests.\nThe Hakkari are intelligent opponents, but their fervor dilutes their cunning. Some priests charge into battle, eager to smash their foes in melee combat, when staying away from the enemy and casting spells may be a better option. These zealots' cooler-headed comrades perform this function, staying away from the enemy \u2014 especially types that look like they could put on the hurt in melee combat \u2014 and cast spells to throw their enemies into confusion. They favor spells like shadow word pain, dispel magic, summon undead and death coil. Powerful priests make liberal use of blasphemy. After they exhaust the offensive spell slots in their two highest levels, they enhance themselves and their allies with inner fire, heroism and avatar and charge into melee. Once there, they strike with their weapons and with spells like inflict critical wounds and harm."}

It was the primary &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; research facility for the study of &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; crystals.\nThe faction controlling the town receives a zone-wide +5% damage buff, and gains access to the NPCs spawned inside Halaa; the opposing faction can attempt to lay siege to Halaa by first killing all 15 of the NPC guards, then outnumbering the faction controlling Halaa on the island itself.\nBesieging Halaa.\nThere are four capturable &lt;a href=\"wyvern\"&gt;wyvern&lt;/a&gt; roosts located around Halaa that can be captured to bombard the plateau from above, aiming to kill the 15 NPC guards. Each wyvern flight gives you 10 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Bomb\"&gt;fire bombs&lt;/a&gt;, which do ~1000 damage on impact, and then a 1% of Max HP as a damage over time area affect (which is mainly intended to kill off the guards, which have over 1 million health points). The faction defending Halaa can destroy the wyvern roosts and attempt to ambush players returning from a bomb run; it is advisable to save one bomb for the landing to reveal any would-be ambushers (the bomb's effect on players, however, is rather negligible). Killed defender NPCs will eventually respawn.\nNote that while the bomb effect is negligible to players beyond the original ~1000hp initial hit, should they continue to stand in the fire spot it creates they will continue taking ~1000hp every few seconds.\nOnce all 15 NPC defenders are dead, a LocalDefense/WorldDefense message \"Halaa is defenseless!\" signifies that Halaa may be captured by having more players than the opposing faction on the plateau itself.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.4\"&gt;patch 2.4&lt;/a&gt;, a daily quest is available to earn 209 honor from killing 10 enemy players in Halaa. The quest is acquired from &lt;a href=\"Lakoor\"&gt;Lakoor&lt;/a&gt; near the jail in Telaar for the Alliance, or from &lt;a href=\"Karrtog\"&gt;Karrtog&lt;/a&gt; in Garadar for the Horde. This quest can be completed within a raid group.\nBattle and Research Tokens.\nFor each PvP kill near Halaa, you receive a &lt;a href=\"Halaa%20Battle%20Token\"&gt;Halaa Battle Token&lt;/a&gt;. You receive Battle Tokens for a PvP kill only if you or a member of your group deals the killing blow.\nWhile your faction controls Halaa, you can trade in 10 &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun%20Crystal%20Powder\"&gt;Oshu'gun Crystal Powder&lt;/a&gt; for one &lt;a href=\"Halaa%20Research%20Token\"&gt;Halaa Research Token&lt;/a&gt; through an NPC in Halaa itself. These tokens can be traded in for rewards through a Quartermaster NPC only available when Halaa is controlled by your faction.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\", the Garrison mission &lt;a href=\"Mysteries%20of%20Lok-rath\"&gt;Mysteries of Lok-rath&lt;/a&gt; provides the opportunity to get many tokens at once, due to the farming difficulties of both PvE and PvP in old expansion content.\nRewards.\nPurchasable from quartermasters.\nHalaa Digsite.\nArchaeology may bring more people to complete for control of Halaa, as hostile guards can be nuisances at best and actual dangers at worst. With their vast HP pools, would-be archaeologists are advised to give the guards a wide berth. Alternately, wrest control of Halaa from the opposing faction (or at least dispose of the guards) via the usual bombing methods."}

He is one of the four animal bosses in the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. He guards the cage containing the gnome female &lt;a href=\"Ashli%20%28gnome%29\"&gt;Ashli&lt;/a&gt; who is part of the &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman%20Timed%20Event\"&gt;Zul'Aman Timed Event&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbilities.\nThe fight consists of 3 phases. Halazzi is a single NPC until taken to 75%, 50% and 25%, at which point he splits into his &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Spirit\"&gt;Troll Spirit&lt;/a&gt; and a Spirit of the Lynx. Take either spirit to 20% to reunite them into the single NPC.\nPhase 1 - Single NPC, no totems\nPhase 2 - Two Spirits, totems (75%, 50%, and 25% health)\nPhase 3 - Single NPC, totems (&lt;25% health)\nStrategy.\nThis is a heavy healing encounter, so bring consumables or a Shadow Priest. Your tanks should have at least 18k health each fully buffed, and must be kept fully healed at all times. Bring three healers, assigning one healer to each tank, and having the third healer split between two. Having a Resto Druid as your third healer is helpful, because he can keep full stacks of Lifebloom on both tanks and innervate one of the healers. Use mana potions as soon as needed, you will need another one\nbefore the encounter ends, so starting potion cooldown early is advisable.\nPhase 1.\nDuring this phase all damage will be focused on the two tanks. The main tank should begin the pull by running forward and engaging Halazzi. The off-tank should run with the main tank. Do not spend time attempting to turn the boss, the off-tank must be in position as quickly as possible.\nSaber Lash is a frontal cleave that can hit up to two targets, splitting the total damage evenly between them. Two tanks must both be in front of the boss in order to properly split the damage. This ability occurs randomly about every 5 to 15 seconds, but often occurs very frequently. This is similar to an ability possessed by &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the event that one of the tanks parries, dodges, or blocks, the other tank still only takes half the Saber Lash if positioning is correct. The tank that parried or dodged completely avoids the damage that they would have taken otherwise. High dodge/parry on the OT is an advantage.\nPhase 2.\nThis phase begins when the merged avatar form of Halazzi is brought to 75%, 50%, and 25% health. At the beginning of this phase he will split into his troll and spirit lynx forms, dealing 4k AoE damage to everyone in the raid.\nThis phase ends when either Halazzi or the Spirit Lynx reaches 20% health. The Spirit Lynx has 10% less health than Halazzi's troll form, but totems spawn near Halazzi so groups with melee damage may prefer to focus on Halazzi instead of the Lynx. Establish your phase 2 DPS target before beginning the fight.\nHalazzi does not perform Saber Lash during this phase.\nHis DPS drops significantly and the lynx does not hit hard. It is possible for one paladin to heal both tanks, so the other 2 healers can be assigned to each raid \ngroup for spot healing and decursing. This significantly helps if your healers run into mana issues, because they wont overheal and decurse the same person.\nThe major priorities in this phase are to destroy the totems as quickly as possible and to dispel the Flame Shock debuff from raid members. The most efficient method to handle totems is for the main tank to enable cast bars as there is a one second cast period when Halazzi drops a totem.\nTotems can be targeted using a macro such as:\nPlease see the for further information about possible targeting macros.\nThe off-tank might find the following macro useful (replace Taunt with Growl for druids):\nThis will target the Spirit if it is up, and taunt it, otherwise it will keep targeting Halazzi. One can start spamming it when the spirit is about to spawn. Due to the exists condition, it won't waste a taunt on Halazzi.\nWhen either the Spirit Lynx or Halazzi's troll form are brought to 20%, they will join back together into the merged avatar form, assume the health he had before splitting, and resume performing Saber Lash. Generally as the Phase 2 DPS target reaches 20%, the tanks should begin to stack up again.\nPhase 3.\nWhen Halazzi joins back together again following the third split phase (from 25% to 0% health), Halazzi will combine Phase 1 and Phase 2 abilities.\nThis phase requires even more healing as the melee attacks from the boss are increased from previous phases.\nQuotes.\nTimer progression:\nAggro:\nSabre Lash:\nSplits into Halazzi and Lynx:\nReturns to Halazzi-only:\nDeath:\nLoot.\nFor the timed event loot, see the &lt;a href=\"Zul%2527Aman_timed_event%23Loot\"&gt;Zul'Aman timed event&lt;/a&gt; article."}

The water totems do not need to be killed, and are useful to healers and other casters.\nAt 66% and 33% health, Halazzi will separate himself from the spirit of the Lynx God, appearing as an ordinary troll with full health alongside a giant lynx. The lynx will mark a party member at attack them. The party may attack either the lynx or stay on Halazzi. It doesn't matter which, but choose one and stay on it. After either gets to low enough health they will join back together and return to phase 1. During this phase he will also drop the corrupted lightning totems. These must be killed quickly as the damage will ramp up fast. During the split phase, Halazzi will periodically Flame Shock random players; dispelling the debuff 25k/3s DoT is advised.\nAt 15% the boss will frenzy, increasing his damage output and becoming able to drop both totems more frequently."}

She was the commander of the night elf forces protecting &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, promoted to the post just before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. She had been a Sentinel since nearly the creation of the organization. She is said to had fought with Tyrande over millennia and that Ashenvale is her true home, rather than the newer &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. She was actually some centuries older than &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;General Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, but recognized the general's skills and eagerly learned all she could, resulting in her promotions within the army.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; begun their launch over Ashenvale she has been trying to send word to Darnassus of the Horde's increased activity there. She lost one of her eyes from an &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; ambush. She fought bravely against the Horde through the forests of Ashenvale, but her forces were not limitless. When &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; arrived with Alliance reinforcements to battle with &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s invading Horde army, firstly Haldrissa was sent to rest but later on she took part in the battle. With Tyrande left incapacitated sometime during the battle, and with the Horde unleashing their &lt;a href=\"magnataur\"&gt;magnataur&lt;/a&gt;s on the Alliance, the Alliance was on the verge of defeat. Haldrissa and a handful of surviving Sentinels led an epic charge to kill Garrosh Hellscream. Yet the charge failed to reach their intended target as the Horde took notice of them and impended their path. Haldrissa converted the failed attempt into a trick that would buy the Alliance a reprieve from the onslaught. She killed one of Garrosh's main trumpeters and tricked the Horde into thinking that Garrosh had signaled a recall of the pressing attack. Though an orc also with one eye, &lt;a href=\"Briln\"&gt;Briln&lt;/a&gt;, tried to fix her interference, she broke the horn to prevent him from remedying the false orders; he gave her a mortal stab to the heart in trying to stop her from destroying it. Verbally acknowledging her cleverness and bravery, Briln told Haldrissa that she did not deserve to die slowly, which she accepted. The orc gave the aging commander a swift death in honor of her valorous actions.\nAfter the battle, &lt;a href=\"Su%27ura%20Swiftarrow\"&gt;Su'ura Swiftarrow&lt;/a&gt; succeeded Haldrissa as commander of Ashenvale's defense, to go along with her previous duties as &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Gulch\"&gt;Warsong Gulch&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"battlemaster\"&gt;battlemaster&lt;/a&gt;."}

Halduron is the long-time best friend of the &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Regent Lord of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, under whom Halduron has served since the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron is Lor'themar's most loyal and trusted comrade, and has served Quel'Thalas with unwavering courage and integrity. He is the regent lord's primary confidant, and one of his chief advisors alongside &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nBackground.\nHalduron was a relative newcomer among the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; the day &lt;a href=\"Ranger-General\"&gt;Ranger-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lireesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; summoned the kingdom's finest rangers to witness &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;her heir's&lt;/a&gt; ritual tribulation. He always spared time to greet &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, who were too young to train as Farstriders. Astride his dragonhawk, Halduron fetched the Windrunner patriarch &lt;a href=\"Verath\"&gt;Verath&lt;/a&gt; when his wife went into labor, and carried Vereesa back to her family's spire to meet &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;the newborn&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalduron and his close friend and comrade &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; grew especially close to Sylvanas in the years to come. The three became known as \"the Trio\" among their high elf peers: merry Halduron, pensive Lor'themar, and mischievous Sylvanas.\nAfter Ranger General Lireesa and her husband were killed in &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;, Halduron took part in the preliminary investigation and ensured the bodies were returned home with care. He then attended the ceremonial election of his ranger-general's successor at &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Retreat\"&gt;Farstrider Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. Concurring with Lor'themar's high praise of Sylvanas, Halduron threw his support behind her and defended her ascension when it was &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Helios\"&gt;challenged&lt;/a&gt; by one who believed &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; better suited. Halduron knew the infighting between Alleria and Lireesa had splintered the Farstriders, and while he would have gladly served the elder Windrunner scion had she embraced rather than rejected the mantle of ranger-general, Sylvanas nobly rose to accept a responsibility that should not have been her own. Alleria herself settled the matter with an endorsement of Sylvanas, who was unanimously elected ranger-general. Halduron later opposed the induction of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Marris\"&gt;Nathanos Marris&lt;/a&gt; into the Farstriders, feeling it would be a contentious decision that would induce further strife, but Sylvanas insisted on his appointment.\nSecond War.\nHalduron, a high elven &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt;, served his country faithfully as the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s - emboldened by their alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; - attacked &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; directly. Halduron, disguised as an elderly cloaked man leaning on a staff for support, was stalked by a troll named &lt;a href=\"Ter%27lij\"&gt;Ter'lij&lt;/a&gt; and his war-party. However, Halduron shed his disguise and quickly turned the tables on his opponents, cutting them down with his longsword and impaling Ter'lij mid-air with a spear. He was approached by &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, a longtime friend of his, who had convinced &lt;a href=\"King%20Anasterian\"&gt;King Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; to mobilize his forces against the invaders. She instructed him to join up with her sister, &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-General&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, and waylay the enemy forces in the &lt;a href=\"Eversong\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron and his company departed, and joined up with his comrade &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;'s ranger company too.\nAfter the orcs had abandoned the battle, King Anasterian fielded priests and magi to bolster the Farstriders' ranks. Halduron's company was aided by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, and it was Halduron who fell upon a noteworthy prize: the Amani chieftain &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; himself, cut off from his brethren and trapped by rampant dragon fire. Halduron and his rangers swiftly cut down the chieftain's comrades, and took him into custody. Yet as the fire prevented Zul'jin from reuniting with his trolls, it also stopped Halduron from corresponding with Sylvanas. With little choice left, the elves set up camp, and beat the captured chieftain mercilessly. Many of Halduron's rangers had lost friends and loved ones to Zul'jin's frequent campaigns. Halduron presided over his torture (one of his men was responsible for the infamous gouging out of Zul'jin's eye); when confronted about its brutality by Liadrin and urged to just execute the chieftain, Halduron maintained that it was out of his hands, though he had another motive: Halduron had hoped to keep Zul'jin alive and allow Lor'themar to decide his fate, as catharsis for his friend's own torture at Zul'jin's hands years before.\nSoon after, an Amani raiding party arrived to save their chieftain. Halduron was impaled by a spear, though Liadrin healed the wound and tossed the weapon aside. Halduron rallied his rangers to battle, and while the trolls were dispersed, they had succeeded in their mission: using the same spear that had nearly killed Halduron, Zul'jin had cut off his own arm and escaped. Halduron held great guilt over this for years to come, having had Zul'jin's life in his hands but letting it slip away.\nHalduron held the rank of lieutenant during the Second War, and was made a ranger captain before the Third.\nThird War.\nHalduron was stationed south of the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; during the early stages of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"The%20Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt;. He narrowly saved &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt;'s life from a group of reanimated elven guardians, who had blinded his friend and butchered Lor'themar's unsuspecting platoon. Like Lor'themar, Halduron had suspected something was amiss with the hidden crystals at &lt;a href=\"An%27owyn\"&gt;An'owyn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"An%27telas\"&gt;An'telas&lt;/a&gt;, which helped empower &lt;a href=\"Ban%27dinoriel\"&gt;Ban'dinoriel&lt;/a&gt; (\"Gatekeeper\"), the protective shield around Silvermoon. The crystals had been stolen. After slaying a lurking necromancer, the two rushed back to defend the capital, though the battle was already in its waning moments.\nRanger General Sylvanas was slain by the merciless &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Arthas\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, and a void was left\u2014leaving the &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; without a leader. Halduron sought out many survivors of the attack and brought them back to the safety of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bazaar\"&gt;The Bazaar&lt;/a&gt;, the only part of Silvermoon reclaimed. After &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; returned to Quel'Thalas, Halduron pledged to aid their prince in destroying the corrupted &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;, and was one of the twenty elves who rushed to the isle before the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; could secure the tainted fount of power. Kael'thas destroyed it, saving the high elves from death and corruption but forcing a withdrawal-based lethargy upon them in its place.\nBack in Silvermoon, Kael'thas rallied the masses and christened them the \"blood elves.\" When Lor'themar was named regent, Halduron became the Ranger-general of Silvermoon and the leader of the Farstriders in the absence of Sylvanas. Lor'themar and Halduron continued to safeguard the Scourge-infested elven homeland from further threats, and were commanded to find a cure for the sin'dorei's magic addiction within the borders of Quel'Thalas.\nHalduron was horrified by the fate of Sylvanas Windrunner; the atrocities Arthas forced her to commit haunted his dreams. Unaware that she'd reclaimed her free will, he and Lor'themar were content to believe their beloved friend at peace in death. Sylvanas, painfully aware of this, did not reveal herself to her old friends until carving out a kingdom of her own in fallen Lordaeron.\nThe Sunwell.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; renamed the &lt;a href=\"high%20elven\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; race \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen brethren, he joined with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; to battle the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; threat running rampant throughout &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron and his old friend &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; were instructed to remain behind in the shattered &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and attempt to find a cure for their people, fresh from the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction. Halduron and Lor'themar coordinated guerilla attacks against the Scourge remnants within Quel'Thalas, with varying success.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt; pursued the current avatar of the Sunwell, a woman named &lt;a href=\"Anveena%20Teague\"&gt;Anveena Teague&lt;/a&gt;, to the elven homeland. Lor'themar and Halduron learned of this and resolved to avenge the Sunwell's destruction by killing the treacherous Dar'Khan. In a conversation with Halduron, Lor'themar reveals that Dar'Khan had befriended him in order to use his knowledge of Quel'Thalas' defenses against their people, after he betrayed them to &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; himself. Halduron ambushed Dar'Khan as he taunted Lor'themar about his role in their homeland's destruction, though both Halduron and Lor'themar were pushed back after Dar'Khan raised undead high elves against them.\nHalduron later discovers the presence of none other than &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, his predecessor, active in Quel'Thalas. He and Lor'themar find and take &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and his companions captive, though they ultimately join forces after Kalecgos reveals their plight and &lt;a href=\"Tyrigosa\"&gt;Tyrigosa&lt;/a&gt; reveals her dragon form. Halduron is skeptical of joining forces with Sylvanas, reasoning that she may have plans of her own for the Sunwell; however, he and Lor'themar conclude that she is likely here only for Dar'Khan's head. Halduron accompanies his new allies to the relief of Anveena, while Lor'themar travels astride Tyrigosa. Halduron's forces arrive in the waning moments of the battle against Dar'Khan and his undead legions and hold them off long enough for Kalecgos to overcome his affliction and rejoin the battle in dragon form. Halduron witnesses the apparent destruction of Dar'Khan at the hands of a reinvigorated Anveena.\nFollowing this, Halduron gains knowledge of Anveena's status as the Sunwell's mortal avatar, and she is put under the blood elves' protection at an undisclosed location in Quel'Thalas.\nBlood of the Highborne.\nUnder Lor'themar's instruction, Halduron frequently supplied &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; with mana crystals to ease her magical addiction. The rangers had been less affected by its onset than most, though they were unsure as to why. Halduron's platoon had discovered a raid of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; treasure hunters at &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, almost all of whom had been slain. The sole survivor relayed tales of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s re-emergence, knowledge which weighed heavily on Halduron's shoulders. Halduron retained guilt for his decision to keep &lt;a href=\"Zul%27jin\"&gt;Zul'jin&lt;/a&gt; alive back in the Second War, though Lor'themar assured him that true leadership isn't making the right decisions every time, but learning from the wrong ones. Halduron remained his most trusted and loyal comrade throughout this turbulent period, the regent hailing Halduron's unwavering courage and integrity in service to Quel'Thalas.\nHalduron led a squad of rangers to attack &lt;a href=\"Dawnstar%20Spire\"&gt;Dawnstar Spire&lt;/a&gt; after \"&lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Thaddir's&lt;/a&gt;\" identity had been discerned, and relieved the surrounded &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; from the Scourge ambush. They were soon joined by Lor'themar, &lt;a href=\"Astalor%20Bloodsworn\"&gt;Astalor Bloodsworn&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28blood%20elf%29\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nJoining the Horde.\nFriendless and imperiled, beset by enemies on all sides, Quel'Thalas needed allies now its ties to the Alliance had been severed. With no one else willing to fight for the kingdom, Halduron was open to an alliance with the reformed &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, of which Sylvanas was now a part, and met its leaders at the &lt;a href=\"Thalassian%20Pass\"&gt;Thalassian Pass&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron exchanged courtesies with &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;. The two came to a swift understanding: bloody as elf and troll history was, the Darkspear were not the Amani, and the upheaval in Quel'Thalas had forced a few of the elves \u2013 Halduron among them \u2013 to conquer their famous prejudices. Halduron escorted the Horde's leaders to the &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Enclave\"&gt;Farstrider Enclave&lt;/a&gt; to meet the regent lord, and sat on the council that saw Quel'Thalas admitted into the Horde.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nDuring this time, he was supportive of Lor'themar's decisions to keep the nation safe, such as allying with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to protect the southern &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron was opposed to the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt;, and indeed shared &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;High Chieftain Cairne's&lt;/a&gt; deep concerns about the maltreatment of &lt;a href=\"M%27uru\"&gt;M'uru&lt;/a&gt;, which led him into several arguments with Rommath, who himself was a strong supporter of the Blood Knights.\nThe ranger-general was informed of a dwarven spy named &lt;a href=\"Prospector%20Anvilward\"&gt;Anvilward&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalduron and Rommath would come to harsh words on many matters, though Halduron came to develop a respect and trust for his compatriot after Rommath remained loyal to Silvermoon following the devastating &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;betrayal&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;. With the elven scion no more, Halduron urged the regent lord to take a more royal and prestigious role in Quel'Thalas, though Lor'themar was consistently opposed to this notion.\nIn the Shadow of the Sun.\nShortly after the great betrayal of &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar\"&gt;Lor'themar&lt;/a&gt; receives numerous letters from one &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Aethas%20Sunreaver\"&gt;Archmage Aethas Sunreaver&lt;/a&gt;, desiring an audience. His pleas being ignored, Aethas finally simply announces his intention to visit Silvermoon City. As Halduron, Lor'themar and Rommath await Aethas' arrival, Halduron hands Lor'themar the unmistakable &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City%20Tabard\"&gt;Silvermoon City Tabard&lt;/a&gt;, chiding him for his desire to retain his &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; attire, and going a step further to suggest the head of the state should not cloth himself in the trappings of a ranger. Lor'themar refuses to take it, stating that he is still a Farstrider, though Halduron\u2014referencing the events that transpired on &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;\u2014implores him that his role as a ranger is far behind him now. Halduron is present during the verbal showdown between Rommath and Aethas and attempts to curb the grand magister's tirade by hoping none of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; ever end up under Arthas' sway.\nFollowing Aethas and Rommath's strong disagreement regarding the Kirin Tor and &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, Lor'themar retires to his chambers. Halduron soon joins him, and the two old friends discuss what should be done. Halduron speaks at length of the grand magister, referencing a new-found respect for him after Rommath remained loyal to Quel'Thalas after the great betrayal of the elven scion. Halduron also suggests Rommath as an ideal liaison for Aethas, despite their differences, and the Ranger General concedes that if the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; want to admit blood elves back into its ranks, then there are those who would welcome the chance to retain good relations with Dalaran again. After a political discussion about just how far the regency of Quel'Thalas should approve or eschew official involvement in the Kirin Tor's welfare, Halduron lightly references Lor'themar's attitude to that of a king's, though the regent lord becomes slightly agitated at the thought.\nSeveral days later, Lor'themar prepares for his journey &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;south of the Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, against Halduron's advice. Knowing that he can't stop him, Halduron settles for ensuring Lor'themar has an adequate escort. Halduron, Rommath, and Aethas later await Lor'themar's return, and Aethas briefly inquires about how his journey to the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; lodge went. Aethas makes an allusion to his desire to help bridge the gap between the quel'dorei and sin'dorei at this point, though Halduron is unsurprised at the poor outcome of Lor'themar's trip.\nLater that afternoon, Lor'themar informs Halduron of the full picture: that the elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Lithien\"&gt;Quel'Lithien&lt;/a&gt; had come under attack from &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; agents in the name of &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, and that the quel'dorei of the lodge had outright declined any assistance from the sin'dorei. Halduron notes that it was to be expected, especially considering Lor'themar had banished them from Quel'Thalas prior. Lor'themar reasons that he could not lead a nation divided, and that at any rate, the killed rangers were as much Halduron's company as they were his. Halduron briefly questions whether or not the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Dark Lady&lt;/a&gt; would know of Nathanos' onslaught, though retracts the statement upon wondering whether or not she would even care. He instead encourages Lor'themar, reasoning that no one else would fight of Quel'Thalas in its hour of need.\nHalduron accompanies Lor'themar to his meeting with Sylvanas and shares his all-too-familiar despair upon looking upon the fate that befell their former ranger-general. Following Sylvanas' successful twisting of Lor'themar's arm to dedicate troops to the looming &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; conflict, and Lor'themar's own conflict with Rommath in regards to it, Halduron formally asks what the Regent Lord's orders are. Having resolved to commit to the war effort, Lor'themar instructs him to contact the &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; lodges, and inform them of what has been decided.\nHalduron simply nods\u2014with a cold courtesy that unnerves the regent lord\u2014and gives Lor'themar a glance he cannot quite read.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nHalduron plays a role in the quest to restore the legendary elven blade &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Delar\"&gt;Quel'Delar&lt;/a&gt;, having traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; to oversee and inspect the renewed &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;'s defenses. He now controls access to the Sunwell, and learns of &lt;a href=\"Myralion%20Sunblaze\"&gt;Myralion Sunblaze&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Caladis%20Brightspear\"&gt;Caladis Brightspear&lt;/a&gt;'s quest to see the blade restored. Halduron is initially skeptical of whether the blade is truly ready to accept another owner, and reiterates the fate of the blade's original owner, &lt;a href=\"Thalorien%20Dawnseeker\"&gt;Thalorien Dawnseeker&lt;/a&gt;, a valiant high elf who gave his life to buy the Sunwell's defenders time to prepare for the Scourge assault. Halduron sends heroes to his resting place, and allows them to enter the Sunwell once the spirit of Thalorien offers them his blessing.\nFor &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; agents, he urges them not to be intertwined in &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;'s political scheming within, and to instead remain focused on the task at hand. For &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; agents, Halduron warns them that they are guests in the most sacred place known to the people of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, and to behave accordingly.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; declared the united troll empire reborn, Halduron left to do battle with the reinvigorated &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani empire&lt;/a&gt; brewing in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;. He makes an appearance on the outskirts of Zul'Aman, meeting with his &lt;a href=\"Farstrider%20Troll-Hunter\"&gt;Farstrider Troll Hunters&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. He is approached by a &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Messenger\"&gt;Silvermoon Messenger&lt;/a&gt;, who conveys Regent Lord Lor'themar's demand to know why Vereesa had entered their lands. Halduron reveals that many of his &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; are unavailable on duty and thus unable to be recalled easily, and so he had personally invited Vereesa and her rangers to help address the new Zul'Aman threat. The messenger mentions that Lor'themar does not agree with the sentiment, and that Halduron has no authority to do so, though Halduron dismisses it as necessary - his role as &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;' ranger-general allowing him to seek aid wherever needed to keep his homeland safe. Halduron sends the messenger back to Silvermoon with the plans for battle.\nHalduron's scouts had found nothing but silence around Zul'Aman itself, though Vol'jin is certain that the burgeoning Amani remnants are biding their time within the ruins. Vol'jin goes on to explain that the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; are seeking to create a new &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; empire, reaching out to all of the troll tribes, including the Amani and his own Darkspear tribe\u2014the likes of which would be a grave threat to Quel'Thalas if not immediately dealt with. Halduron and Vereesa resolve to join forces, their Farstriders and rangers lending aid to Vol'jin's plight.\nTides of War.\nHalduron and Lor'themar sent a subordinate of the ranger-general, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knight\"&gt;Blood Knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kelantir%20Bloodblade\"&gt;Kelantir Bloodblade&lt;/a&gt;, to aid in &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s assault on &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron thought highly of Bloodblade, and was saddened to hear of her death.\nMists of Pandaria.\nLandfall.\nHalduron and Lor'themar were present at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Court of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Purge%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;the situation&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; concluded, overseeing the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; portals funneling in members of the &lt;a href=\"Sunreavers\"&gt;Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt; who escaped the purge. Lor'themar ordered Halduron to assemble the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt;, noting that the time had come for the blood elves to take matters into their own hands.\nRise of the Thunder King.\nHalduron accompanied the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Onslaught\"&gt;Sunreaver Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, taking up arms in the Onslaught's name along with a contingent of his rangers. After departing into the wilderness with &lt;a href=\"Kethiel%20Sunlance\"&gt;Kethiel Sunlance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elina%20Zaralae\"&gt;Elina Zaralae&lt;/a&gt;, Halduron focused on taking on the local &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; threat; while he did not wish to commit genocide against the Zandalari, he understood that a little shortening of their numbers would not be enough to achieve victory. Halduron assuaged Horde champions over the killings and assured them that the blood spilled was on his own hands, not theirs. He and &lt;a href=\"Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt; would routinely return to the &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Promontory\"&gt;Dawnseeker Promontory&lt;/a&gt; as the base camp construction progressed.\nWar Crimes.\nHalduron accompanied Lor'themar to the trial of the deposed &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;. Like &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, Halduron watched intently as the fates of their subordinates, Kelantir and &lt;a href=\"Frandis%20Farley\"&gt;Frandis Farley&lt;/a&gt;, were shown to the court.\nLegion.\nHalduron Brightwing represents the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, the union of all hunters on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Halduron can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Horde. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Horde)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Alliance, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;High Warlord's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, as well as an artifact appearance.\nAs a member of the Unseen Path, Halduron participated in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar the Houndmaster&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Violet%20Hold\"&gt;Violet Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nHalduron returned to Silvermoon and when Lor'themar went to address &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, Halduron was seen sitting next to the main chair in the Spire's main hall.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; called upon the champions of the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; to draw the corruption out of the &lt;a href=\"Sword%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sword of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Halduron carried &lt;a href=\"Thas%27dorah%2C%20Legacy%20of%20the%20Windrunners\"&gt;Thas'dorah, Legacy of the Windrunners&lt;/a&gt; if the player was not a hunter, representing the Unseen Path.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nHalduron was present in the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Court of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Heritage%20of%20the%20Sin%27dorei\"&gt;Heritage of the Sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; ended, Halduron assured &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; that Quel'Thalas is secured, allowing Lor'themar to visit &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;.\nA Moment in Verse.\nHalduron and Rommath took charge of Silvermoon and Quel'Thalas during Lor'themar's visit to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt;. Lor'themar noted that both of them had taken an unusual interest in his journey.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nHalduron was among those who attended the wedding of &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nTactics.\nThe battle with Lor'themar, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, and Halduron can be intimidating for a small raid, and is somewhat comparable to the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; encounter. Rommath and Halduron can prove a serious threat to the raid, and killing all three may seem daunting at first. However, the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Guard%20%28blood%20elf%29\"&gt;Royal Guards&lt;/a&gt; have not been updated since WotLK, so they are dispatched quite easily. It is vital that the raid keep in mind that their respawn timers, like Garrosh Hellscream, are only 10 minutes, unlike other city leaders.\nRaids should devote a few players to keeping an eye out for players teleporting in from behind Lor'themar's chamber as well as the mage trainer's room so as to be ready to quickly dispatch horde players who come to Lor'themar's aid from the Undercity and Pandaria respectively. Your tank should hold Lor'themar to one side of the room to give healers adequate distance to avoid Lor'themar's Mana Burn ability. PvP trinkets are a must for this fight in order to deal with Lor'themar's Mass Charm spell.\nThe combined HP levels of the three Silvermoon leaders can make this a long boss fight, their total HP pool nearly being 1.85B and with several mechanics to take into account for each boss. This is countered by players only needing to kill Lor'themar and the relatively low chance of a &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; defense force gaining swift knowledge of a Silvermoon raid. Thus, player interference is much less likely than in some of the more populated cities.\nHalduron strikes swiftly when in melee range, and will periodically use a &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multi-shot&lt;/a&gt; ability similar to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;', hitting up to ten members of the raid and will also hit random raid members with a regular &lt;a href=\"Shoot\"&gt;Shoot&lt;/a&gt; ability. Rommath will rely on fire-based attacks - &lt;a href=\"Fireball\"&gt;Fireball&lt;/a&gt; on his current target and &lt;a href=\"Flamestrike\"&gt;Flamestrike&lt;/a&gt; on a certain location, but is immune to any interrupts. Rommath's &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Armor\"&gt;Molten Armor&lt;/a&gt; can be dispelled, but he will immediately recast it. Focussing on Halduron, Rommath and Lor'themar respectively will allow more breathing space, as without Halduron and Rommath's abilities to consider, the battle drops in difficulty.\nLike Halduron, Lor'themar strikes swiftly in melee range, and generally alternates between his &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arcane%20Shock\"&gt;Arcane Shock&lt;/a&gt; abilities. His &lt;a href=\"Mana%20Burn\"&gt;Mana Burn&lt;/a&gt; has increased in potency, though he will only infrequently cast his &lt;a href=\"Mass%20charm\"&gt;Mass charm&lt;/a&gt;. With luck, subtlety, and enough concentrated DPS, Lor'themar will fall.\nPersonality.\nHalduron Brightwing, as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, represents the side of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; typically associated with its rangers and woodsmen. He is a natural ranger, a talented military leader, and is hailed by Lor'themar as a courageous man who has served Quel'Thalas with unwavering integrity. Halduron has few of the haughty prejudices often associated with the elves. In happier times, Halduron was known to be good-natured, merry, and quick to laugh, but the horrors of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; hardened his manner.\nHalduron is Lor'themar's primary confidant, providing level-headed counsel to his friend to this day. While loyal to Lor'themar and his regime, Halduron is willing to cross boundaries when the situation is deemed necessary, as showcased in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. Halduron developed a trust and respect for his counterpart, &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magister%20Rommath\"&gt;Grand Magister Rommath&lt;/a&gt;, after the betrayal of their prince to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Though tolerant and fair, Halduron can also be ruthless to his enemies; like many Farstriders, Halduron has a deep hatred for the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs expected of Quel'Thalas' Ranger General, Halduron is skilled in combat (both melee and ranged) and has been shown to wield a variety of weapons, including spears, swords, daggers, and bows, with prowess. He has been seen wielding a longspear in tandem with his longsword, using both of their strengths to dispose of larger groups of enemies. He is not above using subterfuge and deception in battle, posing as a weak target to lure bloodthirsty enemies out of hiding. He calls this tactic \"Feeble Old Man\".\nAppearance.\nHalduron is described as a handsome-looking elf with narrow features, more often than not cloaked and with his bow and blades at his side. During his battles in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, Halduron was draped in a mixture of cloth and mail; his bow nestled atop his cloak and his chest covered by a large sin'dorei phoenix emblem. His hair is long, blonde and slicked, parted at the front, and further parted into two large bangs for his debut in \"World of Warcraft\".\nHis initial outfit in \"World of Warcraft\" was a simplified version of the &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; attire\u2014green and yellow leather with two daggers and a bow. His model update for &lt;a href=\"Patch%204.1.0\"&gt;Patch 4.1.0&lt;/a&gt; showed Halduron donning a more exquisite outfit\u2014dark cobalt mails and shedding his humble bow for &lt;a href=\"Thori%27dal%2C%20the%20Stars%27%20Fury\"&gt;Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury&lt;/a&gt;. He still, however, retained his old daggers.\nQuotes.\nIsle of Thunder.\nMy rangers have sent back disturbing reports from Za'Tual. I believe it is time to take this fight to their doorstep.\nLegion.\nWhile we have an arsenal of weapons at our disposal, the Farstriders don't have any weapons &lt;a href=\"Artifact\"&gt;quite like yours&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to help take down &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Houndmaster\"&gt;Hakkar's&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Felhound\"&gt;hounds&lt;/a&gt;, we'll need to arm ourselves appropriately."}

He was tasked with subverting the local &lt;a href=\"Drakkari\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt; trolls and making them into an army of Blight infused trolls. Adventurers of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; were sent as undercover agents by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; to undermine his efforts and slay him. In the end, however, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was the one who killed him, disgusted by his defeat and amused by the adventurers' duplicity.\nBackground.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the wandering &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; first encountered Drakuru when he was assigned to capture an &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;ice troll&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Drak%27Zin\"&gt;Ruins of Drak'Zin&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Samir\"&gt;Samir&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Granite%20Springs\"&gt;Granite Springs&lt;/a&gt;. Drakuru proposed a truce with them, offering to share his knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Drak%27tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Through the use of an alchemical potion, the adventurer maintained contact with Drakuru, who guided them in a journey to collect several artifacts that make the keep impervious: The &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20the%20Prophets\"&gt;Eye of the Prophets&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;Heart of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and a set of &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20Tablets\"&gt;Drakkari Tablets&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe adventurer summoned Drakuru at the top of Drak'tharon Keep, where he revealed that he was actually betraying the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari Empire&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Drakuru was awarded the Keep and the risen dead minions from it, and charged with 'cleansing' Zul'Drak. He even offered the adventurer a position in Zul'Drak.\nAfter the betrayal of his own people to the Lich King, as Drak'tharon Keep fell early to the Scourge thanks to his betrayal, Drakuru was given control over the necropolis &lt;a href=\"Voltarus\"&gt;Voltarus&lt;/a&gt;, Drakuru had a plan to infuse captured troll chieftains with blight and transform them into misshapen weapons for the Scourge.\nThe adventurer later encountered Drakuru after narrowly dodging a trap laid by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. With the assistance of &lt;a href=\"Stefan%20Vadu\"&gt;Stefan Vadu&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Hand&lt;/a&gt;, the adventurer infiltrated the necropolis Voltarus and convinced Drakuru - now Overlord - to reveal his &lt;a href=\"Blightblood%20Troll\"&gt;new weapons&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn a final showdown, the adventurer used Drakuru's own &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Scepter of Domination&lt;/a&gt; to turn his &lt;a href=\"Blightblood%20Troll\"&gt;Blightblood Troll&lt;/a&gt;s against him. On the verge of being defeated, Drakuru summoned the Lich King for help. The Lich King beheaded Drakuru for his failure, but spared the adventurer's life for having amused him.\nPersonality.\nDrakuru was fiercely loyal to the Lich King and had zero tolerance for failure. He often offered great power to his subordinates to motivate their success, and would follow through on his offers, demonstrated when he gave the adventurer his &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Scepter of Domination&lt;/a&gt; saying that they would need it to lead his army of &lt;a href=\"Blightblood%20Troll\"&gt;Blightblood Troll&lt;/a&gt;s. Also, he seemed to have arranged having certain adventurers made into the Scourge serving under him, in a crude form of affection towards them.\nScepters.\nDrakaru owned a variety of powerful scepters. It is unknown if these were given to him by the Lich King, or if he already possessed them before joining the Scourge. \nQuotes.\nEy, mon!\nGood to be seein' ya again... &lt;name&gt; right? yes, yes, of course.\nYou and I gunna be real good friends. Drakuru know dese things.\n&lt;A grin slowly spreads across the troll's painted face.&gt;\nAchievement.\nCompleting &lt;a href=\"Cleansing%20Drak%27Tharon\"&gt;Cleansing Drak'Tharon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Betrayal\"&gt;Betrayal&lt;/a&gt; awards the Achievement ."}

His second in command was &lt;a href=\"General%20Grebo\"&gt;General Grebo&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nHe oversaw the delivery of &lt;a href=\"The%20Bomb\"&gt;The Bomb&lt;/a&gt; into Stonetalon, and planned to expel the Alliance from Kalimdor, no matter the cost. He was directly responsible for the deaths of &lt;a href=\"High%20Chieftain%20Cliffwalker\"&gt;High Chieftain Cliffwalker&lt;/a&gt;'s family. He was \"dismissed\" by &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; because of his dishonorable tactics, such as the bombing of &lt;a href=\"Thal%27darah%20Grove\"&gt;Thal'darah Grove&lt;/a&gt;, which ultimately led to a Pyrrhic victory and brought shame to the Horde. If players have not yet completed the questline, then they can see him residing at &lt;a href=\"Krom%27gar%20Fortress\"&gt;Krom'gar Fortress&lt;/a&gt;. He appears at &lt;a href=\"Cliffwalker%20Post\"&gt;Cliffwalker Post&lt;/a&gt; late in the chain.\nIronically, Garrosh himself later uses similar tactics in his &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;attack on Theramore&lt;/a&gt;.\nPersonality.\nKrom'gar was an overzealous partisan and fiercely loyal, both to the Horde and Warchief Hellscream. This, coupled with his paranoia and lack of ethics, led to him mishandling his army in Stonetalon in pursuit of victory. However, Krom'gar was not evil, just misguided. He committed his war crimes because he thought he was doing what he must and only in the end, when he had fallen out of Hellscream's favor, did he realize the error of his ways. That said, Krom'gar was not without redeeming qualities. He incentivized his soldiers with rousing speeches and promotions if they performed well, and he inspired fierce loyalty in them. Though he cowered in the face of an enraged Hellscream, he stood defiantly in the face of the attack on Krom'gar Fortress. He evidently also had a soft side, as shown by him buying &lt;a href=\"ice%20cream\"&gt;ice cream&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Clarissa\"&gt;Clarissa&lt;/a&gt; and the Horde adventurers after they helped slaughter some Alliance forces (though he admitted that Clarissa's strange behavior left him, perhaps for the first time in his life, speechless)."}
