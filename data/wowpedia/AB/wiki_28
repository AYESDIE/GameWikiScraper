{"id": "13738", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13738", "title": "Hooking functions", "text": "Hooking functions allows you to replace a function value in an accessible environment by a function of your own, calling the original function before or after execution of new code. Hooking enables addons to modify and/or extend the behavior of the default UI and API.\nDepending on how the behavior of the original function is be modified, one or more of three hook types may be used:\nFunctions as values.\nFunctions are first-class values in Lua: they may be assigned to variables, used as table keys, passed as arguments and returned from functions just like any other value type. Because API and public interface functions reside in the global namespace, and addons rarely use local aliases, it is possible to alter the value of a variable storing a function\u2014and have existing code call the new function. This makes it possible to modify function behavior by hooking.\nThe traditional function declaration, shown below, is merely syntactic sugar for the assignment of a function value to the variable specified by the function name. Thus, the following two lines are identical:\n function foo(n) return n^2; end\n foo = function(n) return n^2; end\nBecause most addons (and the default UI code) call most functions without using a local reference, it is possible to retrieve and change the value stored in a global variable, and get the addons to call your new function rather than the old global one, thereby enabling you to override its behavior. For example:\n local ok, err = pcall(error, \"Throw this error\"); -- results in false, \"Throw this error\"\n error = function(...) print(...); end\n local ok, err = pcall(error, \"Throw this error\"); -- results in true; \"Throw this error\" is printed.\nIn the above example, the original value of error was discarded; in hooking, the original value is typically called by the new function.\nHooking a function.\nTo illustrate the concept, let's create a pre-hook. Pre-hooks are commonly used to override user interface functions that perform an (unprotected) action, potentially adding behavior to existing UI. In this example, hook (a function called when the user clicks on a chat link) to display a faux tooltip for the &lt;a href=\"Tinfoil%20Hat\"&gt;Tinfoil Hat&lt;/a&gt;, an item currently not in the game.\nExplained in detail, the preceding code does:\nThe example used the vararg expression to make sure that, should the API change, the hook will still pass exactly the arguments it was given (no more, no less) to the original function. An additional sanity check on the type of the link argument in 3 prevents a potential error: if the function was not passed a string as expected (for example, by another addon), we do not want to block the default behavior.\nPost-hooking.\nPost-hooks are used to act on an API function call performed by another addon / the user / the default UI, and respond to the performed action when there's no reliable event-based notification. For instance, companions and &lt;a href=\"API%20GetCursorInfo\"&gt;GetCursorInfo&lt;/a&gt; do not function well as of &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.9\"&gt;Patch 3.0.9&lt;/a&gt;, so it may be desirable to obtain the information about the last companion picked up on the cursor from the &lt;a href=\"API%20PickupCompanion\"&gt;PickupCompanion&lt;/a&gt; call. So we post-hook:\n local lastCompanionType, lastCompanionIndex; -- (1)\n local function postHook(typeID, index, ...) -- (2)\n lastCompanionType, lastCompanionIndex = typeID, index; -- (3)\n return ...; -- (4)\n end\n local oldPickupCompanion = PickupCompanion; -- (5)\n function PickupCompanion(...) -- (6)\n local typeID, index = ...; -- (7)\n return postHook(typeID, index, oldPickupCompanion(typeID, index, ...)); --(8)\n end\nThe syntax here is a bit convoluted, defining two functions to accomplish create the hook; this construction is used to make sure that all of the arguments (even if a future patch adds/remove additional arguments) are passed to the original function, and all of its return values are returned by the hook. Step-by-step description of this syntax:\nHooking secure functions.\nSecure functions cannot be hooked directly\u2014as that would taint the variable holding the function, and, as a result, the execution path to the secure function, causing it to fail. Instead, the &lt;a href=\"API%20hooksecurefunc\"&gt;hooksecurefunc&lt;/a&gt; function can be used to apply a post-hook. Unlike the variant above, the values returned by the original function are not supplied.\nLet's apply the same hook to PickupCompanion securely:\n local lastCompanionType, lastCompanionIndex;\n local function postHook(typeID, index)\n lastCompanionType, lastCompanionIndex = typeID, index;\n end\n hooksecurefunc(\"PickupCompanion\", postHook);\nHooking widget handlers.\nYou can also hook widget handles (OnClick/OnShow/On... scripts attached to widgets). There are two general mechanics that you could use:\nHooking object methods.\nFunctions called using the object calling syntax, codice_1, can also be hooked; one simply has to remember that the construct is merely syntactic sugar for codice_2. To hook a function that was originally declared as:\n function AnAddon.Module:FuncName(arg1)\n -- Things happen here...\n end\nWe store the original function and replace it with a hook:\n local original_AnAddon_Module_FuncName = AnAddon.Module.FuncName;\n function AnAddon.Module:FuncName(...)\n local arg1 = ...; -- Use the vararg expression in case the function signature changes\n if type(arg1) == \"number\" and arg1 &gt; 0 then\n -- Call the original function; because of object calling syntax, \n -- pass self as the first argument.\n return original_AnAddon_Module_FuncName(self, ...);\n end\n end\nThe example hook above will only allow the original function to be called if the first argument is a strictly positive number.\nRemoving existing hooks.\nRemoving hooks is generally problematic: there's no way to remove a hooksecurefunc-based post-hook, and insecure hooks may only be removed in some situations. The difficulty arises from the fact that multiple addons may want to hook the same function\u2014and if any addon but the top-most in the hooking chain wants to unhook, there's no way to tell the hook on top of your function to call the function below. It is therefore recommended to simply make your existing hook pass arguments and return values directly through if you don't want to deal with the data. For example:\n local oldFunction, noLongerRelevant = someGlobalFunc, false;\n function someGlobalFunc(...)\n if noLongerRelevant then\n return oldFunction(...);\n else\n -- Original hook handling code goes here\n end\n end\nLibraries may contain functions that allow you to \"unhook\" your method\u2014those operate primarily by moving the ignore switch further up the execution tree: if you remove your hook, it won't get called, but the library's hook function stays in place."}

{"id": "12643", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12643", "title": "Horde", "text": "The Horde (also called the &lt;a href=\"New%20Horde\"&gt;New Horde&lt;/a&gt; or Thrall's Horde) is one of the two major political &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s of the mortal races in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, its counterpart being the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; which the Horde has traditionally been at war with. Driven by unity, the Horde consists of a coalition of disparate races and cultures loosely joined in an alliance of convenience against a hostile world that would see them destroyed. A faction led by off-worlders and composed of outsiders, the Horde has survived the obstacles of Azeroth by bonding together, fighting as family, comrades, or even uneasy allies. Focused, ferocious, and sometimes monstrous, the Horde values strength and honor and is relentlessly opposed to any who threaten the ideals of freedom and hope, but struggles to keep aggression in check.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, the faction was plunged into a state of civil war, divided between Hellscream's pan-orc government he referred to as the \"&lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of the remaining Horde races, as well as &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s that have decided to oppose Garrosh, under leadership of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; upon the defeat of Garrosh, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; was chosen as the new &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde with every leader supporting the choice, even &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; himself. This also marks the first time, when the Warchief's position was held by a person that isn't an orc, signifying a sense of unity between all the member races of the faction, in Vol'jin's own words - \"The Horde is a family\". Following the disastrous &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was named the new Warchief by a dying Vol'jin, who with his last breath said she must step out of the shadows to lead.\nThe Horde has throughout the \"Warcraft\" story remained the only force that can match up to the Alliance. These two factions have warred several times with their predecessors (&lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;) having clashed together in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;s. In the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the last major conflict as of \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\", the controversial acts by the Horde &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; eventually caused a Horde rebellion led by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. This led to a temporary unity between the two factions when Varok asked &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, High King of the Alliance, for aid in assaulting &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to end both the reign of Sylvanas and the enmity between the Horde and Alliance. Ultimately, the rebellion caused the Horde to lose its top leadership when Sylvanas &lt;a href=\"Reckoning\"&gt;killed Varok and abandoned the Horde&lt;/a&gt;. With his death and her abandonment, the Fourth War is considered over and the two factions have begun talks of peace, though many surmise it may not last or cannot forgive the atrocities of the past. Currently the Horde and Alliance are in an \"uneasy armistice\".\nThe Horde is one of the two factions that player characters belong to\u2015the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; being the other\u2015as determined by a given character's &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; which can be both). Besides race, being a member of the Horde or Alliance affects gameplay through what &lt;a href=\"settlement\"&gt;settlement&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation factions&lt;/a&gt; and in some cases &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"encounter\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt;s the player may access. Faction mechanics also prevent Horde and Alliance players from &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;talking&lt;/a&gt; with each other or making &lt;a href=\"group\"&gt;group&lt;/a&gt;s together, and most &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; gameplay involves Horde players fighting against Alliance players. The divide between the Horde and Alliance\u2014in regard to gameplay mechanics, story elements, and sometimes in social aspects like &lt;a href=\"faction%20pride\"&gt;faction pride&lt;/a&gt;\u2014acts as the core element of the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" experience.\nHistory.\nIn the past, the Horde referred to the orcs and their battle thralls from both &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and Azeroth, such as trolls and ogres. Following its utter defeat at the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde's dark power was broken, allowing Thrall to awaken the dormant spirituality of his people and free them from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s control.\nDuring the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall has made lasting bonds with the tauren chief &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and the troll shadow hunter &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; of the Darkspear tribe. The ties between the three races are very close, as both share many similar cultural views. With the help of the tauren, both the orcs and the tribe of trolls have established a place for themselves in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, certain ogre tribes, as well as the Forsaken and blood elves have chosen to affiliate themselves with the Horde.\nThe present Horde is mostly about surviving in a land that has come to hate them. The orcs are hated because, much like the Forsaken, they were manipulated by corrupt forces that channeled their aggression on unsuspecting foes, thus leaving behind a legacy of brutality and domination. In fact, many races of the Horde have a history of being unscrupulous. Though redeemed and trying to make amends or simply trying to survive, they are not forgiven nor trusted by many members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; who believe them to be their old selves still. The &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and their other allies are the ones who understood them, and so they are hated for that.\nIn the Third War, before the liberation of the Forsaken from the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the defection of the blood elves, the Horde allied themselves with the Alliance to rid Azeroth of the Burning Legion. Since then old animosity has risen again, resulting in open conflict on several &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battlefields&lt;/a&gt;, keeping relations between the Horde and Alliance in a state of Cold War. However, the two factions still officially kept a truce despite the rising conflicts until the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;Battle for the Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, when King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; officially &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;declared war&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, with Thrall's departure from the Horde leadership, there were signs of internal strife among the Horde leaders. While &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; was named acting &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde, several leaders entered in conflict with him. &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; challenged Garrosh to an honorable duel, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; made a veiled death threat against him, while &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; came into conflict with him on both an ethical and a tactical level - the use of &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to raise new soldiers, and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; as a weapon.\nBy the time the &lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;mists concealing Pandaria dissipated&lt;/a&gt;, cracks within the Horde started to emerge. The war had intensified with the surprise mana-bombing of &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt; on Garrosh's orders, the actions of which Baine Bloodhoof and Vol'jin openly disapproved of. In response, Garrosh ordered the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; to suppress any potential dissent, going as far as subjugating the Darkspear trolls on their own territory. Horde leaders were weary of Garrosh's attempts to harness the &lt;a href=\"sha\"&gt;sha&lt;/a&gt; for his own ends, and the blood elves became increasingly discontented with Garrosh treating them as expendable in his attempts to do so. The exposure of Sunreaver agents taking orders from Garrosh eventually led to the Sunreavers' expulsion from Dalaran, stoking further recriminations from the blood elf leadership towards Garrosh.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;'s death the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; began in earnest and Horde leader after Horde leader joined it. When at last even Gallywix and the Bilgewater Cartel joined the Rebellion due to Garrosh refusing to pay them for excavating the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, Garrosh re-organized his orc forces into the &lt;a href=\"True%20Horde\"&gt;True Horde&lt;/a&gt; and, with the power of Y'Shaarj, began a genocidal campaign to conquer Azeroth, subjugate all non-orcish life, and brutally crush all who oppose him. Garrosh and the True Horde were defeated in the ensuing conflict by the Horde rebels and Alliance forces; and ultimately &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; was declared Warchief of the Horde.\nUnder Vol'jin's command, the Horde would engage against the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and later the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; on . During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; the Horde and Alliance worked together to prevent the Legion from securing the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; as a staging ground for their invasion. Both armies would be pushed back, &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; slain, and Vol'jin mortally wounded. In Vol'jin's dying moments he named &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; the new Warchief of the Horde and faced with combating the armies of the Burning Legion and the hostility of the Alliance the Horde moved forward to combat the armies of the Burning Legion.\nThe forces of Azeroth ultimately succeed in defeating the Burning Legion during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and the Horde soon after gained the allegiance of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren tribes&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the joined the Horde due to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Speaker of the Horde&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Battle of Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt; joined the Horde, as its equals.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde split between Sylvanas loyalists and Varok Saurfang's revolutionaries. Before the two armies could clash at Orgrimmar, Varok Saurfang, recognizing Sylvanas's loyalists as his brothers and sisters in the Horde and unwilling to spill more Horde blood, challenged Sylvanas to &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;. During the duel, Saurfang was able to get Sylvanas to admit that she considered the Horde nothing, which caused the Warchief to swiftly kill him and abandoned the Horde altogether. In the aftermath of Saurfang's death and Sylvanas's betrayal, the Horde rallied together once more, with her former loyalists defecting to his revolution. Following these events, the Horde and the Alliance have entered into an armistice with one another.\nSometime later, the &lt;a href=\"Voldunai\"&gt;Voldunai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; joined the Horde.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;'s death and the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the leaders of the Horde received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised Varok Saurfang he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the idea of the Warchief being necessary, instead bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. Thus the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt;, a conglomerate of leaders who would represent their people's interests, was created to lead the Horde.\nSometime after the formation of the Horde Council, the armies of the Horde rallied together and defeated the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;Widow's Bite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;Banshee loyalists&lt;/a&gt; that were causing unrest within &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. After Sylvanas defeated &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; and shattered the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde united with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; forces that were attacking &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;,the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Soon after the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;, the leaderships of both the Horde and Alliance grouped with Bolvar and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and decided to send their &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; to enter the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; in order rescue the recently captured &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, the Horde joined the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, during which they successfully rescued Thrall, Baine, and Jaina. Furthermore, each champion personally joined one of the four main &lt;a href=\"Covenant\"&gt;Covenant&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; and aided them in their conflicts. The Horde, Alliance, and the Covenant forces were ultimately victorious, with &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt; being killed within the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Zovaal's defeat, the truce between the Alliance and Horde continued to hold. When the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were re-revealed to Azeroth, both factions sent a &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;joint expedition&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. During this time, the Horde gained the allegiance of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"Dracthyr\"&gt;Dracthyr&lt;/a&gt;, following their awakening on the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; and joined the Aspects in their &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrganization.\nOrgrimmar is the capital of the Horde, and the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde once stood as the undisputed leader. During the time of the warchief, they held dominion over the entire Horde, maintained the faction and was able to declare war for the entire Horde, taking any precaution to ensure the stability and security of the Horde's member states, and had the final say in the induction of new Horde members. The Warchief often made use of &lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Command%20Board\"&gt;Command Boards&lt;/a&gt; to order able-bodied citizens to join war efforts of the Horde in different areas of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nAll members of the Horde have to swear a &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Oath%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;blood oath&lt;/a&gt; to join the faction and previously were obligated to follow the warchief's commands and support the warchief in war if the warchief calls upon them for aid. When it was active, the position of warchief could be attained by having the previous warchief chose a successor or challenging the current warchief to a &lt;a href=\"Mak%27gora\"&gt;Mak'gora&lt;/a&gt;: a prearranged duel with deadly weapons between two people following a formal procedure in the presence of witnesses and traditionally fought until one party yields or is killed, usually to settle a quarrel involving a point of honor. Above all else, the title warchief was granted to those who display strength and decisive action. The final warchief was &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who was challenged for the position by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; and abandoned the Horde after defeating him.\nEach race within the Horde pledges a leader to represent them on the Horde's council, which has come to replace the warchief position. These representatives are typically the leaders of their people, though &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; was appointed as representative for the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; as they assessed their leadership crisis. The council members have the abilities of the previous warchief position, able to induct races into the Horde, deny them, as well as address leadership gaps for other factions within the Horde; such as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; appointing &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; to take over the position of Trade Prince of the Bilgewater Cartel.\nEqual in size, the Horde also has its complexities, much like the Alliance. The core seven races of the Horde are the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;. This roster expanded in the periods leading up to, and during, the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, which saw the &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s of alternate , the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; join their ranks.\nThe Horde also has countless allies and smaller factions among the races of Azeroth that have joined them: the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and various individuals like the &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"beastmaster\"&gt;beastmaster&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt; to name a few.\nCulture.\nBefore the tauren and trolls joined the Horde, the Horde was also called the Orcish Horde.\nAlthough the Horde is a coalition of diverse races with different cultures, agendas, and values, one thing remains constant within the Horde: respect is earned by the blade.\nThe Horde makes no compromises when it comes to excellence, and the power and ferocity of their warriors is legendary. Misunderstood by many as evil, the Horde possesses a strong code of honor and strict laws for disobedience.\nDespite their somewhat monstrous appearance, the majority of the Horde is not evil; much like the Alliance, it is comprised of diverse factions and individuals who possess a wide range of values and virtues. Even so, there is one expectation that must be met when joining the Horde: regardless of gender or station, all are expected to pull their own weight and give their talents for the betterment of the Horde. When weakness is a liability to the future of the Horde, it is the duty of the strong to usurp control from the incompetent and redeem the Horde. \"Lok'tar ogar! Victory or death\" - it is these words that bind one to the Horde. For they are the most sacred and fundamental of truths to any warrior of the Horde. For the Horde, failure is not an option.\nCulturally, orcs and tauren believe in redemption more than most other races on Azeroth and are willing to give almost anyone a chance, regardless of reputation. The Revantusk seem to have even accepted, (if not at least tolerate) their ancient enemy the blood elves. Largely because of these beliefs, a number of mortal races and many diverse factions can be found in service to the Horde.\nLeadership.\nThe Horde has traditionally been led by a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;; a singular leader that possesses ultimate say over the decisions that impact the Horde as a faction. This warchief is the top general, politician and ultimate supreme leader of the Horde. While other leaders still possess power over their own nations and have even been shown to defy the warchief in the past, the ability to rally and lead the Horde as a whole is a privilege that the warchief alone possesses and is able to distribute under their power. This position was abolished in favor of the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s tenure as warchief. This was done as the Warchief held a dark legacy that needed to end after Sylvanas' abuse of the position.\nAs the exact phrasing used in the position's abolition was 'in a time of peace', it is unknown if the position will be used again if war should return.\n &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Warchief Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Warchief Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Warchief Thrall&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Warchief Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;High Overlord Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Chieftain Thrall&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Queen Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Queen Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Queen Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Representative Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;The Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;High Chieftain Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;High Chieftain Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Chieftain Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Chieftain Rokhan&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;br&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Regent Lord Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; - \n &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Trade Prince Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Master Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;High Chieftain Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; \nDark Talons \n &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Cindrethresh\"&gt;Scalecommander Cindrethresh&lt;/a&gt; \nMembership.\nThe alliances which comprised the Horde in earlier times were never restored following their defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the orcs forged new alliances that reflected their rediscovered &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic heritage, including the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;. Even their pact with the undead &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; was based on compassion and a genuine desire to help the restless undead of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Horde in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, which acts as the bulk of the Horde's forces, serve under the &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership. They include most of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the tauren, the Darkspear trolls, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, and a number of less prominent races within the Horde - such as the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20clan\"&gt;Stonemaul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s. The Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, comprising of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, act with more independence from the Kalimdor Horde but ultimately answers to the warchief out of necessity for the Horde's support. Following the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Allied%20race\"&gt;new allies&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; join to the Horde, the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. These races all see the Horde differently. Some see it as an instrument of vengeance, hellbent to carve out a future for its people. Others see it as a refuge for those who need shelter, a commonwealth of the downtrodden, built for mutual support. While some view it as an alliance of convenience, a confederacy of unlikely partners free to pursue their own agendas. Whatever their motivations, they are united to claim Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms for themselves in order to secure key provisions and supplies needed to support their people, and forcibly remove Alliance incursions from their own lands. This Horde is the result of the actions in \"\".\n&lt;a href=\"Durotar%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Nation of Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\ns - The surviving &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of Azeroth's &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third&lt;/a&gt; Wars, who were released by &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Internment%20camps\"&gt;Internment camps&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and led by him to form their new destiny in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; while attempting to re-embrace their once honorable, shamanistic ways and fight the corruption of &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;demonic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. They founded their capital of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, now lead by High Overlord &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt;. Their culture is split mostly between the orcs' warrior spirit and their shamanistic roots, which has recently wrought on a conflict between the younger and older generations. Dedicated to carving out an existence in a world that has come to largely revile them, the orcs have recently turned their attention to reinvigorated conquests. &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon\"&gt;Stonetalon&lt;/a&gt; were among their first targets, and ultimately Warchief Hellscream intended to unite the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; under a single banner. His campaign resulted in Garrosh's dethroning as Warchief.\nThe orcs in the Horde are from the following clans:\n&lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\ns - The jungle trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Islands\"&gt;Darkspear Islands&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; have a very savage and dark history studying voodoo arts and worshiping the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, however after Thrall had saved their tribe from extinction, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; son of &lt;a href=\"Sen%27jin\"&gt;Sen'jin&lt;/a&gt; pledged his tribe to the Horde and founded a new home on the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Isle\"&gt;Darkspear Isle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Some trolls have now begun to study shamanism and more recently druidism, some of these trolls even mix shamanism with voodoo arts, most of the members of the tribe have or are attempting to give up the ways of cannibalism and the other traits of their race's darker history. After retaking much of their territory from the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; marines and the treacherous &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;, the Darkspear have been invited to join a revitalized troll empire under the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt;'s leadership - though Vol'jin declined this offer.\n&lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Thunder Bluff tauren tribes&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The noble tauren of Kalimdor are a race that had hunted the lands of central Kalimdor for generations; however, when Thrall and his orcs had arrived onto the lands of Kalimdor they had already been driven near extinction by the marauding &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; that rampaged through their lands. Under the leadership of their high chieftain &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and the young warchief Thrall, the tauren managed to drive back most of the centaur, and find a permanent home in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, Cairne has pledged his people to the Horde, offering the orcs spiritual guidance and aid. After Cairne's death, the young &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; has arisen to take his father's place and lead the tauren into a brighter future. With the recent Alliance incursion into the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, the tauren have created a &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gate\"&gt;mighty gate&lt;/a&gt; to protect their homeland of &lt;a href=\"Mulgore\"&gt;Mulgore&lt;/a&gt;. Even if their Horde allies turn down dark paths during this war, the tauren have resolved to be the light that guides them through it.\nThe Tauren of the Horde come from various tribes:\n&lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;The Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The Horde of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; was initially next to non-existent, with only the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; orcs and other smaller forces in operation around the continent. In recent years, however, the Horde's presence has been bolstered by the inclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. While considered members of the Horde, their bonds with the western Horde are perhaps not on the same level as the orcs, trolls, and tauren.\nThe Forsaken were once part of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, forced into mindless servitude under the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. After the Lich King's grip began to weaken, the &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; queen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; broke free from his will, and went on to both free and rally other undead beings to join her own empire of undeath, dubbed the \"Forsaken.\" Under Lady Sylvanas' leadership, the Forsaken used any means necessary to conquer the fallen kingdom and remove both the &lt;a href=\"dreadlords\"&gt;dreadlords&lt;/a&gt; and other foes threatening their dominion. After expelling the Scourge from the capital city and massacring the last remaining holdouts of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, they took over the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;catacombs of the former capital&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, founding a capital of their own called the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the backing of the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall warily accepted the Forsaken into the Horde, though this alliance of convenience has been tested - great betrayal at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; has put the Forsaken on a tight leash, made tighter by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;his successor's&lt;/a&gt; less lenient stance on their modus operandi. Following &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;'s ascension to Warchief and especially once &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; took the reins of power, this increased scrutiny has all but evaporated. The group also consists of other undead creatures, such as &lt;a href=\"abomination\"&gt;abomination&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe Forsaken employ various different types of undead.\n&lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The &lt;a href=\"sin%27dorei\"&gt;sin'dorei&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; preside over the other major kingdom of the Eastern Horde from their capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; essentially culled the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; race during the Third War, with over 90% of their people killed, the remaining 10% vowed to avenge the destruction of their once-great nation and dubbed themselves the \"blood elves\" in honor of their fallen brethren. The blood elves worked tirelessly to reclaim their homeland from lingering &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the ever-vengeful &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani tribe&lt;/a&gt;, with the volatile new powers the &lt;a href=\"magisters\"&gt;magisters&lt;/a&gt; advocated, the kingdom of Quel'Thalas was offered aid from an unlikely source - the Forsaken, whose queen, &lt;a href=\"Lady\"&gt;Lady&lt;/a&gt; Sylvanas Windrunner, a former &lt;a href=\"Ranger-general%20of%20Silvermoon\"&gt;Ranger-general of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; who had lost her life during the Scourge invasion. With their assistance, the blood elves were able to fend off the lingering Scourge in the kingdom and were able to enter the Horde as an equal nation of its own.\nQuel'Thalas suffered another dark hour in recent years when its twisted scion &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; attacked his homeland in a mad bid to usher the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s master into Azeroth. He was put to death for this on &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; has thus become the sole leader of the blood elven people. With the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; restored and the monumental betrayal of their prince behind them, a bright future now lies ahead for the blood elves of Quel'Thalas. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they are one of the final bastions of Horde power left within the Eastern Kingdoms.\n&lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt;.\ns - The cunning &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Cartel\"&gt;Bilgewater Cartel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most (if not the most) powerful goblin cartels that dominates trade in the south seas, have recently joined the Horde. After &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; assaulted Kezan and the goblins were forced to flee, their first escape ships were attacked by an Alliance fleet in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20the%20Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Battle of the Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;. With a common enemy, the goblins assisted the captive former Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; in breaking his bonds and obliterating the Alliance on the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Isles\"&gt;Lost Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Their future was tested when their leader, the angered &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to defeat Thrall and take over &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; for himself, though this ultimately ended in failure. Thrall mercifully allowed him to retain his position as &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince\"&gt;Trade Prince&lt;/a&gt;, and thus the Bilgewater goblins were accepted into the Horde, founding &lt;a href=\"Bilgewater%20Harbor\"&gt;Bilgewater Harbor&lt;/a&gt; in the heavily-reshaped Azshara and the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Slums\"&gt;Goblin Slums&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Huojin%20Pandaren\"&gt;Huojin Pandaren&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Pandaren\"&gt;Pandaren&lt;/a&gt; - These pandaren who hail from the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt; follow the path of the &lt;a href=\"Huojin\"&gt;Huojin&lt;/a&gt;, a philosophy among the pandaren that inaction is the greatest injustice, and that there is no shame in defending one's homes and loved ones regardless of cost. Those pandaren who follow the path of Huojin are allies of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and are represented and led by the intrepid &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, a staunch adherent of this philosophy.\nThe Huojin are quick to act and quicker to fight for what they believe in. Impulsive and practical, they feel that the ends can justify the means. These followers now integrated into the Horde community and have a small base of operations in Orgrimmar's Valley of Honor.\n&lt;a href=\"Suramar%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kingdom of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The &lt;a href=\"shal%27dorei\"&gt;shal'dorei&lt;/a&gt; are a powerful and mystical race of &lt;a href=\"Elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who live in &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. Since the city was first separated from the rest of the world over 10,000 years ago, isolated behind a protective barrier, they have evolved by the &lt;a href=\"Nightwell\"&gt;Nightwell&lt;/a&gt; into an arcane-enhanced version of their former selves, and in the process, grew increasingly dependent upon its arcane magic. To protect this font of power, the leaders of the nightborne struck a bargain with the Burning Legion that plunged their kingdom into civil war. After fighting for freedom from their demonic masters, the nightborne seek allies to help them reclaim their place in the world.\nAfter the death of &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and the end of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the shal'dorei wished to rejoin the world. After a harsh exchange between &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and an offer of mutual friendship from &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;, the shal'dorei leader decided that it would be best to ally with the Horde, who share ideals similar to those of the nightborne.\n&lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain tauren tribes&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The Highmountain tauren are found in the region of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain\"&gt;Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; in their capital of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;.

During the war, Huln received a blessing from &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;, so that his people would forever have the demigod's favor, granting them the &lt;a href=\"Horns%20of%20Eche%27ro\"&gt;Horns of Eche'ro&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"moose\"&gt;moose&lt;/a&gt;-like antlers.

For untold generations, the orc clans of Draenor battled one another in endless war, but when offered them &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;the blood of his demonic masters&lt;/a&gt;, the disparate tribes of Mag'har \u2014 the orcish word for \"uncorrupted\" \u2014 refused the dark bargain and banded together to drive out the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, after their victory, the clans stood united as one tribe under the leadership of .\nAfter their escape from and their sacrifice against the fanatical crusade of the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt;, the clans pledged their loyalty to the Horde, residing in Orgrimmar.\n&lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\n- The Zandalari trolls in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; are a powerful and superstitious tribe descended from the first troll tribes, they settled on the highest peaks of this mountain range populated with &lt;a href=\"Wild%20God\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, where they built crude shrines that eventually became the massive temple city of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;. These trolls are scholarly and value knowledge; they preserve troll history but are also deeply steeped in ritual and superstition. They are also masters of war and strategy, having led the trolls in many battles before, and having for many millennia tamed massive &lt;a href=\"dinosaur\"&gt;dinosaur&lt;/a&gt;s. Currently they possess one of the most formidable fleets in the known world, using it in their work to further the goals of troll society as a whole. But as enemies encroach upon the borders of Zuldazar, unrest within the king's council threatens to topple the empire.\n&lt;a href=\"Voldunai\"&gt;Voldunai vulpera&lt;/a&gt;.\n - The vulpera in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt; are a keen and intelligent race of nomadic scavengers capable of turning what they find into opportunities to thrive. They travel in &lt;a href=\"caravan\"&gt;caravan&lt;/a&gt;s, scavenging for supplies, trading where they can, and spreading information they pick up along the way. Dwelling in &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun\"&gt;Vol'dun&lt;/a&gt;, the vulpera can't afford to waste resources. Over time, they have learned to take anything that looks even remotely useful and be creative using what they have, and they have learned to recognize value wherever it hides in the desert. Eager to join the ranks of the Horde, their caravans have departed from the dunes in search of adventure.\n&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons weyrn&lt;/a&gt;.\n - Where the enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Earth-Warder&lt;/a&gt; tread, the Dark Talons shall harrow their skies, crush their will, and topple their leaders, denying the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;'s enemies solace in walls and borders. For every talon in their ranks, they strike down ten of their foes from behind. This weyrn, currently under the authority of the &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Cindrethresh\"&gt;Scalecommander Cindrethresh&lt;/a&gt;, trained to be the elite force that shall be feared by all enemies of the black dragonflight.\nHorde forces.\nWhile a huge portion of the Horde's military power consists of representatives from the faction's member states, there are also several examples of organizations within the Horde which do not belong to any of the member states and instead of answering to a particular racial leader, they are organized by the leader of the Horde, the Warchief, and their advisors. However, while these organizations are not tied directly to any of the member states, the sub-organizations within them are often sent by one of the member states.\n &lt;a href=\"Thrallmar\"&gt;Thrallmar&lt;/a&gt; - is the name for the Horde expeditionary forces to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, who quickly found many native allies.

After, Rexxar disappeared into the Barren wilderness and made the ogre &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Morokk\"&gt;Mok'Morokk&lt;/a&gt; the leader of the clan. Although Mok'Morokk fell prey to temptations of power after &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;'s departure and so the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Village\"&gt;Stonemaul Village&lt;/a&gt;, actual former capital of the &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;, was raided by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s brood. Mok\u2019Morokk led the clan to &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt;, current capital, where he ruled unquestioned until an unknown challenger drove him out.\n &lt;a href=\"Dunemaul%20clan\"&gt;Dunemaul&lt;/a&gt; - Shortly after the shattering the Dunemaul band joined the Horde due to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Megs%20Dreadshredder\"&gt;Megs Dreadshredder&lt;/a&gt; and the Dunemaul \"Emissary\" who are stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Dunemaul%20Recruitment%20Camp\"&gt;Dunemaul Recruitment Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; - Situated in the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, the Revantusk have also been known to have dire trolls such as &lt;a href=\"Ongo%27longo\"&gt;Ongo'longo&lt;/a&gt; among them. At &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Torntusk\"&gt;Elder Torntusk&lt;/a&gt;'s return, the Revantusk have joined the Horde as full members.\n &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20tribe\"&gt;Shatterspear&lt;/a&gt; - Personally recruited by Garrosh Hellscream to fight against the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly situated in the &lt;a href=\"Shatterspear%20Village\"&gt;Shatterspear Village&lt;/a&gt;. After they helped the Horde during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the tribe was attacked in retaliation by the night elf forces. They are rebuilding the village since the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, in hopes that the tribe can ever answer the Horde's call.\n &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;The Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s are orcs from various clans that escaped corruption and remained in Outland throughout all three wars.\n &lt;a href=\"The%20Taunka\"&gt;The Taunka&lt;/a&gt; - Ancient relatives of the tauren, were thought to be lost until re-discovered by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and his orc forces upon their arrival to Northrend. They are welcomed into the Horde soon after &lt;a href=\"Roanauk%20Icemist\"&gt;their leader&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;a href=\"All%20Hail%20Roanauk%21\"&gt;rescued&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Grookin%20tribe\"&gt;Grookin tribe&lt;/a&gt; - A faction of hozen that has made their home in &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt; and was in constant war against the &lt;a href=\"Jinyu\"&gt;Jinyu&lt;/a&gt;. They find themselves allied with the Horde after the Horde gains their favor by rescuing some of their members, sating their appetite for fish, and killing some of their most fearsome enemies. Armed and equipped by the Horde, this tribe of hozen are recruited to fight the Horde's war against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Unshackled\"&gt;Unshackled&lt;/a&gt; - A faction of former &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Slavery\"&gt;slaves&lt;/a&gt; found in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.

When Horde forces arrive in Nazjatar, they ally with the Unshackled against the naga while the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; befriends the &lt;a href=\"Waveblade%20Ankoan\"&gt;Waveblade Ankoan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Unshackled%20Mercenaries\"&gt;Unshackled Mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; are gilgoblins that are &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign%20followers\"&gt;troops&lt;/a&gt; that participate in various &lt;a href=\"War%20Campaign%20missions\"&gt;War Campaign missions&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough not officially part of the Horde, the following groups have allied themselves with the Horde:\nSubjugated.\nThese factions listed are not full members of the Horde but subjugated servants.\nBases of operations.\nCapital cities\n&lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;\nFormer members and allies.\n &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul\"&gt;Dreadmaul&lt;/a&gt; - After losing &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20Hold\"&gt;Dreadmaul Hold&lt;/a&gt; a portion of the &lt;a href=\"Dreadmaul%20tribe\"&gt;Dreadmaul tribe&lt;/a&gt; have become slaves to the conquering Horde forces while another portion of the clan fight to reclaim their former home. Some still remain and continue to fight the Horde for their home. They have managed to break free by allying themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. \n The &lt;a href=\"Dustbelcher\"&gt;Dustbelcher&lt;/a&gt; band - These ogres were hired to assist the Horde, but betrayed them.\n &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; - Joined the Horde sometime after the Third War, but betrayed &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, bringing on the wrath of the Darkspear tribe.\n &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt; - They allied with the Horde during Year 25 to suppress the other centaur clans and kill &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt;.\n - This group of San'layn entered into an agreement with &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, in which they would have a home within the Horde as long as they proved themselves and respected the hierarchy of authority within the Horde. They were ultimately defeated and their leader killed by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\n &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; - Following the death of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; swore fealty to Sylvanas and raised slain enemies as Forsaken. Ultimately loyal and bound to Sylvanas, the Val'kyr followed their mistress following her betrayal of the Forsaken and the Horde at large.\nIn the RPG.\nHistory of the Horde.\nMany orcs slipped through the portal to Azeroth before Khadgar's forces set up their defensive perimeter; among them was &lt;a href=\"Grom%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grom Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, who brought a large chunk of the &lt;a href=\"Warsong%20Clan\"&gt;Warsong Clan&lt;/a&gt; through the portal. The Warsong Clan became a nuisance for the humans, who had placed most of the remaining orcs in internment camps rather than simply slaughtering them.\nDuring this time, the family of one of Lord &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Aedelas Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s servants raised Thrall for the first few years of his life. These fleeting years were more kind to Thrall than the next score; the young daughter of the servant's family befriended him and treated him as a younger brother. Her name was &lt;a href=\"Taretha\"&gt;Taretha&lt;/a&gt;, and she was the closest thing to family that Thrall ever had. Sadly, Thrall was torn away from the servant family as soon as he was old enough to begin his scholastic training, and even that was brief; he was taught the basics of how to read before his military training would begin. Blackmoore intended to use Thrall as a gladiator at first but later developed a much darker plan to give himself power over the Alliance.\nAs the young Thrall trained, Grom Hellscream fought his guerilla war, and Doomhammer escaped from &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;. Doomhammer did not immediately join the rebel clans; rather, he became a hermit and spent his days in contemplation. Such was the way of many warriors who were not ready to give up the fight, but neither did they have the strength left to rally the fragments of the Horde.\nThrall's arena matches grew more brutal as time went on, and he eventually fled with help from his human \"sister.\" He first sought the internment camps, getting captured and observing them from the inside, but finding it amazingly simple to escape. The orcs had fallen into a pitiful state of apathy; few resisted capture. Thrall investigated, eventually seeking out the legendary Grom Hellscream. After proving himself to Grom, Thrall learned that the orcs were in withdrawal; they had grown dependant on the demonic magics wrought by Gul'dan and his servants. Grom also told Thrall about the young orc's rightful clan, the Frostwolves; and Thrall sought them out, vowing to return and work with the mighty chieftain when he could.\nThrall nearly died of the cold trying to reach the Frostwolves, and they concealed their surprise at being reunited with the heir to their chieftain. The Frostwolves, now led by the shaman &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, tested Thrall before accepting him into the clan. After he proved himself, he trained as a shaman. One day, a &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;cloaked warrior&lt;/a&gt; wandered into the camp, and the Frostwolves offered him hospitality. Thrall thought the warrior was insulting him and his clan, and he challenged the traveler; the other orcs gasped as the wanderer threw off his cloak to reveal black plate and a massive hammer. Thrall, unaware who he faced, defeated the wanderer in a brief duel; the warrior then laughed and revealed himself to be Orgrim Doomhammer, the Horde's warchief. He made the mighty Thrall his second, and together they planned to assault the human camps and show their brothers how to fight again. Thrall reunited with Grom, and the three mighty warriors led the orcs in reclaiming the prisoners of war. Blackmoore hounded Thrall at every turn until finally Thrall turned his growing Horde toward Blackmoore's forces at &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and crushed him. Orgrim Doomhammer fell in the fighting, and Thrall took his place as Warchief of the Horde.\nThe Horde avoided conflict with the Alliance as much as possible for a time, sacking only the prisoner camps, until a mysterious visitor \u2014 the prophet Medivh \u2014 visited Thrall and told him that his people would find a home in the west, on the forgotten continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. He made his offer to many, hoping to bring enough strength to Kalimdor to protect the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; arrived. Thrall was one of few who heeded Medivh's warnings, and he took the majority of the Horde across the sea, meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; trolls and allying with them on the way.\nWhen Thrall reached Kalimdor, the orcs encountered the shamanistic &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. The two races allied, since the tauren were in need of aid against the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt;, and the orcs needed friends and guides in this foreign land. They found that their people were similar, but the tauren had fortunately not lost so many to the study of dark magic. After aiding the tauren against the centaur, Thrall and Grom split up for a short time while Grom's clan went to gather supplies in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20Forest\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;. When the orcs took their axes to the ancient trees, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; responded, seeing it as an attack on nature. Hellscream fought a downhill battle against the elves, but just as the last of his troops were about to be defeated, a familiar figure entered the scene \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth%20the%20Destructor\"&gt;Mannoroth the Destructor&lt;/a&gt;. Mannoroth secretly offered Hellscream a chance to regain his former fury and power \u2014 enough for his people to defeat the elves, and their &lt;a href=\"demigod\"&gt;demigod&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 if Grom was willing to drink from a well tainted with Mannoroth's blood. Grom knew the price of his actions, but he was not willing to lose in battle. He, and his troops, drank from the fel-tainted water and were imbued with demonic strength. They slew Cenarius and many elves in their berserker rage. After the battle, Mannoroth revealed himself to Grom and asserted his dominance.\nAs Grom succumbed to the will of the Burning Legion, Medivh visited Thrall again. Thrall's orcs united with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s human forces at Medivh's request, and together they captured Grom's spirit and freed him from his demonic taint. Thrall and Grom then went alone to seek their vengeance against Mannoroth. The two defeated the pit lord, but Grom suffered a mortal wound after saving Thrall's life. Thrall grieved for his friend, whom he had seen as a brother, but he knew that the orc's sacrifice had not been in vain.\nAs the Burning Legion and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; took more of Kalimdor, the orcs and humans allied with the night elves, and together the three forces stood at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, fighting the fury of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, lord of the Burning Legion. It was there that Archimonde fell, though at the cost of many lives from every race. The Legion retreated in the aftermath, and for a brief time, there was peace.\nThrall founded the city of Orgrimmar, named after Orgrim Doomhammer, in the valleys of Durotar, named after his noble father Durotan. Jaina of the humans and Malfurion of the night elves allowed the Horde to live in peace, and tauren constructed on their own city for the first time \u2014 Thunder Bluff in Mulgore. It was not long before tensions rose again, however.\nAdmiral Daelin Proudmoore, one of the leaders of the Alliance in the Second War, came to find his daughter Jaina. In spite of her protests, he launched assault after assault on the orcs, until Jaina was forced to aid the Horde against her father. Thrall honored her sacrifice by sparing those loyal to her within her city of Theramore, but the battle proved to many that lasting peace between the Alliance and the Horde was impossible. More and more battles sprung up in spite of the efforts of both leaders to keep diplomatic relations strong. &lt;a href=\"Battlegrounds\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt; erupted threatening to plunge both sides closer to all-out war. And so, things grew worse and worse.\nBack in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; and former ranger general of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, broke free of &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;'s control and created her own &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; faction \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. As the situation in Kalimdor grew bloodier, Sylvanas offered an alliance to Thrall, which he grudgingly accepted. The introduction of the undead to the Horde infuriated the Alliance further; while Jaina still did her best to stop the fighting, the humans in Stormwind took action against the Horde again, and the situation deteriorated. More recently, Thrall has been in communication with the &lt;a href=\"Revantusk%20tribe\"&gt;Revantusk&lt;/a&gt; forest trolls, who agreed to a tentative alliance with the Horde. The Revantusk tribe is now loosely allied with the Horde. While not members of the Horde, they are its friends.\nSpeculation.\nThe Horde military ranks of &lt;a href=\"Legionnaire%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Legionnaire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Centurion%20%28rank%29\"&gt;Centurion&lt;/a&gt; may have come from the historical traditions of the &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Empire\"&gt;Gorian Empire&lt;/a&gt;.\nVideos.\n&lt;a href=\"Lore%20For%20Noobs\"&gt;Lore For Noobs&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

While the chieftains still hold sway over their own clans, each individual chieftain answers to Gul'dan. The Horde also has a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;, a position held by until his death; its ownership is currently uncertain.\nLike many orc clans, the Horde has no tolerance for weakness, and the penalty for failure is death. Despite the bloodlust raging in many, the orcs of the Horde still honor many orcish traditions, such as the .\nHistory.\nFormation.\nGul'dan traveled to the various clans with his slave , promising a way to travel to a new, healthy land, where food and water would be plentiful. The were one of the first to join, having been promised new enemies to battle and a new land to conquer. Enemies were not mentioned to the less battle-hungry , who nonetheless turned Gul'dan down twice before accepting his invitation; they were the last clan to join the Horde. Even the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Walker\"&gt;Red Walker&lt;/a&gt;s were invited, but refused, and would later be destroyed during the war between the Red Walkers and Frostwolves. Gul'dan did not take rejection kindly, having poisoned who turned his offer down.\nThough the clans initially quarreled, in time the fighting stopped, as each took to sharing what they knew, and unity between the orc clans began to form. of the was chosen early on to lead the Horde as Warchief.\nGuided by Gul'dan's magics, the Horde gathered at the location of an ancient artifact buried deep beneath the sand. They eventually excavated the massive structure, a \" that would allow them to enter their new world.\nBy the time of the opening of the Great Gate, the Horde had been in existence for a number of years, and had seen many power struggles, eventually establishing order and rankings throughout the Horde.\nInto Azeroth.\nGul'dan opened the Great Gate for the purpose of sending the Horde to invade Azeroth. An initial warband traveled through the temporary gateway to the , from where Horde hunting parties began razing human settlements in the surrounding regions and taking prisoners, needed to fuel the ritual to open the Great Gate permanently. This aggression roused the wrath of the human of the Eastern Kingdoms, leading to a larger conflict with the army of Stormwind at the foot of the Great Gate.\nDespite heavy losses to the unknown dwarven &lt;a href=\"boomstick\"&gt;boomstick&lt;/a&gt;s, the Horde was ultimately victorious in defeating Stormwind's forces. At the climax of the battle was slain by the half-breed slave , resulting in her being welcomed into the Horde as an orc.\nHowever, despite their victory in battle, Gul'dan's was unable to complete his plans to open a permanent gateway, leaving the remaining Horde behind on Draenor for the time being.\nPrior to the battle at the Great Gate, Gul'dan had learned of 's betrayal of the Horde, and consequently exterminated the clan, although a few members escaped. The next day, Gul'dan was challenged in by Durotan. The warlock successfully defeated the chieftain, but did so by using his fel magic, sparking dissent and accusations of cheating from some of the gathered orcs, including . However, after effortlessly destroying several of those who spoke against him, the others quickly fell into line. Following the victory of the Horde in the following battle, Gul'dan's hold over the Horde appears to be intact for now."}

The council members each hold a position of power over the Horde; acting in the place of the retired position of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Each is considered a representative of their people, if not the &lt;a href=\"racial%20leader\"&gt;racial leader&lt;/a&gt; in some cases.\nHistory.\nCreation.\nIn the aftermath of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and the defeat of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, various leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; gathered together at the &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar%20Embassy\"&gt;Orgrimmar Embassy&lt;/a&gt; where they received the terms for an armistice from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, putting the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on hold indefinitely, if not permanently. With that matter settled, Lor'themar Theron addressed the absence of a &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt;. Despite support for Thrall to take the mantle on again, he refused, citing that he had promised &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; he would not take on the role once more. Instead, he brought up the notion of the Warchief being unnecessary, bringing in the belief that a change was needed for the Horde's leadership. With this, instead of a singular dictator, the Horde would be led by a conglomerate of leaders who would represent their people's interests.\nAt the time of its creation, the council was composed of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rokhan\"&gt;Rokhan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monte%20Gazlowe\"&gt;Monte Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ji%20Firepaw\"&gt;Ji Firepaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Geya%27rah\"&gt;Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;. At some point afterwards, &lt;a href=\"Mayla%20Highmountain\"&gt;Chieftain Mayla Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Voldunai\"&gt;Voldunai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vulpera\"&gt;vulpera&lt;/a&gt; caravan leader &lt;a href=\"Kiro\"&gt;Kiro&lt;/a&gt; joined the council.\nShadows Rising.\nSometime after the death of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde Council convened with &lt;a href=\"Talanji\"&gt;Queen Talanji&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; and a key ally. The Horde leaders sought to have Talanji take a place on the council with them, however, this meeting was derailed by a failed assassination attempt on the Queen's life. Forced into action by this, the Horde Council empowered the young &lt;a href=\"Jungle%20troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;, still grieving the loss of Varok, with a critical mission to aid Talanji and help uncover the rising threat against her.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; shaman &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; warned Thrall that something was terribly wrong in the spirit world, Thrall informed the council. Despite their misgivings and fears of an ambush, the council voted in favor of Thrall's decision to go to &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, in order to find a way to help the spirit world. Thrall later informed the council of how his meeting with the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; leadership went down.\nUpon learning that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was aware of the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, their belief that Talanji was working with Sylvanas, and that they had requested to speak with the council, another meeting was held. The council unanimously voted in favor of Thrall and Ji Firepaw meeting with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that the meeting would aid in the hunt and capture of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Widow%27s%20Bite\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; against her was ultimately removed by the combined Horde and Zandalari forces, Talanji joined the council.\nExploring Azeroth.\nThe Horde Council was made aware of &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt;'s mission across the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and allowed them to travel across Horde territories. At some point following the end of the Fourth War, the council sent &lt;a href=\"Belgrom%20Rockmaul\"&gt;Belgrom Rockmaul&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; to answer the calls for help from &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Ataya\"&gt;Camp Ataya&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt;, which were being raided by the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Woodpaw\"&gt;Woodpaw&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s. The council also ordered for &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; to look over the Horde holdings within &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, in order to assess the needs and statuses of the people, how the wounds from the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; were healing, and where there were still aches within the Horde. Thus they later received word from Zekhan about what he learned: that war took from all and how he found hope in seeing their Horde brothers and sisters rebuilding their outposts and homes, the hope in the songs and stories booming from their hearths, and ultimately hope in the Horde's future in every corner of Kalimdor. \nShadowlands.\nThe council, along with &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nazgrim\"&gt;Nazgrim&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt;, convened atop of &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt; where they informed Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;return of the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the abduction of Thrall and Baine. They also learned from &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; had also been abducted, and that an attempt was made on &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who neutralized her attackers. These champions were subsequently sent to unite with the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in order to combat the returning enemy. Following the death of &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt;, they returned to &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; to inform the council about the events that occurred in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;dark powers&lt;/a&gt; that Sylvanas had allied with.\nThe council, alongside leaders of the Alliance and Calia, convened with &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Though desiring to rescue their comrades the council knew that they couldn't risk the stability of the Horde and send their fellow leaders on what might well be a suicide mission. To that end, Lor'themar encouraged the Alliance to do the same by pointing out that even their captured friends would offer the same counsel. However, this earned the hostility of Tyrande, which caused the council to prepare themselves for battle before Bolvar convinced the Horde and Alliance leaders to stand down.\nThe council, and the others, then witnessed the ritual to open the doorway to the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt;. Once the ritual was complete the council witnessed &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and even Tyrande Whisperwind enter to rescue their comrades and seek out Sylvanas. The council subsequently departed from Icecrown.\nCalia, who had gone to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, later sent word of &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s and &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;'s recovery to Lor'themar Theron, who presumably informed his fellow council members.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, members of the Horde Council reunited with Thrall and Baine within &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, and then attended the judgment of Sylvanas Windrunner. After the Banshee Queen submitted to the judgment of Tyrande Whisperwind, the night elf matriarch ordered that her penance was to scour the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; for every soul lost in its depths, betrayed or condemned and to send them forth to the &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;. While Voss and Thalyssra departed soon after, Lor'themar joined Thrall and Baine in witnessing Sylvanas entering the Maw to begin said penance.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; reclaimed the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, they established a new &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; to govern them. As the members of the Desolate Council have equal authority, it is likely that they each can speak for the Forsaken on the Horde Council.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nVarious members of the Horde Council were among those who attended the wedding between fellow council members &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thalyssra\"&gt;Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nSoon after the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; were revealed to Azeroth, the Horde Council was approached by &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; who introduced them to the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Cindrethresh\"&gt;Scalecommander Cindrethresh&lt;/a&gt; and an invitation to explore the islands from the dragon aspects. The council subsequently accepted the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Talons\"&gt;Dark Talons&lt;/a&gt; into the Horde and then turned to the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; and instructed them to work with the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;joint expedition&lt;/a&gt; to investigate. After the council, Cindrethresh and Ebyssian discussed the mission logistics, members of the council then ventured to the &lt;a href=\"zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; near the port, where they were seemingly prepared to witness the expedition depart."}

Acquiring these will require at least five, but usually six, or even seven stacks of .\nObjective of.\nThere is a by each faction leader in the six participating cities. The Horde Gift Collection can be given to Kwee Q. Peddlefeet for a and your choice of 5 , 5 , or 5 .\nVotes.\nCompleting this quest will add a point to the total gift collections for the capital city leader standing next to Kwee Q. Peddlefeet. This counts as one vote for the popularity of that leader. At the end of the the Love is in the Air seasonal event, the capital city leader with the most gift collections will have Kwee Q. Peddlefeet stay by them to buff players for another week.\nYou can ask Kwee Q. Peddlefeet about the gift voting standings. He gives the number of turn-ins for each participating city leader and the totals for each faction. \nDisproportionate voting stacked toward one particular leader will give either faction that does so a better chance of winning. \nNotes.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item. It cannot be sold at the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed nor put in a &lt;a href=\"guild%20bank\"&gt;guild bank&lt;/a&gt; tab, but it can be given, sold, or traded with other &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s using the &lt;a href=\"trade\"&gt;trade&lt;/a&gt; window. Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nThis item is primarily useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year. \nThe item can be created from the ingredient items after the event is over. By combining each hierarchical layer of gifts and pledges near its expiration, it should be possible to extend the overall duration to around 28 days for the faction gift collections; so anywhere within that timeframe, a faction gift could be created. Unlike the city gift collections, which may proc a buff after the event (TBD), there is little point to building the faction gift collection unless you have a turn-in point. It is unknown whether Kwee Q. Peddlefeet will accept the quest turn in after the event, but it seems unlikely as the quest turn-in mechanic is thorough in its checking this sort of detail. Additionally, the voting portion of the mechanic would be meaningless, an inconsistency which is most easily resolved by removing the whole quest after the event. In any case, Kwee Q. Peddlefeet is only available after the event in the one city that wins the vote, and only for an additional week. \nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article. "}

{"id": "175136", "revid": "53469493", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=175136", "title": "Enrage (mechanic)", "text": "Enrage is a collective term for &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; and other monster abilities which dramatically increase damage output. Many bosses have a \"hard\" berserk timer to limit the possible length of the encounter, while others may have a \"soft\" berserk that gradually increases tank and healer stress over the course of a fight. Certain &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s also have unrelated &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20effect\"&gt;Enrage effect&lt;/a&gt;s that &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s can dispel.\nAlthough Enrages are ubiquitous now, they were once the exception rather than the rule. Bosses with various Enrage abilities became more and more frequent during the course of Classic WoW as encounter complexity increased.\nThe various types of Enrage mechanics can be classified as follows:\nBerserk (hard).\nA hard berserk is designed to &lt;a href=\"wipe\"&gt;wipe&lt;/a&gt; a group if the boss is not defeated in a certain length of time. Without such a mechanic, killing a boss would just be a question of having enough healers who don't run out of &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt;. It adds some urgency to the encounter, makes DPS a more critical role, and prevents undergeared raids from killing the boss. Not all bosses have what is often called a \"'zerk timer\"; bosses without one usually use a soft mechanic instead.\nThe absolute time limit that a hard berserk represents varies by encounter, although most bosses are in the 5-10 minute range. When the enrage occurs, the boss' damage output will increase greatly and the boss will begin annihilating players one by one, starting with tanks and proceeding to the best DPS without an aggro dump. Most bosses in berserk mode also gain movement speed increases and taunt immunity (if not already taunt immune), to prevent players from &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiting&lt;/a&gt; the boss while continuing to DPS. The fight is no longer winnable at that point unless the boss is already very close to death, and even then it becomes a desperate race. Any sort of area-effect attack combined with Berserk spells immediate defeat for the players.\nBoss goes into a berserker rage! is a common raid warning issued when this time limit is reached.\nExamples:\nBerserk (soft).\nA soft berserk is the informal name for a variety of mechanics that gradually increase the difficulty of an encounter and eventually wipe groups who cannot defeat the boss. Soft berserks take many forms. Some are over the entire fight, while others are invoked at a fixed point in an encounter (for example, at a certain boss health percentage, or after a certain amount of time), and some become apparent only when the group makes mistakes or doesn't control elements of the fight (for example, letting &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s or stacking &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;s get out of control). \nFrenzy (hard).\nHard frenzies generally take the form of large damage buffs, are usually triggered when a boss reaches a certain (low) percentage of health, and last until the boss is defeated. This part of the fight puts immediate stress on tanks and healers, and is almost always the ideal time to use Bloodlust or similar effects.\nFrenzy (soft).\nSoft frenzies are a damage buff that can be dispelled with a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Shiv\"&gt;Shiv&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Hunter\"&gt;Hunter&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;Tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Soothe\"&gt;Soothe&lt;/a&gt;. These are similar to other boss enrages, but are short duration and can usually be healed through.\nExamples:\nBosses without Enrages.\nAlthough many raid boss encounters feature some sort of time limit, some do not.\nExamples:"}

Now the humans are attacking your base in retaliation, leaving no choice but to fight your bitter enemies once more. Destroy the human settlements to halt their attacks against your forces.\"\nThe battle.\nAfter days of marching across the barrens, Thrall's troops are growing restless. Thrall, however, assures them that all will be well when they reach the &lt;a href=\"Oracle\"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt;.\nSuddenly, they stumble upon Grom Hellscream and his Warsong Clan battling a group of humans. Thrall and his warriors rush to Hellscream's aid and the orcs defeat the humans. After the battle, Grom tells Thrall that the humans, led by a &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;\"frail girl\"&lt;/a&gt;, have blockaded the passage to &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak\"&gt;Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall decides that they should look for a means to bypass the humans. He orders Grom to leave the humans alone for the time being.\nGrom returns to his camp while Thrall constructs his own base. A short time later, a troll scout reports that there is a nearby Goblin Laboratory selling Zeppelins. If they can acquire the Zeppelins, the orcs will be able to fly past the human forces. However, as Thrall makes preparations to secure the Zeppelins, Grom gives into his bloodlust and starts attacking the humans. The humans launch a counterattack against the orcs forcing Thrall to fight back.\nAfter fending off repeated human attacks, Thrall leads his forces toward the Goblin Laboratory. They are forced to destroy at least one human base blocking the way. The Goblin Laboratory itself is surrounded by hostile &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Harpy\"&gt;harpies&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall defeats these creatures and hires the Zeppelins he needs. He then flies them back to his base.\nDespite having achieved his goal, Thrall is greatly upset. Many lives have been lost in a battle that could have been avoided. Thrall confronts Grom and angrily rebukes him for disobeying orders. Grom is defiant at first, but then backs down and apologizes for his disobedience. Thrall, however, is not convinced that Grom can control his bloodlust. He orders Grom to take his clan to the northern forests and construct a settlement while the rest of the Horde seeks out the Oracle."}

Their lower bodies are supported by six spindly arachnid limbs and their heavily bandaged torsos are human in form. The cunning Crypt Fiends were once the lords of the ancient spider kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; that spanned the entirety of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in ancient times. However, the Crypt Fiends' power base was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, when he and his &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; took control of the frozen continent. Now the Crypt Fiends command their spider underlings in the name of their master, Ner'zhul. These aberrant creatures are capable of summoning swarms of vile insects and projecting web-like strands to incapacitate and harm their enemies.\nInformation.\nCrypt Fiends are great additions for any Undead army, as their fairly high damage attacks compensates for their slow speeds. Unlike &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Headhunter%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Troll Headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rifleman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Riflemen&lt;/a&gt;, Crypt Fiends cannot attack air units, which is a small setback when facing aerial creeps or early aerial units mid-game. In order to attack air units, Web must be researched at a &lt;a href=\"Crypt%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Crypt&lt;/a&gt;, which allows them to bring down air units for ground only attacking units to strike, including themselves. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Raider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Raider&lt;/a&gt;'s ensnare, Web can be auto-casted, but only targets aerial units. They're good at taking down aerial units which stray too far from the rest of their army.\nDue to their fairly high health, damage and range, it is not uncommon to most Undead players start with them for their initial army.\nSpells and abilities.\neb (Autocast).\nIf you're building Crypt Fiends be sure to research Web. It's a cheap upgrade and it's good to have it available on the fly rather than having to wait for it if you get in trouble against air units.\nWebbed air units cannot move and count as ground units. This means that units with ground attacks can now attack them, and also that units with no ground attacks cannot. Webbed units only count as ground units for attack targeting purposes. You cannot, for example, Possess or Impale a webbed air unit. Units with a good air attack but a poor ground attack, such as Gargoyles, do not mix well with Web.\nurrow.\nNotes: Burrowed Fiends have a new regeneration type and gain no benefit from Blight anymore. Burrowed units are not affected by auras.\nThey turn into invisible units - however, they can still be damaged via spells and AoE attacks."}

Though the &lt;a href=\"Nerubian\"&gt;Nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s fell before the wrath of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; during the fabled &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Spider\"&gt;War of the Spider&lt;/a&gt;, the insidious Crypt Lords were swayed over to the Lich King's ranks and granted considerable power and the immortality of &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt;. Now the giant, thundering beasts serve as the Lich King's mightiest warriors and the guardians of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s holdings in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nHero names.\nThebis-Ra, Typhis-Ahn, Anubiros, Memphis-Ahn, Horus'aman, Nephri'thos, Arak-arahm, Tuten'arak, Pharoh-moth.\nInformation.\nCrypt Lords are immensely durable Undead heroes, much more compared to the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;. They possess high Strength and a respective amount of growth for it but are lacking in Agility and Intelligence. \nImpale is a powerful ability for Crypt Lords, essentially being a multi-hitting version of the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20King%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Mountain King&lt;/a&gt;'s Storm Bolt in return for less damage and only being able to strike ground units.\nSpiked Carapace allows the Crypt Lord to take more punishment by giving him extra armor.\nThey're essentially notable for wading into the midst of an intense battle and taking heavy amounts of punishment, thanks to their high health and Spiked Carapace providing the Crypt Lord with additional armor to protect him from standard attacks. Crypt Lords will benefit greatly from health and mana boosting items so they can make the most use out of their health and spells.\nDespite this, most players generally prefer the Death Knight and Lich because of their versatility, but the Crypt Lord is very effective when given the proper items and training.\nSpells and abilities.\nImpal.\nNotes: Airborne units can take damage and be attacked. Airborne units are untargeteable by spells.\nImpale is a powerful move - while it doesn't do a lot of damage, it temporarily stuns every ground unit it hits on its path. Try to position the Crypt Lord in a position where he can impale the most units to make the most of this spell.\nTry to avoid lining up your units in a way the Crypt Lord can incapacitate all of them at once. You should watch out for your Heroes though as most players tend to Impale them and finish them off while they're stunned.\npiked Carapace (Passive).\nSpiked Carapace essentially combines the Ring of Protection items along with a Thorns Aura effect for himself - a perfect set to compliment his high health.\narrion Beetles (Autocast).\nCarrion Beetles are essentially great for early Creeping as they can take damage to allow the Crypt Lord to take less in return. Don't worry about them dying - they cost no food and are permanent until killed, or if another beetle is summoned when the limit is reached. They are also good for Death Knights and Liches to restore their health and mana respectively.\nLevel 2 and 3 Carrion Beetles can also use Burrow, making them ideal scouts if the enemy doesn't have invisibility detection.\nUse dispel units to destroy any Carrion Beetles. Invisibility detection also works if they try to burrow underground.\nocust Swarm (Ultimate).\nLocust Swarm is kind of similar to Protoss Carriers in StarCraft. Once \"launched\" the Locust Swarm will follow the Crypt Lord where he walks, heading out in an area around the Crypt Lord.\nNotes:\nUse this ability in a hectic fight - with many enemies around, the Crypt Lord is guaranteed to recover more than he can take in damage if he isn't being focused on.\nFocus on the Crypt Lord if he activates the spell - the locusts summoned immediately die off (signified by loud screeching) if he teleports or is killed."}

Their lower bodies are supported by six spindly arachnid limbs and their heavily bandaged torsos are human in form. Crypt fiends can be found most notably in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, but also in the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.

The &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s that had fallen in the war were resurrected as slaves for the Lich King's army. These reanimated insectoids became known as the crypt fiends because they still wear the tattered remains of the linens in which their corpses were mummified. These aberrant creatures are capable of summoning swarms of vile insects and projecting web-like strands to incapacitate and harm their enemies.\nThe crypt fiends appear in many places around Northrend, fighting for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Crypt fiends also appear scattered throughout the &lt;a href=\"Ghostlands\"&gt;Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, defending territory claimed by the Scourge. Weaker crypt fiends called &lt;a href=\"Nerubis%20Guard\"&gt;Nerubis Guards&lt;/a&gt; can be found at the destroyed &lt;a href=\"village\"&gt;village&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Suncrown%20Village\"&gt;Suncrown Village&lt;/a&gt;.

It changes through out the phases of the Scarlet Enclave. It is most active during the Second Phase.\nAfter the death knight starting zone is complete, the Crypt of Remembrance is thereafter known simply as \"Crypt\".\nWrath of the Lich King.\nBelow is the changes of the Crypt of Remembrance, and the nearby pumpkin patch, during the many Phases of the Scarlet Enclave (The death knight starting area.). The Crypt of Remembrance is the Graveyard of the Enclave, should a death knight release spirit instead of taking the Val'kyr's resurrection.\nPhase One.\nDuring Phase one of the the Crypt of Remembrance has not yet been captured by the Scourge. The player can visit it if they choose, there will be no NPCs there, strangely however the Crypt will already be set up as a Scourge base, the bookcases and other objects already in place inside. This is odd because it isn't captured or used until phase 2. As such Phase One occupants will not be listed as it is empty.\nPhase Two.\nDuring the Second Phase of the Scarlet Enclave Death's Breach has become the main base of the Scourge on the ground. The player will be instructed to continue their attack by reporting to the new forward base, the Crypt of Remembrance. The Town of Havenshire having been taken over and destroyed, as the player makes their way to the Crypt they can see the death and destruction caused by them in Phase One. With Havenshire destroyed the player will now move onto the next area for their campaign of destruction, &lt;a href=\"New%20Avalon\"&gt;New Avalon&lt;/a&gt;, the Scarlet's Main base of operations in the area. The pumpkin patch, which is not far from the Crypt, is being set up for an area for a plague cauldron, courtesy of Noth the Plaguebringer. As such him, and his quests, will be included in the Crypt's occupants and quests, due to his close proximity. Eventually the Death Knights will once again be re-assigned to a new area, a secret base inside of the Scarlet's own lands.\nPhase Three.\nAs of Phase Three of the Scarlet Enclave the Crypt holds no important occupants, having moved to Death's Breach. The Plague Cauldron still remains active, should the player have more skulls, and the Plaguehounds still wander around the pumpkin patch. Crypt Guardians still remain, but not even Fineous remains inside.\nAfter the Scarlet Enclave.\nUpon finishing the Final Quests and leaving the instanced Scarlet Enclave, one will find that like Havenshire and New Avalon, the Crypt has been abandoned. The Cauldron remains but is unusable."}

The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; trainers can be found here, as well as a small crystal-digging &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; full of &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt; workers. Note that the shaman are not all draenei; there are also &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; and Broken shaman trainers around, including the most important one, &lt;a href=\"Farseer%20Nobundo\"&gt;Farseer Nobundo&lt;/a&gt;, located at the small elevated platform in the zone. The Crystal Hall also houses numerous trainers: a &lt;a href=\"first%20aid\"&gt;first aid&lt;/a&gt; trainer, a &lt;a href=\"fishing\"&gt;fishing&lt;/a&gt; trainer, an &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; trainer, and a &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; trainer. \nAnother notable &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt; in the area is &lt;a href=\"Seer%20Skaltesh\"&gt;Seer Skaltesh&lt;/a&gt;, close to the &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; enclosure. If the player talks with him, they are given &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Sapta\"&gt;Elemental Sapta&lt;/a&gt; which can be consumed and gives &lt;a href=\"Sapta%20Sight\"&gt;Sapta Sight&lt;/a&gt; to the player for one minute. While under this spell, it is revealed that there are, in fact, numerous &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s present in the Crystal Hall.\nAn interesting fact is that the draenei harvest crystals in the northern portion of the hall, where Broken draenei miners use their mining picks to gather the precious gems. This part reminds one of an excavation site. The crystals are used to repair the Exodar. It is gathered that the Broken draenei, though still draenei in some regard, are treated like a lesser class; a labor and task force. It is kind of odd that a race with such an attachment to the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; treats those who were once their own people with such distaste. It is possible that the arrangement was agreed to by the Broken draenei; their bodies better suited to manual labor than the \"pure\" draenei.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; helped build the \"Exodar\", and &lt;a href=\"E%27ira\"&gt;E'ira&lt;/a&gt; designed this hall as a calm and quiet place. There's also a mural of E'ira, made from brightly colored glass. After the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the area was visited by &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;.

{"id": "86398", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=86398", "title": "Stance dancing", "text": "Stance dancing was the art of changing &lt;a href=\"warrior%20stances\"&gt;warrior stances&lt;/a&gt; briefly to use abilities from different stances. Because not all abilities were available in all stances, there were many situations where even tanking warriors were required to change stances.\n&lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; removed stance restrictions on warrior abilities, making stance dancing obsolete.\nHistorical information.\nTo see a protection warrior to do this is now rarely (if ever) observed since because of a warrior talent review in the past, there are very few abilities that generate much threat require another stance. It may be more common to see an Arms warrior do so, as they may be most likely to stay in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Stance\"&gt;Battle Stance&lt;/a&gt;, but switch to &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Stance\"&gt;Berserker Stance&lt;/a&gt; in order to use &lt;a href=\"Pummel\"&gt;Pummel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs always in the past, typically warrior tanks would stay in &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance\"&gt;Defensive Stance&lt;/a&gt; as much as possible. That stance generates the most threat and affords the most protection. However, in many boss fights, warriors were almost required to change to Berserker Stance at least briefly to activate &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt; (which no longer requires a specific stance) in order to avoid fear or to generate enough rage to stay on top of the threat list.\nStance dancing tanks rely heavily on the &lt;a href=\"Tactical%20Mastery\"&gt;Tactical Mastery&lt;/a&gt; talent.\nTips and Tactics.\nRage generation is a key concern of a Tank spec warrior. &lt;a href=\"Sword%20and%20Board\"&gt;Sword and Board&lt;/a&gt; tanks do not generate significant amounts of &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt;. Ideally a Tank wishes to use &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Block\"&gt;Shield Block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Devastate\"&gt;Devastate&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Shout\"&gt;Demoralizing Shout&lt;/a&gt; as quickly as possible to generate significant threat and debuff enemy melee damage. This requires 46-55 rage depending on talent distribution and is difficult to generate cold using a one hand weapon. Using a stance dance a &lt;a href=\"Warrior%23Protection\"&gt;Tank Spec&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"sword%20and%20board\"&gt;sword and board&lt;/a&gt; Warrior can easily generate the required rage. The typical rage generating stance dance sequence was &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Stance\"&gt;Battle Stance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodrage\"&gt;Bloodrage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Charge\"&gt;Charge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Clap\"&gt;Thunder Clap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Stance\"&gt;Berserker Stance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demoralizing%20Shout\"&gt;Demoralizing Shout&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Rage\"&gt;Berserker Rage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance\"&gt;Defensive Stance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Block\"&gt;Shield Block&lt;/a&gt;,and then &lt;a href=\"Devastate\"&gt;Devastate&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Sunder%20Armor\"&gt;Sunder Armor&lt;/a&gt;. Macros can be employed to complete this sequence in under 5 seconds. For best results, a Stance Set addon would be used to automatically equip a slow two-handed weapon when in &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Stance\"&gt;Battle Stance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Berserker%20Stance\"&gt;Berserker Stance&lt;/a&gt; then automatically equip a &lt;a href=\"sword%20and%20board\"&gt;sword and board&lt;/a&gt; when you switch to &lt;a href=\"Defensive%20Stance\"&gt;Defensive Stance&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "45998", "revid": "58609", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=45998", "title": "StarCraft franchise", "text": "StarCraft is a military science fiction franchise owned by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment&lt;/a&gt;. It is most notable for the real-time strategy games ' and '.\nHistorically, there has been overlap between the \"StarCraft\" and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft\"&gt;Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" playerbases\u2014a player might start with one IP, then shift to the next as the next RTS was released.\nParallels to \"Warcraft III\".\nSeveral gaming elements first introduced in \"StarCraft\" were later adapted for use in ' and '.\nPlot progression.\nPrevious Warcraft games offered two campaigns, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, which essentially dealt with the same events through different eyes. With three races, Blizzard decided to stack the campaigns to deal with different events, told in chronological order in one combined story arc. Essentially, the player was dissuaded from playing the zerg or the protoss out of order, because they didn't learn the plot details of the terrans. This was adapted for \"Warcraft III\" with a minor difference: the player no longer had option to defy the chronology. Additionally, the campaigns for both games proceeded similarly (for the original game, the Human campaign went first, then the Evil campaign second, and finally, the \"Neutral\" party third. For their expansions, the \"Neutral\" party went first, then the Human campaign second, and the Evil force third).\nSpecific influences.\nIn the final mission of the game, the player commanded two armies, one protoss and one terran, in a last-ditch effort to save the galaxy by defeating the insidious Overmind of the zerg, which was hell-bent on assimilating the protoss in order to combine their purity of form with the zerg's purity of essence to become a \"perfect\" species. Similarly, in the final mission of \"Reign of Chaos\", the user commands the &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; army reinforced by the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to stop &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; from ascending &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. The two Antagonist/Anti-Hero characters, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and Sarah Kerrigan, are similar to one another. Kerrigan's transformation from human to zerg, and her subsequent embracing of the darkness, also closely parallels the tale of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnequal units.\n\"Warcraft I\" and \"Warcraft II\" were completely balanced: for each human unit or building, there was a corresponding orc unit or building with similar damage, armor, and requirements. The only differences occurred with spells. In \"StarCraft\", no such perfect equality existed. \nThe four races have different advantages, most of them similar to the racial attributes of the terrans, zerg, and protoss from \"StarCraft\". The different strategically significant traits of the races in \"StarCraft\" have been combined in new ways to form the \"Warcraft III\" races. The \"Warcraft III\" night elves, for instance, resemble the terrans in that their buildings can move and their base fighting unit has a missile attack, but like the zerg, their worker units are consumed when they create most buildings. The &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; have the protoss's ability to summon buildings rather than constructing them, so a worker unit is not tied up in construction; also like the protoss, they have a dedicated invisible spy unit, but their buildings have to be constructed upon dedicated infested terrain called &lt;a href=\"Blight%20%28plague%29\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt; (like zerg creep), and their army line-up is strategically similar to that of the zerg. \nExample.\nThe basic terran combat unit, the marine, is a fairly durable ranged unit, capable of attacking both ground and space units. By contrast, the first fighter unit available to the zerg was the tiny, brittle &lt;a href=\"zergling\"&gt;zergling&lt;/a&gt; who could only attack ground units and whose usefulness came mostly from its low cost, speed, and that two spawned from one larva. Finally, the protoss zealot, though only attacking ground units, is extremely durable, in addition to shields. Similarly, the central zerg building, the hatchery, evolves into a lair and later into a hive, while the terran command center and protoss nexus do not evolve. \nIn \"Warcraft III\", the races are balanced from the perspective that they all have infantry, ranged, cavalry and spellcasters, with similar-type production facilities, but feature different specific abilities and traits.\nReferences.\nWar3 Asset Mod.\nOver three thousand original \"Warcraft III\" material assets have been released for use in the map editor of \"StarCraft II\" in in 2015, as well as the addiction of new hero models for the 4 primary races and some other new models. Original models including neutral creatures and their sounds as well as doodads, structures, spell effects, ambient sounds, music and custom user interfaces for each race. In \"StarCraft II\" with in 2020. An official War3 Asset Mod includes a whole set of working data that includes races, units, buildings, and abilities.\nArcade Workshop.\nArcade (also known as \"Arcade Workshop\") offers the StarCraft community an exciting new way to discover, rate, and play a wide array of community and &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; created games. Arcade is available within the StarCraft II client, located in the main menu at the left of the screen after you log in."}

Found in the city's lower levels, the district borders other suburban areas in the form of the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Commons\"&gt;Evermoon Commons&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Siren%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Siren's Vigil&lt;/a&gt; to the east and south, and the &lt;a href=\"Artisan%27s%20Gallery\"&gt;Artisan's Gallery&lt;/a&gt; to the north. It is a largely open district with a main square and access to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Bay\"&gt;Suramar Bay&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Starcaller Retreat is notably home to the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;, an outdoor tavern that acted as a major focal meeting point for much of Suramar's citizenry. At the time of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;, the Waning Crescent (and by extension the Starcaller Retreat) served as the main headquarters and support base for the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nightfallen rebels&lt;/a&gt;. The district would eventually suffer heavily for this association when the nightborne authorities and their &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic allies chose to retaliate.\nThe events of the civil war would ultimately make Starcaller Retreat one of the more active areas of Suramar City involved the conflict.\nHistory.\n&lt;a href=\"Nightborne\"&gt;Nightborne&lt;/a&gt; society was thrown into upheavel during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s ruler &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; chose to allow the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s access to the city. &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;A resistance movement&lt;/a&gt; immediately formed to oppose Elisande, beginning &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;a civil war&lt;/a&gt; for control of the city and the wider region. Seeking to gain the support of the nightborne citizens, as well as protect them from Elisande and the demons. The rebels began operating throughout Suramar City, basing themselves in the lower levels in the city's west, which was home to its lower classes and those suffering most under the regime.\nThe tavernkeeper &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;, owner of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;the Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt;, quickly became one of the rebellion's chief leaders within the city proper. The Waning Crescent, as well as the Starcaller Retreat in which it was located, subsequently acted as a base for the majority of rebel activities throughout the city, as well as serving as a meeting point for its members. Starcaller Retreat was connected to the rebellion's main headquarters outside the city through a telemancy beacon in the main square, allowing ease of travel for Nightfallen agents. Over time, the insurrection began to accumulate more and more successes, in response to which the Grand Magistrix and her &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; allies eventually chose to respond.\nIn retaliation, a large force of demons and &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, under orders from Elisande, marched on the Starcaller Retreat and slaughtered as many of its residents as possible. Much of the district, including the Waning Crescent, was razed. Despite the totality of the carnage, the event ultimately worked against Elisande's cause, turning yet more nightborne (even members of her own Duskwatch) against her in horror.\nThe Nightfallen headquarters within the city was moved to the nearby &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Terrace\"&gt;Evermoon Terrace&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of Starcaller Retreat's ruin. From there, the rebels would eventually achieve success in their mission to bring down Grand Magistrix Elisande and her allies."}

The caster turns starlight into devastating missiles. The caster calls down starlight that solidifies into a destructive missile of matter and energy. The missiles appear as searing stars from the air above the targets, rocketing down into them with devastating explosive power. A caster is able to concentrate, and target two creatures, structures or objects with one starlight missile each that causes force damage. It can target different creatures, or the same creature repeatedly. However it cannot target the same creature with both missiles at the same time.\nOverview.\nThe most powerful spell in the arsenal of the &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt;. The spell is a much more powerful version of &lt;a href=\"Starshards\"&gt;Starshards&lt;/a&gt;, an ability all &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Priests\"&gt;Priests&lt;/a&gt; may learn. While a priestess of Elune channels this ability, she is lit up by light, and stars come crashing down from the skies, striking her enemies with the force of Elune. This ability was especially used by Tyrande Whisperwind during the many battles of the third war. She aided her allies in defeating many demons with it during the battle of Mount Hyjal, and when she was to protect the bridge over the river Arevass in Loradaeron. She, with this spell alone, held back an army of undead. She was swept downriver when the bridge collapsed and stranded in a watery valley in the middle of the plaguelands when the Scourge crept in on her. Through extensive use of starfall, she held their assaults off until Illidan came to her rescue.\nOmen from the Lunar Festival also have this ability.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; can do an average of twentieth thousand damage every 2 seconds, one hundred thousand for its full duration. The &lt;a href=\"core%20hound\"&gt;core hound&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Omen\"&gt;Omen&lt;/a&gt;, also knows this move, although he mostly uses &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt; on foes in front of him."}

Characteristics of a gear check (or gatekeeper) boss include some or all of the following:\nThe game designers use these gatekeeper bosses to ensure enough of the raid members did pass through the intended content progression before continuing deeper into the instance.\nThe term 'gear check' is sometimes used in a derogatory manner due to the fact that after surpassing the requirement, gear checks can become easy to the point of silliness (for example, with Tier 5 gear, the Curator is dead after 70 seconds or less).\nUsually, the end boss fight of a raid instance is not designed as gear check, but rather requires high levels of skill even after beating it many times (possible exception: &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Malchezzar\"&gt;Prince Malchezzar&lt;/a&gt;, though this was probably not the designers' intent, as the \"safe spots\" were removed in patch 2.4).\nFor example &lt;a href=\"Razorgore%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Razorgore the Untamed&lt;/a&gt; (first boss of &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;) requires a high amount of skill and coordination, but only a few key raid members are needed with good gear (on healers good gear may even be detrimental because of aggro issues). The second boss (&lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz%20the%20Corrupt\"&gt;Vaelastrasz the Corrupt&lt;/a&gt;), however, hits very hard and is on a three-minute timer. The whole raid must deliver very high &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt;, several tanks with good gear must take turns in tanking him, and even with well-equipped tanks, the healers are under extreme pressure to keep them up. Most of the raid members must have spent a lot of time in &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; to gear up sufficiently in order to beat Vaelastrasz.\nOther famous examples for gear checks are: &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Curator\"&gt;The Curator&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brutallus\"&gt;Brutallus&lt;/a&gt;. A more recent example would be &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gara%27jal%20the%20Spiritbinder\"&gt;Gara'jal the Spiritbinder&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Butcher\"&gt;The Butcher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Sludgefist\"&gt;Sludgefist&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "232556", "revid": "474131", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=232556", "title": "Gear score", "text": "Gear score is a numerical value based on the statistics of a player's gear. It is (supposedly) the maximum potential of a player's performance. However, it is up to the player to perform that well. In addition to item level (ilvl), the item's actual statistics or abilities may or may not be included for calculation, as determined by specific formulas or addons.\nMost commonly, gear scores are a metric used to evaluate the relative strength of a player's equipment as a way of determining if that player meets a given threshold to join in certain raids or groups going through an instance. It should be noted that a given gear score, no matter which formula is used, does not necessarily mean that other players cannot demand higher scores from others before joining a raid or group.\nDespite the possible flaws in the system, gear score can be a useful tool in determining an individual player's readiness for certain content. Rather than risking the waste of time and money on wipes and repair bills, gear score can provide a basic indication that a player is \"likely\" to possess gear sufficient to run (or even trivialize) the content in question. There is no substitute for checking a player's choice of gems, enchants, glyphs, and spec, plus knowledge of appropriate caps (hit, haste, and/or crit), all of which reveal far more about a player than for what gear he or she has managed to win rolls or purchased by running heroics.\nThat said, when used as an \"initial\" assessment of a player, followed by inspections of their Armory profile (which does display things like item enhancements and achievements), gear score can allow the quick and efficient assembling of groups and raids intending to take on difficult content. Be warned: reliance on gear score, without following up the initial assessment with the armory or inspecting, is in fact counterproductive. It degrades the community by encouraging less knowledgeable players to \"upgrade\" based strictly on item levels, as well as decreasing the motivation of some players to improve (as they receive raid invites and rolls on loot without needing to do so).\nControversy.\nThe usage of gear scores has caused a large amount of controversy due to a proportion of players who view it as unnecessary and distracting in the face of others options like DPS or Achievements.\nTeammate screening.\nThe largest source of complaints appears to arise from the fact that while gear score addons/websites may calculate and suggest a gear score for certain content, frequently players have arbitrarily raised the minimum score needed before they will allow others to join them. Motivations for this may include a desire by some players to either decrease the chance of failure in the instance, or to increase the ease or speed of gameplay. Often, players will seek to run older content as fast as possible as a means to farm emblems as quick as possible. These groups frequently reject new players who may actually need gear from such content.\nPlayers often feel they are skilled enough to overcome their lack of gear. They feel upset that they are not given the chance to prove themselves because they fail whatever gear score requirement was imposed by the raid leader. A veteran player with a low gear score can outperform a newer player with a high gear score. Similarly a high gear score tank can be the counterweight for a low gear score healer or vice versa.\nWrong-class gear.\nUntil Patch 4.0.1, the GearScore add-on (now called PlayerScore) did not penalize gear whose stats were inappropriate to a player's class or role or were only useful in PvP, nor did it consider weapon or armor type.\nCaps.\nEven if a player's gear is class- and spec-appropriate, gear score add-ons do not take soft or hard caps into account. &lt;a href=\"Reforging\"&gt;Reforging&lt;/a&gt; greatly reduces the impact of this problem, but only if the player is aware of the relative value of different secondary stats to him or her.\nDecline and alternatives.\nIn Cataclysm, two assessment methods have caused gear score to fall into disuse.\nItem level.\nThe game now provides average equipped &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;, which is adequate if only a sanity check is needed of the player's assessment that he or she is geared.\nRawr and Simulationcraft.\nThe tools &lt;a href=\"Rawr\"&gt;Rawr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Simulationcraft\"&gt;Simulationcraft&lt;/a&gt; provide detailed estimates of a player's potential &lt;a href=\"damage%20per%20second\"&gt;damage per second&lt;/a&gt;, healing per second, or chance to survive and hold aggro as a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;; these are the best way to objectively score a raider's gear. Since they use thousands of iterations and can standardize both boss mechanics and raid buffs, they are far more precise than estimates based on damage meters or combat-log parses.\nSources.\nThere is a variety of external web-sites and addons that can be used to score a character's gear.

Unlike the &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;s, who are beings of pure flame, the &lt;a href=\"flamewaker\"&gt;flamewaker&lt;/a&gt;s are &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s composed of flesh and blood. Gehennas resides near the bottom of the Firelord's elemental hierarchy and covets the power and station of his superiors. He is distrusted by all who serve with him, with the exception of his two loyal guards, who believe they might gain from their overseer's ascension.\nGehennas uses shadow magic and guards the &lt;a href=\"Rune%20of%20Mohn\"&gt;Rune of Mohn&lt;/a&gt; along with two &lt;a href=\"Flamewaker%20%28mob%29\"&gt;Flamewakers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, Gehennas is accompanied by four Flamewakers rather than two. He will also cast Rain of Fire much more frequently.\nStrategy.\nClear the entire area around Gehennas and then pull the guards to the south west and tank Gehennas in the center of the room. Make sure Gehennas is far enough away that the only people in range of his curse, shadow bolt, and rain of fire are the main tank and his healers/decursers. The two guards need to be tank far away from Gehennas and need to be kept a decent distance apart, otherwise the tanks and melee DPS will end up stun locked the entire battle from the two cleaves. The MT on Gehennas will need a dedicated decurser usually a mage, but a druid will work as well. The tank must have the curse removed as soon as possible. Gehennas deals a fair amount of damage and you will not be able to keep the tank up if he is only receiving 25% of the healing. Once the two guards are dead the entire raid should focus on killing Gehennas. The guards go down pretty quickly, Gehennas takes a while.\nMages and druids in this fight should be sure to adjust their decursing priority list to place the MT at the top, followed by other melee players, as the curse greatly reduces the amount of healing a player can receive.\nReward.\nGehennas's death rewards 100 reputation with the &lt;a href=\"Hydraxian%20Waterlords\"&gt;Hydraxian Waterlords&lt;/a&gt; up to 20,999/21,000 Revered.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

He was previously the elected leader of &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;kind, though as one of the perks of his station, he liked to style himself as \"King of Gnomes\". Gelbin has been at the helm of the gnome race during some of its most difficult and trying times. Since his title was an elected one, the fact that he held his position throughout such hardship is a testament to the love his people have for him. A brilliant &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;inventor&lt;/a&gt;, Gelbin rose quickly to prominence among the meritocratic gnomes with his innovative designs and creative problem-solving skills. He built the very first functioning &lt;a href=\"mechanostrider\"&gt;mechanostrider&lt;/a&gt;, assisted in the development of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;, and was instrumental in the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; running from &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlthough one wouldn\u2019t know it from looking at him, the loss of Gnomeregan weighs heavily on the high tinker. He was unprepared for the invasion that swept through his beloved city, and he was betrayed by a &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;trusted advisor&lt;/a&gt; who convinced him to react hastily, resulting in unnecessary deaths. Now Mekkatorque\u2019s brilliant mind has taken on a surgical focus with one single outcome: the retaking of Gnomeregan.\nFollowing the reunification of Gnomeregan and &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;, Gelbin was officially proclaimed king of the gnomes, the first monarch to rule all of gnomanity since &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt; four hundred years before.\nBiography.\nBackground.\nA young Gelbin Mekkatorque graduated from &lt;a href=\"Gearshaft%20University\"&gt;Gearshaft University&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, and was gifted with a pair of &lt;a href=\"mithril\"&gt;mithril&lt;/a&gt;-rimmed lenses from his friend and fellow graduate, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;, which he wore at almost all times. He rose to fame in &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28nation%29\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; after his first - and arguably most popular - invention; the revolutionizing traveling device called the &lt;a href=\"Mechanostrider\"&gt;Mechanostrider&lt;/a&gt;, which provided an effective method of personal transport, finally putting the &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; race on par with the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and their &lt;a href=\"charger\"&gt;charger&lt;/a&gt;s. From then on, Mekkatorque continued his work, pumping out invention after invention, each one benefiting and furthering the gnomish race and their technology. His inventions included the &lt;a href=\"Gyromatic%20Micro-Adjustor\"&gt;gyromatic micro-adjustor&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"repair%20bot\"&gt;repair bot&lt;/a&gt;.\nMekkatorque was known for his practicality and his personal quarters were fittingly practical. His creative way of thinking could be represented physically by the very hallways in &lt;a href=\"sector%2017\"&gt;sector 17&lt;/a&gt;; a library connected to the drafting room connected to simple foundry connected to the assembly chamber. He had a habit of often getting caught up in his inventive process, spending night after night brainstorming ideas; to the point where most of his resting was done within his working space. His skill as an engineer was unquestionable, having literally earned so many awards that his apprentices asked for him to have a trophy case made in order to store them all.\nSecond War and aftermath.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; took control of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. The Gnomeregan gnomes and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; dwarves successfully &lt;a href=\"Defense%20of%20Gnomeregan\"&gt;defended themselves&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually, with the help of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; freed their home. Mekkatorque kept a &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;-made chair as a souvenir in sector 17 from the first gnomish-assisted foray into a Horde encampment in the Second War. He chose the fierce-looking primitive construction of bone and raptorhide to remind himself of two important points: that his enemies lived in a world shaped from monsters' flesh and bone, and that even tusked, mossy-skinned savages needed a cozy place to sit sometimes.\nFollowing the victory, the rebuilding of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; began, and being allied, the dwarves and gnomes decided to help. However, it was evident that travel to and from the north was difficult and slow, as such &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; requested a faster solution from Azeroth's most esteemed engineer at the time, Gelbin Mekkatorque. Tinker Mekkatorque, in his office at sector 17 prepared the schematics for the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;, even creating a scale mock-up model of the Tram out of pie tins. Soon Mekkatorque would take part in the construction of his ambitious subterranean train project, successfully creating a quicker method to travel from Ironforge to Stormwind City. Gelbin kept &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; informed about updates or problems. Once, he even informed him about a problem of rats.\nAt some point before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the gnomish electorate chose Mekkatorque to lead their nation as their &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker\"&gt;High Tinker&lt;/a&gt;, following his various technological triumphs and their benefits to the gnomish race. For many, he would be viewed as a role model for what the gnomes looked for in a High Tinker. Mekkatorque's best friend, &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt;, would soon rise up the ranks like Mekkatorque had and gained favor among the intellectual elite, eventually winning the seat of chief advisor to his friend, the High Tinker. A brooding but imaginative &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;, Thermaplugg served as Mekkatorque's chief advisor for many years, continuing to covet the role of High Tinker with jealousy that would slowly eat away his sanity.\nPrior to year 18 when the Alliance of Lordaeron splintered, High Tinker Mekkatorque, along with some other leaders, reaffirmed that the gnomes would not leave the Alliance of Lordaeron.\nFall of Gnomeregan.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Sicco Thermaplugg and Gelbin had been designing the prototype for the dwarven &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;, eventually perfecting it sometime during the war. While the gnomes continued to supply their allies in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with their machinery and weapons, the gnomes had taken very little part in the war. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invaded during the Third War, Gelbin declined to send aid to the Alliance in the form of gnomish personnel, much to their allies' surprise. When the war was over, however, it was revealed as to why the gnomes had not aided the Alliance.\nDwarven digging operations around &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; awoke the foul race of primitive creatures called &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, which were attracted to the gnomish machinery and built tunnels toward &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. On the onset of the Third War, when the &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the brutish troggs broke through the lower reaches of the city, invading from the depths of the earth.\nMekkatorque was unprepared for an invasion of his own city, but knowing that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was already busy with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; invasion, Gelbin tried to find a way to handle this subterranean invasion without the pre-occupied Alliance. The brilliant leader believed that protecting Lordaeron from the Scourge was of the utmost importance, so he kept the trogg invasion a secret. For five years, the gnomes secretly fought the troggs but were overrun. The troggs simply dug around their defenses and breached into their engineering quarters.\nMekkatorque approached this invasion as he would any other problem. He remained fearless and calm, relying on the intelligence of his people. Turning to his advisers, his top adviser and friend Mekgineer &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; put forward a potential plan, releasing a toxic gas that would kill the troggs as they invaded. Sicco had claimed to have tested the radiation levels of the gas claiming to have evidence of its terminal effects on the troggs and had shown Gelbin falsified numbers on its density and volumetric weight. According to Thermaplug's calculations, the gas would stay in the quarantined thoroughfares and lower sections of Gnomeregan, poisoning the invaders as they emerged from the depths while the gnomes waited safely sealed away in the upper urban tunnels, kept away from the population by Thermaplugg's &lt;a href=\"Kleen%20Wind%20Domiclic%20Filter\"&gt;Kleen Wind Domiclic Filter&lt;/a&gt;s. The urgency to deal with the invasion, and the confidence his trusted friend showed led Mekkatorque to believe it was the best course of action and ordered the gnomes to open the pressure valves of their giant, grinding machines and released toxic radiation throughout the lower levels of the city.\nMekkatorque could only watch as the plan failed catastrophically. Rather than kill the troggs, most shambled through the gas, becoming enraged as they were irradiated. The filters failed, going straight through them into the homes of Gnomes, killing them as they waited in their homes thinking they were safe. Mekkatorque was left beside himself with guilt, the casualties of the invasion already high, the gas causing casualties to skyrocket to eighty percent of the population.\nUnable to take any more deaths or hold back the Troggs, Mekkatorque was forced to swallow his pride and lead the surviving gnome population out of Gnomeregan to seek refuge with their dwarven neighbors in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, all the while forced to carry the weight of the dead on his shoulders. During the evacuation of Gnomeregan, Mekkatorque was horrified to discover that Thermaplugg had, in fact, betrayed the gnomish race. Thermaplugg's desire to be High Tinker had driven him mad with envy over the years, driving him to plot against Mekkatorque. His plan was to frame the High Tinker by letting thirty percent of the population die to the gas, then swoop in and save the day and dismiss the troggs; ensuring him the position and Gelbin with the blame of the many deaths. However, the gas was much deadlier than Thermaplugg anticipated; wiping out eighty percent of the Gnomish population rather than thirty. With such a high amount of deaths, the Gnomes rallied desperately to Mekkatorque, much to Thermaplugg's dismay.\nKing &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; granted them asylum and cleared out an entire district of his city for them to reside in, which Mekkatorque was already familiar with because of his previous work with the Deeprun Tram. The gnomes constructed &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; here. Mekkatorque had only truly found how mad his old friend had become following the evacuation when it was discovered that Thermaplugg remained behind, and the details of his underhanded plans slowly became public, his plans and plots discovered.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nGelbin Mekkatorque, now located in &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and having been High Tinker for seven years continued to lead the Gnomeregan Exiles in their new home, aiding in Alliance operations across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and at the same time devising a plan for retaking their home city, watching as his people's seclusion slowly dissipated as his people intermingled with other members of the Alliance. While Gelbin originally assumed his former friend had perished, voyages and observations of the city proved otherwise, as well as revealing the disturbing fate of some of the Gnomes who were left behind. Those who survived mutated into diseased &lt;a href=\"Leper%20gnome\"&gt;Leper gnome&lt;/a&gt;s, the disease warping their minds, which led to a now mutated and insane Thermaplugg taking over the leper gnomes, ruling them with an iron fist of madness.\nSentencing &lt;a href=\"Sicco%20Thermaplugg\"&gt;Sicco Thermaplugg&lt;/a&gt; to death for treason, Mekkatorque enlisted the aid of various Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to venture into the radioactive city and take down the betrayer, returning reporting the death of Thermaplugg, only for Mekkatorque to later find out it was just a clever facsimile devised by Thermaplugg. It became clear that retaking Gnomeregan would take more than just a small team, rather a large force of gnomish and Alliance might.\nMekkatorque also sent &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Swindle\"&gt;Dirk Swindle&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt; to defend gnomes from &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the dwarves' &lt;a href=\"brewfest\"&gt;brewfest&lt;/a&gt; celebrations, Mekkatorque rode out to the festival grounds each day for the ceremonial &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%23Tapping%20of%20the%20Keg\"&gt;tapping of the keg&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; awoke, he sent his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; into all corners of Azeroth. To defeat the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;Plague of Undeath&lt;/a&gt; and necropolises, members of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; traveled to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; and created an artifact of the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt;'s Light. Gnomish adventurers of the Alliance delivered it to Gelbin Mekkatorque to destroy the Scourge.\nOperation: Gnomeregan.\nAfter years of planning, Gelbin Mekkatorque put his plan into action at last and launched , calling support from not only the gnomish people but the Alliance as well. Under Mekkatorque's strategic leadership, the Gnomeregan Exiles and Alliance comrades were priming their forces at &lt;a href=\"Steelgrill%27s%20Depot\"&gt;Steelgrill's Depot&lt;/a&gt;, the staging grounds for the Gnomeregan offensive and the production site of the gnome's &lt;a href=\"mechano-tank\"&gt;mechano-tank&lt;/a&gt;s. After the preparations were made, Gelbin led a full assault to wrest control of Gnomeregan's airfield, setting up a surface command post, and ultimately underwent a raid into the tunnels of lower &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. \nThermaplugg, however, had one final trick: once the Alliance had reached the center of the city he unveiled the &lt;a href=\"Irradiator%203000\"&gt;Irradiator 3000&lt;/a&gt;. Unable to disarm the bomb in time, Gelbin was forced to recall the forces and hastily teleport to the surface, sealing off Gnomeregan while the irradiation cleared out; planning to continue the assault once that had happened. Despite being unable to fully retake the city, Mekkatorque was happy with the successful first maneuver and the knowledge that Thermaplugg had been dealt a blow he'd not recover from soon. The gnomes had carved out a tenuous foothold in &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, near the techno-city's gates.\nCut Short.\nAs the push to retake Gnomeregan continued, Gelbin was eager to inspect his old living quarters of &lt;a href=\"sector%2017\"&gt;sector 17&lt;/a&gt;, which was recently retaken. Finding it somewhat odd as to how easily the section was retaken, Gelbin was caught up in his own emotions, remembering the past and the fall of Gnomeregan. After years of having to put a strong image for his people, Gelbin finally let his emotions out, weeping over the loss of his people; feeling somewhat better after doing so. As he prepared to leave, he found his mithril spectacles on the arm of his troll chair, left behind during the rush to evacuate the city. Picking them up, he realized too late that it was a trap set out by Thermaplugg as a tripwire was tied to the glasses.\nHaving ordered his guards away so he could inspect his old quarters, and having forgotten his weapon &lt;a href=\"Wrenchcalibur\"&gt;Wrenchcalibur&lt;/a&gt;, Gelbin was surrounded by three Troggs as Thermaplugg gloated via intercom over Mekkatorque's falling for his trap. Through careful manipulation and usage of his surroundings, Gelbin successfully dispatched the troggs unarmed. Not willing to allow Gelbin to escape after all this time, Thermaplugg arrived to deal with Mekkatorque personally. Yet in the end, he too was outwitted by the High Tinkerer. Having repurposed the trap's trigger mechanism to take out the troggs, Gelbin released a tensely wound spring that had been holding up more weight than it should have been, which resulted in Thermaplugg being cut in half, losing his legs in the process. Thermaplug did survive though due to his destroyed battle suit cauterizing his wounds, likely with minimal blood loss. Gelbin decided to leave him for dead so that his suffering would be prolonged, citing it as an appropriate punishment for his crimes against the gnomes. He decided that if the rats or the troggs didn't kill Thermaplugg, then he'd think of no one better to lead the troggs than one of their own.\nElemental Unrest.\nHigh Tinker Mekkatorque was present during the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest%20meetings\"&gt;Elemental Unrest meeting&lt;/a&gt;. During the meeting, he mentioned that the large amount of seismic activity could endanger Ironforge.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Mekkatorque protected the &lt;a href=\"Military%20Ward\"&gt;Military Ward&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge from the elements.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Gelbin Mekkatorque returned his attention to Gnomeregan which had aired out. He can now be found under a tent at &lt;a href=\"New%20Tinkertown\"&gt;New Tinkertown&lt;/a&gt;, the portions of Gnomeregan's surface reclaimed during the battle against Thermaplugg. Mekkatorque sent &lt;a href=\"S.A.F.E.\"&gt;S.A.F.E.&lt;/a&gt;, under &lt;a href=\"Nevin%20Twistwrench\"&gt;Nevin Twistwrench&lt;/a&gt;'s command, to retrieve gnome survivors. Mekkatorque personally assembled a team of &lt;a href=\"class%20trainers\"&gt;class trainers&lt;/a&gt; to prepare the young evacuees for battle, and made a habit of meeting most of the survivors himself.\nThe Gnomeregan Exiles were slowly reclaiming portions of Gnomeregan, such as the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Dormitory\"&gt;Old Dormitory&lt;/a&gt;. Mekkatorque's units fought against Thermaplugg's irradiated gnome forces, who were bent on keeping the gnomes from rebuilding and finishing their reclamation of Gnomeregan. The High Tinker then hired &lt;a href=\"Kharmarn%20Palegrip\"&gt;Kharmarn Palegrip&lt;/a&gt; and his demolitions team to close off the trogg advance, and eventually led a combined gnome and dwarven force in defeating one of Thermaplugg's most loyal henchmen, &lt;a href=\"Razlo%20Crushcog\"&gt;Razlo Crushcog&lt;/a&gt;.\nWolfheart.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; invited Gelbin Mekkatorque to represent Gnomeregan at a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and deliver their vote whether or not the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; should be accepted into the Alliance. When he arrived, he had a little argument with &lt;a href=\"Drukan\"&gt;Drukan&lt;/a&gt;. They soon made peace during the banquet, when he was approached by Drukan and had a private talk with him. Mekkatorque voted to accept Gilneas into the Alliance.\nTides of War.\nWhen word of the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;fall of Theramore&lt;/a&gt; reached the rest of the Alliance Gelbin Mekkatorque personally journeyed to Stormwind City. Upon arriving he and other Alliance leaders and representatives began planning a counterattack against the Horde's naval blockade of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Over the course of the meeting, Mekkatorque quietly asked if anyone had been to Theramore following its destruction. He was then informed by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Prince Anduin&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; herself had been there. While voicing joy at her survival Gelbin couldn't help but wonder why Jaina wasn't helping them in strategizing. He was informed by &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that she was pursuing her own methods.\nMists of Pandaria.\nMekkatorque and &lt;a href=\"Tinkmaster%20Overspark\"&gt;Overspark&lt;/a&gt; participated in the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, Mekkatorque showing up in the &lt;a href=\"Underhold\"&gt;Underhold&lt;/a&gt; to help Alliance adventurers against &lt;a href=\"War%20Master%20Kragg\"&gt;War Master Kragg&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron\"&gt;Kor'kron&lt;/a&gt; guards. He was present when the leaders of the Alliance and Horde met after &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;' defeat.\nWar Crimes.\nGelbin was invited to attend the trial of &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; alongside the other Alliance leaders. When the Horde and Alliance leaders met at the temple a few days prior to the start of the trial, &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; argued that Garrosh should be tried by his peers so he could make compensation to those he had wronged. Gelbin laughed humorlessly and retorted that Gallywix meant monetary compensation. Jastor replied that that would be an acceptable form.\nLegion.\nWith the events about to unfold on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, High Tinker Mekkatorque commanded his people to get outfitted and ready for battle \u2014 any way they know-how, leading to the creation of gnomish &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. Mekkatorque and a contingent of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Tinkerer\"&gt;Gnomeregan Tinkerer&lt;/a&gt;s accompanied King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s vanguard on the assault on the Broken Shore. Mekkatorque fought at the Broken Shore on his own &lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt; and used it to call in air support from the Alliance &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Skyfire\"&gt;Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" at King Varian's command. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance forces were left vulnerable by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s unexpected retreat. The Alliance tried to retreat on the \"Skyfire\" but was impeded by a summoned &lt;a href=\"fel%20reaver\"&gt;fel reaver&lt;/a&gt;. Through his steam armor, Gelbin caught a falling Stormwind soldier by their cape. The Alliance forces watched helplessly as King Varian Wrynn sacrificed himself by distracting the Burning Legion forces so that the Alliance forces could fly to safety. In the aftermath of the battle, Mekkatorque attended the funeral of Varian Wrynn.\nWhen an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player reaches Prestige Rank 2, Gelbin can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; alongside other notable leaders of the Alliance. During &lt;a href=\"A%20Royal%20Audience%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;A Royal Audience (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, he is present at the ceremony hosted by King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; that congratulates the character for their battles against the Horde, following their receiving of the &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Marshal%27s%20Medal%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Grand Marshal's Medal of Valor&lt;/a&gt; from the King, as well as an artifact appearance.\nBefore the Storm.\nGelbin was present in a meeting with &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. He was accompanied by his advisor &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Tread%20Sparknozzle\"&gt;Captain Tread Sparknozzle&lt;/a&gt;. He wondered whether &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; could heal herself. He also received &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; samples to study and chose &lt;a href=\"Sapphronetta%20Flivvers\"&gt;Sapphronetta Flivvers&lt;/a&gt; to go to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nMekkatorque and his forces joined the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; with the help of &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who created a &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; portal to transport both his gnomish troops and her own &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nFrom his airship \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Strider\"&gt;The Strider&lt;/a&gt;\" Mekkatorque led an attack on the Horde's &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; mining operations in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, using an army of remote-controlled robots. &lt;a href=\"Jastor%20Gallywix\"&gt;Jastor Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"G.M.O.D\"&gt;G.M.O.D&lt;/a&gt; led the Horde's reprisal, and then confronted Mekkatorque and his own mech suit in the sky only for the G.M.O.D to run out of fuel, giving Mekkatorque the chance to knock Gallywix out of the sky. Once the G.M.O.D was operational again, Gallywix attacked \"The Strider\" above &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; to draw out Mekkatorque. As they fought \"The Strider\" began to fall apart and so Mekkatorque fled, leaving Gallywix to wonder how to break through his mech's Proto Layered Optimal Titan Armor.\nTides of Vengeance.\nMekkatorque sailed with the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20navy\"&gt;Alliance navy&lt;/a&gt; during their &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;assault on Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;. Once a majority of the Horde's forces were lured to &lt;a href=\"Nazmir\"&gt;Nazmir&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance navy began their invasion. The &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Fleet\"&gt;Golden Fleet&lt;/a&gt; sought to impede the Alliance navy's path, but the Alliance had secretly planted explosives on their ships beforehand. Just as Gelbin was about to remotely detonate the explosives with his remote detonator machine, Gelbin's floor collapsed from the impact of one of the Golden Fleet's &lt;a href=\"ballistae\"&gt;ballistae&lt;/a&gt; missiles. Gelbin fell below the deck of &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20ship\"&gt;Jaina's ship&lt;/a&gt; and pulled himself out of the rubble so he could rush to re-position his remote detonator. Once the remote detonator was upright again, Gelbin pushed the detonator button and blew up the entire Golden Fleet stationed there, allowing the Alliance navy to invade &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt; with little resistance. Gelbin was saddened to hear that &lt;a href=\"Grong\"&gt;Grong&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a &lt;a href=\"Grong%2C%20the%20Revenant\"&gt;Revenant&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;'s magic and urged Alliance adventurers to be merciful while putting him down. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Dazar%27alor%20%28battle%29\"&gt;Siege of Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt;, Mekkatorque dueled Gallywix in his &lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt;, once again defeating him, and proceeds to serve as a raid boss for Horde players. He was seriously injured during the battle but escaped using an escape pod, which was tended to by &lt;a href=\"Elgin%20Clickspring\"&gt;Elgin Clickspring&lt;/a&gt; and another gnomish engineer. However the escape pod placed him in suspended animation, and neither &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; nor Stormwind's priests know how to help him recover from his injuries, while &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Wyrmbane\"&gt;Halford Wyrmbane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; referred to him as being dead.\nVisions of N'zoth.\nAlthough he was still alive, Gelbin's escape pod began to lose power and his pulse began to slow, despite the efforts of the Kul Tiran healers. &lt;a href=\"Kelsey%20Steelspark\"&gt;Kelsey Steelspark&lt;/a&gt;, desperate to save the High Tinker, worked with Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to have Mekkatorque's pod transported to &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20Island\"&gt;Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;, hoping the &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnomes&lt;/a&gt; there would be able to save him. &lt;a href=\"Waren%20Gearhart\"&gt;Waren Gearhart&lt;/a&gt; believed that an existing device could be modified to gain access to Gelbin without disrupting the pod's life support. However, the &lt;a href=\"Homing%20Copter\"&gt;copter&lt;/a&gt; carrying the pod was shot down by the island's &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, and the adventurers were forced to recover the pod and kill the troggs who had downed the copter. As work proceeded to unlock the pod, &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Erazmin\"&gt;Prince Erazmin&lt;/a&gt; wished to learn both from his own people about what made an ideal leader, and from their allies from Gnomeregan about why they followed Gelbin, as a baseline for restoring his mental function. After the pod was opened, a &lt;a href=\"Spark%20Reactor\"&gt;Spark Reactor&lt;/a&gt; recovered from &lt;a href=\"King%20Mechagon\"&gt;King Mechagon&lt;/a&gt;'s Annihilo-tron was delivered from &lt;a href=\"Mechagon%20City\"&gt;Mechagon City&lt;/a&gt; to jump-start Gelbin's heart, and the High Tinker at last awakened.\nGrateful to Erazmin and his people for their aid, the High Tinker elected to return the favor by helping retake their home. Gelbin, Erazmin, Kelsey, and the Alliance adventurer teleported into Mechagon City and cleared out the last of King Mechagon's loyalist machines. With Mechagon liberated, Prince Erazmin expressed the desire to reunite their people and asked Gelbin to lead them. Gelbin accepted, on the condition that Erazmin stands with him as both counselor and friend. Without hesitation, Erazmin agreed. Addressing the crowd at the High Tinkertory in Mechagon City, Kelsey announced the reunification of Gnomeregan and Mechagon, and proclaimed Gelbin as the new king of an undivided gnomekind.\nHe later attended the summit hosted by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to declare the armistice of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;. He stood next to Erazmin throughout the announcement and clapped for Anduin's declaration that the armistice was signed. Unlike most of the leaders, he, Erazmin, and &lt;a href=\"Aysa%20Cloudsinger\"&gt;Aysa Cloudsinger&lt;/a&gt;, remained behind in the embassy and engaged in a conversation following &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;'s rejection of the armistice.\nInventions.\nGelbin Mekkatorque invented numerous gadgets, devices and machines:\nPersonality and traits.\nGelbin Mekkatorque, before the fall of Gnomeregan, was the absolute peak of all things a Gnome could aspire to be, a brilliant tinker who invented countless wonderful inventions and a trusting friend who valued his fellow gnomes. After the fall of their city and the massive loss of gnome lives, Mekkatorque grew far wearier and consumed with guilt, as he felt it was his fault for trusting Sicco Thermaplug, his close friend, in his attempt to rid them of the Trogg problem plaguing the city. Guilt, and a desire to not be pitied by the dwarves who had taken them in, would plague Mekkatorque until Gnomeregan was assaulted by his forces. The lives lost still weighed heavily on his mind, despite systematically beginning to reclaim their home and his hope dimmed for the future, as the melancholy of his life before the fall of Gnomeregan clung to his heart and mind until Thermaplugg tried to kill him in his recently reclaimed quarters. During the fight, Mekkatroque regains his hope for the future and realizing that despite Thermaplug's betrayal, it had been because of his friends, the Alliance, and everyone's hard to work who had died in reclaiming the city for the sake of the Gnomes. Mekkatorque has now banished his inner demons, regaining his hope and belief that trust in his friends, will cause Gnomeregan to not only raise again but to be even better than it once was.\nAside from his own personal feelings, Mekkatorque is incredibly inventive, and quick-witted during a fight. Before becoming High Tinker, Mekkatorque invented an incredible amount of useful items, of which he believed would benefit all of Gnomekind. Above all, he exemplifies what is best in Gnomes, which is why he was elected to the position of High Tinker and is still a much-beloved leader amongst them, as he is creative, and compassionate. He is motivated by curiosity, inventiveness, and altruism. His biggest flaw is his own inability to properly deal with his emotions because he feels he must be a leader first and foremost, and be \"Gelbin\", second. For Mekkatorque, understanding the universal laws of the world and science is easier than understanding himself, but even then, he can come to learn and grow as a person given enough time and personal reflection. His friendships and responsibility to his people and the Alliance are what guide him as a person and as a leader.\nCounting prime numbers is a way for him to relax his mind, as well as talking to himself - something he had refrained from doing after the fall of Gnomeregan.\nPunctuality had never been one of Mekkatorque's strong suits, but he likes to keep track of time to know exactly how late he is going to be.\nSometimes he wields a weapon named &lt;a href=\"Wrenchcalibur\"&gt;Wrenchcalibur&lt;/a&gt;, while mostly he is armed with a shield and mace or fights in steam-powered armor.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nMekkatorque's voice was changed in patch 3.3.3, as were his lines of dialogue.\nWelcome to Tinker Town!\nIceflow Lake.\nCrushcog's defeat will send a powerful message to his master, Thermaplugg.

They are mortal enemies of the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt; of centaur, a brother tribe also located in southern Desolace. The founding leader, or &lt;a href=\"Khan\"&gt;Khan&lt;/a&gt;, of the Gelkis was &lt;a href=\"Gelk\"&gt;Gelk&lt;/a&gt;, second of the alleged offspring of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt;. The Gelkis were once willing to befriend adventurers of the Horde and Alliance in exchange for doing evil acts towards the Magram clan, while under Khan Shaka's leadership. They are presently led by the &lt;a href=\"Khan%20Shodo\"&gt;Khan Shodo&lt;/a&gt; and his three sons.\nThe Magram held no alliance with their brother tribes, until Khan Shodo's sons were slain and was reunited with his daughter, who was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Maraudine%20clan\"&gt;Maraudine clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOriginally led by Khan Gelk, the Magram situated themselves in the southernmost regions of Desolace when the centaur divided into five tribes and have remained there ever since. \nWhen the Gelkis clan spoke out against Khan &lt;a href=\"Magra\"&gt;Magra&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Magram%20clan\"&gt;Magram clan&lt;/a&gt;'s notion that strength was essential and the tribe's survival depended on their fighting spirit, arguing that Theradras always watches over the centaur and will keep the tribes safe and alive, an eternal feud between the two tribes was born.\nAs such the Gelkis are more civilized \u2014 or as close as centaur can come to civilized - than their brethren, with an organized social structure and a firm grasp of the &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; tongue. While the Magram only respect strength, the Gelkis respect nature and their birthmother &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt;, calling upon her protection and the power of earth to maintain their existence. \nCataclysm.\nNo longer needing to request aid from adventurers of the Alliance and the Horde and being the strongest of the clans - between the Magram and Kolkar clans, due to &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, demons, and the centaurs nearly killing each other off. This has allowed the Gelkis to maintain their strength and continued to grow. Under the new leadership of Khan Shodo and his three sons, they now actively attack outsiders.\nWhen Khan Shodo's sons were slain he stopped caring about the land and the demons which continuously invade it, feeling that he has failed his clan and his forefathers. He eventually agrees join forces with the Kolkar and Magram, after being reunited with his captured daughter.\nSome time after the Cataclysm, the Gelkis and other clans of centaur joined under the new &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;High Khan&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerritories.\n&lt;a href=\"Gelkis%20Village\"&gt;Gelkis Village&lt;/a&gt; is located just to the east and slightly south of &lt;a href=\"Shadowprey%20Village\"&gt;Shadowprey Village&lt;/a&gt; in southwestern &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. It is the principal village of the Gelkis, and is situated in a ring around a large ravine. A cluster of cliffs and bluffs in the ravine are connected by a series of bridges and lead to a cave in the southern mountain face of Desolace. The Gelkis khan resides within this cave. The entire village is directly adjacent to Desolace's main north-south road and is thus a hazard for many travelers. \nReputation.\nFaction description.\n\"These centaur have made their home in the southern region of Desolace. Mortal enemies of the Magram Centaur.\"\nGaining reputation.\nReputation with the Gelkis Clan Centaur is gained by killing hostile mobs at &lt;a href=\"Shok%27Thokar\"&gt;Shok'Thokar&lt;/a&gt; and by completing the quest &lt;a href=\"Death%20to%20Agogridon\"&gt;Death to Agogridon&lt;/a&gt;, with the latter granting enough reputation to reach ranking with the faction.\nShould the player have already finished the quest before &lt;a href=\"patch%208.0.1\"&gt;patch 8.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, they can speak to &lt;a href=\"Karnum%20Marshweaver\"&gt;Karnum Marshweaver&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Karnum%27s%20Glade\"&gt;Karnum's Glade&lt;/a&gt; to receive the reputation reward.\nOld reputation.\nMagram vs. Gelkis.\nThe clashing cultural values of the Magram and Gelkis are the founding reason for their animosity towards one another, and it has only spiraled downwards since their initial disagreement. \nThe Gelkis representative &lt;a href=\"Uthek%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Uthek the Wise&lt;/a&gt;, stationed just northwest of the main village in a small tent on the borders of Gelkis territory, recruits foreign aid to strike against the Magram and organizes strategic missions - not all involving violence - to weaken them.\nUthek also sends foreign assistance to combat the &lt;a href=\"Kolkar\"&gt;Kolkar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maraudine\"&gt;Maraudine&lt;/a&gt; clans.\nReputation.\nIn order to be deemed worthy of the Gelkis' trust, adventurers must gain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the tribe by slaying members of the Magram until they reach status with the Gelkis. Each kill gives 5/20/25 reputation to the &lt;a href=\"Gelkis\"&gt;Gelkis&lt;/a&gt; faction and lowers the reputation of the &lt;a href=\"Magram\"&gt;Magram&lt;/a&gt; by 25/100/125. As of April 2009, kills reward full reputation, even at level 80. Previously, if mobs were at grey difficulty, they only awarded 1/5 reputation, however this appears to have been changed.\nBy far the most straightforward, if slow, way to gain reputation with the Gelkis is to camp next to &lt;a href=\"Warug\"&gt;Warug&lt;/a&gt; of the Magram. While he cannot be attacked, &lt;a href=\"Warug%27s%20Bodyguard\"&gt;Warug's Bodyguard&lt;/a&gt;s can and reward 5 Gelkis rep / -25 Magram rep per kill. What's more, they continually respawn to ensure that Warug always has two bodyguards, saving one from having to roam around the camp looking for victims. Note that this seems to be bugged, and occasionally the guards will spawn as Friendly and unattackable even at low faction rep with the war flag turned on.\nReputation with the Gelkis caps at , or one point below . By saving quests till the player is capped higher values can be attained. The highest level reached is 249/21000 or 274/21000 with &lt;a href=\"Diplomacy\"&gt;Diplomacy&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn earlier builds a player could become friendly or higher with both Centaur clans at the same time, by having someone else in a party kill a member of the Gelkis or Magram, which would cause the player to gain reputation with one Centaur clan, while not losing reputation with the other. As of &lt;a href=\"patch%202.2\"&gt;patch 2.2&lt;/a&gt;, the player will gain and lose reputation regardless of who in the party actually does the killing."}

Faced with the problem of preventing the orcs from being enslaved by the &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, he wandered alone in contemplation for many days. One day, a storm forced him to take shelter in a &lt;a href=\"Gorgrond\"&gt;Gorgrond&lt;/a&gt; steam cavern, where Gelnar then began to experience fever-induced visions. Giving both his body and spirits to the &lt;a href=\"furies\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt;, he submerged himself in a pool of lava and was miraculously unharmed.\nAccording to leged, Gelnar first forged the head of the Doomhammer in a pool of elemental lava, coaxing it forth from the heart of Draenor itself, before crafting the handle out of oak wood.\nDuring one battle, Gelnar and his clan faced an army of ogre invaders. The orc raised his hammer into the sky, and it spoke through fire and lightning. Thunder rolled through the blackened clouds above, shaking the very ground beneath the orcs' feet, and Draenor boomed with all its fury. The rain anointed the clan with the elements' blessing, and Gelnar and his clan rushed towards the enemy with a war cry on their lips.\nBoth the weapon and the name were then passed from father to eldest son for generations."}

{"id": "21963", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=21963", "title": "Gem", "text": "A gem is generally an &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt; that can be used as an &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; primarily for &lt;a href=\"jewelcrafting\"&gt;jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s or placed into a &lt;a href=\"socket\"&gt;socket&lt;/a&gt; of another item to give that item additional bonuses, &lt;a href=\"power\"&gt;power&lt;/a&gt;s and/or &lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafters&lt;/a&gt; can turn raw gems into socket gems or various jewelry items like rings and necklaces. The term \"gem\" can be used for raw or cut stones, but is often only used to describe cut gems. A gem cannot be removed once it is placed into a socket, however it can be overwritten by another, destroying it in the process.\nSocketable gems come in five broad categories: colored, prismatic, &lt;a href=\"meta%20gem\"&gt;meta&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"cogwheel\"&gt;cogwheel&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sha-Touched\"&gt;Sha-Touched&lt;/a&gt;.\nColored gems.\nColored gems are the most common type of socketable gem. They come in the colors red, blue, yellow, green, purple, and orange. They provide stat bonuses when socketed. They can be placed in any colored socket, or a prismatic socket. They will activate an item's socket bonus if the correct color gems are matched up with the socket colors. A certain number of certain colored gems may be required in order to activate meta gem.\nThe primary colored gems are , , and . Each color is associated with a specific set of stats, as in the following table:\nThe green, purple, and orange gems are considered hybrids. Each of these gems offers a combination of two stats according to the parent colors. For example, a purple gem may provide bonuses to expertise (a \"red\" stat) and hit rating (a \"blue\" stat). All of the colored gems of a particular tier have the same benefit weighting. A hybrid gem's two bonuses will each be half what the primary gem would have provided. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Solid%20Ocean%20Sapphire\"&gt;Solid Ocean Sapphire&lt;/a&gt;, a blue gem, provides +60 stamina, and the &lt;a href=\"Flashing%20Inferno%20Ruby\"&gt;Flashing Inferno Ruby&lt;/a&gt;, an red gem, provides +40 parry. The hybrid of these two is the purple &lt;a href=\"Defender%27s%20Demonseye\"&gt;Defender's Demonseye&lt;/a&gt;, with +30 stamina and +20 parry.\nEach hybrid gem can match a socket of either parent color for the purpose of activating an item's socket bonus. A green gem will match a blue or yellow socket, a purple gem will match a blue or red socket, and an orange gem will match a red or yellow socket. The hybrid gems also count for each parent color when activating a meta gem.\nPrismatic gems.\nPrismatic gems act as colored gems, and count as all three colors. They will match any color socket for the purpose of activating an item's socket bonus, and will count as all three colors for activating a meta gem. There are two varieties of these gems: one variety that improves all &lt;a href=\"resistance\"&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt;s, and one that improves all five &lt;a href=\"attributes\"&gt;attributes&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King expansions introduced prismatic gems, but there are not as yet any prismatic gems associated with Cataclysm.\nMeta gems.\n&lt;a href=\"Meta%20gem\"&gt;Meta gem&lt;/a&gt;s are more powerful gems that can only go in a meta socket. Meta sockets are found only on powerful headgear, and there is only one socket per piece. Meta gems may require some colored gems to be equipped in order to be activated; for example, a meta gem may require you to equip items that have two blue and one red colored gems socketed.\nA gem does not have to match its socket color to count toward a meta gem's bonus. For purposes of activating a meta gem's bonus, a hybrid colored gem counts as one gem of each of the two colors. A prismatic gem counts as one gem of each of the three colors.\nCogwheel gems.\n&lt;a href=\"Cogwheel\"&gt;Cogwheel&lt;/a&gt; gems fit into cogwheel sockets, which are found on the &lt;a href=\"Bio-Optic%20Killshades\"&gt;Bio-Optic Killshades&lt;/a&gt; epic engineering-crafted goggles. When first manufactured, these goggles have very poor stats, but the cogwheel gems are quite powerful in order to compensate. This allows the engineer to customize the goggles for any class specialization. It allows the goggles to be used by any class without the need for a large number of goggle schematics.\n&lt;a href=\"Tinker%27s%20Gear\"&gt;Tinker's Gear&lt;/a&gt; gems are the \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\" upgrade to Cogwheels and are no longer engineer-only as non-engineers can now equip some items that have cogwheel sockets.\nSha-Touched gems.\n&lt;a href=\"Sha-Touched\"&gt;Sha-Touched&lt;/a&gt; gems fit into Sha-Touched sockets, which are only found on weapons from &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Heart of Fear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Endless%20Spring\"&gt;Terrace of Endless Spring&lt;/a&gt;.\nSocketing.\nGem bonuses are activated when they are placed in equipment sockets and the equipment is worn. To begin socketing an item, hold down shift and right-click the item. A dialogue window will open which allows the gems to be placed in the sockets.\nGems cannot be removed from sockets once finally placed. However, they can be replaced by placing new gems in the same socket. The old gem will be destroyed once the new gem's socketing is finalized.\nCataclysm gems.\nThese pages concern the gems new to &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthrend gems.\nThese pages concern the gems new to &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthrend epic gems can be purchased with 220 &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt; from vendors in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;:\nOutland gems.\nThese pages concern the gems specific to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; era.\nComplete list:\nSpecific articles:"}

Any gem (except meta gems) may be placed in them.\nThe exception to this is relics either made by &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;,looted from dungeon inhabitents or purchased with &lt;a href=\"Justice%20Points\"&gt;Justice Points&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Valor%20Points\"&gt;Valor Points&lt;/a&gt;\nUncolored sockets and the gems that have been added to items via &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; do not count towards any socket bonus an item may have. \nSockets in &lt;a href=\"Relic\"&gt;Relic&lt;/a&gt;s do count as the sockets are an integral part of the item and are usually the only socket on the item in question.\nIn both of these situations the gems color will count towards any requirements of a meta gem.\nMeta sockets.\n&lt;a href=\"Meta%20gem\"&gt;Meta sockets&lt;/a&gt; currently appear only in particular varieties of head items. Meta sockets only accept &lt;a href=\"meta%20gem\"&gt;meta gem&lt;/a&gt;s, and meta gems may only be placed in meta sockets.\nMeta gem's differ from colored gems as they also have a requirement for them to activate,\nMeta gems require a certain combination of other color gems currently socketed in your equipped gear for both the meta gem and the socket bonus on the gear to be activated\nGem stats.\nA &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt; is associated with a primary color (, , ). For example, &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt; is a stat. That means having a pure strength gem in a or slot is possible but the gem color bonus requirement will not be met.\nHowever, gems come in both primary and secondary colors. As seen on the Color Wheel below, if you mix red and yellow, you get . An orange gem will provide one stat and one stat, each in approximately one-half the amount that a primary-colored gem of the same level would. \nIt is most important to note that, for the purposes of both socket bonuses and meta-gem requirements, a secondary-colored gem is considered to be a gem of BOTH of its primary colors. Thus, an orange gem will be considered to be both a gem AND a gem at the same time. \nTherfore if a gem requires more red than yellow gems equipping an orange gem will not affect the balance\nThis means that if you really want &lt;a href=\"strength\"&gt;strength&lt;/a&gt;, and your item only contains a socket, then the only way to get both strength and the socket bonus is with an gem, which will reduce the stat and suppliment it with a stat like &lt;a href=\"critical%20strike%20rating\"&gt;critical strike rating&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"resilience\"&gt;resilience&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis table shows all existing stat mixes and their name prefixes."}

Are there any chances to change that in the future?\" &lt;a href=\"Chris%20Metzen\"&gt;Chris Metzen&lt;/a&gt;'s reply was \"We have I don't know how many quest designers. Probably seven? So there's a lot of people that plug away on story for this thing and certainly, like, our CDev's department's always chasing fiction and hooking characters and stuff like that, and we totally appreciate every component of our audience and want the game to kind of sing to everybody, so... Off the top of my head, I don't know if we're currently developing gay or lesbian characters but it's certainly a possibility. As long as the story's compelling... I think everything's gravy as long as it's just a really good character, well-rounded character that people really respond to, so I think it's totally an open possibility.\"\nIn a July 2020 interview with Eurogamer, while discussing the \"\" character &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"%23Shadowlands\"&gt;see below&lt;/a&gt;), executive producer &lt;a href=\"John%20Hight\"&gt;John Hight&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"WoW is a game that doesn't try to emphasise sexual relationships so in that regard, we don't necessarily tell that part of the story other than to hint around it. But we certainly have characters [that have] - or we've always thought of characters as having - different gender identities in the game. We don't try to put a big focus on it and make it a big deal, we just try to make the game feel comfortable, friendly and approachable for everybody in the game, regardless of where they come from.\" When asked if this meant that there are transgender characters in content predating \"Shadowlands\", Hight replied, \"Knowing some of our designers and having conversations with them, I'm sure that was the intent. But we like to keep things subtle.\"\nIn an interview with &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt; around the same time, lead narrative designer &lt;a href=\"Steve%20Danuser\"&gt;Steve Danuser&lt;/a&gt; stated that \"I think it's a valuable thing that we show these different perspectives [on gender and sexuality] on Azeroth and want to really make clear that, you know, there's people who sometimes say, \u201cWell, Warcraft is this medieval fantasy game and those kinds of things weren't talked about in medieval times, so they shouldn't be in Azeroth,\u201d but I disagree with that. I think that Azeroth is a world of magic and a world of possibilities, and one of the things that's really important to know is that, in Azeroth, you can love who you want, you can identify yourself the way that you want, and all of those things are possibilities. We just want the game to be able to reflect that through its storylines, and through its character customization options, and we're really excited about that.\"\nGallery.\nThis section contains images about the anatomy (nudity, sexual dimorphism, and suggestive imagery), sexuality in official artwork, and/or images that show off the physical form.

They formerly controlled the whole of both islands, but with a mysterious magic causing a large amount of their soldiers to go insane or die, they have lost the bulk control over the island they once held.\nHistory.\nOnce led by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Reginald%20Baradin%20II\"&gt;Duke Reginald Baradin II&lt;/a&gt;, this fierce army has historic ties to the island stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;. They have joined the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in an effort to repel the Horde invaders and gain control of this crucial strategic point.\nThe Baradin's Wardens are a motley collection of soldiers based on the island of Tol Barad. Though they bolster their ranks with &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; at many opportunities, several prominent members of the Wardens claim ancestry from &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, a human-led nation that battled against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; on the shores of Tol Barad in the past. Still, others speak of years of service to the &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that they were charged with ensuring that the deadly prisoners locked away in the mystic &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt; never again walk free on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Whether these claims are simple bravado or truth remains to be seen, but the effect of invoking the bloody history of the island's guardians cannot be denied. The Baradin's Wardens are fiercely dedicated to their mission.\nThese champions seek aid from anyone willing to cross swords with the Horde armies scattered throughout the island of Tol Barad. The favors they extend to their champions are equally militant: mighty battle standards, peerless weapons, and other combat aids, all of which they hope will serve their continued goal of controlling the prison island once more.\nThrough a series of unfortunate events, the group lost control over various portions of Tol Barad. In the northern region, apart from the Horde, various other forces have begun to run rampant across the area. The Wardens at &lt;a href=\"Farson%20Hold\"&gt;Farson Hold&lt;/a&gt; have gone insane, with their leader, &lt;a href=\"Keep%20Lord%20Farson\"&gt;Keep Lord Farson&lt;/a&gt;, now entirely hostile to their cause. &lt;a href=\"Pirate\"&gt;Pirate&lt;/a&gt;s have overrun &lt;a href=\"Rustberg%20Village\"&gt;Rustberg Village&lt;/a&gt; after the Stromic denizens there returned home to aid with the troubles in their native kingdom. In addition, a myriad of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; issues plague the Baradin's Wardens. &lt;a href=\"Wellson%20Shipyard\"&gt;Wellson Shipyard&lt;/a&gt; was lost and its inhabitants mysteriously raised as hostile &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s, and undead pirates roam the coastline just east of Farson Hold, attacking supply ships. &lt;a href=\"Largo%27s%20Overlook\"&gt;Largo's Overlook&lt;/a&gt; has also been overrun by undead, who steal from the Wardens' dwindling supplies. While out of the way, undead have also risen in the &lt;a href=\"Restless%20Front\"&gt;Restless Front&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Hill\"&gt;Forgotten Hill&lt;/a&gt;, making it difficult to scavenge old supplies and tend to the deceased respectively.\nTo the south, their prison fortress of &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Hold\"&gt;Baradin Hold&lt;/a&gt; has also now been lost in a myriad of ways. The main fortress is under contest between the remaining Baradin's Wardens and their Alliance allies, and the invading Horde forces, with the outlying buildings swapping back and forth between the two factions ceaselessly. The prison cellblocks themselves have also been lost. The &lt;a href=\"Hole\"&gt;Hole&lt;/a&gt; has fallen to a prisoner revolt headed by the traitor &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Silva\"&gt;Warden Silva&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"D-Block\"&gt;D-Block&lt;/a&gt;'s imprisoned &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s have all broken free and overrun their cells. The ominously named &lt;a href=\"Cursed%20Depths\"&gt;Cursed Depths&lt;/a&gt; have also fallen, with undead running rampant through the block. Finally, the main cells within Baradin Hold itself have also been lost; the various methods of keeping imprisoned the dangerous demons within having had been destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after adventurers raided Baradin Hold, a clean up crew was attempting to restore Baradin Hold. &lt;a href=\"Occul%27tharon\"&gt;Occul'tharon&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the same cell as &lt;a href=\"Occu%27thar\"&gt;Occu'thar&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike with its predecessor, its guards were able to contain it with wards for a time. Unfortunately, their efforts were thwarted when the island was overrun by demonic prisoners; forcing the Wardens to once more fall back and leave the hold in ruins.\nExploring Azeroth.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; embarked on their journey to explore Azeroth as well as catalogue the locations of various artifacts, they visited the isles.\nAfter the breakout in Baradin Hold, the wardens found a notebook by one of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; mages. Shaw noted that the Wardens were still active in the area, even though control of the Hold had been lost. Instead of attempting to reclaim the prison, the Wardens have adopted the stance of killing any prisoners that attempt to leave the hold. Marcus Johnson claims he has no idea how many prisoners remain.\nReputation.\nReputation description.\n\"Once led by &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Reginald%20Baradin%20II\"&gt;Duke Reginald Baradin II&lt;/a&gt;, this fierce army has historic ties to the island stronghold of &lt;a href=\"Tol%20Barad\"&gt;Tol Barad&lt;/a&gt;.

The path leading to the instance line can be found at , on the outside of the hold's western wall next to the meeting stone.\nHistory.\nIn the past, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; controlled the prison full of monstrous creatures, including demons, until the mages were overrun. One of the worst of the inmates, the demon &lt;a href=\"Occu%27thar\"&gt;Occu'thar&lt;/a&gt;, broke of its cell and devoured all of its fellow prisoners in the west wing. Unfortunately for him, this act rendered him too large to escape. Eventually, the demon was killed, while many others remained until there was a breakout. Most demons were slain by hired swords, but some escaped.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a battle between the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raged throughout the surrounding environment, but the inside of Baradin Hold stood silent - and rightly so. Among some of the most deadly entities on Azeroth - those too dangerous to chain above ground or exile from the island - were locked inside the hold, only accessible to those who claimed control of Tol Barad.\nLegion.\nWhen the adventurers killed &lt;a href=\"Occu%27thar\"&gt;Occu'thar&lt;/a&gt; shortly after the Battle for Tol Barad, a clean-up crew was attempting to restore Baradin Hold. However, its prison was invaded by &lt;a href=\"Occul%27tharon\"&gt;Occul'tharon&lt;/a&gt; and other demons. The prison guard initially warded him but barely held it. Subsequently, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Tol Barad became lost to the inmates, with all forces in retreat. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated the Hold and slew Occul'tharon, claiming the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; (which the creature had somehow obtained while in the Twisting Nether) to be used in their rituals.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt;'s latest report said that some of the demons were still in the prison, but that there was no warden inside. &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt; kept tabs on the prison and confirmed the Hold's state to the .

He was the ruler of the prosperous and peaceful Kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; from at least 75 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt; up until his death in the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt; the year 18 BDP. His wife was Lady &lt;a href=\"Varia%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varia&lt;/a&gt;, and their only child was &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Llane Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, heir to the kingdom.\nBiography.\nThe Gnoll War.\nFor many years, the kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; prospered. However, threats soon emerged. Packs of &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s began launching raiding parties against various villages, farmsteads and convoys, and in response, Stormwind sent &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s to patrol the roads and keep the beasts in check. However, the gnolls remained a constant danger, and during the reign of King Barathen Wrynn, 75 years prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the threat spiraled out of control. &lt;a href=\"Garfang\"&gt;Garfang&lt;/a&gt;, alpha of the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20pack\"&gt;Redridge pack&lt;/a&gt;, had spent years conquering the other tribes, and under his leadership the gnolls began launching attacks on &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; itself. Thus, the &lt;a href=\"Gnoll%20War\"&gt;Gnoll War&lt;/a&gt; began. Barathen beseeched the other human kingdoms for aid, but received none, and so decided to take matters into his own hands. Taking a small party of armored knights with him, King Barathen waited for the next gnoll assault to begin. When it did, the king and his knights rode away from Stormwind and east into the &lt;a href=\"Redridge%20Mountains\"&gt;Redridge Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. As expected, Garfang had held nothing back for the attack, but did not himself accompany his forces into battle, leaving his camp exposed to attackers.\nWhen the royal party reached Garfang's camp, they battled the packlord and his personal guards for a full day and night, until Barathen himself sank his blade into the packlord's neck. Half of his knights had died, but the bold plan had paid off. Without a unified leader, the rest of the gnolls soon fell to infighting, and before long had killed too many of their own kind to continue pushing into human lands. This allowed King Barathen to rally his soldiers, launch an attack on the Redridge Mountains and decimate what remained of the hyena-like creatures. Though scattered packs remained in the far reaches of the land, the gnolls would never again be able to pose any actual threat to the kingdom. The war was over, and Barathen, known thereafter as the Adamant, was celebrated as a hero. As a result of the Gnoll War, Barathen and his people grew more isolationist, believing that they could deal with any threat on their own.\nWhen his son &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;Llane&lt;/a&gt; was born, Barathen proclaimed the day to be a time for festival for the duration of his rule, and to mark the occasion, gave each citizen of Stormwind one &lt;a href=\"gold\"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt; sovereign. When &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; fell into a coma, Barathen and the &lt;a href=\"Abbot%20of%20Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Abbot of Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; agreed to put the boy in care of the &lt;a href=\"cleric\"&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;. After he awoke from the coma during Llane's &lt;a href=\"Age%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Age of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, the awakened boy gave the prince &lt;a href=\"Medivh%27s%20hourglass\"&gt;an hourglass&lt;/a&gt; that represented the duration of King Barathen's rule.\nThe Gurubashi War.\nAround 50 years later, 21 years prior to the First War, Stormwind's farmers and settlers had begun pushing south, claiming more and more territory near the jungles of &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The conflict escalated from small skirmishes to frequent raids by troll warbands. The now elderly King Barathen dispatched his forces in a defensive manner, commanding them to intercept raiding parties but forbidding them from carrying out retaliatory strikes into Gurubashi land. Barathen had no interest in a full-scale war with the trolls, but his son Llane wished to teach the trolls a lesson, even if that meant invading troll territory. The private debates between Barathen and Llane grew heated.\nBarathen's strategy was effective for a time, but one day a troll raiding party slipped through Stormwind's patrol lines and burnt three &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; towns to the ground, barbarically killing dozens of humans. The incident became the talk of the kingdom, and Barathen met with Stormwind's lords and other nobles to discuss a response. The king was still focused on de-escalation and declared that Stormwind's armies would be bolstered but used only to strengthen their patrol routes, and that there would be no offensive against the trolls. Llane challenged him publicly, demanding the blood of Stormwind's citizens to be repaid in kind, forcing Barathen to publicly rebuke his son in order to end the protest. Llane was furious, not only for the humiliation but also for what he saw as his father's cowardice. His friend &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and many of Stormwind's soldiers felt similarly, but for the soldiers to disobey the king was unthinkable. Lothar, Llane and their friend &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; decided to launch a secret mission into Stranglethorn to quickly put an end to the Gurubashi leader, &lt;a href=\"Jok%27non\"&gt;Jok'non&lt;/a&gt;, before retreating. However, the battle with the trolls forced Medivh to unleash his full might to kill the trolls before the three men hurried back to Stormwind. While no trolls who had witnessed Jok'non's death had survived, it took little imagination for the trolls to guess who was responsible. The Gurubashi rallied under the banner of Jok'non's son, &lt;a href=\"Zan%27non\"&gt;Zan'non&lt;/a&gt;, and marched to war against Stormwind, marking the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20War\"&gt;Gurubashi War&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the trolls arrived at the walls of Stormwind City, the human soldiers trembled at their numbers. Zan'non had learned some of his father's &lt;a href=\"blood%20magic\"&gt;forbidden tricks&lt;/a&gt;, using them to transform a few Gurubashi into hulking berserkers who climbed Stormwind's walls and ripped its soldiers to pieces. The death toll on both sides mounted quickly, and old Barathen knew that it would take a miracle to break the Gurubashi siege. Thus, he mounted a desperate counterattack with his personal guards, storming directly into the hellish front lines with the intent of taking Zan'non's head. He almost succeeded, but the odds were against him. King Barathen Wrynn died on the field of battle.\nLlane mourned his father's death but knew that the city now looked to him for guidance. Stormwind's forces had fallen into disarray and all seemed lost. Llane convinced Medivh to unleash his &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; powers as he had once before, unleashing a storm of magic that killed the majority of the Gurubashi and their leaders, saving Stormwind. After the battle, Llane Wrynn succeeded his late father as King of Stormwind.\nAlternate timeline.\n&lt;a href=\"Barathen%20Wrynn%20%28film%20universe%29\"&gt;The King of Stormwind and father of Llane&lt;/a&gt; from a separate timeline appears in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20film%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft film universe&lt;/a&gt;."}

Knowing that humanity could not survive a war against the &lt;a href=\"Amani\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; if they remained divided, he declared himself the first human king, unified the scattered human &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s into the first great &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Empire of Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, and founded the capital of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;.\n2,700 years ago before the First War, the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; barbarians of &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt; enacted raids against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; who arrived on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;. Though the humans tried peace when they landed there, the Drust immediately went to war. They attacked the fledgling hamlets unprovoked, while their barbarians glorified the slaughters, attacking unarmed civilians. These raids lasted several years until &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;an open war&lt;/a&gt; broke out between the two races for control of the region.\nOn both &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and Azeroth, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s have been considered a barbaric race. The introduction of the &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;demon blood&lt;/a&gt; into their bodies made the orcs even more ruthless and barbaric. After being raised by humans, &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; saw the customs of his own kind as barbaric, and described &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; as a barbaric place for any human who would see it.\nIn the RPG.\nThe barbarian is a ferocious warrior. He is uncivilized and brutal, relying on instincts, anger, and raw physical might instead of tactics or fancy swordsmanship. His &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; is frightening to behold, and it allows him to smash apart his enemies while ignoring all but the most brutal blows. He has a connection with nature's primal elements; this class is most commonly found among races that dwell in the wild. They are the wild warriors of the steppes and wastes, they are the brutal &lt;a href=\"berserker\"&gt;berserker&lt;/a&gt;s and axe wielders of the orcs and the frightening, tattooed warriors of feral dwarven clans and human outcasts.\nBarbarians by race.\n&lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s have a strong history of favoring barbarians as fighters. The class' focus on anger suits the orcs well, especially when their demonic &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Fury\"&gt;bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; overtakes them. Since the orcs have thrown off the shackles of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, this class is becoming less common among them, but it is still a noble and respected path. Trolls live in the wilds, and their strongest fighters are barbarians.\nThis class is less common among other races. Individuals who live far from civilization and those who allow their fury to guide them often become barbarians. &lt;a href=\"Tauren\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; are somewhat likely to become barbarians, as these races have close ties with Azeroth's wilderness. Barbarians are commonly seen among savage humanoids, such as &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s. Some humans and half-orcs may have adopted a barbaric lifestyle on Kalimdor.\nTroll barbarians.\nThe standard image of a barbarian is some bloodthirsty crazy, probably an orc, shouting out incomprehensible threats and laying about him with a massive axe, while blood flies everywhere. Troll barbarians, however, devote their rage and strength to ranged weapons, flinging axes into their enemies with unerring speed. Perhaps the trolls' spirits look favorably on these warriors and enhance their abilities, for troll barbarians draw the magic of their weapons into their bodies and are able to impart it to other weapons. The iconic troll barbarian lopes out of the trees, his face painted in fierce tribal colors, his hair standing on end. He grips an axe or spear in each hand. \"Say hello to my little friend!\".\nWildhammer barbarians.\nWildhammer dwarves are renowned for wild behavior and deadly skill at arms. They have a tendency to enter a fray armored with little more than a loincloth and body paint, and still come out covered only with the blood of their foes. They are fierce charging across the ground or when soaring atop gryphons; barbarians of other races seek to emulate Wildhammer dwarves' reckless ability to stay alive through sheer pluck while laying waste to their enemies. The iconic Wildhammer barbarian clutches his hammer and grins, showing gaps in his teeth. Feathers and beads are stuck in his sweaty hair and beard. \"Come get some!\" he shouts, before letting out a howl and charging forward.\nEx-barbarian.\nEx-barbarians are former barbarians. Barbarians have wild spirits. They tend toward &lt;a href=\"chaotic\"&gt;chaotic&lt;/a&gt; alignments and they cannot be &lt;a href=\"lawful\"&gt;lawful&lt;/a&gt;. A barbarian who becomes lawful loses his ability to rage and cannot train further as a barbarian. He retains all the other benefits of the class (reduced damage, faster movement, able to sense traps, and an uncanny ability to dodge).\nNote: An ex-barbarian is not so much a true variant or class, but a penalized barbarian (blocked from his ability to rage).

Screenshots showed a new Fret Bar interface (resembling that of the \"\" games) powering the Bard's \"Groove\" resource system.

Utilizing a new resource system known as \"groove\", the player will be able to perform abilities and launch a Fret Bar in order to perform riffs with a guitar-based keyboard peripheral. Performing riffs will build \"groove\", allowing them to unleash more powerful abilities and effects. The Bard is able to front in a number of roles as varied as his musical repertoire, and excels both as a solo performer and as part of a solid group lineup.\nRaces.\nA complete list of playable races has yet to be confirmed, though it may be possible for all races to become a Bard, as it is possible for all races to rock out. To date, confirmed races are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;.\nLore.\nThe deeds of every great hero inspire countless songs of triumph, virtue, and epic adventure.

Because of this, a mounted warrior often leads a second mount to carry gear and supplies.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nIn &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, the first appearance of barding occured in &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s for obtaining the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Paladin\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"charger\"&gt;charger&lt;/a&gt;.\nThese quests have since been removed from the game. \nLater, during subsequent ventures into the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers have been able to equip various bardings developed by &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworkers&lt;/a&gt; to allow them to gather crafting materials without having to dismount.\nIn addition, a piece of &lt;a href=\"mount%20equipment\"&gt;mount equipment&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Comfortable%20Rider%27s%20Barding\"&gt;Comfortable Rider's Barding&lt;/a&gt; serves to prevent the rider from being dazed while riding their mount; this equipment does not work in &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arenas&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Battleground\"&gt;Battlegrounds&lt;/a&gt;.

He disappeared off the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Coast\"&gt;Frozen Coast&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and a statue was erected in his honor in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Champions\"&gt;Hall of Champions&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Westwind seemingly returned to lead the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;. In reality, however, he was dead, his corpse being used as a disguise for the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Mal'Ganis began whispering to &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;High General Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Abbot%20Landgren\"&gt;High Abbot Landgren&lt;/a&gt;, posing as the voice of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself, and guided them into creating the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; and sailing to the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; in Northrend. One month into the construction of &lt;a href=\"New%20Hearthglen\"&gt;New Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;, Landgren proclaimed that the Light was going to send the Onslaught a visitor to lead them to victory. Shortly after, Mal'Ganis assumed Barean Westwind's appearance and sought out Abbendis. Abbendis had heard that Westwind had died in Northrend years prior and noted that the \"admiral\" looked younger than he should, but was nonetheless convinced when he claimed to have survived the destruction of his fleet through the grace of the Light. Although \"Westwind\" claimed that he didn't intend to replace Abbendis, he effectively undermined her authority and took over command of the Onslaught.\nWestwind warned Abbendis about the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s upcoming invasion of Northrend, and created the sect of &lt;a href=\"raven%20priest\"&gt;raven priest&lt;/a&gt;s by passing on a \"blessing\" from the Light to High Abbot Landgren. Abbendis felt that something wasn't right about the admiral, but dismissed the feeling and resolved to stay faithful, even though the \"Light\" had stopped speaking to her in conjunction with the admiral's arrival. Shortly after the Alliance and Horde's arrival to the Dragonblight, Westwind ordered some Onslaught men to begin building a new base, &lt;a href=\"Onslaught%20Harbor\"&gt;Onslaught Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of the Alliance and Horde entered New Hearthglen's cathedral to kill Abbendis, Westwind stood by, protected by a magic shield, and watched them to kill her. He commented that Abbendis had \"served her purpose\", told the heroes that they'd see each other in Icecrown, and then teleported away. &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Wroth\"&gt;High Executor Wroth&lt;/a&gt; were both concerned by the admiral's escape but decided that he'd have to be dealt with later.\nWestwind retreated to Onslaught Harbor and holed himself up in the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20Hollow\"&gt;Hidden Hollow&lt;/a&gt; to prepare for the final battle against the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. After adventurers discovered the admiral's whereabouts, &lt;a href=\"Lord-Commander%20Arete\"&gt;Lord-Commander Arete&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; gave them &lt;a href=\"Lord-Commander%27s%20Nullifier\"&gt;a device&lt;/a&gt; to nullify Westwind's magic shield, then sent them to the Hidden Hollow to kill him. During the battle, Westwind shed his disguise and revealed his true identity as Mal'Ganis, who upon defeat escaped through a portal to \"&lt;a href=\"Nathreza\"&gt;the homeworld&lt;/a&gt;\".\nSpeculation.\nSince the admiral was from Kul Tiras, &lt;a href=\"Westwind%20Weald\"&gt;Westwind Weald&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; may be named after him or his family or vice-versa."}
