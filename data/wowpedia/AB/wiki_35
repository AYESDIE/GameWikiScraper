He owned books with star maps of constellations of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the homeworld of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. One of these books described three Draenic constellations: the Staff, the Tome, and the Seer. The book noted that once every five hundred and forty-seven years, a celestial event involved these three constellations and more, with a comet streaking through the Staff and one of Draenor's &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt;s being full right in the middle of the Seer. The novel didn't specify who wrote these books, though they seemed to be written as a first-hand account.\nCoincidentally, this celestial event matched up to three artifacts from Azeroth: the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; (the Staff), the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; (the Seer), and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; (the Tome). When &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; combined the three corresponding artifacts with the magical energies released during the event, he was able to &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;open up&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s to other worlds.\nThere was also another constellation that didn't appear in the books &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; had taken from &lt;a href=\"Karazhan\"&gt;Karazhan&lt;/a&gt;, and that he had personally dubbed \"Turalyon's Hammer\" in honor of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;his friend&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeer Kazal.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Shadowmoon orcs&lt;/a&gt; have a long history of spirituality and astrology. , who gave related quests during &lt;a href=\"Bonus%20Event\"&gt;Bonus Event&lt;/a&gt;s prior to \"&lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;\", describes various stars with special meanings and effects.\nConstellation statues.\nWithin the halls of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; a few constellations can be found, they are similar in appearance to Algalon:\nCreatures.\nThere are beings that resemble constellations and are often qualified as \"celestial\":\nItems.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\" a few items appear to be some kind of solid constellation."}

Shamans can drop it to take aggro from nearby mobs and occasionally stun them. It also protects all other totems by placing a protective shield on them. Combined with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Stoneclaw%20Totem\"&gt;Glyph of Stoneclaw Totem&lt;/a&gt;, this totem plays an important role in PvP.\nThe totem is sometimes affectionately referred to as the \"Angry Stick\".\nTalents.\nTalents that can improve the totem:\nFunctionality.\nThis totem is used to draw &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; from nearby mobs. However, the totem does not produce any damage to nearby mobs and enemy players - instead it pulses a weak &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; (weaker than taunting abilities) every 2 seconds. Since the totem lacks any damage output, it is very easy for any player to &lt;a href=\"peeling\"&gt;peel&lt;/a&gt; a mob from the totem with only using his/her auto-attack, and it is highly unlikely that the totem will regain aggro on its own. Thus, this totem is ill-suited for any type of aggro management during combat. Foolish shaman players never use this totem since they think it does not affect greatly the player's gameplay in different situations, however when you get an extra unexpected addition when fighting this totem is a reasonably form of temporary crowd control, providing a weak \"offtank\".\nSome shaman players, however, do use this totem skillfully. Since it still has a weak &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"threat\"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt;, it can still peel away the initial &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; from a mob that has not been engaged by any player. Also, the caster has to take into consideration that once the totem is destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;(s) (like any other totem) they will instantly pursue the caster, unless the caster is out of their pursuit range before the totem dies.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%202.0.1\"&gt;patch 2.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, Stoneclaw was given a 50% chance of afflicting whatever hits it with a &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;. The stun is initially a 3 second stun, but is affected by &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt;. The hit points of the totem were not increased with the patch, nor the duration, so it is unlikely that the totem survives long enough to make a target immune to further stuns. It should be noted, however, that Stoneclaw Effect shares a stun type with other stuns, so any stuns inflicted by the totem may limit other &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; abilities substantially."}

The entrance is at on the west side of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt;, 2/3 to the top. Queuing for Stonecore through the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; requires an average item level of 272 and to discover the entrance.\nHistory.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Within the Temple of Earth, locked in the heart of Deepholm, lies the Stonecore. It was inside these caverns that the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; toiled over &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, hammering &lt;a href=\"elementium\"&gt;elementium&lt;/a&gt; plates to the Dragon Aspect's body in an attempt to hold his tormented form together. With his renewal complete, Deathwing ascended into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, shattering the &lt;a href=\"World%20Pillar\"&gt;World Pillar&lt;/a&gt; and destabilizing the region of Deepholm.\"\nDescription from site.\nAlthough the corrupted Dragon Aspect is now gone, his fanatical Twilight's Hammer followers are still entrenched within the deepest recesses of the Stonecore. For these zealous worshippers, the point of Deathwing's ascent is sacred ground, and they would gladly give their lives to preserve its sanctity.\n&lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; have recently arrived in Deepholm to mend the broken World Pillar, but their efforts have come under attack by a host of malevolent forces, not the least of which is the Twilight's Hammer. As &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; heroes struggle to aid the shaman, the Stonecore has become a demoralizing symbol of the grim hold that Deathwing's followers still have on Deepholm.\nAside from the presence of Twilight's Hammer cultists, details concerning the Stonecore are scarce. The few explorers who have braved the Temple of Earth's inner sanctum tell of jagged, erratic passageways\u2014the work of some yet-unseen elemental beasts\u2014twisting throughout the area and, more times than not, leading to dead ends. Most troubling of all are reports of a monstrous &lt;a href=\"stone%20wyrm\"&gt;stone wyrm&lt;/a&gt; lurking in the shadows of the subterranean region. Beyond that, whatever guards the site of Deathwing's ascendance in the deepest caverns of the Stonecore is a mystery.\nWhether or not the Stonecore's native elemental creatures are under the sway of the Twilight's Hammer is unknown. There is no doubt, however, that they will view intruders with hostility. Unless the subterranean lair is cleansed, the efforts of the Earthen Ring and other benevolent forces in Deepholm will be meaningless. As long as the Twilight's Hammer retains its hold over the Temple of Earth, the entire region will remain covered in Deathwing's lingering shadow.\" \nGeography.\nThe Stonecore is located in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt; at the west side of of the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Earth\"&gt;Temple of Earth&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance is about two-thirds of the way up the central pillar. There's a distinct landing platform once you get to that level or higher. \nDungeon denizens.\nEncounters.\nThe first few pulls of the instance involve &lt;a href=\"Millhouse%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millhouse Manastorm&lt;/a&gt; with a group of 3-5 other adds. He retreats to the n pack once his HP gets low. These pulls are a bit of a gear/ability check, as they are arguably harder than the first two bosses.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

They are led by &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; was stolen by Dargrul, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodtotem tribe&lt;/a&gt;, the most aggressive and cruel of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, went on the offensive against the Stonedark, capturing several members of the tribe despite them not being affiliated with Dargrul. Navarrogg himself was locked in a cage at &lt;a href=\"Cliff%27s%20Edge\"&gt;Cliff's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, where he managed to warn the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; about something terrible the Bloodtotem were about to commit before vanishing. When the adventurer saw Navarrogg again, he was being held in the &lt;a href=\"Cave%20of%20the%20Blood%20Trial\"&gt;Cave of the Blood Trial&lt;/a&gt;, where he aided the adventurer when the Bloodtotem revealed their alliance with the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; and transformed into corrupted Feltotem tauren. Together, Navarrogg and the adventurer fought off the Feltotem, fighting their way through &lt;a href=\"Torok%27s%20Bluff\"&gt;Torok's Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and slaying the Bloodtotem chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Torok%20Bloodtotem\"&gt;Torok&lt;/a&gt;, before returning to Stonedark Grotto.\nIn gratitude for being saved by the adventurer, Navarrogg then journeys to the Highmountain capital of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt; to declare his allegiance for the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20Tribe\"&gt;Highmountain Tribe&lt;/a&gt;. The Stonedark later join the Highmountain, &lt;a href=\"Rivermane%20tribe\"&gt;Rivermane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Skyhorn%20tribe\"&gt;Skyhorn&lt;/a&gt; forces in the battle for &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt;, where Dargrul sent his forces to destroy a tauren village.\nSometime following the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Highmountain tauren joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. Though the Stonedark did declare allegiance to Highmountain, it is unknown if they followed suit in joining the Horde.\nCulture.\nThe Stonedark appear to place great value in personal strength, revering the legendary weightlifter &lt;a href=\"Liftbrul\"&gt;Liftbrul&lt;/a&gt; as a champion of their tribe and, on at least one occasion, requiring outsiders to prove their weightlifting abilities before discussing matters with them further. The Stonedark have three sacred relics \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Resistance\"&gt;Chains of Resistance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Rod%20of%20Bearing\"&gt;Rod of Bearing&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Wheel%20of%20Fortitude\"&gt;Wheel of Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which they have possessed for generations, but which were recently stolen by the &lt;a href=\"Deepcavern%20Murloc\"&gt;Deepcavern murlocs&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately after the relics are retrieved, a group of Stonedark begin using them as weightlifting equipment.\nWhile the Stonedark are no match for Dargrul's fighters in open combat, they do have other ways to help defeat their enemies. They are skilled in earth-based magic: &lt;a href=\"Navarrogg\"&gt;Navarrogg&lt;/a&gt;, whose powers over the earth are enhanced while he is in the possession of the &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20Focus\"&gt;Stonedark Focus&lt;/a&gt;, raises small creatures born of the earth help defend himself and his people; while they are not terribly bright, the tiny &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s are loyal in their way."}

At least we have a little time until the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; finishes their gathering efforts. After that it will all be shipped to &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Hold\"&gt;Cenarion Hold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, and the war will likely follow not long after.\nAll of the preperations are complete now, &lt;class&gt;. We await the last of the materiel to be sent to Silithus, which should be in less than 5 day's time. Then once the organization there is done with, someone will have to come forward and ring the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;gong&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Dais\"&gt;Scarab Dais&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"%3Athe%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;:the Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;.

Then the guild was contracted by the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, which had been razed by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. It was a massive project which required a small army of &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"artisan\"&gt;artisan&lt;/a&gt;s. They restored Stormwind to its former majesty, and their skill and distinctive style are evident in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; and in the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, a few nobles supported them, such as &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Ellerian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Queen Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Count%20Erlgadin\"&gt;Count Erlgadin&lt;/a&gt;, who lobbied to improve the working conditions for the stonemasons during the restoration of the kingdom.\nHowever, while the stonemasons spent years toiling to rebuild the glorious city, they were left broke, their fees and salaries left unpaid and unspoken for, as they were forgotten by the city's officials. When the time of the rightful payment came, the nobles of Stormwind couldn't because they ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, and the massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy. In the shadow, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt; manipulated both sides with the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; - her meddling in the rebuilding of Stormwind left the nobility unsatisfied with the craftsmanship of the guild, while the workers were enraged that the nobility despised them and were threatening to withhold payment. &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; was unable to negotiate a resolution that appeased both parties. While he agreed that the Stonemasons' fees were excessive, he felt the amount offered by the nobles was too stingy, and began to suspect Lady Prestor.\nWhen Edwin VanCleef spoke out, demanding restitution for their works, the House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, and it turned into a heated dispute, which resulted in riots that led to the murder of Queen Tiffin, a projectile killing her instantly while she tried to calm down the rioting stonemasons. In response, King Wrynn vowed to punish those responsible and dealt with the rioters more severely. The Stonemasons, fleeing the city, hid in the rural areas of Westfall to escape prosecution. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding. From the shadows, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; continued to stoke their rage by using her influence to cut off supplies and support to the region. They later became the terrorist organization known as the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, and turned to &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;ry and murder to recover the gold owed to them. Under Edwin VanCleef's reign, the Defias were determined to destroy the corrupted House of Nobles and Stormwind City with it.\nDecades later, after being crowned, &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; offered pardons and reparations for the former Stonemasons and their families. As King Varian died against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, it became harder to carry on old grudges, and the young king's reforms allowed more aid and resources to arrive at &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, which caused the spark of revolution to fade. Consequently, the majority of the former Stonemasons decided to left the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, returning to live in the kingdom they once rebuilt."}

Seeking to bolster her forces Sylvanas successfully had their leader &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt; possessed by a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; and thus the clan declared their allegiance to Sylvanas.\nWhile the Stonemaul in Lordaeron fought against the enemies of the Dark Lady, the branch of the clan in Kalimdor fell under the control of &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt;, who had come into possession of the ancient orcish axe, &lt;a href=\"Serathil%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Serathil&lt;/a&gt;. Kor'gall's rule was brutal and merciless, and &lt;a href=\"Crol%27ka\"&gt;one ogre&lt;/a&gt;, whose brothers were killed by Kor'gall, knew that he was leading the clan to ruin. He barely escaped with his life and sought any help he could. His quest would lead to him asking the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for help.\nKor'gall was soon approached by &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Nathal\"&gt;Mok'Nathal&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde. Rexxar demanded to join the clan, and Kor'gall agreed, but only if he were to pass through the Gauntlet, a valley full of many beasts and thus completing the Trial of Strength. Rexxar and his friends survived the Gauntlet, and Kor'gall was impressed and allowed Rexxar to join. Rexxar's first request was to aid the Horde, but Kor'gall had no intention of ever honoring their former allies again. Frustrated, Rexxar exercised his right to challenge Kor'gall for the leadership of the clan. Kor'gall decided to entertain the request but warned that he was not as slow-witted as Rexxar first guessed.\nThough it took several tries, Rexxar finally beat Kor'gall and slew him in the Trial of Blood. As Kor'gall died, the last words on his ears were his men cheering for Rexxar. With his death, Rexxar assumed the position of chieftain. He then led the Stonemaul ogres back to &lt;a href=\"Tidefury%20Cove\"&gt;Tidefury Cove&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; was assembling the Horde. Thrall sent his soldiers and the Stonemaul ogres to &lt;a href=\"Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; to keep Proudmoore's forces at bay while Rexxar and his few companions wove through the battle to face off against Proudmoore and his most loyal retainers. In the end, Rexxar and Proudmoore squared off in mortal combat, and Rexxar emerged victorious.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAfter the battle, Rexxar disappeared into the Barren wilderness and made the ogre &lt;a href=\"Mok%27Morokk\"&gt;Mok'Morokk&lt;/a&gt; the leader of the clan. Although Mok'Morokk had displayed strength when Rexxar was their leader, he soon fell prey to temptations of power after Rexxar's departure. Rather than lead, he demanded. He did not serve his people, as he expected them to serve him.\nWhile the Kalimdor branch of the clan endured Mok'Morokk's leadership, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; would send &lt;a href=\"Mug%27thol\"&gt;Mug'thol&lt;/a&gt; and his ogres to retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Will\"&gt;Crown of Will&lt;/a&gt;. However, instead of bringing the crown to Sylvanas, he decided to try it on. The Crown of Will subsequently enabled him to free himself from the banshee's possession and he defected, establishing himself and his band of ogres in the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Alterac\"&gt;Ruins of Alterac&lt;/a&gt; as the &lt;a href=\"Crushridge\"&gt;Crushridge&lt;/a&gt; ogres.\nIn time &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Village\"&gt;Stonemaul Village&lt;/a&gt; was raided by &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s brood.

While &lt;a href=\"Brogg\"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; expected that the ogres would take an action against the dragons, no counterattack happened. He ruled until an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde drove him out and he fled. The clan now seeks a new leader. &lt;a href=\"Draz%27Zilb\"&gt;Draz'Zilb&lt;/a&gt; who orchestrated the attack hinted that &lt;a href=\"Tharg\"&gt;Tharg&lt;/a&gt; could be a leader but is hindered by his injuries and age.\nCataclysm.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Stonemaul clan has expanded into &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; and set up a base of operations in western Feralas, near &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt;, called &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Hold\"&gt;Stonemaul Hold&lt;/a&gt;. The Stonemaul are helping the Horde in dealing with the local population of hostile ogres, the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; and their Gordok class, in the region under the command of &lt;a href=\"Orhan%20Ogreblade\"&gt;Orhan Ogreblade&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nThe Stonemaul clan from Brackenwall joined &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s forces in the &lt;a href=\"Attack%20on%20Theramore%20Isle\"&gt;Attack on Theramore Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war%23Invasion%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria's Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the Stonemaul within &lt;a href=\"Brackenwall%20Village\"&gt;Brackenwall Village&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Or%27Dac\"&gt;Or'Dac&lt;/a&gt; as an emissary to support the &lt;a href=\"Domination%20Point\"&gt;Horde's influence&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; reported that the Stonemauls are doing well, even growing their holdings into Feralas at Stonemaul Hold.\nIn the RPG.\nMost ogres are savage and evil, as unruly as any forest troll. However, the Stonemaul clan defies this mold, and exists in a lawful and semi-democratic society. They perform trials to decide anything from a new leader to going to war, and have willingly joined the Horde. Unlike the wild and uncontrollable clans elsewhere on Azeroth, the Stonemaul ogres are tightly organized, following a specific hierarchy of power.\nWhen Rexxar departed and appointed Mok'Morokk as chieftain, Onyxia laid waste to their home. In the meantime, Draz'Zilb uses the clan's few remaining resources to investigate why Onyxia attacked them in the first place. The bottom line here is that the Stonemaul clan is no longer in any condition to support the Horde on the battlefield. A number of ogres survived Onyxia's attacks, but they are disorganized and fight among themselves.\nStonemaul ogres have no chieftain at the moment, and a consensus of the eldest ogres of the clan makes most of the Stonemauls' decisions, along with words of advice from Horde emissaries and counselors."}

After their deaths and arrival in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the Stonemaul joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; by the will of &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Stonemaul were ruled by , and in league with the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They attacked the &lt;a href=\"Overlook%20Ruins\"&gt;Overlook Ruins&lt;/a&gt; but failed and were killed.\nThey were known to have captured displayed &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; and forced the likes of &lt;a href=\"Gladiator%20Akaani\"&gt;Gladiator Akaani&lt;/a&gt; and into fighting in their arena. In time, Akaani and Kash'drakor were able to escape but were forced to leave the others behind and were unable to mount a proper rescue attempt in fear that their allies and family would be instantly killed if they were recognized. Meanwhile, the Stonemaul were not content to let them go and sent their hardened slave hunters after them. However, they were approached by the &lt;a href=\"garrison\"&gt;garrison&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Commander&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed to aid them in their fight against the Stonemaul.\nLearning that the slave hunters kept pendants magically tethered to the slaves, which allowed them to track them wherever they were and possibly killed them, the Commander retrieved said pendants. The commander also liberated Kash'drakor's son , &lt;a href=\"Pitfighter%20Vaandaam\"&gt;Pitfighter Vaandaam&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Y%27kish\"&gt;Y'kish&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bruto\"&gt;Bruto&lt;/a&gt;, and killed &lt;a href=\"Slavemaster%20Ok%27mok\"&gt;Slavemaster Ok'mok&lt;/a&gt;. In the aftermath, Nazgrel reunited with his father, while the Commander, Vaandaam, Y'kish, and Bruto confronted and killed the Stonemaul Chieftain Kor'gall.\nDuring this conflict, &lt;a href=\"Prowler%20Sasha\"&gt;Prowler Sasha&lt;/a&gt;, recruited the Commander in killing even more Stonemaul in order to acquire &lt;a href=\"Ogre%20Tooth\"&gt;their teeth&lt;/a&gt; for his necklace.\nWith the Stonemaul defeated, the gladiators joined the Commander in their fight against the Iron Horde.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nIn the years following the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat on the Stonemaul would be subdued by the under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; . However every so often, one of their members would stir the embers of rebellion until the Mag'har got them back in line. By the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20between%20the%20Lightbound%20and%20the%20Mag%27har\"&gt;war between the Lightbound and the Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; the Stonemaul were led by &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%2C%20Greatson%20of%20Kor%27gall\"&gt;Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall&lt;/a&gt;. Unbeknownst to the Mag'har Kor'gall secretly defected to the &lt;a href=\"Lightbound\"&gt;Lightbound&lt;/a&gt; and called on the Stonemaul to rise up against the Mag'har.\nSometime during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the alternate Draenor to recruit the Mag'har orc clans that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; saved from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling and the Legion's corruption. With the aid of a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Horde champion&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg was able to establish a connection between Azeroth and Draenor through the use of the shard of the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Time\"&gt;Vision of Time&lt;/a&gt; in his possession. Upon arriving in Draenor, the pair was taken prisoner by the Mag'har. However, the pair was released after Warchief Hellscream recognized them as coming from Azeroth.\nUpon receiving word of Kor'gall's uprising, Hellscream instructed &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Geya%27rah\"&gt;Overlord Geya'rah&lt;/a&gt;, Eitrigg, and the champion with putting the threat down. Upon arriving at the &lt;a href=\"Stonemaul%20Arena\"&gt;Stonemaul Arena&lt;/a&gt;, the three discovered Kor'gall's call to arms had split the clan with the Stonemaul remaining loyal to the Mag'har and the rebels themselves calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27gall%20clan\"&gt;Kor'gall clan&lt;/a&gt;. In the end, the rebellion was put down with the death of Kor'gall, Greatson of Kor'gall who revealed his allegiance to the Lightbound before his end.\nUpon learning that the entire Lightbound army was en route to Beastwatch, the Horde and Mag'har held the line against them while other Mag'har and the Stonemaul were gathered by . During the battle, &lt;a href=\"Yrel\"&gt;High Exarch Yrel&lt;/a&gt; herself appeared on the battlefield and offered the Mag'har one last chance to embrace the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. As Warchief Hellscream and Lantresor charged against the Lightbound, Eitrigg activated the shard of the Vision of Time in his possession in order to return to Azeroth. After arriving to Azeroth, the Mag'har's new leader, Overlord Geya'rah pledged the Mag'har's loyalty to the Horde."}

It starts on the (earthly) northern summer and lasts about two weeks (June 21 - July 4). It is similar to the &lt;a href=\"Lunar%20Festival\"&gt;Lunar Festival&lt;/a&gt; and other holidays, featuring some useful buffs, food, and toys to play with.\nThe ending of the Festival seems to have been merged with the &lt;a href=\"Engineers%27%20Explosive%20Extravaganza\"&gt;Engineers' Explosive Extravaganza&lt;/a&gt; holiday:\nIt is an important tradition in Kalimdor a beyond, dating back centuries. Guardians of the bonfires are chosen each year to watch over the sacred flames and ensure they never go out.\nItems and redemption.\n28 items can be purchased in exchange for at &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Supplier\"&gt;Midsummer Supplier&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Midsummer%20Merchant\"&gt;Midsummer Merchant&lt;/a&gt;s in capital cities. Daily quests award 20, and individual bonfires out in the world can be interacted once per holiday for 5-15 each. Furthermore, kill &lt;a href=\"Ahune\"&gt;Ahune&lt;/a&gt; once-daily in the special \"The Frost Lord Ahune\" &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;dungeon finder&lt;/a&gt; instance to pick up another 5-15 from the &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20of%20Chilled%20Goods\"&gt;Satchel of Chilled Goods&lt;/a&gt;. \nTo purchase all cosmetics, toys and pets from the vendor would cost .\nAdditional items are available:\nKilling &lt;a href=\"Ahune\"&gt;Ahune&lt;/a&gt; rewards the &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20of%20Chilled%20Goods\"&gt;Satchel of Chilled Goods&lt;/a&gt; which has a chance to drop any of the following items:\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blossom\"&gt;Burning Blossom&lt;/a&gt; can be earned through a variety of quests. The blossoms can be consumed for a small buff or used as currency for a variety of items including the &lt;a href=\"Brazier%20of%20Dancing%20Flames\"&gt;Brazier of Dancing Flames&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Flame\"&gt;Captured Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nDaily quests:\nLord Ahune.\nTo gain access to the holiday boss, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Ahune\"&gt;Lord Ahune&lt;/a&gt;, you must first complete a chain of quests beginning at an &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring%20Elder\"&gt;Earthen Ring Elder&lt;/a&gt; near the flame in a friendly capital city.\nPlayers are then given access to Ahune if level 89 or higher, and a daily quest is made available based on their level:\nBonfires.\nThe s and s at each of your own faction's bonfires offers you &lt;a href=\"Honor%20the%20Flame\"&gt;Honor the Flame&lt;/a&gt;.\nRight-clicking a bonfire of the opposite faction offers &lt;a href=\"Desecrate%20this%20Fire%21\"&gt;Desecrate this Fire!&lt;/a&gt;. The act of dousing a bonfire does not pull guards (though they will aggro as normal based on range and level - &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; requires a flying mount or stealth to avoid aggro), making this a fast and easy way to generate money and Burning Blossoms. Be warned that dousing the opposite faction's bonfire will flag you for &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; combat, even with &lt;a href=\"War%20Mode\"&gt;War Mode&lt;/a&gt; off.\nThe bonfires of capital cities have separate quests and you cannot Honor the Flame of your own faction's Capitals.\nThere are a grand total of 128 bonfires across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and : 16 Neutral, 51 Horde, 52 Alliance, and a total of 8 cities (4 for each faction).\nStealing the Cities' Flames.\nEach faction can loot the Flames of the opposing faction's cities, each of which starts a quest. Stealing all four cities' flames will offer the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Thief%27s%20Reward\"&gt;A Thief's Reward&lt;/a&gt;. \nHorde\nAlliance\nReward: &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20the%20Fire%20Festival\"&gt;Crown of the Fire Festival&lt;/a&gt; (no bonuses).\nTrivia.\nWhen the Midsummer event started in year 2009, flags for completion of the quests in 2008 had not been reset, preventing those who had completed one-time quests in 2008 from getting those quests and gathering Burning Blossoms. Further, characters above level 70 did not have a version of the quest &lt;a href=\"Striking%20Back\"&gt;Striking Back&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis fix allowed anyone who had already completed any bonfire quests in 2009 before the fix was applied to gather more Blossoms that year than are usually available. Completed achievements were not revoked, but partially completed ones lost all progress. The &lt;a href=\"Striking%20Back%20%28Hellfire%20Peninsula%29\"&gt;Striking Back (Hellfire Peninsula)&lt;/a&gt; quest for 67-70 characters was extended to 67-80, once again allowing 20 Blossoms per day from daily quests.\nWhile the initial patch was to have reset all event quests, it proved incomplete in many cases. Many reported being unable to complete the \"city flames\" quests for Exodar and Silvermoon despite being able to repeat those for other cities. At least one realm was not reset properly the first time, and further issues were found. A number of players have continued to have problems with the Exodar and Silvermoon city flame quests."}

They recorded the events of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; in \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Annals%20of%20the%20Great%20Alliance\"&gt;The Annals of the Great Alliance&lt;/a&gt;\". They had been given the supreme honor of inscribing the Annals in preparation for the impending invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;. It was the first time in long history that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Great Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; brought together &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s under the same banner to remove their common enemy from the face of the world. When Milan started on the Annals they did not know if they would describe the Alliance's victory or defeat, but it was his hope that the Alliance's descendants would read and learn from the pages, whatever the outcome. For that reason, Milan concentrated on the military aspects of the Alliance endeavors, so that future leaders could study and expand on them in the event of the Alliance's demise. They believed the preservation of knowledge was of paramount importance, as the Horde had come to destroy all they had learned and all they loved about their lands. They swore a great oath to protect the words with their life and to pass the knowledge on to all who would gain the smallest wisdom from it.\nBackground.\nMilan's first action after writing the foreword to the Annals was to travel to &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt; to record the maps, orders, and tactics of the Alliance's most promising human commander there, and they hoped the &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt;s favored the Alliance. This position gave Milan firsthand experience of several battles throughout the course of the war.\nUltimately, Milan witnessed the fall of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; and the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Great Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and witnessed the weeks of celebrations worldwide.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Milan%27s%20Mastercraft%20Band\"&gt;Milan's Mastercraft Band&lt;/a&gt; might have belonged to them."}

Though the duo's relationship started off rocky, their trials and tribulations during the course of their adventure has made them good friends.

Drunk Miles told him about his quest with Kova. Eventually, Miles accompanied Kova through the desert of &lt;a href=\"Tanaris\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;, commenting its wildlife. Finally, they entered the &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; and met &lt;a href=\"Williden%20Marshal\"&gt;Williden Marshal&lt;/a&gt; who told them that the orc passed through his camp and headed south. Williden also warned them before Un'Goro's animals, especially &lt;a href=\"King%20Mosh\"&gt;King Mosh&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually they got to &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Plume%20Ridge\"&gt;Fire Plume Ridge&lt;/a&gt; where they noticed a cave. As they were about to enter, Bellthazor caught Miles. However, Miles was able to free himself from his grasp and the human escaped. Atop of the ridge they found the cave and Dhambeela in it. As they left the ridge, they were attacked by both, King Mosh and Bellthazor. While Mosh hit and stunned Miles, Bellthazor kidnapped Dhambeela. Kova tried to use her shamanistic power against Mosh, but the beast overwhelmed her almost killing her as Miles drank one of Kova's potion and attacked the beast. The beast fell and was stunned. Eventually they found Dhambeela smiling at them as Bellthazor was no match for her.\nThey returned to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and Kova thanked Miles for saving her life. Miles told her that his song needs some modifications. He was last seen singing \"The song of Miles Corebender and Kova Broadhorn\" to a gathering crowd during the &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Faire\"&gt;Darkmoon Faire&lt;/a&gt; at the base of Thunder Bluff."}

Though the peasants are capable of saving their towns from surprise attacks on their towns, they are always glad to give up their weapons and go back to their regular duties.\nIn terms of fighting potential, militiamen are a step up from &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 they have answered a call to arms and have gathered in the &lt;a href=\"town%20hall\"&gt;town hall&lt;/a&gt;, where they received armor and weapons. Beneath the leather and steel, however, they are still the same untrained &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s and laborers. Peasants become militia only when their commanders are desperate.\nAt first glance you take the man for a warrior, standing in his armor and hefting his sword. Then you notice how poorly the armor fits him, and how awkwardly he carries his battered blade. A cloak covers his shoulders, but his head is bare; the expression on his face, more fear than anything else, confirms your suspicions. This man is no soldier.\nPeasants sometimes receive rudimentary military training, and with some armor over their bodies and a weapon in their hands, some of them even remember it. Militiamen still charge but stop a pace or two away in order to attack. Most of them realize just how little their armor truly protects them and still run away when faced with a clearly superior foe."}
{"id": "228012", "revid": "1487011", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=228012", "title": "Militia (Warcraft III)", "text": "The workers of the Human &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; can be converted into Militia when the need arises. You can transform &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peasant&lt;/a&gt;s individually by clicking on the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Call%20to%20Arms\"&gt;Call to Arms&lt;/a&gt; icon on each Peasant's command card or convert them en masse by ringing the Call to Arms bell at your &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;. Peasants will then rally to the Town Hall, where they don armor and wield axes to fight invaders. After a set amount of time, Militia will revert back to Peasants, or you can prematurely end their military tenure at the Town Hall with the Back to Work bell.\nInformation.\nMilitia are created by Peasants arming themselves at their &lt;a href=\"Town%20Hall%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Town Hall&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Keep%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Keep&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Castle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Castle&lt;/a&gt;. For expansion Town Halls, it must be upgraded into a Keep in order to create Militia; only the player's starting Town Hall has the ability to make Militia. Militia are on a timer of 45 seconds and will convert back to Peasants when their timer runs out. You can always convert Peasants to Militia via the Town Hall and convert them back to Peasants at any time. Compared to the Peasant, the Militia has a stronger and faster attack, more and stronger armor (Normal to Heavy) and have a base speed of 270, compared to the Peasant who has 190.\nUpon expiration of the timer, if the Militia was attacking a unit, then the ensuing Peasant will still keep attacking. If the Militia is sent back to the main building via recall, then they'll return to whatever they were doing before turning into Militia.\nMilitia are popular among human players for rushing creep camps near the player that they'd normally have trouble with other units at the time, and make perfect meatshields doing so. They're often supported by a few &lt;a href=\"Footman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Footmen&lt;/a&gt;, though other players may simply bring more Militia than normal to clear the creep camp. If the Militia take heavy damage, recall them back to the Town Hall so they return to work immediately. Note that your resource gains will dip with varying effect for the duration of the Militia depending on how many Peasants were converted.\nWhen under attack, try to avoid using Militia if possible. Defensive towers generally have a better play, and forcing your Peasants to turn into Militia will prompt the enemy to attack again, as they know you don't have an army to defend your base, and you'll be weakened from the lack of resources. Militia also provide more experience compared to Peasants since they've turned into a combat unit."}

If the player upgrades an inn to Level 2 at their Tier 2 garrison on , Manastorm will show up with a dungeon quest, unlocking him as a follower. He plays a prominent role in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde%20Campaign\"&gt;Tirisgarde Campaign&lt;/a&gt;.\nMillhouse is married to &lt;a href=\"Millificent%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millificent Manastorm&lt;/a&gt;, with whom he has a love-hate relationship. The two are fought in the &lt;a href=\"Manastorms\"&gt;Manastorms&lt;/a&gt; encounter in the &lt;a href=\"Other%20Side\"&gt;Other Side&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nTrapped in Arcatraz.\nWhile the Arcatraz is a place of imprisonment for dangerous beings the &lt;a href=\"Naaru\"&gt;Naaru&lt;/a&gt; encountered, Millhouse, in fact, was merely a victim of circumstance - a stowaway who was in the wrong Naaru vessel at the wrong time. It is unknown how he actually got to a Naaru vessel but it's quite possible that his curiosity over the mysterious Naaru and his knowledge of the Arcane played a major part in his entry.\nIn combat, he appears to be a jack of all trades, using &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Frostbolt\"&gt;Improved Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Pyroblast\"&gt;Pyroblast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Arcane%20Missiles%20%28Cataclysm%29\"&gt;Improved Arcane Missiles (Cataclysm)&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, most elite NPC's have grown beyond the simple boundaries of talent specs, and Millhouse is no different.\nCataclysm.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Millhouse returned as a member of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20cult\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer cult&lt;/a&gt;. It was perhaps his proximity to Skyriss\u2014a servant of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;\u2014that led to him joining the cult. He was involved in their operations in &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared numerous times in the &lt;a href=\"Stonecore\"&gt;Stonecore&lt;/a&gt;. He had apparently acquired a new spell called \"Impending Doooooom!\", but its effects were unknown as he was interrupted by the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Corborus\"&gt;Corborus&lt;/a&gt;. He and his Twilight's Hammer loyalists were knocked over the precipice, and was suspected to have been killed in the impact.\nMists of Pandaria.\nHaving survived, he joined the &lt;a href=\"Brawler%27s%20Guild\"&gt;Brawler's Guild&lt;/a&gt; as a gladiator. Apparently, the Stonecore was &lt;a href=\"merely%20a%20setback\"&gt;merely a setback&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nIf the player has a Level 2 inn, which becomes available beginning with their Tier 2 garrison, Manastorm will show up on the second floor as a quest giver. After quickly assuring the player that he's changed, he asks for help in collecting a piece of equipment for a humanitarian project he's working on. After helping him out, he joins the growing fort as a follower.\nLegion.\nMillhouse is searching for the &lt;a href=\"Nightborne%20Soulstone\"&gt;Nightborne Soulstone&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Arcway\"&gt;Arcway&lt;/a&gt; tunnels near &lt;a href=\"Felsoul%20Hold\"&gt;Felsoul Hold&lt;/a&gt;, only to be captured by the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Archmage\"&gt;Archmage&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisgarde\"&gt;Tirisgarde&lt;/a&gt;, accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, comes searching for a corrupted &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt; within the tunnels, they free Millhouse and join forces. Eventually, the two find Vargoth within the tunnels, but the possessed mage manages to escape. Afterwards, Millhouse joins the Tirisgarde to aid in their search for the Soulstone.\nEventually, the Tirisgarde succeeds in rescuing Vargoth and manages to use the Soulstone to imprison &lt;a href=\"Kathra%27natir\"&gt;Kathra'natir&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; possessing the mage. During the following celebration, Millhouse tries to claim his prize, only for &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to refuse him, promising instead to aid him in search of other artifacts. Millhouse then runs off, exclaiming \"You're not my friends anymore!\". He remains a &lt;a href=\"Champion\"&gt;Champion&lt;/a&gt; of the Archmage, however.\nHe sent an &lt;a href=\"Image%20of%20Millhouse%20Manastorm\"&gt;image&lt;/a&gt; of himself to the Violet Hold battling with the adventurers against his wife, &lt;a href=\"Millificent%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millificent Manastorm&lt;/a&gt; who managed to escape.\nDuring the quest &lt;a href=\"Finding%20Ebonchill\"&gt;Finding Ebonchill&lt;/a&gt;, the player finds a book titled \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Manastorm%20Decision\"&gt;The Manastorm Decision&lt;/a&gt;,\" mentioning Millhouse as being the son of the dangerous &lt;a href=\"Magnus%20Manastorm\"&gt;Magnus Manastorm&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nAt an unknown point in time, Millhouse made a deal with the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt; for some of his &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; for his experiments.\nWhen he and his wife were &lt;a href=\"Manastorms\"&gt;confronted&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, he instantly realized that the loa had sent them to recover his mojo, which caused his wife to become outraged that he had made a deal with Bwonsamdi too. In response, Millhouse called her out on her hypocrisy, and they subsequently fought Bwonsamdi's agents. After being beaten, he surrendered and declared that he would prefer Millificent over the mojo, an admission that deeply touched Millificent.\nWith the mojo in their possession, Bwonsamdi's agents returned to the loa, while the Manastorms affirmed their love towards one another.\nDragonflight.\nAlongside &lt;a href=\"Millificent%20Manastorm\"&gt;Millificent Manastorm&lt;/a&gt;, Millhouse is found inside the &lt;a href=\"Duck%20Cave\"&gt;Duck Cave&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Frostlands\"&gt;Upper Frostlands&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt;.

Who knows what would happen.\nBesides, your unique biological capability could be leveraged in a more efficient manner.\nYou should pursue a surgical plan that accounts for near-constant upgrade procedures. You can modify yourself every morning to fit the specific needs of the day!\nMost other races could not withstand such a taxing biological demand, but your body appears to be built for it.\n&lt;Pristy examines you carefully.&gt;\nYou, my dear test subject, have many flaws. The biggest being your complicated connection to magic.\nI assume that you cannot help it. It's in your blood.\nBut you must break that connection and replace with a much more healthy and sustainable reliance on technology!\nSpend some time thinking of the most common tasks you use magic for around your home.\nThen, after you've identified them, we will infuse you with a whole host of mechanical components that can do that task for you instead!\n&lt;Pristy examines you carefully&gt;\nAn excellent question! There is always room to improve what nature handed you at birth.\nReject equally the claims that you are perfect or unsalvageable. Both are equally wrong. And you, my dear test subject, have plenty about you that is right.\nFor the rest, I will write up a 24-page plan detailing every modification we simply must make.\nThere's still so much to improve!\n&lt;Pristy examines you carefully&gt;\nWell your body is clearly resilient to even EXIST in its current state.\nIt also appears to be resilient to, or at least extremely compatible with, infections of all types.\nI'd recommend pursuing our most invasive surgical options.\nMost test subjects would not survive them, but I'd give you above average odds!\n&lt;Pristy examines you carefully&gt;\nThere's sufficient room in those shoulders for embedded modules...\nNo, maybe we should scale back the shoulders and enhance the spine further...\nHave you ever wanted to be taller than a Tauren? I think we might be able to pull it off if you're open to copious amounts of skin grafts and extended physical therapy.\nDon't worry we won't copy the Tauren horns. We'll embed retractable power coils instead!\n&lt;Pristy examines you carefully from head to hoof&gt;\nImpressive physique.. Sturdy balance... Indomitable resilience... Nature did pretty well with you.\nBut let's talk about those tendrils... Frankly, they look ridiculous, and I doubt they serve any real purpose.\nI recommend immediately replacing them with retractable hoses or storage tubes. Your choice.\n&lt;Pristy examines you carefully.&gt;\nI'm pleased to see a fellow gnome asking such questions.\nAs you might imagine, we have a breadth of research and test cases that track results, specifically with gnome biology.\nYou can pursue any modifications you see here in Mechagon.\nThe charging station is a large construction project occasionally found in &lt;a href=\"Bondo%27s%20Yard\"&gt;Bondo's Yard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt's the only device that can recharge &lt;a href=\"Empty%20Energy%20Cell\"&gt;Empty Energy Cell&lt;/a&gt;s, converting them into usable &lt;a href=\"Energy%20Cell\"&gt;Energy Cell&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBe careful, though. Charging stations are noisy and will attract the attention of nearby troggs who may wish to interfere with you.\nYou can always ask Waren Gearhart in town if the charging station, or any other particular construction project, is available today. Ir just run by Bondo's Yard and check for yourself.\nIf the charging station is not available, it should be available within a few days.\nEnergy cells are the most valuable resource we have in Mechagon.\nThey are large batteries with a universal interface, capable of delivering electrical power to any mechanical device that requires it.\nIf you're looking to construct or craft something complex, you'll likely need at least one Energy Cell to power it.\nYou can find Energy Cells almost anywhere on the island, but they are exceptionally rare. When you have them, be sure to use them wisely.\nIf you have Empty Energy Cells, you can charge them at a Charging Station to convert them into usable Energy Cells.\nEmpty Energy Cells are just Energy Cells that have been drained of all their electricity.\nThey aren't good for anything other than getting recharged at the charging station. Then they can be used in any project that requires charged Energy Cells.\nYou can find Empty Energy Cells almost anywhere in Mechagon, but you'll have to wait until the charging station construction project is available to recharge them."}

He is an ex-&lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"marine\"&gt;marine&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubduing Private Hendel.\nAt the end of &lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Diplomat%20quest%20chain\"&gt;The Missing Diplomat quest chain&lt;/a&gt;, you must subdue Private Hendel. He is guarded by two level 35 accomplices. Immediately after you accept Hendel's challenge to fight, his accomplices will attack you. There is a trick to defeating Hendel and his accomplices: immediately after accepting Hendel's challenge run to the edge of the entrance ramp to nearby North Point tower. It's only a few steps away. Hendel's accomplices will follow you to the edge of the tower\u2014make sure you don't outrun them. When you get to the entrance ramp of the tower, guards from &lt;a href=\"North%20Point%20Tower\"&gt;North Point Tower&lt;/a&gt; will come down the ramp to assist you. Once they've taken care of the accomplices, you can go back for Hendel.\nAnother strategy is to focus all of your attacks on Hendel and ignore his guards, because once Hendel's HP is low enough, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Lady Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Tervosh\"&gt;Archmage Tervosh&lt;/a&gt; appear on the scene to finish the job. The guards run away at first sight of them.\nIf you fail to subdue Hendel, it will at first appear that you're not given a second chance to do so. Right-clicking on Hendel no longer triggers his challenge. To fix this, abandon The Missing Diplomat quest, then right-click on Hendel to re-create the quest.\nSpeculation.\nWhen last seen he was sent to Theramore for questioning. It's unknown what happened with him afterwards. He was either sent to prison and died during the mana-bombing of Theramore or he could be released or escaped at some point."}

For example, in WoW, a particular weapon (that hits many times) might have a 10% chance on each hit to apply a special effect, such as poison damage. When WoW users talk about \"how often this weapon procs\", they are talking about the likelihood of the special effect occurring.\nProc was originally short for \"spec_proc\" (spec_proc is short for \"special procedure\") which is a term used by the original programmer of , Jeremy Elson. It might have been used by the original programmers of diku-MUD as well. Special procedures in Circle-MUD are functions that can be assigned to objects, players, and locations in the world such that each time an event occurs, the special procedure function will be invoked. Special procedures were used in Circle-MUD for a wide variety of purposes: Creating room events when a person typed a specific string of text, causing a &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; or piece of &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; to perform a magical action, and even causing a MOB (mobile) to do something that it wouldn't normally do.\nSpecial procedures were a way of creating unique experiences that could not be achieved by simply building the dungeon and populating it with monsters. Special procedures breathed life into these worlds by introducing extra coding that enhanced the gamer's experience without changing the underlying structure or function of the code-base. If you ever played a MUD and were walking around in a dungeon and randomly saw the text \"You feel as though you are being watched,\" that was probably a special procedure.\nWhen developers and players were talking about these special procedures they abbreviated the term to \"proc\". Over time the noun also became a verb, \"proced\" (\"proc'd\" or \"procced\"), which meant that the special procedure was invoked and performed its action. Most often, players were concerned about their weapons and whether or not the weapon would perform its special attack (a proc), and so proc must have started to take on a narrower meaning for MMORPG players who were somewhat more removed from the core combat engine and flat world of MUDs.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", players refer to items that have \"Chance on Use\" or \"Chance on Hit\" effects as having a proc. Most of the time these items are weapons but they can also be armor, rings, trinkets, and even spell effects. How these items trigger their proc(s) depends upon what kind of an item it is.\nGuaranteed effects from critical hits (like \"after a critical strike your attack speed is increased by 30% for 15 sec\") are called proc too (the effect is automatic, but the critical hit is rare.\nSeveral classes have abilities that will unpredictably activate - for example, a druid's &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Clarity\"&gt;Omen of Clarity&lt;/a&gt; or a death knight's &lt;a href=\"Killing%20Machine\"&gt;Killing Machine&lt;/a&gt;. The event of these abilities activating is also called a proc.\nWeapons.\nFor weapons that have a proc, they usually have a \"Chance on Hit\" to either aid the wielder, harm their target(s) or both. Procs can also be added to weapons by enchanting them with certain enchants. The proc-rate of a weapon is the frequency with which the weapon triggers its proc. This varies depending on the nature of the weapon and how it is wielded. Certain epic weapons have a very high chance of proc'ing (30+%), but most players report that wielding one-handed weapons in your off-hand reduces the proc-rate by 50%.\nPPM.\nIt has been proven however that enchantment procs are based on something called Procs per Minute (PpM, PPM, or ppm). This in essence makes slower weapons, especially on a class like a rogue with instant attacks boosting their attacks per minute like crazy, actually proc more than faster weapons.\nThe PPM system works as follows: The actual chance each hit with a weapon procs the effect is PPM * weapon speed / 60.\nDual wielders should note that all instants (including the extra attack granted by Sword Specialization talent from Warriors &amp; Rogues) always happen with the main hand weapon, severely increasing the number of hits per minute with that weapon. (This also explains as to why people find OH weapons proc much less; they just don't hit as much)\nArmor, Rings, and Trinkets.\nWorn items such as these can either trigger their proc when the wearer is hit in combat, when the wearer casts a spell \u2014 offensively or defensively, when the wearer uses the item, or when the wearer hits their opponent with a melee attack. That would tend to make the first proc more valuable to players who get hit quite often, in other words PVPers and &lt;a href=\"warriors\"&gt;warriors&lt;/a&gt;, the second proc useful to anyone, and the third proc most useful to melee combatants like &lt;a href=\"rogues\"&gt;rogues&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpell effects.\nSome spell effects can also grant players a proc. Examples: The &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; spell &lt;a href=\"Windfury%20Weapon\"&gt;Windfury Weapon&lt;/a&gt; causes each attack to have a chance of permitting a free attack with a bonus to their &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt;."}

Here is the formula: \nwhich is the same as: \nThis gives the percentage chance that the proc will be triggered each hit. Note that PPM is an average, not a guarantee.\nPPM &amp; Haste.\nThe speed used for calculating the PPH (Proc per Hit) chance is the basic weapon speed, not the characters Haste-affected hit speed. This means the probability of a proc per hit is not affected by Haste. But since Haste increases the number of hits per minute, it also increases the total number of procs.\nInstant attacks.\nThe PPM rate of a given effect is based on auto-attacks (\"white damage\" attacks) made with that weapon. However, an effect on the main-hand weapon can proc more often than its PPM rating, as instant attacks (Sinister Strike, Overpower, etc.) are all assumed to be made with the main hand, and therefore can trigger the proc. \nIn addition, because instant attacks use the \"calculated PPH rate\" based on the weapon speed, yet are not themselves restricted by the weapon speed, a slower weapon will result in more total procs.\nFor example, a Warrior has Crusader (PPM of 1) on a 2.0-speed and a 2.5-speed weapon. These calculations assume ample Rage and no misses.\nEach minute, the Warrior also does 10 &lt;a href=\"Bloodthirst\"&gt;Bloodthirst&lt;/a&gt;s, 6 &lt;a href=\"Whirlwind\"&gt;Whirlwind&lt;/a&gt;s, and 4 &lt;a href=\"Overpower\"&gt;Overpower&lt;/a&gt;s, for a total of 20 instant attacks. \nTherefore, the slower the weapon you wield in the main hand, the more often any PPM-rated ability on it will proc, assuming you use any special attacks that can trigger the proc.\nAll these calculations are made with no &lt;a href=\"Flurry%20%28warrior%20ability%29\"&gt;Flurry (warrior ability)&lt;/a&gt; included."}

{"id": "14551", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14551", "title": "Profession", "text": "A profession is a trade-oriented set of &lt;a href=\"skill\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt;s that player characters may learn and incrementally advance in order to gather, make, or enhance items that can be used in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" gameplay. In essence, professions are 'jobs' characters may have. Professions are learned and improved via a &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; for a nominal fee, or sometimes advanced with special &lt;a href=\"recipe\"&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;s. Any profession can be learned regardless of a character's faction, race, or class, although some &lt;a href=\"racial%20traits\"&gt;racial traits&lt;/a&gt; provide bonuses to a particular profession. For example, &lt;a href=\"Gnome%20%28playable%29\"&gt;gnomes&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href=\"Engineering%20Specialization\"&gt;Engineering Specialization&lt;/a&gt; which may aid them if taking up the &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt; profession.\nSpecific trade skills within a profession allow you to do specific things such as crafting or equipping certain items. The making of such items are learned directly from profession trainers, from recipes found throughout the world, or occasionally taught as &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt; rewards. Each crafting profession starts out with a few specific trade skills that can be used to increase your skill level; as a player advances their profession to higher levels, they unlock the ability to learn new, more rewarding trade skills, which in turn are used to gain more skill levels (up to the current maximum). Gathering professions, on the other hand, have no need of specific trade skills: The player advances their skill level simply by harvesting the appropriate raw materials from &lt;a href=\"resource%20node\"&gt;resource node&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the world.\nNote the distinction: Trade skills are capabilities within a profession\u2014such as forging a particular piece of armor\u2014whereas skill level is a progression metric which acts as a prerequisite for learning more difficult trade skills (in the case of a crafting profession) or harvesting greater amounts of raw materials (in the case of a gathering profession).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Professions%20tab\"&gt;Professions tab&lt;/a&gt; lists a character's professions, and provides easy access to all related abilities and crafting interfaces.\nProfessions.\nThree classes of profession exist: primary, secondary, and so-called \"pseudo\"-professions.\nPrimary professions.\nPrimary professions are limited to two per character, though one is not required to take any at all. You can &lt;a href=\"Profession%23Unlearning%20a%20profession\"&gt;unlearn a primary profession&lt;/a&gt; in order to free up a profession slot and learn something new, but you will permanently lose all acquired knowledge and experience within that profession; if you learn it again later, you will have to start over from scratch.\nSecondary professions.\nSecondary professions can be learned by any character regardless of their choice of primary professions, and can provide the player with a number of benefits, resources and side activities. Unlike primary professions, secondary professions cannot be unlearned: since there is no limit to how many you can have at one time, there is simply no point in being able to drop them.\nPseudo-professions.\nPseudo-professions are unlike primary and secondary professions in that they are either learned or leveled in unusual ways; some are automatically available to specific classes\u2014similar to &lt;a href=\"abilities\"&gt;abilities&lt;/a&gt;\u2014while others are purchased outright, requiring no player interaction to increase. \nCategories of professions.\nEach profession falls into at least one of three categories: Gathering, production, and service. Overlaps between these categories are common, and a profession of one type often has some functions that are of another type.\nGathering.\nGathering professions allow a character to &lt;a href=\"gather\"&gt;gather&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"harvest\"&gt;harvest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"resource%20node\"&gt;resource node&lt;/a&gt;s throughout the game world to supply ingredient materials (or \"mats\") for crafting professions. Occasionally, these harvested items will be directly useful and usable. Any gathered materials that do not &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt; can be sold in the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;, often for a tidy profit for the time invested.\nProduction.\nProduction professions make items from other &lt;a href=\"ingredient\"&gt;ingredient&lt;/a&gt; items such as herbs, ingots, and meats. While &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; once referred to these as \"Production\" professions, most players refer to them as simply crafting within the game. Most of the items produced will be directly useful, but some will be ingredients for more advanced or complex items. Crafted products that do not bind on pickup can be sold in the auction house, with more powerful or novel items commanding higher prices.\nService.\nService professions benefit players by providing a service such as item &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;enhancement&lt;/a&gt; rather than focusing on the production of the items themselves. Characters that want to make money with a service profession will often have to actively solicit customers, though quality-of-life improvements such as the addition of &lt;a href=\"Enchanting%20Vellum\"&gt;Enchanting Vellum&lt;/a&gt;s have greatly diminished this need over time.\nCompanion professions.\nWhile it is perfectly valid to choose any two primary professions you like, certain professions complement others in a way that makes them natural companions. The best example of this is the most typical: Pairing a crafting profession with the gathering profession that provides the bulk of the materials required to advance in that crafting profession.\nEffectively pairing complementary crafting and gathering professions greatly reduces a character's reliance upon the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; for materials. While this can be a good thing for players without a large sum of gold or a steady stream of income, keep in mind that gathering can consume a great deal of time and may still not provide all of the reagents necessary for your craft. Therefore, adherents to the old adage \"time is money, friend!\" must determine what is more valuable to them: The gold saved by gathering your own materials, or the time saved by purchasing materials gathered by others.\nThe following is a table of crafting professions and the primary and secondary companion professions that are most complementary to them. If you have no real interest in crafting, consider instead taking two gathering skills to &lt;a href=\"Guide%20to%20making%20money\"&gt;make money&lt;/a&gt; while adventuring in the world.\n&lt;a href=\"Alchemy\"&gt;Alchemy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe best companion for this profession is &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;, as early alchemy relies almost exclusively on &lt;a href=\"herb\"&gt;herb&lt;/a&gt;s for the mixing of any potion. The secondary &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; profession is also highly recommended, as it supplies a number of oils used in the craft and can be taken simultaneously with Herbalism. At higher levels, &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt; can be used to provide materials for some potions as well as &lt;a href=\"transmute\"&gt;transmute&lt;/a&gt;s. \nIt may be useful for advanced players to check your server's &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; prices for herbs and minerals, choosing to gather one or the other depending on which has the highest profit margin. You can then sell your excess material and use the profits to purchase the materials you cannot obtain for yourself. New players should stick with Herbalism and Fishing until they get used to dealing with the auction house.\n&lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe best companion for this profession is &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;, as the &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; used in nearly all smithing plans is typically in high demand and thus expensive to purchase on the auction house. While blacksmithing does utilize components from other professions (mainly leather from &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt;), it does not do so in sufficient quantity to justify any other gathering profession. In addition, low-level blacksmithing items rarely sell for more than the cost of their materials, and the additional income from selling excess ore can help to offset this cost until you can produce rare and in-demand weapons and armor.\n&lt;a href=\"Cooking\"&gt;Cooking&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile Cooking is a secondary profession and utilizes many dropped &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;meat&lt;/a&gt;s from creatures in the game, its natural companion is &lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt;. It can be leveled without the use of fishing (a noted departure from when it was originally introduced to the game), but catching and cooking fish is a very efficient method for increasing your skill. Don't forget that since both cooking and fishing are secondary skills, you can have both of them in addition to two primary skills.\n&lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;.\nEnchanting actually provides its own pseudo-gathering skill, known as &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanting&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to break down items of &lt;a href=\"uncommon\"&gt;uncommon&lt;/a&gt; quality or better to produce the materials needed to enchant other items. It is therefore common practice to couple Enchanting with &lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;, which similarly requires no gathering skills and can produce many items that can be disenchanted. If you do not like &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; and the cost of &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; is cheaper on the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt; can also produce items suitable for disenchanting. This combination\u2014though not unheard of\u2014is not common, as anyone can farm for cloth while only someone with the Skinning profession can obtain the leather needed by Leatherworkers. \nNote that it is also customary for Enchanters to farm disenchantable items from &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;d dungeons and to buy up cheap disenchantable items from the auction house to provide the materials needed for their craft. This has long since given Enchanting a reputation for being one of the most difficult and expensive professions to level up\u2014a reputation which has increased its rarity, and therefore its profit margins as well.\n&lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe best companion skill for this profession is &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; is typically in high demand and thus expensive to purchase on the auction house and, like &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, Engineering is ore intensive. Unlike Blacksmithing, however, it is also &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; intensive and uses a fair number of &lt;a href=\"gems\"&gt;gems&lt;/a&gt;, which Mining also provides. While this profession also uses items provided by &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt; (again similar to Blacksmithing), it is not in sufficient enough quantity to justify not taking Mining.\n&lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe only truly worthwhile companion skill for Inscription is &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;. Using the associated &lt;a href=\"Milling\"&gt;Milling&lt;/a&gt; skill, Scribes gather herbs to be made into various pastes (known as &lt;a href=\"pigments\"&gt;pigments&lt;/a&gt;) that are later used as the basis for &lt;a href=\"ink\"&gt;ink&lt;/a&gt;s for their profession.\n&lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe best companion skill for this profession is &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;, as &lt;a href=\"ore\"&gt;ore&lt;/a&gt; is typically in high demand and thus expensive to purchase on the auction house. Like &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, Jewelcrafting is ore and &lt;a href=\"stone\"&gt;stone&lt;/a&gt; intensive. Additionally, Jewelcrafting needs &lt;a href=\"gem\"&gt;gem&lt;/a&gt;s, which are obtained either directly from mining or from &lt;a href=\"Prospecting\"&gt;Prospecting&lt;/a&gt; mined ore. Jewelcrafting uses so little from other professions that it is not advisable to couple it with anything other than Mining.\n&lt;a href=\"Leatherworking\"&gt;Leatherworking&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe best companion skill for this profession is &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt;, as it produces almost all of the raw materials needed to work &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, you don't have to kill an enemy yourself in order to skin it; any &lt;a href=\"skinnable\"&gt;skinnable&lt;/a&gt; creature that has been killed and looted can be skinned for leather, &lt;a href=\"hide\"&gt;hide&lt;/a&gt; or scraps that a leatherworker can turn into usable pieces of leather or items. Like many professions, Leatherworking does occasionally utilize other professions' crafted or gathered materials. However, these are not in sufficient enough quantity to warrant the omission of Skinning.\n&lt;a href=\"Tailoring\"&gt;Tailoring&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlike most primary professions, Tailoring has no associated gathering profession as most of the raw materials are obtained by &lt;a href=\"farming\"&gt;farming&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;s in the game. Nonetheless, it is still commonly coupled with a gathering skill\u2014&lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Mining\"&gt;Mining&lt;/a&gt;\u2014or with &lt;a href=\"Enchanting\"&gt;Enchanting&lt;/a&gt;, which similarly provides its own raw materials. However, except for Skinning to a minor degree, none of these are for the purpose of helping with Tailoring proper. Rather, they are all for either making money on the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt; from selling raw goods to other professions, or for providing uncommon quality or better items to be &lt;a href=\"disenchant\"&gt;disenchant&lt;/a&gt;ed. \nTailors that do not wish to pick up the Enchanting profession should consider Skinning. The reason for this is twofold: First, Skinning provides a few items needed by tailors (such as leather for tailored boots or bags). Secondly, both Skinning and Tailoring are professions that rely upon gathering items from mobs that you will be killing anyway. In other words, if you kill a humanoid, it will most likely be dropping cloth for your tailoring; meanwhile, if you kill a beast or dragon, you can skin it to grab useful materials. Having both Tailoring and Skinning is a great way to both save and make money at the auction house.\nIncreasing professional skill level.\nSkill level is increased by practicing the skill. This works differently for different professions.\nFor most professions, you have a chance to gain skill level as you craft items, perform your service, or gather from a resource. As you increase in a skill, more recipes and resources reach a 0% chance to increase the skill (at this point the recipe will appear grey in the profession window). When a recipe turns green, a skill raise seldom occurs. A yellow recipe will raise the skill by 1 point roughly 60% of the time. An orange recipe always raises the skill 1 point.\nThe chance of skilling up changes within a color band as well. For example, if a particular item goes from orange to yellow at 240 and from yellow to green at 255, the chance of skilling up will be almost as good as orange from 240-245, middling from 245-250, and barely better than green from 250-255. It is often beneficial to make high yellow items to skill up more cost-effectively than orange items, but low yellow items should only be used if inexpensive (or if profitable!).\nThe formula describing the chance to gain a skill level, given your current skill level, the level at which the pattern you are using turns \"yellow\", and the level that it turns \"grey\", appears to be:&lt;br&gt;\n chance = (greySkill - yourSkill) / (greySkill - yellowSkill)\nThis means that a recipe that has just turned yellow will still be guaranteed to grant a skill point for its next craft (in the above formula, if yourSkill and yellowSkill are the same, the result is 1). It can be observed that the level at which recipes turn green is the point where the chance of a skill-up is 0.5. Thus, yellow recipes have a skill up chance tending from 1 to 0.5 as the recipe approaches green. The number of crafts of a recipe required to get 1 skill-up is &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_distribution\"&gt;geometrically distributed&lt;/a&gt;, thus the expected number of crafts is given by 1/chance. This may help in which recipe is the 'cheapest' to use to level up regarding material cost.\nOne exception to this rule is &lt;a href=\"Skinning\"&gt;Skinning&lt;/a&gt;, wherein skinning a corpse which appears orange does not guarantee a skill increase, and often many such corpses must be skinned in order to raise the skill).\n&lt;a href=\"Fishing\"&gt;Fishing&lt;/a&gt; also works differently. Each item fished has a contribution to raising your fishing skill, regardless of the item level fished or the location fished. Raising your fishing skill requires progressively more catches, but it doesn't matter where you fish nor what you catch (other than you will miss more fish in more difficult areas where you have a chance to miss some fish, so it will take longer - so raising fishing skill can be inversely related to the difficulty of the fishing.)\nCreating a &lt;a href=\"Basic%20Campfire\"&gt;Basic Campfire&lt;/a&gt; has a chance of increasing cooking skill. This has 5 min cooldown so it is not so useful.\nProficiency levels.\nThere are nine proficiency levels that constrain how much skill players can acquire within their professions. Apprentice, Journeyman, Expert, and Artisan no longer appear in game and are rolled up under Classic. Journeyman and Expert are only referenced in profession achievements.\nBonus to profession skill.\nYou can also increase your profession skill level with certain racial abilities, items, and enchants. Principally the chance to skill up is based on the characters base skill level - i.e. the skill level before the racial or item bonus. This makes it much easier to level up the skill. The &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; skill bonus of 5, for example, means that a recipe that turned from orange to yellow at 30 for other races would not turn yellow until 35 for a Draenei jewelcrafter.\nYou must have training in the profession (at least one skill point) to use a skill bonus in that profession. With no training, the skill bonus does not apply - so you cannot use the skill bonus instead of training in a profession.\nRacial profession.\nCertain races receive a profession skill bonus as a racial trait.\nEnchantments.\nCertain enchantments create a permanent profession skill bonus on an apparel item, which is then worn to apply the profession skill bonus. Currently, all of these work on gloves. \nCasting these enchantments on a very low level &lt;a href=\"soulbound\"&gt;non-binding&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"quality\"&gt;white or gray quality&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; glove enables the glove to be worn by any character. This will also prevent anyone from accidentally &lt;a href=\"disenchanting\"&gt;disenchanting&lt;/a&gt; the glove. (The materials for the enchantment cannot ever be recovered in any case.)(Some folks may prefer the enchantment on a &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt; glove they can't accidentally give away.)\nThe herbalism enchantment can be cast on for a total bonus of +7 or +10 herbalism skill. This is the only way to get both bonuses at once since individual herbalism skill bonus items would occupy the same equipment slot.\nEquipment.\nCertain items give profession skill bonuses when wielded or worn.\nBonuses you only get with a certain profession.\nEach Primary profession gives certain advantages unique to practitioners of that profession. The crafting profession bonuses, by design, are all roughly comparable: about 40 points of item budget (i.e., 40 points to a statistic other than &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, 60 points of &lt;a href=\"stamina\"&gt;stamina&lt;/a&gt;, or 80 points of &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt;). There are only a few gaps - for example, there is no tailoring bonus useful to &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince the release of \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\", no profession has had &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20pickup\"&gt;bind on pickup&lt;/a&gt; items of great value. Several professions have &lt;a href=\"blue\"&gt;blue&lt;/a&gt; quality items that will be useful to fresh level 80s, but quickly replaced with better gear. \nThe crafting professions each have recipes for items that require skill in that profession.\nAlchemy.\nAlchemists are able to create and equip unique trinkets, ranging from the &lt;a href=\"Philosopher%27s%20Stone\"&gt;Philosopher's Stone&lt;/a&gt; (200) to a selection of max level versions such as the &lt;a href=\"Vibrant%20Alchemist%20Stone\"&gt;Vibrant Alchemist Stone&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to being a required tool for &lt;a href=\"transmutation\"&gt;transmutation&lt;/a&gt;s, these trinkets grant substantial amounts of primary and secondary stats, as well as increasing the effect that healing and mana potions have on the wearer by 40%.\nIn addition, midway through Apprentice level (50 skill), Alchemists get a passive ability, &lt;a href=\"Mixology\"&gt;Mixology&lt;/a&gt;, that doubles the duration of any elixir (or flask) that they use, provided that it is one they are able to make themselves. This ability also increases the effect of the elixir, but the amount of increase varies from item to item.\nAlchemists are also able to make a small collection of potions that only they are able to benefit from. At Grand Master (400) alchemists can create the and , which are not consumed upon use. These can provide a regular and endless supply of mana or health, although their contributions (2000 and 2400 respectively) are far less significant at max level. Grand Master also brings the &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20the%20North\"&gt;Flask of the North&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a small buff to the alchemist's primary stat, effectively replaced at Illustrious Grand Master (500) skill level by its Cataclysm equivalent, the &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Enhancement\"&gt;Flask of Enhancement&lt;/a&gt;. Although these flasks provide a much smaller bonus than other flasks at that skill level, they are not only not consumed upon use but have the advantage of being usable in Arenas.\nBlacksmithing.\nThe most notable exclusive benefit Blacksmiths get is the ability to add a socket to bracers and gloves, that requires 400 Blacksmithing skill to remain active. (This makes Blacksmithing an attractive complement to Jewelcrafting, for players who are not worried about gaining required materials.)\nBlacksmiths can also create skeleton keys to open locked doors and chests, providing a limited alternative to a rogue's lockpicking services.\nIn addition, Blacksmiths are able to craft gear that only they can wear, dependent on the specialization they have chosen: weapons or armor. These items become available at several points:\nEnchanting.\nEnchanters are able to enchant their rings with effects that are roughly comparable to an additional cut gem.\nEngineering.\nAlmost every item an engineer makes is usable only by other engineers, making it difficult to compare to other professions. They have custom made items that do everything from snare or mind control opponents to gaining access to a mailbox or bank space in the middle of the wilderness.\nMuch like Blacksmiths, they are able to make a small selection of items (headgear) exclusive to engineers.\nAnd in common with most other crafting professions, they are able to augment select items of their own gear. While most of these changes are gadgets (increased movement speed, rockets, parachutes), many also give bonuses to combat statistic abilities (armor value, critical strike rating, haste rating, etc). \nIn common only with Tailoring, there are two mounts that only Engineers can create and use. (There are a further two mounts - the motorcycles - that require engineering to create, but anyone can use.)\nInscription.\nScribes at Grandmaster level (400) are able to put powerful enchantments (&lt;a href=\"Augment%23Inscriptions\"&gt;Inscriptions&lt;/a&gt;) on their shoulder items. This also saves players the bother of grinding &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt; reputation.\nBeyond that, they are able to use Scrolls of &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Recall\"&gt;Recall&lt;/a&gt;, which act much like the &lt;a href=\"Shaman\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Recall\"&gt;Astral Recall&lt;/a&gt; ability, with close to the same cooldown period.\nJewelcrafting.\nStarting as low as level 35, and continuing at least to level 75, Jewelcrafters are able to make trinkets that only they are able to use (&lt;a href=\"BoP\"&gt;BoP&lt;/a&gt;).\nMore significant than those trinkets, though, is the ability of Jewelcrafters to create and socket more powerful epic quality gems. These gems (up to three allowed at a time) are up to 40% more powerful than the best gems that non-jewelcrafters can obtain. Much like Blacksmithing and Enchanting, this provides benefits approximating having an additional two gems installed in your gear.\nLeatherworking.\nLeatherworking allows the practitioner to augment their bracers (a substitution for normal enchantments), and their leg items. (Leg enchantments are typically done through leatherworking anyway; the Leatherworker-only versions are far cheaper but equal in power.)\nAs with Blacksmiths, Leatherworkers are able to create a fair selection of armor items that only they may use, at pretty much the same levels as blacksmiths, but lacking the recipes at 415 skill/level 78.\nTailoring.\nTailoring, like Leatherworking, provides cheap top-end leg enchantments, albeit for spellpower rather than melee abilities. It also allows the tailor superior enchantments for cloaks (providing one of several varieties of '&lt;a href=\"proc\"&gt;proc&lt;/a&gt;' buff.\nTailoring, like Engineering, has a pair of unique flying mounts that only Tailors can ride.\nLastly, tailors gain a passive ability, &lt;a href=\"Scavenging\"&gt;Scavenging&lt;/a&gt;, that allows them to loot extra cloth off of Northrend humanoids.\nEasy money making.\nEvery profession offers opportunities to make money. The gathering professions offer an obvious avenue: Sell what was gathered. Some of the crafting professions also have \"value added services\". The value of those services depends on the market prices for the source and completed items, or upon the price players are willing to offer for the \"cooldowns\".\nReputation.\nAll of the skills have reduced cost to train depending on your &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Faction\"&gt;Faction&lt;/a&gt; to which the &lt;a href=\"trainer\"&gt;trainer&lt;/a&gt; belongs. Since you can generally have at least one reputation at &lt;a href=\"Honored\"&gt;Honored&lt;/a&gt; by 20th level, selecting where to train will save you (5% as compared to the cost when &lt;a href=\"Friendly\"&gt;Friendly&lt;/a&gt;). This is also true for all recipes for the building professions.\nFactions.\nMany good high-level recipes are sold by &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s. Faction grinding keeps many crafters busy for several weeks and can often be very expensive if you are not backed by a guild. It is not uncommon for a crafter to start out with two collecting professions (usually Skinning/Mining or Skinning/Herbalism), later learn the first production craft, and in the end learn a second production craft to maximize benefit from the faction.\nUnlearning a profession.\nYou may unlearn a profession and start a new one but this removes the chosen profession. If you were to learn it again, you would have to start leveling it from a skill level of 1 again. You will also forget any recipes you may have acquired in your old profession, so they must be reacquired if you take it up again. Note, however, that you do \"not\" unlearn your speciality, if you have one. If you later re-acquire an unlearnt profession for which you had a speciality, you will still have the speciality. The new profession you choose to replace it with also starts with a skill level of 1. You can unlearn a profession from your skills tab (the hotkey is k). To do so, click on the appropriate profession, and in the bottom part of the panel is a tiny icon that when moused over will tell you it lets you unlearn your profession. Be sure you really want to unlearn a profession; Blizzard will not undo it if you change your mind!\nOne way to make use of this is to look at primary professions from a different perspective. You can only have two. But they are not 'cast in concrete', you can discard a primary profession and replace it. And they are dirt cheap - Apprentice level training in a primary profession costs 9 copper in your starting area. When you are first starting, you might benefit by switching professions to meet a goal. You can use this to get a fair upgrade to your starting gear cheaply, and stock up on some low level consumables. \nThe downside is that you lose all of your built up skill and recipe knowledge. Some &lt;a href=\"profession%20mounts\"&gt;profession mounts&lt;/a&gt; will not be rideable until you gain the requirements again, but will still exist in your mount list and count towards achievements.\nHistory.\nNew professions have been added through expansions and patches.\n&lt;a href=\"Jewelcrafting\"&gt;Jewelcrafting&lt;/a&gt; could originally only be learned on accounts that had the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; expansion enabled, as trainers for this profession were located in expansion-exclusive areas. These trainers were added to the old-world cities in the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; expansion, making Jewelcrafting available to &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;classic&lt;/a&gt; accounts. \nIn contrast to the initial exclusivity of Jewelcrafting, trainers for the &lt;a href=\"Inscription\"&gt;Inscription&lt;/a&gt; profession were introduced directly to old-world cities with the &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;pre-patch&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, making it immediately available to all players.\n&lt;a href=\"Archaeology\"&gt;Archaeology&lt;/a&gt; was initially restricted to owners of the \"Cataclysm\" expansion; this expansion was integrated into the base \"World of Warcraft\" package in October of 2013."}

Botany could be a form of obtaining food in alternative to fishing or looting meat off of mobs.\n? Not a true crafting profession, this would be more like a producing profession to provide for a gathering profession (herbalism).\n- The uses of Botany would be extremely limited. For Botany to not simply reproduce things already made in other professions, it would have to be extremely creative. \n- Very similar to herbalism, in that they both work with plants and herbs.\n&lt;a href=\"Brewmaster\"&gt;Brewery&lt;/a&gt;.\n+ Would allow the player to make drinks, and not just alcoholic drinks. \n- A few drinks are already produced via cooking, and more could just be included.\n&lt;a href=\"Infusion\"&gt;Infusion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs &lt;a href=\"enchanting\"&gt;enchanting&lt;/a&gt; is to equipment, and &lt;a href=\"inscription\"&gt;inscription&lt;/a&gt; is to abilities, so is infusion to racial traits. Infusing types of energy into one's body one could change some of the racial traits, including higher strength or intelligence, or, at higher levels, new racial abilities. It could be used to change &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s into &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Draenei\"&gt;Draenei&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Satyrs\"&gt;Satyrs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"felblood\"&gt;felblood&lt;/a&gt; etc. The mats would probably come from disenchanting items and harvesting the blood of demons, dragons, or powerful beings.\n- Nethaera stated in a Blue Post that there are no plans for race changes. Thus, it is unlikely that one will be able to change from Orc to Fel Orc, etc. The changing of racial traits is cast into serious doubt as a result of this. &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html%3FtopicId%3D34203905%26amp%3BpageNo%3D1\"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Lumberjack\"&gt;Lumbering&lt;/a&gt;/Forester.\n+ If Woodworking became a new profession, lumbering would help be the gathering profession for it.\n? Several unique new tree spawns would be needed, much like herbs and ore veins.\n? Might require a lumber mill to turn the raw wood into planks of wood. There are currently not many lumber mills around.\n- Wood can already be purchased from vendors ( and ).\n- Since you would never be allowed to actually cut down trees part of the landscape, this might make the profession a little less realistic.\n&lt;a href=\"Sailor\"&gt;Sailing&lt;/a&gt;.\n+ Could be the next \"riding\" skill allowing players to sail to different places (in a Great Sea expansion), since ground mounts don't work on water.\n? Since flying mounts already exist, traveling by water may be obsolete, however, with Blizzard not wanting players to pass anything its likely flying will be at a higher level in most expansions released. \n? Players can already use vehicles, as of Wrath of the Lich King, such as tanks and bombers without a skill. There's no particular reason a skill would be needed to sail but not for the others.\nRowboats would make for good single person transportation method.\n- A &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Turtle%20%28mount%29\"&gt;water mount&lt;/a&gt; was introduced in the &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt;.\n- Ships are massive objects that would seem too big for players to control alone.\n- Would be restricted to a very small part of the game, in which few places are required to swim to.\n- Would cause issues going to places where normally &lt;a href=\"fatigue\"&gt;fatigue&lt;/a&gt; would set it preventing you from going too far.\n&lt;a href=\"Woodworker\"&gt;Woodworking&lt;/a&gt;.\n+ Would allow for the crafting of arrows, bows, crossbows, polearms, shields, staves, and possibly maces.\n+ Guns and bullets are already produced by Engineers. This would provide a nice parallel to Hunters who prefer bows.\n? Chairs and other vanity items could be crafted as well. Models already exist.\n? Crafting boats or ships might be a possible profession only \"mount\".\n? A very high level could make a 'Trojan Horse' for raiding, would allow a raid party of ten members (or more) to enter the city walls of a rival faction without being attacked, for a limited time or until they attack an NPC or PVP player."}

Unlike flying machines these bikes can be used by non-engineers. Obtaining this mount awards the achievement &lt;a href=\"Get%20to%20the%20Choppa%21\"&gt;Get to the Choppa!&lt;/a&gt;.\nEngineers can learn to create a rocket mount based on their specialization, which can be sold to non-engineers. &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20engineering\"&gt;Gnomish engineering&lt;/a&gt; can only make the &lt;a href=\"Geosynchronous%20World%20Spinner\"&gt;Geosynchronous World Spinner&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20engineering\"&gt;Goblin engineering&lt;/a&gt; can only make the &lt;a href=\"Depleted-Kyparium%20Rocket\"&gt;Depleted-Kyparium Rocket&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are also other unique flying mounts that engineers can learn and sell to other players.\nJewelcrafting.\nJewelcrafters can learn to make five jewel panther mounts that can be sold.

The first four are then themselves used as mats to create the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Onyx%20Panther\"&gt;Jeweled Onyx Panther&lt;/a&gt;. This means to have all five, the first four are created twice, one set to be mounts, and another set as mats.\nLeatherworking.\nLeatherworkers can craft two mounts, and only the Dustmane Direwolf requires Leatherworking to ride.\nTailoring.\nTailors can craft four flying carpets which require &lt;a href=\"tailoring\"&gt;tailoring&lt;/a&gt; to be used."}

It requires high DPS and a lot of movement.\nThis boss is available since January 5, 2010 on US servers and January 6 on EU servers.\nLore.\nProfessor Putricide is the Scourge genius behind the development of all forms of blight, plague, ooze, scourge, and death delivery. He is the final boss in the Plagueworks section of Icecrown Citadel, the first Icecrown wing to be unlocked. In order to reach his laboratory, players must first defeat &lt;a href=\"Festergut\"&gt;Festergut&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rotface\"&gt;Rotface&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Rising\"&gt;Scourge resurgence&lt;/a&gt;, Putricide was one of the undead forces reanimated by &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; in in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. Later, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s of both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; were sent by the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to kill him once again.\nPreparation.\nTwo tanks are required, one of them drives the Abomination during Phases 1 and 2. In 25 player, a third tank is recommended (Phase 3 only). The encounter becomes easier with more DPS so no more than 2/5 (10/25 player) healers is fine. Putricide enrages 10 minutes after the pull.\nMutated Abomination.\nOne player needs to drive a Mutated Abomination. Mutated Abomination is a disease debuff which must not be cleansed, it is gained by clicking on the table at which Putricide starts. If the Abominations dies, a new one can be obtained by clicking the table again. During the whole encounter, slime pools spawn randomly. During phases 1 and 2, the Abomination eats these to gain ooze power. Ooze power in turn is used to snare the adds which spawn.\nIn phase 3, the tank inside the Abomination must help tank Putricide, so slime pools start to accumulate and eventually kill the raid (soft enrage).\nTactics.\nPhase 1: 100% to 80%.\nThis phase is all about add control. Alternately, a green and an orange add spawn from the green or orange tank respectively on each side of the room. It's essential to kill each add before the next one spawns. Putricide should be nuked only while no add is up. Since Putricide uses no dangerous AoE abilities, it's safe for the whole raid to stand close to him.\nInitially, Putricide is tanked next to the Orange tank on the left side of the room. Not long after the pull, Putricide performs an \"Unstable Experiment,\" which spawns a Volatile Ooze (green add) next to the green tank on the right side of the room. Ranged DPS should switch to it immediately and melee DPS should switch as soon as it is clear who it is targetting. The Volatile Ooze targets and roots a random player and moves towards its target; the Abomination pilot needs to snare it with Regurgitated Ooze. Upon reaching its target, the ooze explodes for 175,000 damage which is split between all players standing on top of the target. The explosion also knocks all affected players back a few yards. After the explosion, the Ooze acquires a new target and repeats the process. Positioning players in a group next to a wall can keep the explosions from knocking the characters too far apart.\nAfter the Ooze is dead, Putricide and the whole raid should move next to the Green tank. The next Unstable Experiment spawns a Gas Cloud (orange add) next to the orange tank. The Gas Cloud follows a random player and applies Gaseous Bloat, a dot which requires a lot of healing. Gaseous Bloat starts with numerous stacks that decrease over time. Should the Gas Cloud reach its target while stacks still remain, the whole raid takes a large amount of damage, usually leading to a wipe. The target must kite the cloud around the room while everyone else kills it. The abomination pilot should also snare it. When the Gas Cloud spawns, ranged DPS should immediately begin nuking it down, while melee DPS should wait until the Gas Cloud's target is. \nAfter this, the raid and Putricide move back to the Orange tank. The adds spawn alternately in a predictable manner.\nIt's highly desirable to have no add up at the start of Phase 2. For this reason it's a good idea to stop DPS at about 82% and finish off the existing add before pushing him into Phase 2 (in well behaved raids this should be automatic because nobody should damage the professor while an add is up anyways).\nPhase 2: 80% to 35%.\nPutricide casts Tear Gas, which stuns the raid for 10 seconds during the phase change. Rogues can &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; and Mages can use &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; before Putricide finishes casting. This allows them some extra DPS time. The fight remains basically the same, but Putricide gain two additional abilities: Choking Gas Bomb and Malleable Goo.\nThe Choking Gas Bombs are two flasks which he drops on the ground close to himself. They form an orange cloud on the floor and explode after 20 seconds, killing players within in a 10 yard radius. When he drops them, everybody must move away from the flasks.\nMalleable Goo looks like a bouncing green slime ball. Putricide randomly targets and tosses 1/2 (10/25 player) goo balls to ranged targets. On impact each causes 20,000 AoE damage and slows attack/cast speeds by 200%. All players must move away from the impact points of the green bouncing balls.\nJust like at the end of Phase 1, stopping DPS a few percentages before he goes into phase 3 to ensure that no adds are up is desirable.\nPhase 3: 35% to 0%.\nProfessor Putricide casts tear gas again and phases. As before &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Invisibility\"&gt;Invisibility&lt;/a&gt; allow extra DPS time. With good timing and a little luck, a Shaman can drop a &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elemental%20Totem\"&gt;Fire Elemental Totem&lt;/a&gt; that's not affected by the Tear Gas as well. This can also be used between Phase 1 and 2, but is more useful for Phase 3.\nDuring Phase 3, adds stop spawning, but adds that are up do remain. Use all &lt;a href=\"DPS%20cooldowns\"&gt;DPS cooldowns&lt;/a&gt; at the start of this phase. Malleable Goo, Choking Gas Bomb, and Slime Pools continue. The Abomination buff is removed and the person inside returns to normal form. This means that the slime pools accumulate and start growing. Phase 3 is a DPS race, Putricide must be killed in short order (about 80/120 seconds in 10/25 player).\nAny remaining add must be killed immediately. Putricide stacks a debuff on his current tank every 10 seconds (Mutated Plague), which has a one-minute expiration timer. The debuff deals AoE damage to the whole raid. If it expires, is removed or somebody dies from it, Putricide gains a massive amount of health (300.000 health for each stack that the person had in 10 man). With two tanks, Tank #1 should tank it up to 2 stacks, then Tank #2 should tank it up to 2 stacks. After that, the tanks should taunt off each other per stack. With three tanks, each tank should initially get 2 stacks, and then to four stacks.\nPutricide also stacks a buff on himself called Mutated Strength, causing him to do more damage over time.\nIn 25-player: In Phase 3, Mutated Plague triples in damage every stack, therefore three tanks are recommended.\nShort Version.\nThis is a condensed, easy to read version of the above. It describes the basics of the fight generally for normal modes in limited depth.\nPhase 1: Ooze pools should be eaten by the Abomination pilot to gain resources and remove hazards.\nAlternating, an add spawns from the green and orange tanks. The abomination pilot must snare adds using 'Regurgitate ooze'. DPS must priority kill the adds. Ranged must stack on the target of the green add, while the orange add must be kited by its target. Only when no adds are up should you DPS Putricide. Stop near 80% HP to kill oozes, then proceed into Phase 2 with no adds up.\nPhase 2: Continue Phase 1's add management.\nChoking Gas Bombs and Malleable Goo are dropped by/thrown at the raid. They should be dodged.\nBurn adds that remain before 35% and Phase 3.\nPhase 3: Abomination disappears. Avoid slime pools. Adds cease, but Choking Gas and Malleable Goo remain. Burn remaining adds. Activate Heroism and other cooldowns now to avoid a soft enrage and keep this delicate phase short. Tanks need to rotate Mutated Plague to keep it as low as possible, avoiding raid damage - Tank A receives 2, B receives 2, then taunt off every stack (A2/B2/A3/B3/A4/B4 etc). DPS stay on Putricide while avoiding raid hazards (slime/goo/bombs). If not killed quickly, Putricide soft-enrages around 4 stacks of Mutated Plague (approx. 1m20s/80s) and also soft enrages off Mutated Strength if left long enough.\nAlternate Strategy (10 and 25).\nTo maximize DPS time, Putricide stays near the green ooze spawn point. Ranged stack opposing the oozes, at max range, while spreading out to minimize the malleable goo effect during Phase 2 &amp; 3. With this positioning, melee can switch from the boss to the green add very quickly.\nPhase 1.\nThe transition to Phase 2 should occur before the second green slime spawns, in 10 player it's even possible to get Phase 2 before the first orange add spawns. Tank positioning here can make the difference. The first location should be nearby the table until the first puddle of ooze drops. Then the tank can move to the exact point where the ooze spawns at the tip of the arrow closer to the table on Green side. This allows the melee to be on the green ooze,once it is target-able. The ranged can stack on this phase on the opposite end of where the green ooze appears on the circle, allowing for range on Putricide and the Ooze when it comes out.\nWhen the green ooze spawns, ranged can simply stay put on top of each other and nuke it. Melee follows the Ooze towards its target, so when it explodes damage is distributed between everyone. Before the orange ooze spawns, the tank should then have another puddle appear at his feet sometime soon. At this point take him back to position 1 by the table. When the orange ooze spawns everyone should be a safe distance away from it, ranged at max range, melee near the green tank. Ranged immediately switch to it, melee nuke Putricide while waiting until it has picked a target, and then charge in. The targeted player can help by kiting the add towards the melee group first, and then around the room, staying near the green tank if possible.\nAs above, stop DPS near 80% until no add is up.\nPhase 2.\nIf Phase 1 was ended with no oozes, there's a solid 20+ seconds to DPS the boss uninterrupted. Phase 2 is identical to Phase 1 except that it requires higher raid awareness. The boss has to be moved when he drops Choking Gas Bombs (orange vials on the ground), and ranged must avoid Malleable Goo at all costs. When using BigWigs or Deadly Boss Mods, it's a good idea to stick to its advice - don't move if the mod doesn't tell you to do so. The two positions that the tank has established should flow perfectly from here on out. Whenever he drops a choking gas bomb, move to the other position. When the green ooze comes out, he should be right on top of it. When the orange ooze comes out, he should be near the table.\nThis phase should also be ended with no oozes present and little to no slime puddles left.\nPhase 3.\nFollow the lines as guided in the Picture. Otherwise, same as in the above Phase 3.\n2nd Alternate Strategy (10 and 25).\nRanged spends the fight near the table, able to dps either add with little movement. They are close enough to reach the green add spawn point with no or little movement. Tank Putricide a bit away from the green add spawn point to avoid puddles and vials being dropped there. As the green add forms, the tank moves to the spawn point and then melee and the tank switch as soon as possible to the green add. Melee stands between the add and the ranged group, so if they are then thrown through the air, they are thrown to the ranged group. All dps stays on the green add until it is dead.\nFor the Orange add, ranged picks it up as soon as possible as normal. Melee attacks when it is clear they are not the victim. The kite path is ideally around the Putricide tank and ending near them, so that melee doesn't have far to go to get back to the boss.\nThe Hudmap addon can help one see the malleable goo, and its true landing spot. Ranged group for phase 2, but not too closely to help avoid puddles forming under a green add victim, and to help prevent a malleable goo landing upon the victim and all of the people trying help share damage. Ranged can step in at the last second to help share the damage. However, the 'share damage' radius is quite small, and if one does not fly through the air as expected, they need to keep moving away from the add, as they may be the next victim.\nMost Putricide tanks can help dps the green add, as well as chase it to a ranged victim. Putricide doesn't seem to to hit too hard from behind. Protection warriors can charge the green add while being thrown through the air. This fight penalizes people standing off by themselves.\nHeroic Difficulty.\nProfessor Putricide gains Unbound Plague, which lasts 60 seconds. Unbound Plague deals increasing damage every second, killing players within approximately 15 seconds of being infected. It jumps to anyone within 3 yards, leaving a debuff called Plague Sickness every time, which increases damage taken from Unbound Plague by 300%, stacking infinitely. \nTo deal with Unbound Plague the victim should step away from other players for a few ticks, then run in to pass the disease to another player. This recipient should stand clear for a few ticks, then pass it to another player who does not have Plague Sickness. The Plague Sickness debuff means that if you pass the Unbound Plague back and forth between a few people who all develop Plague Sickness, you can easily overwhelm the healers. It is important to pass the Unbound plague to a new player, or one who has at least lost the Plague Sickness.\nRather than casting Tear Gas on the raid on Heroic Difficulty to change phases, Professor Putricide instead debuffs half the raid with the Ooze Variable and half the raid with the Gas Variable in 25-player mode. He then spawns both a Volatile Ooze AND a Gas Cloud at the same time. Players may only attack targets matching their variable. The abomination almost never has enough juice to slow both the ooze and the cloud, so at least one will be moving at full speed. It is also possible that he will summon the two adds while the raid is fighting an existing add, bringing the total to three.\nOverall Professor Putricide's Heroic Mode emphasizes an unforgiving raid environment as both Malleable Goo and Choking Gas cloud MUST be avoided to avoid the dps loss and to avoid putting strain on the healers. This is even moreso in Phase 3 when getting hit by either could spell a wipe, with dps being lost and healers being overtaxed.\nIn 10-player mode, there are no Variable debuffs, but he still spawns both a Volatile Ooze and a Gas Cloud at the same time instead of casting Tear Gas.\nQuotes.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Icecrown%20Citadel%23.C2.A0Professor%20Putricide\"&gt;Sound Files of Icecrown Citadel: Professor Putricide&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;\nSpeculation.\nPutricide may be the same person as &lt;a href=\"Dr.%20Terrible\"&gt;Dr. Terrible&lt;/a&gt;; Dr. Terrible's last name is unknown and he possesses the same model as Putricide (though this model is also used by a number of other unrelated characters). Dr. Terrible's last words also claim that he will rise again and extract vengeance. Professor Putricide also had potions that turns the player into an abomination, which is reminiscent of Terrible's attempts to create a &lt;a href=\"flesh%20giant\"&gt;flesh giant&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"vargul\"&gt;vargul&lt;/a&gt; parts."}

Knaak and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.audible.com/adbl/site/products/ProductDetail.jsp%3FproductID%3DBK_SANS_003421%26amp%3BBV_UseBVCookie%3DYes\"&gt;StarCraft II: Heaven\u2019s Devils&lt;/a&gt; by William C. Dietz. These are the only two novels Kyle has stated he will not be performing for Project Audioblizz.\nProject Audioblizz began on July 26 2010, when Kyle published his performance of the short story &lt;a href=\"http%3A//kylemccarley.com/audioblizz/starcraft\"&gt;\"StarCraft: Revelations\"&lt;/a&gt; by Chris Metzen, in honor of the release of StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty, which took place less than 24 hours after the first installment to Project Audioblizz was made available for download.\nJust over one week later, Kyle published his first Warcraft audiobook, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//kylemccarley.com/audioblizz/warcraft\"&gt;\"Of Blood and Honor,\"&lt;/a&gt; also written by Chris Metzen. His plans are to release his first Diablo audiobook, \"Demonsbane\" by Robert B. Marks, followed by several of the short stories in both the StarCraft and Warcraft universes to increase the breadth of the project as quickly as possible. Shortly after that, he intends to continue work with Project Audioblizz by moving in to the longer, full length novels from all three franchises.\nKyle McCarley.\nKyle McCarley, formerly known as Mickey C, is known for his works with the now extinct &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Radio\"&gt;WoW Radio&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"http%3A//donutboys.net\"&gt;The Donut Boys&lt;/a&gt;, including the radio play, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//kylemccarley.com/chalice-of-silvermoon\"&gt;The Chalice of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and the talk show, Happy Hour Tavern. When WoW Radio closed its doors, Kyle played a large part in the creation of &lt;a href=\"http%3A//omfg.fm\"&gt;Original Media for Gamers&lt;/a&gt;, OMFG.fm, and continues to not only host &lt;a href=\"http%3A//omfg.fm/%3Fp%3DShows%26amp%3BID%3D1\"&gt;The Donut Shop&lt;/a&gt; with the previously mentioned Donut Boys, but also acts as the Chief Operating Officer of the company and holds one of three seats on the Board of Directors.\nKyle began Project Audioblizz in the hopes that he might be able to share Blizzard novels with gamers in a more readily accessible way and that he might garner more attention for himself in his professional career as a voice-over artist. Kyle has performed in a few Warcraft machinima productions, including &lt;a href=\"http%3A//video.google.com/videoplay%3Fdocid%3D-8477928769250176083%23\"&gt;The Chalice of Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php%3Fid%3D20054\"&gt;Return 2&lt;/a&gt;.

During the shaping of the Dragon Isles by the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragon\"&gt;bronze dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironormu\"&gt;Ironormu&lt;/a&gt; met the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;. They occasionally received visitors to the &lt;a href=\"Wingrest%20Embassy\"&gt;Wingrest Embassy&lt;/a&gt; located on the shores of the isle.\nA lush and primal place bursting with &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elemental magic&lt;/a&gt; and the life energies of Azeroth, they were settled by the dragonflights after their empowerment by the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; and served as the center of their kingdom. The &lt;a href=\"djaradin\"&gt;djaradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tarasek\"&gt;tarasek&lt;/a&gt; are two races known to have lived here even before the dragons arrived.\nBecause of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, much of the isles' magic was drained away and the dragons were forced to leave their homeland in the care of the &lt;a href=\"titanic%20watcher\"&gt;titanic watcher&lt;/a&gt;s, the &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s that were left behind. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; tasked the watchers to use the &lt;a href=\"Beacon%20of%20Tyrhold\"&gt;Beacon of Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; to hide the Isles away from all outsiders, as well as the dragons themselves, until a time came when elemental energy resurfaced and the dragons could be drawn home to reestablish their kingdom, at which point the watchers would light the Beacon and reveal the Isles to the world once more.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe Dragon Isles are a place that few have heard of and even fewer have been to. The Black Prince &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; has been searching for the Isles, but was unable to find them. Other dragons were not forthcoming in information. An \"ancient home for all dragonflights\" is mentioned in legends concerning the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Riders%20of%20Loreth%27Aran\"&gt;Dragon Riders of Loreth'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nHaving been hidden away for more than 10,000 years, the primal elements have resurged on the Dragon Isles as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; heals and awakens, causing new life to arise. The titan watcher &lt;a href=\"Koranos\"&gt;Koranos&lt;/a&gt; has lit the Beacon of Tyrhold, lifting the veil that was hiding them from the world, and calling the dragons back home. Working together, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; dispatched the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; to conduct a scientific expedition to the re-emerging islands. This was explicitly not a military venture, with both factions joining forces to form the &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Expedition\"&gt;Dragonscale Expedition&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nZones.\nFour of them are leveling zones, while the fifth, the Forbidden Reach, is the starting zone for &lt;a href=\"dracthyr%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"evoker\"&gt;evoker&lt;/a&gt;s. Players have to go through the zones in order, starting in the Reach/Shores, and ending in Thaldraszus. The progression is vertical, with the Shores being located at the base of the Isles, while Thaldraszus is located at its apex. The expansion's storyline runs through each of the zones sequentially. Exploration within the zones themselves, however, is comparatively non-linear.\nGetting to the Dragon Isles.\nPlayers get to the Dragon Isles via a boat from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and a gunship from &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying an expedition of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Reliquary\"&gt;Reliquary&lt;/a&gt; to the rediscovered land.\nWild creatures.\nIn the Dragon Isles there are creatures with draconic elements to them because of the magic of the space\u2013the draconic energy causing evolutions to the creatures over the years to give some of them scales, frills, or additional spikes. Some of the known such creatures are &lt;a href=\"argali\"&gt;argali&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hornswog\"&gt;hornswog&lt;/a&gt;, a specific type of &lt;a href=\"mammoth\"&gt;mammoth&lt;/a&gt; on the Dragon Isles and &lt;a href=\"ottuk\"&gt;ottuk&lt;/a&gt;.\nDevelopment.\nThe Dragon Isles were conceived as a \"vertical space\" from the outset. This was felt to \"suit the fantasy of the location.\" The zones were designed to be more compact than other regions.\nAssociate Art Director for \"Dragonflight\" &lt;a href=\"Tina%20Wang\"&gt;Tina Wang&lt;/a&gt; described the Isles as being larger than &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; in-game.\nOriginal concept.\nThe Dragon Isles were originally conceptualized during the development of \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" but were cut early on. They were intended to be located &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Lordaeron\"&gt;north of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and west of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, as a level 65-70 zone with a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;. They were also planned to host temples to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. Some early maps also labeled the isles with the name \"&lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;\", implying she would be present.\nSome working assets labeled \"Dragon Isles\" are still present in the game files. They were added during the \"World of Warcraft\" beta and are used only in a test zone named &lt;a href=\"Designer%20Island\"&gt;Designer Island&lt;/a&gt;. The set consists of a large nautilus-shaped temple as well as three caves with structures built over the entrances. A &lt;a href=\"hermit%20crab\"&gt;hermit crab&lt;/a&gt;-shaped temple had also been designed but did not make it to the game files. The nautilus-shaped Old God temple is also present on a piece of concept artwork simply labeled \"Dragon Isles\" included in both \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Art%20of%20World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;The Art of World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and the &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20credits\"&gt;original in-game credits&lt;/a&gt;.\nDespite being cut even before the \"World of Warcraft\" beta, the small islands still appeared, unlabeled, on the in-game &lt;a href=\"World%20Map\"&gt;World Map&lt;/a&gt; just north of Lordaeron until they were removed in '. It was only in ' that the first &lt;a href=\"canon\"&gt;canon&lt;/a&gt;ical mention of the Dragon Isles was made, before they were finally introduced in \"\".\nThe concept of red dragons living on islands north of Lordaeron is consistent with the stating that dragons are native to \"the untamed &lt;a href=\"northlands\"&gt;northlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\". The idea of Alexstrasza inhabiting an island near the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; was also seen in the canceled \"\", in which she lived in a cave on &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Soggoth%20the%20Slitherer\"&gt;Soggoth the Slitherer&lt;/a&gt;'s remains at the &lt;a href=\"Master%27s%20Glaive\"&gt;Master's Glaive&lt;/a&gt; and the giant kraken temple in the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;Shrine of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; both closely resemble the Dragon Isles temple concept."}

It is here that the remaining aspects -- &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, and Thrall -- have gathered to empower the Dragon Soul -- Azeroth's last chance to stop the great behemoth.

Players must thwart the attacking forces long enough for Thrall to charge the Dragon Soul.\"\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Forged by Deathwing during the War of the Ancients, the Dragon Soul harnessed the combined power of the dragonflights until it was ultimately destroyed. Through the Caverns of Time, Thrall and the remaining dragonflights were able to recover the powerful artifact before its destruction. Now they have rallied at Wyrmrest Temple in a desperate attempt to use the might of the Dragon Soul against Deathwing himself.\"\nEncounters.\n\"Deathwing seeks to destroy Wyrmrest Temple and end the lives of the Dragon Aspects and Thrall.\"\n\"Deathwing must be destroyed, or all is lost.\nStoryline.\nThe raid picks up right where the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; instance finishes. &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; are now nearby &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; and raiders begin by attempting to relieve the beleaguered Aspects under siege by the Twilight's Hammer, the Twilight dragonflight and the Black dragonflight. Along with an army of mortal races and dragons led by you battle your way through the army and stop an earth elemental at the base of &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;. is pounding at the foundations of the spire trying to level it. \nOnce inside Wyrmrest &lt;a href=\"Tyrygosa\"&gt;Tyrygosa&lt;/a&gt; explains that Deathwing has summoned extremely powerful Faceless ones to assault the Temple as well, and Maws of the Old Gods are erupting from the nearby earth. Once they're dead the temple is all but reclaimed and the Aspects decide now its the time to strike. However upon meeting with them Thrall explains that using the full power of the Dragon Soul would likely kill him in the process, but &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; believes they can use the &lt;a href=\"Focusing%20Iris\"&gt;Focusing Iris&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Eye of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; to stabilize it. The Twilight's Hammer knew about the weakness and sent several of their most powerful shamans under the leadership of to ambush the heroes at the Eye. Once Hagara is defeated the Focusing Iris is taken back to Wrymrest. As the Aspects want to empower the Dragon Soul Deathwing realizes what's happening and sends dozens of twilight drakes to stop them. Once the drakes are defeated the Aspects begin to empower the Dragon Soul with their own energies. With their focus on the Dragon Soul, Deathwing sends his ultimate minion to finish them off - the ultimate Twilight dragon experiment who is meant to cause the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt; by slaying the Dragon Aspects at this juncture. After his defeat the Dragon Soul is fully charged and Thrall unleashs it at Deathwing, blowing one of the elementium plates off his back. Realizing that the battle is lost, Deathwing destroys a &lt;a href=\"Gunship\"&gt;Horde Gunship&lt;/a&gt; and flies off to the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt; so that he can escape into the relative safety of Deepholm. The Aspects, the heroes, and the surviving crew board &lt;a href=\"The%20Skyfire\"&gt;The Skyfire&lt;/a&gt; and chase after Deathwing. On the way, Twilight's Hammer drake riders, led by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; , harry them. When the Skyfire catches up the drakes attack the Skyfire's engines and allow Deathwing to escape. The heroes manage to kill all of the drakes and Warmaster Blackhorn, then repair the engines and resume their chase.\nUpon catching up to Deathwing &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;they parachute onto his back&lt;/a&gt; and begin to rip off the armor plates and prying a hole big enough to give Thrall a clean shot with the Dragon Soul, this time burning a hole through his chest. Deathwing plummets into the Maelstrom and is presumed dead. The players and the Aspects land at the Maelstrom. As they celebrate the defeat of Deathwing, Nozdormu warns them to be quick, as Deathwing re-emerges shortly afterwards. The final stage of the raid begins when &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's deformed body&lt;/a&gt; rises out of the Maelstrom to face off against the players in the final showdown with many phases. The first phase is moving around the isles around the Maelstrom. Players have to fight his claws, wings, tail alone and the tentacles. Once Deathwing is weakened the Aspects channel all their remaining powers into the Dragon Soul and fire it at Deathwing, completely \"unmaking\" him but also making them mortals. With the loss of &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;'s powers, the Dragon Soul was returned back in time to the point where it was taken.\nNotes.\nRaid Finder.\nDragon Soul is the first raid instance to support the &lt;a href=\"Raid%20Finder\"&gt;Raid Finder&lt;/a&gt; feature. When entered at the Raid Finder difficulty level, the following changes apply:\nPower of the Aspects.\nEffective beginning the completion of server maintenance for the week of January 31st, 2012, the debuff \"&lt;a href=\"Power%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Power of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;\" is applied to all enemies in Dragon Soul, which reduces their health and damage dealt. The spell can be disabled by talking to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Devrestrasz\"&gt;Lord Devrestrasz&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of Dragon Soul if a raid wishes to attempt the encounters without the aid of the Dragon Aspects.\nHeroic Restrictions.\nIt is not possible to start heroic-mode &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Spine of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Madness of Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; if any of the members of the raid have defeated any of the previous bosses in normal mode during that lockout.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The term DKP is also frequently used to designate raid-level &lt;a href=\"loot%20system\"&gt;loot system&lt;/a&gt; in general. The most popular systems for endgame loot distribution are point-based (and thus DKP systems). The very first endgame loot distribution system was developed by the guild Afterlife in 1999 and named for the original two EverQuest end bosses, both of whom were dragons. Beginning in \"Wrath of the Lich King\" various systems and tools began to be implemented that saw DKP gradually become redundant and ultimately largely abandoned by the bulk of the WoW Community. From the advent of vendor-bought epic gear, to Dungeon Finder, Raid Finder, Mythic difficulty dungeons, and Personal Loot. With \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" retiring all other loot methods besides Personal, it seems that DKP will likely meet its final end.\nEQ origins.\nFrom &lt;a href=\"http%3A//eqdkp.com/%3Fp%3Dabout\"&gt;EQDKP - About&lt;/a&gt;:\nDKP automation.\nMost guilds using a formal &lt;a href=\"loot%20system\"&gt;loot system&lt;/a&gt; will use a website to communicate current standings to their members. There is a plethora of ways to do this ranging from simple lists updated manually, to highly tailored full-fledged graphic mods. When setting up such a system it helps to keep it simple at first, and not to get carried away with fancy features and time-consuming projects.\nThe technically simplest method of dealing with DKP is to just have a list on the guild forums or a flat html file in which the standings are manually updated. The disadvantage of this solution is that there will be no item history, and it's not easy to do fast searches while raiding. Updating can also be time-consuming and error-prone. If a simple system (like &lt;a href=\"Suicide%20Kings\"&gt;Suicide Kings&lt;/a&gt;) is used, this approach may still be appropriate.\nThe vast majority of raids though use some ingame mod to collect data, and a website with a database to display the statistics. These &lt;a href=\"DKPSoft\"&gt;DKPSoft&lt;/a&gt; systems need some time to set up, and a little learning on how to use them, but offer a lot of nice features, and are quite safe and simple to use.\nThe most popular such systems are &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.eqdkp.com/\"&gt;eqDKP&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.bbdkp.com/\"&gt;bbDkp&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost are PHP/MySQL based, thus need a website supporting that. \neqDKP is something like a gold standard, the grandfather of all such systems. It is rather well documented, and sports support forums on its website. It's not a bad idea to simply start there if there are no specific reasons to use one of the other systems. \nA recently popular dkp system is called GDKP or originally created as &lt;a href=\"Perfect%20dkp\"&gt;Perfect dkp&lt;/a&gt; which is essentially a zero sum gold exchange system.\nIf you wish to integrate your DKP within a phpBB3 forum then you can use &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.bbdkp.com\"&gt;bbDKP&lt;/a&gt;, includes multiple dkp pools, multiple guild support, headcount &amp; ct_raidtracker import, bossprogress, automated guild application template, bbTips plugin with item, itemico, spell, quest, achievement tootltips, Guild roster with Armory update. Games supported : WoW, Aion, EQ2, Lotro, FFxi\nSome live DKP standings examples:\nOther Popular Systems\nThere are also addons that use Officer/Public notes to handle DKP. As such DKPs are tracked in real time and everyone has the latest standings readily available, in the expense on not being able to handle DKP tracking for people outside the guild:\nAnd there are also systems that don't use the Officer/Public notes, but keep their own storage mechanism:\nScientific research on DKP systems.\nMeanwhile, the economics of MMORPGs in general, and the loot distribution systems in particular, have become the subject of scientific research.

It was created in response to DKP in the hope of creating a system as popular as DKP, but without many of the faults it has\nThe Faults of a Dragon Kill Points system.\nA few years back when the concept of raiding was introduced in Massively multiplayer online role-playing games, Dragon Kill Points were introduced as a currency to promote the amount of raiding done by guild members. However &lt;a href=\"DKP\"&gt;DKP&lt;/a&gt; had some great flaws in it;\nFirstly there was a great chance of a member or group of members getting far ahead on DKP than others, thus dominating the system, this is likely when comparing people who have been in the guild for greater leangths of time than others, this was balanced by modifying the DKP worth of a kill to the total of its items DKP value, divided by the number of members in the raid. However this never created a truely stable system, and though it was less likely for a member to outpass his guild members by quite as much, it still happened very regularly.\nSecondly, it does not accommodate the respective play times of its members. It is very unlikely to have a guild where every member can attend every raid scheduled, many do not have time on specific days to raid, from work, education or other reasons. This means the people with the highest activity could attend more raids and thus get more DKP,\nThirdly. DKP has very few methods of giving new members an equal chance to get items as \"veterans\", this can greatly stem a guilds growth.\nFinally, though there are others. DKP can made a guild DKP based, with members with nothing more to gain from a raid, going there and often denying other members who needed loot from the raid a place, just to farm some DKP. This happens lots with Officers and Leaders demanding to be in raids.\nSo instead of constantly trying to decrease the problems DKP causes, a new system, DKR or Dragon Kill Reputation was introduced, hoping to address DKP's flaws in the best way possible\nHow Does DKR Work?\nThe basis is very similar to DKP, you attend raids and kill bosses to earn points, however in DKR it is not a currency, it is more of a reputation bar.\nThe amount of DKR you have effects the chance you have of winning loot in raids, but can never assure you win. In World of Warcraft, the code for the role would be /roll 1-(your DKR), for example if i had 131 DKR it would be /roll 1-131, this generates a random number between 1 and 131, this helps people will less DKR gear up, but still favours the people who contribute most.\nAgainst the player is a torrent of -DKR, there is an amount deducted per day on default, the amount should be linked to the amount of raids a guild organises per week, a guild that raids less should charge less than a guild that raids daily, this makes people in the first guild not be repeatedly buffeted by an amount of -DKR that they cannot replace under the current raid timetable, which would make a guild sink into heavy -DKR, but helps force people in the latter guild to participate. This helps new members joining the guild to be equal in the competition, if a new member cannot compete with older members for DKR the -DKR torrent it too low and must be increased\nThe amount of DKR gained from various things should be done by the guild master with such values that it would be difficult to get way ahead of your -DKR \n-DKR increases by your DKR, the guild should set boarders at an amount of DKR they think will be hard to reach, though not impossible, people above this amount should be charged much more -DKR, so they cannot get too far ahead but they still have no limit to their DKR\nRaids done by people who are known to have obtained almost all of the gear and equipment they need from a raid gain decreased DKR for attending that raid than members with some items left to gain, recommended about 1/4 to 1/2 of the DKR gain. This stops people scavenging DKR from easy raids. If a person can only name 2 or less improvements they would get from direct drops they count as above the raid, unless they are leading they should step down to allow other less geared members take their spot if required\nAs in some strains of DKP, DKR can be used as both a punishment and a reward for various things, giving a guild leader more ways to moderate the guild, instead of just promoting or sin-binning them or complete removal from guild, the guild leader may hand out small amounts of DKR and -DKR, however the guild leader must be fair and not reward themselves any or very much, a deputy or board of officers can help decide if the guild leader should be able to award themselves DKR on an event by event basis.\nIf someone goes below 1 DKR they cannot roll on items until they are above 1 DKR \nUnlike in DKP a player may become invunerable to -DKR, if the player is not going to be able to raid from a holiday or regular absence on certain days, they may arrange for them not to receive -DKR on the days they will not be avalible, however if they do raid within that time they gain no DKR or loot. Even frozen DKR should still have a small amount of -DKR however, between 15 and 5 times less than a normal person of their DKR would get\nItems have no DKR value, you do not \"pay\" for an item. However the raid leader should still moderate the rolls to stop ninja looting. Offspec rolls and similar things should not happen if there is someone who needs it Main Spec\nAdvantages and Disadvantages.\nAdvantages of Dragon Kill Reputation\nIt can increase the amount of people attending raids and increase the effort put into them\nIt allows newer players to hop into the competition easily\nLuck always plays a part so it is impossible to dominate the rolls completly, people do not fail to attend a raid because of the knowledge they will not get any loot\nIt accommodates peoples varying play times, though still giving a slight drain to encourage raiding over slacking\nPeople are not discouraged from rolling on items they could use in the hope of a superior drop later on, in DKR the player can roll on both items, thus it does not stem raid progression\nDKR has much better protection against inflation than DKP\nDisadvantages of Dragon Kill Reputation\nThere are currently no programs online that calculate your DKR for you\nThere is less incentive to get ahead of everyone else\nThe DKR system was created by Iksf"}

Such places are rare, and these dragons are sometimes imprisoned forcefully by &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;s wanting to use their offspring as beasts of war.\nSecond War.\nMighty chains of &lt;a href=\"adamantine\"&gt;adamantine&lt;/a&gt; steel bounded the most powerful creature in all of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; the Dragon Queen. Captured and ensorcelled by &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; contrived by the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;, the great &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;Dragon&lt;/a&gt; was kept in a constant state of weakness and pain. As the unwilling slave of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen was closely watched as she laid her precious eggs. The Dragonmaw clan then raised her young to fight for the Horde - slaying the &lt;a href=\"Drake\"&gt;whelps&lt;/a&gt; when they became too powerful to be properly controlled. Constant efforts were made to break Alexstrasza's will in an attempt to master the control of more &lt;a href=\"Wyrm\"&gt;mature&lt;/a&gt; dragons.\nDespite the description of the building implying that Alexstrasza was the only dragon enslaved for her eggs, many dragon roosts could be seen in the later missions of both human and orc campaigns of '. The ' campaign also introduced &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; as a dragon voluntarily aiding the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, along with his &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;flight&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nIn \"\" the Dragon Roost was a neutral building which allowed dragons to be called forth as &lt;a href=\"mercenary\"&gt;mercenary&lt;/a&gt; units.

There were originally five different colors of dragons, one for each of the main &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, but \"The Frozen Throne\" added a sixth one for the &lt;a href=\"Nether%20dragon\"&gt;Nether dragon&lt;/a&gt;s. The colors of the dragons varied depending on the tileset of the map, with the Nether dragon broodmother fittingly looking like a &lt;a href=\"Black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; dragon.\n&lt;a href=\"Blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;Blue&lt;/a&gt; dragons had a Frost Breath ability which slowed unit for 10 seconds like a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;Bronze&lt;/a&gt; dragons had a Lightning Attack. Otherwise, the different colors of dragons were the same and their stats were identical.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; forces in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had several dragon roosts, as well as the members of &lt;a href=\"Garithos%27%20Elite%20Guard\"&gt;Garithos' Elite Guard&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThe original dragon roost from the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; can still be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Lifebinder%27s%20Cell\"&gt;Lifebinder's Cell&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;.

They are the mount of choice for most native &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt;, who have long sought mounts that embody their values: patience and strength. With a naturally armored hide, even gait, and a relaxed attitude that welcomes long journeys, dragon turtles are the perfect mounts for pandaren adventurers. They are easily outfitted with adventure essentials (like maps, cushions, and brew-storage), and their slow stride can ease their passengers both into new parts of the world and into a relaxing nap. In addition, their low stance means the rider experiences no bounce or jostle, even when cornering sharply. However, while dragon turtles appear slow at a glance, when handled by an experienced rider they can move fast enough to keep pace with even the swiftest &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolves&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are six colors available for purchase in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, namely Green, Black, Blue, Brown, Purple and Red.

It has a primal and fearsome appearance. Though squat, it stands 10 feet high. Some &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; captured and trained a few dragon turtles to augment their soldiers, but this tactic is not widespread. Though some thought &lt;a href=\"turtle\"&gt;turtle&lt;/a&gt;s were slow and unimpressive, this creature proves that thought wrong.\nA dragon turtle can swallow opponents large or small and can hold either 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or smaller opponents in their gullet at one time."}

The keep is a rotating major community objective, with the Obsidian Outcasts launching a massive siege of the area to re-establish their holding over the area and eject the Djaradin from their home. Players can lend their aid to this objective every few hours, allowing them to re-establish the keep as a safe area and receive leveled-loot from the chest at the end of the siege.\nWhile the Keep is under Djaradin control, it can be very dangerous to traverse the area; as the Qalashi will man the &lt;a href=\"Qalashi%20Wingshredder\"&gt;wingshredders&lt;/a&gt; upon the walls, placing a rapidly stacking debuff on any player that flies over it.

Approximately two years after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, it was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"plague%20of%20undeath\"&gt;plague of undeath&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nAfter making landfall at the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; on his hunt for &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; moved his ships and troops north and west to Dragonblight; here the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; emissary conveyed &lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;' order to recall the expedition, and here Arthas had his ships destroyed, trapping his forces in Northrend. A few days later, Mal'Ganis attacked his encampment with overwhelming numbers, prompting him to seek out &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne%20Cavern\"&gt;a cavern&lt;/a&gt; to the north.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; Arthas returned to Northrend after having destroyed the northern regions of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, answering the Lich King's call to fight &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, his first base camp was on the southern coast of Dragonblight.\nDescription from site.\n\"For millennia the Great Dragonblight has served as the enduring heart of Northrend.\nHere dense forests surround a vast Arctic wasteland littered with the massive, gleaming bones of perished dragons. In the center of this frozen expanse lies &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a structure believed to be built by the world-shaping titans shortly after &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s creation. Many legends hold that the five great Dragon Aspects were blessed within this fortress and given their charge to watch over the budding world. Perhaps it is for this reason that dragons nearing the end of their lives come to the Dragonblight to enrich the land with their passing.\nSurrounding Wyrmrest Temple are five majestic dragon shrines: red, bronze, green, blue, and black, each blessed with the powers of its respective flight. In recent times the undead Scourge has laid siege to these shrines in an effort to further its attempts at raising terrifying new variations of undead dragons to serve the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn an attempt to arrest these invasions, the red Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, has begun recruiting heroes to aid in the fight against the Scourge, even as the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; wage their own desperate battles against the undead. The one-time &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, now the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Scarlet Onslaught&lt;/a&gt;, has arrived as well in the hopes of claiming victory in their ongoing campaign against the Lich King and his minions.\nBoth the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; have begun establishing a presence in the Dragonblight, taking a particular interest in the barred entrance to Icecrown, &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;. There both factions have begun gearing up for the siege that will inevitably lead into the lair of the Lich King himself.\nThe immediate dangers of the Dragonblight are posed not only by the Lich King, however, but also by the blue dragonflight. Determined to manipulate all existing magic to serve his own purposes, the blue Dragon Aspect, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt;, has ordered his flight to maneuver colossal machines into key positions over magical &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt; clusters. Many believe that these dire constructs are intended to realign the paths of magical energy that course beneath the earth. If successful, Malygos's tampering could result in an ecological and magical catastrophe that would threaten not only the stability of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately the equilibrium of the entire world.\"\nAlthough mostly a chilly snowfield, Dragonblight contain several locations with radically different terrain. The most notable are perhaps the dragonshrines having lava (&lt;a href=\"Obsidian%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Obsidian Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;), tropical forest (&lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Emerald Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;) and desert (&lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;).\nCataclysm era.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s death, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; invaded Wyrmrest Temple, resulting in a battle of the four dragonflights against the cultists.\nDragonblight is where the majority of the final battle against &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and his allies took place, and its &lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;future version&lt;/a&gt; can also be visited via &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;-era region featured in the instances is mostly unchanged by the Cataclysm, the only notable change is a presence of three maws: &lt;a href=\"Go%27rath\"&gt;Go'rath&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Shu%27ma\"&gt;Shu'ma&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maw%20of%20Destruction\"&gt;Maw of Destruction&lt;/a&gt;, that have surrounded Wyrmrest Temple and burrowed their tentacles inside the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nMists of Pandaria.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Alliance-Horde%20war\"&gt;Alliance-Horde war&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Okrut%20Dragonwaste\"&gt;Okrut Dragonwaste&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Dragonwaste%20Enslaver\"&gt;enslavers&lt;/a&gt; arrived to the Dragonblight to capture and subjugate dragons in the name of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, a large part of the &lt;a href=\"Deaths%20of%20Chromie\"&gt;Deaths of Chromie&lt;/a&gt; scenario took place in the Dragonblight, visiting the different &lt;a href=\"dragonshrine\"&gt;dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that as the dragons have dispersed now on their own business; all the &lt;a href=\"dragonshrine\"&gt;dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s stand empty.\nGeography.\nDragonblight is the keystone of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the center of its southern shore. It's an expanse of glaring white glaciers, interrupted by mountain peaks and a massive graveyard of &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; bones. The ice and bones make for a suitable landscape, but there's no glacier deep enough to bury the history of Dragonblight. It is a land of endless strife and death, and betrayal after betrayal.\nDotting the wasteland are &lt;a href=\"Dragonshrine\"&gt;Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s to each of the dragonflights, where a number of dragons go when their lives are at an end.\nTravel hubs.\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20Hold\"&gt;Fordragon Hold&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Stars%27%20Rest\"&gt;Stars' Rest&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Wintergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Wintergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=\"Flight%20path\"&gt;Flight path&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;"}

Under his leadership the clan finally gained the upper hand against its foes and in a coordinated offensive, the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; attacked and drove the &lt;a href=\"jalgar\"&gt;jalgar&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Kalimdor's&lt;/a&gt; lush central forests.\n15,000 years ago, the clan found themselves afflicted by the &lt;a href=\"curse%20of%20flesh\"&gt;curse of flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Ymiron blamed the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s and then tried to purge the \u201cweakness\u201d from his own people.\nWhen vrykul women began giving birth to small, malformed children - a development that spread fear and superstition among the vrykul clans, Ymiron blamed the absent &lt;a href=\"Titanic%20watcher\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; for it. He ordered the &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;weak and ugly children&lt;/a&gt; born to Dragonflayer women be killed, but some vrykul could not bear to do it and secreted them away to &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, where legends told that other vrykul had fled there with &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; long ago. In an effort to stave off the curse of flesh, the Dragonflayers went to sleep beneath &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in facilities such as &lt;a href=\"Gjalerbron\"&gt;Gjalerbron&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nShortly before the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the slumbering vrykul awakened. Many of them would come to believe that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was a god of death, such as the Dragonflayer clan, and pledged themselves to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the war, they began attacking &lt;a href=\"Valgarde\"&gt;Valgarde&lt;/a&gt;, the primary &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; fortresses in eastern &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. They captured a number of Alliance soldiers and either left them impaled or imprisoned in &lt;a href=\"Wyrmskull%20Village\"&gt;Wyrmskull Village&lt;/a&gt;. They were also making plans to attack &lt;a href=\"Westguard%20Keep\"&gt;Westguard Keep&lt;/a&gt;; the details of the plans were in the hands of &lt;a href=\"Yanis%20the%20Mystic\"&gt;Yanis the Mystic&lt;/a&gt;. However, he was killed and the &lt;a href=\"Dragonflayer%20Battle%20Plans\"&gt;Dragonflayer Battle Plans&lt;/a&gt; were retrieved.\nSome Dragonflayer pitted their prisoners against powerful vrykul gladiators, then threw out their corpses for a necromancer to raise as ghouls when they lost.An Alliance force entered the Utgarde Catacombs where this was taking place, freeing the prisoners and defying the vrykul champions in &lt;a href=\"The%20Ring%20of%20Judgment\"&gt;The Ring of Judgment&lt;/a&gt;. They also took the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Cipher\"&gt;Ancient Cipher&lt;/a&gt;.\nYet another faction of the clan led by &lt;a href=\"Skeld%20Drakeson\"&gt;Skeld Drakeson&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the Ember clutch to breed &lt;a href=\"Proto-Whelp\"&gt;Proto-Whelps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Proto-Drake\"&gt;Red Proto-Drakes&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ember%20Clutch%20Ancient\"&gt;Ember Clutch Ancient&lt;/a&gt; charged an adventurer with driving them out.\n&lt;a href=\"Queen%20Angerboda\"&gt;Queen Angerboda&lt;/a&gt; was found by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to be awakening her husband &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt;. She was killed before she could finish the task and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; spirited the still-dormant king away to &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Pinnacle\"&gt;Utgarde Pinnacle&lt;/a&gt;, promising that if her killers were foolish enough to follow him there, he would have the chance to avenge his wife.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Apothecary%20Society\"&gt;Royal Apothecary Society&lt;/a&gt; designed a new &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt;, capable of killing all life in Halgrind. Thorvald, the chieftain of the town, fled when the Forsaken took the city. The remaining vrykul, while not dropping dead from exposure, found themselves trapped and slowly killed. He was killed later for his blood.\nThe Dragonflayers in &lt;a href=\"Voldrune\"&gt;Voldrune&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; imbued talismans with flame to control proto-drakes. As the vrykul prepared for war, they were killed by adventurers who took command of &lt;a href=\"Flamebringer\"&gt;Flamebringer&lt;/a&gt; to kill &lt;a href=\"Thane%20Torvald%20Eriksson\"&gt;Thane Torvald Eriksson&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventurers ventured into the &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Keep%20%28instance%29\"&gt;halls of Utgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Utgarde%20Pinnacle\"&gt;its pinnacle&lt;/a&gt; to permanently remove the threat posed by the Dragonflayer. Despite fighting alongside a few members of the &lt;a href=\"Ymirjar\"&gt;Ymirjar&lt;/a&gt;, the elite army of vrykul loyal to the Lich King, they were almost entirely wiped out. In the end, even their king, Ymiron, would fall at the invaders' hands.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAccording to reports from &lt;a href=\"Westguard%20Keep\"&gt;Westguard Keep&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the vrykul of Howling Fjord were keeping to themselves."}

They are typically led and made up primarily by their respective color's dragons; though they also include lesser dragonkin such as &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; and even mortals. In early history, there were many dragonflights (there were dragons in every color of the rainbow), yet there were five flights that held dominion over their brethren. It was these five flights that the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s chose to shepherd the budding world. The leaders of each group were called the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, the Great Aspects, or simply the Aspects. The five great dragonflights are identified by their coloration: black, blue, bronze, green, and red.\nLesser dragonflights and organizations beyond the main five also exist, which are usually off-shoots of the other flights in some capacity. Since the fall of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the dragons, including the former Aspects and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; herself, have apparently lost most of their power, along with most of their eggs in the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; sanctums and their ability to further reproduce.\nMembers of all the dragonflights used to intermingle a lot, but after the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Wars\"&gt;Dragon Wars&lt;/a&gt;, most flights now keep to themselves. This did not affect the various lesser dragonkin left behind on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;; who appear to have been spared from the horrors that divided their kind.\nPrimary.\nThere were once many more dragonflights, but eventually five rose to prominence as the others declined:\nOther draconic groups.\nSeveral other organizations have cropped up, some of which claim to be dragonflights themselves. Most of them are offshoots of other dragonflights, predominantly the black dragonflight.\nIn the RPG.\nDragons group in five dragonflights that claim ancestry to the greatest of their kind. Each color is proud of its heritage and lineage and remembers the name of all those who have gone before. These flights are further separated into small family groups known as broods. Each occupies and holds territory within Azeroth\u2018s less populated areas. Some are commonly seen; others have nearly been driven to extinction by wars among their own kind. \nEach of these five flights keeps secrets of its own and adheres to separate ideologies from the rest. They are led by powerful entities known as Aspects, one from each color, who rule over their flights as powerful gods looking down on their less fortunate descendants. For the most part, all dragons are of the same species with similar bone structure, anatomy, and physical capacity. Each flight, however, is distinct with different goals, interests, and ideals. The cautious traveler remembers the ancient words spoken by one of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s most powerful mages: Let sleeping dragons lie."}

They are deft predators that rend their foes with razor-sharp talons. Their scales are smooth and slippery, and few have the skill to ride one without a saddle. Dragonhawks are among the deadliest known predators. They are able to spot prey from great distances, rush in, and rend with both talon and beak. In addition, they're capable of breathing fire.\nDragonhawks liberated from troll enslavement are considered among the most loyal of all their kin.\nBackground.\nThird War.\nDragonhawk riders were high elven and blood elven warriors mounted on a dragonhawk. The fierce warriors of the dragonhawk battalions were often the first into combat, picking apart the enemy ranks and surrounding enemy towers with dense fog so that reinforcements can strike unhindered by enemy defenses. The dragonhawk riders followed Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and later to his campaign to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDragonhawks were introduced to World of Warcraft in the \"&lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion. They are seen mainly in &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt;, but stronger dragonhawks are found in &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;. \nDragonhawks are very rare indeed, and they are most often seen in Eversong Woods, home of the blood elves. Beautiful creatures, dragonhawks are sought after by hunters from around the world, even though their stats rarely outshine those of more savage beasts.\nFlight paths.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.0\"&gt;Patch 2.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Isle of Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt; was opened, and dragonhawks are used as the main taxi from the island to the mainland, as well as for bombing runs in the &lt;a href=\"Dead%20Scar\"&gt;Dead Scar&lt;/a&gt; and on the Dawnblade flotilla off the northern coast. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.4.3\"&gt;Patch 2.4.3&lt;/a&gt;, dragonhawks also replaced the &lt;a href=\"bat\"&gt;bat&lt;/a&gt;s at the &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tranquillien\"&gt;Tranquillien&lt;/a&gt; flight paths - which was the original intention for the Quel'Thalas flight paths (around the time when BC was just released, guards would say that the Silvermoon flight master was tending to the dragonhawks).\nAs a mount.\nA rideable dragonhawk is now available as of &lt;a href=\"3.0.8\"&gt;3.0.8&lt;/a&gt; as a reward for completing the &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20o%27%20Mounts\"&gt;Mountain o' Mounts&lt;/a&gt; achievement, which requires the player to collect 100 different mounts. The reward is either a &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Dragonhawk%20Mount\"&gt;Blue Dragonhawk Mount&lt;/a&gt; for Alliance, or a &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragonhawk%20Mount\"&gt;Red Dragonhawk Mount&lt;/a&gt; for Horde. Both are 280% speed mounts.\nIn patch &lt;a href=\"3.2.0\"&gt;3.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, Horde players were also given the &lt;a href=\"Sunreaver%20Dragonhawk\"&gt;Sunreaver Dragonhawk&lt;/a&gt; as a reward from the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Tournament\"&gt;Argent Tournament&lt;/a&gt;. It costs 150 &lt;a href=\"Champion%27s%20Seal\"&gt;Champion's Seal&lt;/a&gt; and requires you to be exalted with &lt;a href=\"the%20Sunreavers\"&gt;the Sunreavers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a companion pet.\nA Dragonhawk Hatchling is a recently born dragonhawk. These creatures can be purchased in different colors as a companion. They are classified as dragonkin battle pets.\nAs a hunter pet.\nDragonhawks are a family of &lt;a href=\"Cunning%20pets\"&gt;Cunning pets&lt;/a&gt; in World of Warcraft. &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;Blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s start with a dragonhawk as their first pet. Dragonhawks share their special ability (although different in appearance) with the &lt;a href=\"wind%20serpent\"&gt;wind serpent&lt;/a&gt;s. They, through their use of their &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Breath\"&gt;Fire Breath&lt;/a&gt;, breathe Fire on the target, increasing magic damage taken by 8% for 45 sec. This ability is very usefull for &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;. They are only found in areas that require the \"\" expansion to enter.\nTwo new rare dragonhawks were added in &lt;a href=\"patch%205.1.0\"&gt;patch 5.1.0&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Sunwing\"&gt;Sunwing&lt;/a&gt; flies in &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href=\"Manas\"&gt;Manas&lt;/a&gt; roams amongst wildkin in southeastern &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nDragonhawks are vicious flying predators. They are swift and deft, able to crack bones and pierce hides with their mighty beaked jaws. They can be trained as aerial mounts and seem to have a particular affinity with high elves (and now blood elves), and are often trained by them. Majestic and magnificent creatures, dragonhawks and their elf riders, resplendent in lacquered dragonhide armor, make an impressive sight.\nThis large &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; could carry away a man - on its back, or in its talons. These hawk-like creatures are impressive. Its feathers show brilliant streaks of color on its wings and tail, but its most remarkable feature is its head, which seems like a combination of an &lt;a href=\"hawk\"&gt;hawk&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt;. Its strong beak gleams wickedly. Straight, colored horns that match its plumage sprout from the beast's head.\nAs their name implies, dragonhawks resemble a cross between a hawk and a dragon. They look much like large hawks with dragonlike heads and a few other draconic characteristics - long neck, sleek body and large wings. Dragonhawk plumage is brown with touches of blue and red.\nDragonhawks are able predators. They prefer diving attacks, snatching prey in their talons to devour at their leisure. When trained, they readily fight in tandem with a skilled rider."}

They are useful against towers using the &lt;a href=\"%23Cloud\"&gt;Cloud&lt;/a&gt; ability.\nInformation.\nDragonhawk Riders are fairly uncommon amongst Human players, mainly because they lack the offensive power that the &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20Rider%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gryphon Rider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Flying%20Machine%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Flying Machines&lt;/a&gt; possess. However, they are excellent against taking down heavily fortified towns and heavy air units.\nDragonhawk Riders have a fairly decent Piercing attack allowing them to deal with various units that the Gryphon Riders and Flying Machines may have trouble dealing with, such as &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, who are spell immune and are protected from magic attacks.\nCloud prevents enemy towers from attacking in the targeted area for 30 seconds - more than enough for your other units to batter through them before they can resume attacking again. If an enemy player attempts to defend themselves with numerous towers, have several Dragonhawk Riders use Cloud on them, effectively rendering them useless for the duration of the spell. Make sure to have a &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Paladin&lt;/a&gt; heal them in case the enemy attempts to target the Dragonhawk Rider.\nAerial Shackles is an anti-air spell which deals 40 damage every second for 30 seconds in total, for a total of 1,200 damage. As the name suggests, it only works on enemy aerial units. The damage and duration of the spell ensure that if not interrupted, it will kill a light aerial unit and severely weaken a heavy one to the point that it can be killed quickly by other attacks. This spell is particularly useful at taking down any aerial threats to a player or team's army, such as &lt;a href=\"Chimaera%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Chimaeras&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Wyrm%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Frost Wyrms&lt;/a&gt;. They can also be used on &lt;a href=\"Gargoyle%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Gargoyles&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Hippogryph%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hippogryphs&lt;/a&gt; if needed.\nSpells and abilities.\nCloud.\nDo not move the Dragonhawk Rider while it is casting Cloud or it will stop casting Cloud.\nThis spell must be maintained by having the Dragonhawk Rider stay still while the spell is cast to get the full effect. Force the Dragonhawk Rider to run which will cancel Cloud.\nAerial Shackles.\nDo not move the Dragonhawk Rider while it is casting Aerial Shackles or it will stop casting Aerial Shackles.\nThis spell must be maintained by having the Dragonhawk Rider stay still while the spell is cast to get the full effect.

The riders are depicted with a shield and a lance, but they can also act as &lt;a href=\"archer\"&gt;archer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"bombardier\"&gt;bombardier&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nDragonhawk riders participated in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; commanded a group of dragonhawk riders that attacked the Scourge shortly before the Ranger-General's demise.\nWhen the Scourge entered the perimeter of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;, the dragonhawk riders from the city attacked the &lt;a href=\"gargoyle\"&gt;gargoyle&lt;/a&gt;s with frenzied speed. During the fight, they were healed by &lt;a href=\"Vandellor\"&gt;High Priest Vandellor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Liadrin\"&gt;priestess Liadrin&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, the riders were outnumbered.\nFollowing the end of the Third War, several units were seen accompanying &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Prince Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;. On &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, a group of dragonhawk riders and foot &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; attacked Arthas following his escape from &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. The elves were eventually killed as Arthas was aided by &lt;a href=\"Anub%27arak\"&gt;Anub'arak&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s. Arthas raised the dead elves into undeath.\nAfter Kael'thas betrayed Quel'Thalas and took control of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, several dragonhawk riders could be seen guarding the place and fighting against the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Sun%20Offensive\"&gt;Shattered Sun Offensive&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThey are the &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; version of &lt;a href=\"windrider\"&gt;windrider&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHigh elf dragonhawk rider.\nDragonhawk riders are high elf magi who take the fight to the air. The high elves use these mounted warriors as support troops, nullifying ranged fighters and battlements with their spells. They are resplendent in gold and blue armor, each helm worked in stylized wings above each ear. They bear lances and pat their majestic dragonhawk mounts in preparation for battle. Dragonhawk riders are elite aerial warriors. As magi, dragonhawk riders tend to stay above the battle, using their spells to befuddle enemies and disable potentially dangerous foes. A favorite tactic of dragonhawk riders is to cast \"fog cloud\" over enemy battlements, rendering their long-ranged attacks useless. Dragonhawk riders also use \"aerial shackles\" to disable flying opponents.\nBlood elf dragonhawk rider.\nKnown as the dragonhawks of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danas\"&gt;Quel'Danas&lt;/a&gt;, the blood elves' deadly dragonhawk units are trained to scour the infested ranges of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. From the &lt;a href=\"Gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;aeries&lt;/a&gt; of the island refuge of Quel'Danas, these elite windriders seek intruders and report on the movements of troops through the scarred forests. Battle with the dragonhawks is a sudden, confusing, and swift move to find shelter from rending talons and razor sharp arrows. The blood elves use aerial tactics and minor spell strikes from the sky to tear through their foes like a fierce wind. They often defend themselves and their mounts with &lt;a href=\"Mage%20Armor\"&gt;mage armor&lt;/a&gt; before engaging in battle. &lt;a href=\"Aquel%27Luer%27Thala\"&gt;Aquel'Luer'Thala&lt;/a&gt; is the commander of the dragonhawk riders of Quel'Danas.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Dragonhawk%20Master\"&gt;Dragonhawk Master&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ayren%20Cloudbreaker\"&gt;Ayren Cloudbreaker&lt;/a&gt; may be dragonhawk riders."}

The &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian&lt;/a&gt; also imprisoned several of Sargeras' demon followers alongside the Avatar. Most of them were dead or barely alive, and the Guardian believed that the tomb's enchanted seals would keep them contained. While it was true that the demons would never have been able to escape the structure on their own, over the millennia some of them fed on the Avatar's lingering power and regained enough strength to prowl the tomb.\nSecond War.\nWhen he arrived inside the former &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Temple of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; already knew that the tomb would be guarded, which is why he took his &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; forces inside with him, even at the risk of having to kill them himself instead of having to share the power found deep inside the ruins.\nWhen he arrived to the tomb's final room, Gul'dan broke the seals left behind by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; and that were meant to protect against any &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian race... but not against &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenic&lt;/a&gt; ones. And so he revealed creatures of darkness, coalescing into discreet writhing shapes with eyes that glowed darker than the rest, creatures so terrible that even the greater warlock was left terrified at their sight. These demons slaughtered the Stormreavers, including Gul'dan himself, and then even attacked the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; forces outside the tomb, killing many orcs before they could be stopped. One of the surviving warlocks found Gul'dan's remains as he was escaping the temple, and took his head with him. The &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; was eventually brought to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, along with tales of the terrifying defenders of the Tomb.\nThe orcs killed during the battle were eventually raised by the vile magics of the demons and kept reliving it in their undeath.\nA &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; war party made up of &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; alongside about thirty of their respective troops eventually reached the Tomb before the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Some of them were reluctant to be there after what they had heard about the tomb's defenders. Luckily for them, they encountered a single Tomb Guardian, a nightmarish demon that held the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. The demon killed many orcish warriors, and after retrieving the Scepter the survivors deemed it too dangerous to try getting the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nThe Tomb Guardians were encountered by &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; while she pursued &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who sought the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;."}

The circular stone path leading to the dais in the center of the room was a mosaic pattern outlining the yearly cycles of the moon. The Chamber was rectangular and filled with night-blooming flowers. The Temple was under leadership of &lt;a href=\"Dejahna\"&gt;Mother Dejahna&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the War, the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; attempted to open a secondary portal besides the one at the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; in the Temple in order to attack the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; on two fronts. The &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; used the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt; to close the portal and put several magical seals on the Temple.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt; caused it and most of Suramar to be blasted under the sea. Millennia later, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; would battle and managed to defeat the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Avatar of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. She then chose to imprison its corpse within the sunken Temple because of its Highborne seals which negate &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, earning it a new name. Aegwynn further warded the Tomb of Sargeras so no &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;ian race could enter it, and this is why the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; that was possessing &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt; later summoned the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; to Azeroth in the first place - orcs were unaffected.\nSecond War.\nCenturies after Aegwynn's battle, the tomb was raised during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;a new island&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan believed that the body of Sargeras contained the power to make him a god (it was, in fact, the promise of the Tomb of Sargeras that led Gul'dan to first open the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;). The warlock led his entire army, formed by the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; clans, to the islands, thus taking away about a third of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde's&lt;/a&gt; deployed forces. This action ultimately led to the Horde's defeat in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan himself was later torn apart by the Tomb's &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Guardians\"&gt;demonic guardians&lt;/a&gt;, at the very threshold of the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Eye chamber&lt;/a&gt;, and his armies destroyed by the enraged &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;. The Black Tooth Grin forces were led by &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, and had been sent by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, who had been forced to cancel the Horde's assault on Lordaeron in order to deal with Gul'dan's treachery.\nThe orcs killed during the battle were eventually raised by the vile magics of the demons, and kept reliving it in their undeath.\nEventually, &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt; sent one of his lieutenants, &lt;a href=\"Ragnok%20Bloodreaver\"&gt;Ragnok Bloodreaver&lt;/a&gt;, to accompany &lt;a href=\"Tagar%20Spinebreaker\"&gt;Tagar Spinebreaker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Wolfbrother\"&gt;Fenris Wolfbrother&lt;/a&gt; and their warriors to the Tomb of Sargeras. Their mission was to locate and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside the tomb, they were confronted by a demon, whom they promptly slew. The demon held the scepter, and it was recovered. It was then that Ragnok, the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;, threatened the orcs with death if they did not help him retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Fenris was adamant, however, and Ragnok was forced to reconsider his decision to venture into the Chamber of the Eye.\nThird War.\nMany years later, the tomb was visited by &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; who was searching for the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to destroy &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s orders. &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; tried to &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Isles%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;stop him&lt;/a&gt; from claiming the Eye, but Illidan collapsed the chamber on top of her, setting off a chain reaction that started the collapsing of the entire building. However, Maiev managed to escape.\nAftermath.\nSome time later, the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; would clear the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, its remaining artifacts were given to the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;'s custody and the structure was sealed up.\nThough his plans on failed, survived. Under the Legion's command, he was banished to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to open a gateway for a monstrous invasion force unlike anything the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; have ever faced. After being flung through the Black Gate, Gul'dan heard the familiar voice of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, who gifted the warlock with the endless knowledge of the Legion and ordered him to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras.\nOn orders from &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan would later make his way to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; to open the way for the Burning Legion to fully invade Azeroth once again, in an invasion that dwarfed even the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter spying on &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan find a small &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; rowboat. Within an hour, using Kil'jaeden's directions and fel magic to move quickly across the water, Gul'dan had reached the island that his other self had raised from the ocean depths many years prior. With ease, he dismantled the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; locks and barriers blocking the entrance into the Tomb of Sargeras before blasting the door open and swiftly plunging into the darkness.\nShortly thereafter, Khadgar entered the tomb as well after hearing the massive blast caused by the door's destruction. After evading several of the deadly magical traps laid by Gul'dan, the mage confronted the warlock in a towering chamber, and a furious battle erupted. Colossal waves of arcane and fel crashed together, threatening to ignite the air around the two combatants. Kil'jaeden's voice angrily told Gul'dan that neither of the two could die this day and that he had to withdraw. Realizing that if he did not obey, he would get cut off from the Legion immediately, the warlock shrouded himself in fel, causing Khadgar's arcane magic to unleash a blinding explosion. When he had opened his eyes again, Gul'dan was gone. A deadly cat-and-mouse game ensued, with Khadgar taunting Gul'dan in an attempt to bring him out of hiding while launching blasts of fire at random into the darkness.\nAfter a lucky shot almost reduced him to cinders, Gul'dan convinced Kil'jaeden to tell him about the power locked in the tomb and how to unleash it. Then, using this knowledge, he began deactivating the five arcane seals that had been created in the tomb by the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; of Suramar during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; using the five &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar noticed this attempt and began sending out &lt;a href=\"arcane%20elemental\"&gt;arcane elemental&lt;/a&gt;s to find the warlock while also starting to ask if the orc had ever learned of the fate of his main universe counterpart. Gul'dan ignored him, continuing to break the seals until he reached the fifth and final one, which had begun growing more powerful with each passing moment, arcane energy surging into it \u2014 a mechanism created hundreds of years ago by &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;a female Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar sensed this and created a massive arcane wedge and began slamming it into the floor of the chamber. Gul'dan threw his concealing illusion aside, and the battle between the mage and the warlock erupted once again. Realizing that he could not kill Khadgar \"and\" break the last seal at the same time, Gul'dan attempted to convince Kil'jaeden to infuse him with the tomb's power, while Khadgar finished his story and revealed the fate of the original timeline's Gul'dan: having been torn apart by the demons he had once served. Gul'dan suddenly realized that he was guaranteed to outlive his usefulness in the Legion's eyes, but in that moment, Kil'jaeden conceded and allowed the energies of the tomb to surge into the orc.\nGul'dan immediately ceased his attack upon Khadgar, instead crushing the final seal in a fist of fel fire. The energies necessary to tear open a rift between Azeroth and the Nether began surging towards the portal buried below Thal'dranath, but Gul'dan seized them for himself. After a moment of drowning in pain beneath an endless ocean of power, he regained his control and, by lifting only a finger, caused the chamber to erupt with overwhelming fury. Khadgar managed to seal himself in ice once more, but Gul'dan simply hurled the ice block through a doorway before collapsing tons of rock on top of it, blocking the entrance. Kil'jaeden instructed Gul'dan to allow the power to flow to the portal. Gul'dan, relishing this act of defiance, refused.\nGul'dan used his new power to reach through his demonic link and speak face to face with his master, sitting on a throne in some distant world within the Nether. Gul'dan accused him of planning to discard the orc from the beginning. Kil'jaeden denied this, having invested too much into Gul'dan. He explained that the original Gul'dan died because his betrayal is what sealed the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;first Horde&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 and by extension, Kil'jaeden and the Legion \u2014 on Azeroth during the Second War. When Gul'dan angrily replied that that was not him, Kil'jaeden told him that betrayal was in his nature. Seeing great potential within the orc, however buried beneath a short-sighted selfishness, the eredar had dragged Gul'dan to Thal'dranath to lead him to even greater power. The eredar then went on to explain that while Gul'dan had always been destined for power, he would never be his own master; that every creature served a master, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;even the Deceiver&lt;/a&gt;. Then, he gave the warlock a choice: prove himself loyal, return his power to the portal and open the way for the Legion, or betray his masters yet again to exact his petty vengeance on insignificant mortals before the Legion destroyed him. He left with a closing thought: Gul'dan may call him 'the Deceiver', but Kil'jaeden stated that he had never lied to him. \"Not once. Not in &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;this world&lt;/a&gt;, and not in &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;yours&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nGul'dan was finally alone in the chamber. Though he felt certain in his decision, he also felt a speck of self-doubt growing inside him. Soon, he heard Khadgar, now joined by Maiev Shadowsong, trying to claw their way into the chamber. The warlock thought to himself that if they wanted to rush to their deaths, they were free to do so, but in that moment, Gul'dan realized where his insecurity was coming from. Khadgar had been utterly defeated, yet he was not giving up. Maiev could not stand the archmage, but was now risking her life to save him. Gul'dan remembered &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;the others&lt;/a&gt; who had rushed headlong into battle against the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; himself, and realized that he would have to face every single one of them alone, albeit without a master. Khadgar and Maiev breached the chamber and ran towards Gul'dan. With no effort, he brushed their attacks away again and again, yet they kept coming at him. The warlock thought to himself that their stubborn resistance was exactly what he would have to face over and over again; he had no measure of his new power, but he had a measure of theirs. Finally, reluctantly, he let his power slip away from him and down towards the portal, at last allowing the Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth to commence. As Khadgar and Maiev dropped to the floor, Kil'jaeden commended Gul'dan for his choice, and now Gul'dan had something he had never had from the Legion before: their trust.\nKhadgar and Maiev ran for their lives, with the Warden heading north to fortify the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and Khadgar transforming into a raven to fly east. As the archmage glanced back towards the ever-darkening sky above the tomb, he saw Gul'dan levitating in the middle of the inferno, laughing and pointing towards the fleeing archmage to order several demons to pursue him.\nThe demons started tearing at the vault, hoping to reclaim their master's power.\nLegion.\nThe upper portion of the Tomb of Sargeras is known as the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt;, which were once a place of worship to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. Since the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, fel minions have desecrated this holy place, twisting it into their own image. Now, this site hosts a battle that could turn the tide of the invasion. While the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; engage the fel army directly, a small group of heroes infiltrates the upper reaches of the cathedral in a desperate hope to return the &lt;a href=\"%3AAegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;:Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; to its resting place. The Dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; commands the Legion forces within the Cathedral and he takes the attempt to infiltrate the Cathedral of Eternal Night as a deeply personal matter. For the warlocks had killed his favored general, &lt;a href=\"Jagganoth\"&gt;Jagganoth&lt;/a&gt;, stringing up his corpse and heart in &lt;a href=\"Dreadscar%20Rift\"&gt;Dreadscar Rift&lt;/a&gt; as both a warning and source of power. Mephistroth is also seeking retribution for the adventurers' recent brutal attacks on the Broken Shore. The memories are fresh. And revenge is sweet. Ultimately Mephistroth and his agents would fail and the Aegis of Aggramar would be secured within the Cathedral in order help in stopping the Legion Invasion of Azeroth.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; is then attacked by the adventurers. The penultimate boss is the &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Avatar of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the tomb, while the final boss is Kil'jaeden aboard a &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Legion's defeat, the tomb stopped glowing fel green.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras is certainly the most important site on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. The tomb, an ancient &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Kaldorei&lt;/a&gt; structure from before the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, is constructed of tan stone. Its recent history has collapsed the tomb in places, and it is unstable. Shifting stones and tunnel collapses are common. Red &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;orcish&lt;/a&gt; letters, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s legacy, mark the walls. The Tomb is perhaps the most dangerous place in the Broken Isles. Take a trip here only if you think you are up to killing some &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nDescription.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras is a haunted and eerie place. Skeletal and ghostly &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s battle each other ad in\ufb01nitum. A few &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;Stormreaver&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s, remnants from Gul'dan's disastrous expedition, also occupy the deep places, as do demons, which are particularly prevalent in the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Eye\"&gt;Chamber of the Eye&lt;/a&gt;, which is the section of the tomb that held &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras's body&lt;/a&gt; and, until recently, the last remnant of his withered form: the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Heavy stone gates and round doors barricade the tunnels. Sometimes, stepping onto a platform (outlined in eerie white light) causes such a door to roll to the side. Apparently the Kaldorei liked columns, because they are prevalent in the tomb; some remain whole, but many have collapsed or broken. The tomb also contains obelisks, fountains, &lt;a href=\"seahorse\"&gt;seahorse&lt;/a&gt; statues, archways, coral, seashells, torches, braziers, crates, barrels and fallen rock. Alga slicks many surfaces. In some places, the ruin's original \ufb02oor is intact: tan stone or brick. In others, the \ufb02oor is shattered or covered by dirt or seawater.\nHistory.\nFive hundred years ago, &lt;a href=\"Magna%20Aegwynn\"&gt;Magna Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt;, slew the demon &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing that the demon-&lt;a href=\"Titan\"&gt;Titan&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse still had power, she sought a safe place to entomb it. She discovered a Kaldorei ruin deep beneath the sea, near the &lt;a href=\"Maelstrom\"&gt;Maelstrom&lt;/a&gt;, and placed the body within, believing it to be secure. Time proved her incorrect. Centuries later, &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;, possessed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, convinced the orc shaman Gul'dan to lead his people through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; to wage war on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Medivh\u2013Sargeras offered Gul'dan a powerful artifact called the Eye of Sargeras as incentive. The orc grew impatient, though, and through &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; and research divined the location of the Tomb of Sargeras. He raised the Broken Isles and entered the tomb. Gul'dan encountered many trials within the tomb, as explained in a record of his experiences \u2014 a sort of diary \u2014 which he kept by painting orcish runes onto the tomb's walls. Orc forces loyal to &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; attacked Gul'dan's Stormreavers, and the &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; desperately sought the Eye. In the end, he failed, and the tomb's demonic guardians tore him asunder.\nYears passed, and the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; began and ended. In the chaos following the con\ufb02ict, &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, the Betrayer, traveled to the Tomb of Sargeras. Like Gul'dan, he too sought the Eye of Sargeras, supposedly intending to use it in a ritual to destabilize and destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; tracked Illidan to the tomb. Within the building, Maiev discovered pieces of an artifact called the &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Orb of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, and when she collected the entirety of the object it gave her great power. Maiev and her forces confronted Illidan deep within the tomb and interrupted his ritual. Illidan used the Eye to \ufb02ood the tomb and escaped. Out of all the night elves, only Maiev had the power to escape death, and the loss of her forces embittered her.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Pick up her quest to eventually unlock a raid shortcut after four maiden kills...\nDefeating the maiden will activate the elevator in the center of her arena, but she was also standing on a Teleportation Pad that will send players directly to the bottom without having to wait. At the bottom, run north to start some exposition from Kil'jaeden, then the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Avatar\"&gt;Fallen Avatar&lt;/a&gt; encounter. Focus down the Maiden of Valor, then the avatar. Swim north through the fel water and run past Kil'jaeden to teleport to his Legion ship in the Twisting Nether.\nThe ship is considered outside for mount purposes. Clear through all the trash then run east to the Kil'jaeden encounter. Save cooldowns for the second phase in an attempt to skip the blind portion. Attack him up until he goes immune at 80%, then watch for the purple orbs in the corners. Get in a position that the Rupturing Singularity will knock the player back to the direction of the next singularity, as there will be very little time to run to it. Rinse and repeat until Kil'jaeden lands back in the center, then pop all cooldowns and defeat him before he finishes his cast at 40% health to start the Illidan phase.\nAfter the cutscene, Kil'jaeden's loot is in the Spoils of the Legion's Fall container southeast of Velen, Khadgar, Illidan, and the Image of Aegwynn. The image can teleport players back to the instance line.\nLoot.\nThe &lt;a href=\"tier%2020\"&gt;tier 20&lt;/a&gt; set pieces drop from bosses in Tomb of Sargeras."}

It is accessible from a &lt;a href=\"Underwater%20Passage\"&gt;narrow entrance&lt;/a&gt; at the bottom of the lake.\nThe area is comprised of the &lt;a href=\"Vestibule%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Vestibule of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s tomb, the &lt;a href=\"Darkwalk\"&gt;Darkwalk&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Grave-Prison%20of%20Zakajz\"&gt;prison&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter Tyr's sacrifice, his &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; allies entombed keeper &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;hammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; where they defeated each other. Tyr's followers then enchanted the tomb with protective wards. They bound the Silver Hand to these magical seals, thereby preventing anyone from touching it in the future. Among them was &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim%20the%20Truthseeker\"&gt;Yrgrim the Truthseeker&lt;/a&gt;, the champion of Tyr, who helped to build the tomb and decided to stay guarding his tomb. While most other refugees continued south, the vrykul were moved by Yrgrim's example and stayed with him. Yrgrim stayed at Tirisfal Glades for several years, teaching the vrykul there about the pursuit of justice and nobility. Once he decided that he had taught them all that he could, tired after all his battles, he departed to find a champion that could bear his &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;artifact&lt;/a&gt; in his stead. &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; then became a secretive order sworn to protect the tomb.\nDuring one journey in Tirisfal, &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt; and his followers discovered the long-lost tomb of Tyr. A tense confrontation ensued between Thoradin's retinue and Tyr's Guard. Eventually, the former king and his followers forced their way past the guardians and entered the gravesite. Unaware of the darkness resting beneath the earth, Thoradin told his magi to break the tomb's magical wards. The &lt;a href=\"sorcerer\"&gt;sorcerer&lt;/a&gt;s thereby inadvertently resurrected Zakajz, who had been kept dead by the seals. The massive horror summoned minions from below the earth and tore through Thoradin's followers, but the king did not flee or cower. His comrades' deaths gave him enough time to bury Strom'kar in Zakajz's brain even as the Corruptor's claws crushed the life from him. The sword's elven enchantments forced the C'Thrax into a deep slumber and kept it from regenerating. However, Thoradin's wounds were mortal and he died shortly after. For centuries thereafter, the former king's &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt; lingered near the tomb, unable to find peace.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Travard and the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; met the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; and explained that recent intrusions of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; have revealed the secret position of the tomb, endangering &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;The Silver Hand (artifact)&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs too many knew about the location of the tomb, Travard stated that it was necessary to close it forever, but only after they recovered the hammer. With the help of Tyrosus, the old paladin gathered the members of the Tyr's Guard and departed with troops of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. When they entered the tomb, they discovered many abominations of the void and had to eliminate them before Travard could begin the ritual to claim the hammer. However, the ritual could not be performed as one of the Sparks of Tyr was stolen and taken in the depths of the tomb. During their descent towards the &lt;a href=\"Grave-Prison%20of%20Zakajz\"&gt;Grave-Prison of Zakajz&lt;/a&gt;, the Tyr's Guard eliminated many void creatures, until they encountered the &lt;a href=\"Horrific%20Aberration\"&gt;Horrific Aberration&lt;/a&gt; who decimated the order. After they slew the monster, Travard resumed the ritual while his allies protected him from &lt;a href=\"Mordoth%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Mordoth the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, and once the hero paladin was in possession of the legendary weapon, everyone fled from the tomb which began to crumble.\nAs the only remaining member of the Tyr's Guard, Travard explained that Tyr's body and its secrets, as well as the prison of &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;, were now buried and protected under tons of stones and water. He then announced that the champion of the Light was in his opinion the most worthy person to carry and protect the legendary artifact, and that they would soon meet again.\nDragonflight.\nAt some point after his order was decimated and the artifacts within the tomb secured; &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; found that the tomb had not fully collapsed. He endeavored instead to remain, standing vigil over it as the last remaining &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; for several years, until at some point the defense systems locked him out.\nAfter the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; ventured to the tomb to find memories of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, they found Travard frustratedly locked out, and the tomb shaking and slowly collapsing. The old paladin decided to aid them with activating the various mechanisms in the tomb, hoping that they contained enough memories to activate the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt; in order to revive Tyr's new body. He defended the group in the main chamber from the defense systems, before leading them to the &lt;a href=\"Darkwalk\"&gt;Darkwalk&lt;/a&gt;; where he guided them to a second console after the first short-circuits. The hero activated the console with the Silver Scale, showing them Tyr's last stand against &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt;. After witnessing Tyr's sacrifice, Travard told Koranos and the hero that his faith has been renewed and returned to &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; with them."}
