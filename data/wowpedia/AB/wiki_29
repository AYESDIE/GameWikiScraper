After flying from Silithus to &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, he accidentally bumped into Reynah Firecaster, who was not looking where she was going, and the two had an argument, threatening to kill each other if they ran into each other again. Barnabas left Undercity and began hunting down scattered Scarlets he found around &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; until he again ran into Reynah. Before the two killed each other, they came to an understanding that they both were hunting the same targets and decided that, until they killed the Scarlet leader &lt;a href=\"Renee%20Lauer\"&gt;Renee Lauer&lt;/a&gt;, they would work together.\nThe two attacked the Scarlet camp and managed to capture Renee. However the two began arguing over who would deal the killing blow, allowing Renee's allies to arrive and incapacitate both of them. Before their execution Barnabas and Reynah told the Scarlets they vowed vengeance over the deaths of their loved ones and asked Renee why would she kill innocents. When Renee responded that the Forsaken and the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were a disease infesting &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;human lands&lt;/a&gt; Reynah attacked the surrounding Scarlets with her fire magic, until they were cornered and injured explosives. Barnabas was permanently killed by decapitation, while Reynah's neck was snapped. Moments later, Forsaken led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; killed the entire camp, and raised Renee Lauer as one of the undead."}

They have lived in peace with the other tol'vir tribes for a long time, until the &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20tribe\"&gt;Neferset tribe&lt;/a&gt; made relations with &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and the elemental lord &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;. The Ramkahen were given the same choice but refused, they however have taken steps to insure their safety after seeing the aftermath of the attack on &lt;a href=\"Orsis\"&gt;Orsis&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nThe stalwart, cat-like Ramkahen people can claim a history truly unique on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;: they are the descendants of an ancient race, the stone-skinned tol'vir shaped to guard the oases and tombs of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. The Ramkahen have long since lost their stone skin because of a curse laid upon them by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;, but they have held firm to their sacred mission, and spread throughout &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; in the hope of protecting its ancient tombs and vaults from those who would defile them. With &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s reemergence into Azeroth, the Ramkahen have found themselves pitted against their closest cousins, the &lt;a href=\"Neferset\"&gt;Neferset&lt;/a&gt; tol'vir, who serve Deathwing and his allies for the promise of a return to their ancient, stony forms. The Ramkahen still cling to their charge of defending Uldum, but they can do little for their ancestral land if they are annihilated, and so they prepare for war. Those who support the Ramkahen in their fight against the Neferset can earn arcane trinkets and garments created in the image of the titans themselves.\nWhen the Neverset were defeated, the Ramkahen took over the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Tol%27vir\"&gt;Lost City of the Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; was freed from his prison, the Ramkahen formed the &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20Accord\"&gt;Uldum Accord&lt;/a&gt; by allying with the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wastewander\"&gt;Wastewander&lt;/a&gt; bandits. They defended Uldum and the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Halls of Origination&lt;/a&gt; from both N'Zoth's forces and the &lt;a href=\"Amathet\"&gt;Amathet&lt;/a&gt; tol'vir.\nReputation.\nPlayers start out at with this faction.\nIt is possible to increase Ramkahen reputation through about a third of by completing the available &lt;a href=\"Uldum%20quests\"&gt;Uldum quests&lt;/a&gt;. To gain reputation up to requires the &lt;a href=\"Tabard%20of%20Ramkahen\"&gt;Tabard of Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt;, or completion of the two daily quests &lt;a href=\"Thieving%20Little%20Pluckers\"&gt;Thieving Little Pluckers&lt;/a&gt; for 150 rep per day and &lt;a href=\"Fire%20From%20the%20Sky%20%28daily%29\"&gt;Fire From the Sky (daily)&lt;/a&gt; for 250 rep per day.\nFaction description.\n\"The cat-like people of Ramkahen are the descendants of the Tol'vir, guardiands of Uldum.

Usually a cast sequence is used to ensure exact and reliable timing of the application of these healing buffs and also generate some sort of buff extension. In some cases once the damage has been received from the boss, then a second cast sequence may be used to activate the healing of these buffs.\nHealing ramps are a key part of the &lt;a href=\"Priest%23Discipline\"&gt;Discipline priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Monk%23Mistweaver\"&gt;Mistweaver monk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druid%23Restoration\"&gt;Restoration druid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Evoker%23Specializations\"&gt;Preservation evoker&lt;/a&gt; playstyles. A list of these specializations and some examples of of their key abilities or talents during a ramp follows (not an exhaustive list of all options):\nHoly priests, Holy paladins, and Restoration shamans are generally not considered ramp healers, as their abilities generally do not require an exact cast sequence to be timed leading up to a damage event. This does not necessarily mean that non-ramp healers cannot do burst healing. However, the mechanism by which those specializations perform it will be different to that of the ramp specializations.\nRamps tended to come into their modern forms around Legion. For example, this was the introduction of which more rapidly applied &lt;a href=\"Atonement\"&gt;Atonement&lt;/a&gt; to more targets than previous options."}

He moves so slowly that it's easy to stay out of the way until the tank recovers and regains aggro. In an enclosed space, someone will most likely die."}

This article is a brief\nattempt to informally explain random numbers and how they are used in &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;. No mathematics are done here, and many\ndetails are glossed over. This is an extremely relaxed explanation rather than a textbook.\nPNRG and Seeding.\nA PNRG (pseudo-random number generator) is a computer's way of generating numbers that appear to be random, but are actually based on what seed was used to generate them.\nThe seed is the most important thing in a PNRG function. To generate numbers, computers first require some kind of input, known as the Seed. The seed can be thought of just like an actual seed from a plant - the thing that everything grows from. However, in this case, a random number or set of random numbers grows from the seed.\nA batch of mathematical functions can be applied to the seed by a PNRG (pseudo-random number generator) algorithm to convert it into presentable output. As a result, since the seed must be a physical quantity obtained from somewhere, it is impossible for a computer to generate a completely random number. However, since the seeds used in the majority of PNRG functions cannot be predicted by humans, numbers generated with them are considered random for all functional purposes.\nIn order for the numbers produced by the PRNG to appear as random as possible, an unpredictable number must be used as the seed. This could be an erratic number, like digitized white noise from a radio telescope aimed at a source\nof X-rays, or the electrical noise on your hard drive cables, or a digitized image of an unpredictable\nprocess,\nand so on. (The most famous example of the last was Silicon Graphics pointing a webcam at a table\nfull of Lava Lamps, and then pulling numbers of the image's bitstream.)\nYou can also use a seed that isn't ambivalent but can be measured with enough accuracy to not be influenced or predictable. The time is a good example of this. A computer can produce the current time to millisecond accuracy. Due to the inherently chaotic nature of PRNGs, a small change in time results in a completely different output. Since time seeds are easily obtainable without special equipment, they are the seed of choice in many of today's applications .\nSome players like to believe that they have influence over the seed, and can alter which loot they get by having a different raid leader, for example. However, Blizzard has already pointed out that this is not the case. See #2 under\n&lt;a href=\"%23Things%20To%20Remember\"&gt;Things To Remember&lt;/a&gt; for why.\nBlizzard Information.\nBlizzard posting an article\nshortly after the game was released, describing how \"rolls\" are done. Much of that article is not directly\nrelated to this topic, but it does describe which PRNG is in use. It is called IBAA, and source\ncode is available.\nThings To Remember.\nA few things that players typically forget \u2014 or would prefer to not think about \u2014 when arguing over \"randomness\" of loot:"}

The organization can trace its roots back to the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, when a loosely affiliated band of &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; warriors occasionally worked together to defend &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. Roughly five hundred years ago, a group of similarly dedicated fighters formed and officially took on the name \"Farstriders\". Their mandate was to protect Quel'Thalas far beyond its actual borders and look after high elf interests all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The commander of the Farstriders was given a unique title: ranger-general of Silvermoon. The title itself predates the formal establishment of the Farstriders, and was first given to a legendary ranger named &lt;a href=\"Talanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Talanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. The title was eventually passed to &lt;a href=\"Lireesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lireesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, whose eldest daughter &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; was expected to inherit the position. Yet Alleria, who had always found little use for her people's traditions and expectations, chose to focus on more practical matters.

All of the locations were written up on a whiteboard, after which everyone started going through and picking which projects they wanted to work on.

Signing a song of the fate befallen on her village, she is found by a passing by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling alone and with no one to play with, the little girl asked them to help her find her playmates\u2014&lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Munchykins\"&gt;Mr. Munchykins&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trunksy\"&gt;Trunksy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Striggs%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Mayor Striggs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Smoochums\"&gt;Smoochums&lt;/a&gt;. Along the way, the adventurer found the former townsfolk in the &lt;a href=\"Glenbrook%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Glenbrook Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, with Abby narrating how their lives ended. This led them to a cave where an unresponsive &lt;a href=\"Annie%20Warren\"&gt;Annie Warren&lt;/a&gt; was found. Before being able to understand what was going on, Abby appeared from behind and asked them to follow her. With all of her playmates ready, it was finally time for a tea party. Arriving at the place, the adventurer noticed a dead Smoochums and all the other party guest surrounded on a sort of gound symbol. At Abby's request, the adventurer reluctantly sat in the middle and was then attacked by a &lt;a href=\"Wicker%20beast\"&gt;wicker hound&lt;/a&gt;. With her goal complete, Abby left the adventurer to their fate, never to be seen again. The adventurer survived the encounter and was soon approached by Annie Warren, who revealed that the villagers thought Abby had died some time ago.\nLater on, during the &lt;a href=\"Allegiance%20of%20Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Allegiance of Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; questline, specifically &lt;a href=\"Her%20Dog%20Days%20Are%20Over\"&gt;Her Dog Days Are Over&lt;/a&gt;, one can find that Abby appears to have struck again (as her stuffed animals can be found at the sacrificial circle and child's giggles can be heard once again), sacrificing &lt;a href=\"Princess%20%28wicker%20beast%29\"&gt;Princess&lt;/a&gt; and turning it into a wicker beast.

Many effects generated by &lt;a href=\"talent\"&gt;talent&lt;/a&gt;s are abilities.\nAbilities are usually separated into &lt;a href=\"active\"&gt;active abilities&lt;/a&gt; (some &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt; interaction is needed to use the ability) and &lt;a href=\"passive%20ability\"&gt;passive abilities&lt;/a&gt; (always active without need for activation).\nThe line between abilities and powers can be hazy, especially for &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;-like effects from &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s, non-&lt;a href=\"caster\"&gt;caster&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"hybrid\"&gt;hybrid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt;es.\nYour character's abilities can be found in their &lt;a href=\"spellbook\"&gt;spellbook&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nDepending on their availability and the method of obtaining them, abilities can be divided into several types: General, Racial, Class, Spec, Talent, Glyph and Pet.\nMost abilities have a level requirement, and are only available to learn once the character has reached the required level. Some (such as professions abilities) may also have other requirements, such as a certain number of skill points in the corresponding profession.\nGeneral.\nGeneral abilities are abilities that any character can learn, regardless of class. There are many sources of general abilities: some can be learned from trainers, such as the &lt;a href=\"riding\"&gt;riding&lt;/a&gt; abilities, &lt;a href=\"Battle%20Pet%20Training\"&gt;Battle Pet Training&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Master%27s%20License\"&gt;Flight Master's License&lt;/a&gt;; others come via &lt;a href=\"profession\"&gt;profession&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"Disenchant\"&gt;Disenchant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cooking%20Fire%20%28ability%29\"&gt;Cooking Fire (ability)&lt;/a&gt; or the profession passive abilities themselves; and many are gained as &lt;a href=\"guild%20perks\"&gt;guild perks&lt;/a&gt; due to being in a &lt;a href=\"guild\"&gt;guild&lt;/a&gt; of sufficient level. The only ability known by all characters at the time of creation is &lt;a href=\"Attack%23Player_auto-attack\"&gt;Auto attack&lt;/a&gt;.\nRacial.\nEach race comes with its own selection of racials, including some passive and some active abilities - see &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; for a full list. Race also determines which &lt;a href=\"language\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;s your character can speak, reflected in the Languages passive.\nClass.\nClass abilities are spells/abilities that are available to all characters of a given class, regardless of their spec. Some are known by characters at the time of creation, while most will automatically be taught to players when they reach the appropriate level. The ability to use weapons and armor is also determined by class.\nSpec.\nSpec abilities are spell/abilities that are only available to characters of a certain &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;. Some are shared between two or more specs, while others are unique to a single spec. Like class abilities, spec abilities are gained automatically when the character reaches the appropriate level. Since spec abilities are only available to characters of the appropriate specialization, choosing or switching your specialization will immediately grant you all spec abilities available at your level.\nTalent.\n&lt;a href=\"Talent\"&gt;Talent&lt;/a&gt; abilities are spell/abilities that are accessible by all characters of that class, regardless of their spec. There are 6 tiers of talents for each class, with 3 potential talents on each tier. Tiers become accessible once the character reaches the appropriate level. Once a tier is unlocked, players are able to choose one of the three talents on that tier.\nGlyph.\n&lt;a href=\"Glyph\"&gt;Glyph&lt;/a&gt; abilities are available to all characters of the appropriate class, by choosing the corresponding glyph. Most glyphs modify existing abilities (acting similarly to passive abilities), but some grant new, active abilities. Major glyphs tend to grant powerful abilities, while minor glyphs grant fun, entertaining ones.\nPet.\n&lt;a href=\"Pet\"&gt;Pet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;warlock minion&lt;/a&gt;s have abilities of their own. Classes with pets will find their current pet's active and passive abilities listed in their spellbook, once they have learned to command their pets.\nAbility rotation.\nAn ability &lt;a href=\"rotation\"&gt;rotation&lt;/a&gt; is a defined sequence of abilities that can be used to achieve a certain role in a group or raid. In other words, it can refer to the order in which a certain class will cast its spells or use its abilities in a PvE setting. Rarely if ever is there a defined rotation for a PvP situation.\nExamples.\nExamples of abilities:"}

Abjuration is the study of protective &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;.\nAbjurer set.\nIn \"World of Warcraft\", the abjurer is mentioned in the name of a clothing set.\nNotable spells.\nThe most generalized abjuration spell is the mana shield, a spell that transmutes raw mana into a barrier that protects the caster from attacks. Properly executed, this spell can protect the mage against even the most formidable of attacks - but the mana shield is very difficult for a novice to master. It often takes a mage months of practice to even conjure a simple mana shield, and thus, more basic alternatives exist.\nA series of elemental armor spells were invented to aid the traveling mage in the unfortunate case that he or she might be attacked. These spells require far less raw energy to cast then a mana shield and are more easily maintained over time, but lack the raw potency of the mana shield. Rather than stopping an attack completely, a frost armor spell might simply decrease the effectiveness of the assault. The more advanced armor spells grant other benefits - for example, the potent mage armor spell actually assists the caster in regaining magical power more easily.\nPractitioners of the arcane arts are often ambitious, and we frequently find ourselves in situations where magic may slip just slightly beyond our control. It is for this reason that the ward spells exist. Ward spells are quick, potent incantations to protect the caster against a form of elemental damage - damage which is often caused by the caster attempting one of the other schools of magic. This is why studying abjuration early is so imperative."}

Locus-Walker had seen a &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;unique destiny&lt;/a&gt; for Lothraxion and so did not kill him in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; where he would have been dead for good.\n&lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; first heard about Locus-Walker from Lothraxion, and wanted to seek him out to learn how the Void fought for future reference while battling it. &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; made it clear she did not approve of Alleria attempting to seek him out because, according to her, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and Void could not coexist. A thousand years after she joined the Army of the Light (from her perspective, due to how time works inside the Nether), Alleria encountered Locus-Walker while both of them were imprisoned by the Legion on &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;. She had left the Army five hundred years before this after using the Void to save herself and her husband &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; from dying on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Locus-Walker was captured by the Legion, the wrappings containing his energy body had been destroyed. After Alleria used his teachings to kill the &lt;a href=\"inquisitor\"&gt;inquisitor&lt;/a&gt; torturing them, Locus-Walker opened a Void rift for them to escape. On the other side was utter nothingness, the Void itself. Their first lesson was about maintaining Alleria's sanity while using the Void's power. Throughout her training Locus-Walker delved into her memories. He explained to her the duality of Light and Shadow, how the Light cannot see the whole of destiny because it alone is not responsible for it; likewise, the shadow cannot see all of destiny either. He explained how the shadow sees the Light as nothing but horrors, just as the Light sees the shadow, and how neither is true nor wrong. How the Light seeks one path and shuns all others as lies, while the Void seeks every possible path and sees them all as truth. Through Locus-Walker's training, Alleria was able to see destiny that both the Light and Shadow could not see.\nBut Alleria also realized she was delving into the Void too soon, before her destiny demanded it. Seeing a vision of Turalyon presently being attacked by an &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; attempting to steal his soul as a prize, she tried to have Locus-Walker let her go. When he refused as they were not done, she attacked him to force the lesson to be cut short. Furious, Locus-Walker declared her a coward and he should have expected no less. Though he began to gather power to strike back at her, he stopped when he heard what Alleria's vision was and, laughing, said she had made a very determined enemy; Alleria wasn't sure if that meant Locus-Walker or the eredar. Deciding she may have a unique destiny Locus-Walker acquiesced, allowing Alleria to go save her husband. But he believed they would meet again.\nAlleria assumed Locus-Walker was the only one of his kind to tangle with the Void.\nLegion.\nWhile investigating why the Void was corrupting the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Krokul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Eredath\"&gt;Eredath&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, Alleria and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; encountered Locus-Walker. He explained that he had come to Argus to investigate what the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard\"&gt;Shadowguard&lt;/a&gt;, a group of ethereals who had tragically succumbed to the Void, were doing there. The Shadowguard, in turn, wanted to capture Locus-Walker before he could disrupt their efforts of making Argus fall to darkness. After showing Alleria and the adventurer what the Shadowguard was up to, Locus-Walker confronted Alleria about her husband &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and what he thought of her use of shadow magic, asking how she could use it when the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; shone so brightly beside her. Alleria countered that without the Light, there is no Shadow. Locus-Walker had hoped to find more ethereals among the Shadowguard who possessed the necessary strength of mind to resist the Void, and was disappointed to find such an utter lack of resistance.\nAfter taking care of the ethereals at the &lt;a href=\"Shadowguard%20Incursion\"&gt;Shadowguard Incursion&lt;/a&gt;, Locus-Walker decided to allow Alleria another opportunity to pursue her destiny. After slaying the &lt;a href=\"void%20revenant\"&gt;void revenant&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nhal%27athoth\"&gt;Nhal'athoth&lt;/a&gt;, Locus-Walker retrieved its heart and gave it to Alleria, who consumed it. After telling Alleria that as long as her mind remained her own she could control the Void's power and that perhaps someday he would tell Alleria how he came to control it by himself, Locus-Walker took his leave.\nLocus-Walker appeared again when the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt; sought the &lt;a href=\"Crest%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Crest of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Triumvirate\"&gt;Seat of the Triumvirate&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Saprish\"&gt;Saprish&lt;/a&gt; died, Locus-Walker took his staff. During the battle with &lt;a href=\"L%27ura\"&gt;L'ura&lt;/a&gt; he prompted Alleria to use the power of the Void rifts the dark &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; was opening, culminating in her absorbing L'ura's essence and transforming into a Void state that she could turn off and on at will. After saying they needed to test the limits of her newfound power, Alleria and Locus-Walker left the Seat.\nLocus-Walker can later be found at &lt;a href=\"Telogrus%20Rift\"&gt;Telogrus Rift&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt; join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. He finds the void elves fascinating and they give him much to ponder. He wants to linger to learn about Telogrus. &lt;a href=\"High%20Elf%20Wayfarer\"&gt;High Elf Wayfarer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20Scholar\"&gt;Silvermoon Scholar&lt;/a&gt;s are gathered around him.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTelogrus Rift.\nFascinating.\nI sensed that change was destined to find Alleria Windrunner, but I did not anticipate that her kin would undergo a similar transformation.\nThe implications are many. These events have given me much to ponder.\nThis is a very old place. Broken by rage, yet sculpted by the threads of fate.\nThere is much to be learned here. I believe I might linger a while.\nBe seeing you."}

Knowing that it can be reset by the group pulling back into the room that &lt;a href=\"Gortok%20Palehoof\"&gt;Gortok Palehoof&lt;/a&gt; is found in lets you keep your harpoons without dying or having to leave the instance and lose them.\nAfter 3 assigned members of the group have 2 harpoons each (only 5 are needed to kill Grauf), he is reset and the group can quickly run past to the harpoon guns before he respawns. The tank positions themselves in the doorway just next to the harpoon guns, and someone is sent to run back down the corridor and stand in front of Skadi to start the event, then quickly make their way back up to the group at the harpoon guns.\nAs the fight is started, the group should allow Skadi to do one pass by (watching for frost breath) so that the adds can be DPS'd down. As he reaches his second pass, the harpooners should shoot Skadi down and the tank should pick him up. Then all DPS goes to the remaining adds and kills them to stop them causing trouble, then Skadi is killed as normal.\nA regular DPS group with no special tricks should be sufficient to kill Skadi in well under the time limit, even when he is allowed to do one pass by.\nAdditional Note.\nUsing this method should also ensure that you get ."}

If you with to aid me, then I would appreciate it, but regardless, please try not to cause any trouble.\nBecause you have aided me, I will tell you what I know of this land and of the things there are to see. My knowledge is not vast, but perhaps I can point out some things that might interest one such as yourself.\nMy knowledge of night elf lore is limited, but it is said long ago\u2014back when the night elves still held sacred the art of arcane spell casting\u2014that Azshara was the greatest of their kind. A beautiful woman they named &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;queen&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly it was her addiction to the arcane that would one say be the catalyst for the most devastating events this world's history.\nOnce a great city of night elves, the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; once ruled there, practicing great and powerful arcane magics. They are cursed now, haunting the lands, and their ruined city has been victimized by the &lt;a href=\"Spitelash%20Naga\"&gt;Spitelash naga&lt;/a&gt;. I understand that the naga search the ruins for powerful Highborne artifacts.\nA powerful human mage is rumored to live to the north: &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Xylem\"&gt;he&lt;/a&gt; keeps watch over the land for some unknown reason. I have not traveled there myself, but it is said that visitors are welcome and can even earn favor with him if they are willing to do errands for him.\nI've seen terrible things happen to the &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years\u2014they were victims on many fronts. But it's unclear to me what's became of this tribe. Are they corrupted by the same plague that's touched &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;? Or perhaps they are simply angry at what's happened to their once peaceful people and now seek to defend themselves. Either way, most of them appear hostile to those who come into the area.\nThe blue dragons themselves aren't here, but followers of &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; are. I do not know why, but I can tell you this: wherever the blue dragons are, expect to find arcane magic. I wouldn't be surprised if the dragonspawn are there protecting something... perhaps something the Highborne left behind."}

He tells the legend of &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen's&lt;/a&gt; death and the origin of &lt;a href=\"Alani\"&gt;Alani&lt;/a&gt;. \nAlani's origin as told by Loh-Ki.\nLegends tell of a great battle that took place in this very vale, turning the golden fields to crimson with the blood of many brave monks. The armies of Lei Shen of Thunder King, emperor of the mogu, fought brutally, but were eventually overcome.\nFor days following the fall of Lei Shen, the vale was shrouded in a cloud of the deepest black. Summoned by Lei Shen in his final moments, the otherworldly storm blanketed the vale with rainfall and struck jagged spears of lightning into the hills.\nThe blood of the fallen was washed away by the storm and carried to Whitepetal Lake, turning the waters a deep red. With its final breath, the storm struck the center of the lake, igniting the very water itself. The lake burned with a crimson hue for many days.\nWhen the blaze subsided, a cloud serpent hatching could be seen flying around the center of the lake. Its scales sparked with storm and fire, and where it flew, great clouds formed in the sky. My people named it Alani, the Stormborn.\nThey say that Alani can only see the flash of the greatest lightning, and may only hear the echo of the greatest thunder. Should you wish to get her attention, you will need to harness the very essence of the sky that spawned her.\nInterpretation.\nLoh-Ki's tale seems to conflict with the other account of Lei Shen dying of old age, as well as the historical account of him dying to the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Forge of Origination&lt;/a&gt; set off by the &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;. This could be seen as a difference between factual and \"traditional\" history in Pandaren culture. The fact that his name is strikingly similar to &lt;a href=\"http%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loki\"&gt;Loki&lt;/a&gt;, god of mischief and lies in Norse Mythology, also indicates his tale should be taken with a grain of salt."}

It is a path of healing and renewal, and stands for \"a song of the heart\" or \"a song of the spirit\" in &lt;a href=\"Orcish%20%28language%29\"&gt;Orcish&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Lok'osh's origins stem from the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s aided the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Mag'har&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;.

One of the Mag'har, &lt;a href=\"Nakha\"&gt;Seer Nakha&lt;/a&gt;, watched the hero and learned what they discovered. After the adventurer left, Nakha sought out the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Kashur\"&gt;Mother Kashur&lt;/a&gt; as the hero had done. Kashur told Nakha of \"a song that only the spirits could hear\", which had initially troubled them until the hero helped them find rest. After years of trying, Nakha heard the song for herself, inspiring her to become a &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; and travel to &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to train other orcs to follow the same path. While orcish &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; speak to \"the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20spirit\"&gt;elements&lt;/a&gt; without\", Nakha speaks to \"the elements within\", a song of the heart and the spirit: a Lok'osh. The Lok'osh is not an easy path to follow, but those who do so have never felt more connected to their people.\nThe news that there were now orcish priests listening to \"the songs of life and shadow\" spread to &lt;a href=\"Relka%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;Relka Bloodfyre&lt;/a&gt;, the last Mag'har of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;. Relka attended Azeroth's first &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes that she could share her clan's knowledge about such magic with the young priests, and help guide those who wished to use &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magic away from disaster. She told priest &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s at the Kosh'harg that they had much to teach others and that she hoped to see them again after the event."}

Elevated to the role of Prime Designate, Loken was the chief jailor of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, imprisoned in the depths of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. However, the whispers of the Death God eventually drove Loken to betray his comrades and bring down the work of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. With Ulduar and the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt; under his control, Loken created an &lt;a href=\"iron%20army\"&gt;army of iron&lt;/a&gt; to do battle throughout &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. He was eventually stopped and killed by brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBiography.\nAncient history.\nLoken was one of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers\"&gt;Keepers&lt;/a&gt; created by the &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; to lead the titan-forged armies against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s. He was given power by &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;. He and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; battled and defeated &lt;a href=\"Neptulon%20the%20Tidehunter\"&gt;Neptulon the Tidehunter&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoken had an affair with &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, the wife of his brother &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, from his prison within Ulduar, muddled Loken's thoughts and made him lash out at Sif, scared at the thought of losing her, and he killed her by accident. Horrified at what he had done but too scared to tell Thorim the truth, Loken tricked Thorim into believing that it had been the work of &lt;a href=\"Arngrim%20the%20Insatiable\"&gt;Arngrim&lt;/a&gt;, the king of the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s, turning Thorim against his allies. Loken would stop the war between Thorim's and Arngrim's forces with an army he had created with the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, but unknown to Loken Yogg-Saron had planted the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; inside the forge, which would slowly convert titan-forged into flesh and could also spread to those forged before the curse was created.\nAfter Thorim retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; in despair, Loken was desperate to cover his actions, even if it meant using Yogg-Saron's power to do so, for if &lt;a href=\"Algalon\"&gt;Algalon&lt;/a&gt; or the Pantheon ever found out his life would be forfeit. He arranged the death of &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt;, making it look like a lab accident, though Mimiron's &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt; followers would create a new mechagnome body to house the Keeper's soul. Loken subdued &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, corrupting them into complacency with &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. He convinced the titan-forged &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; to imprison &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, the Prime Designate, within his &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the title of Prime Designate that Odyn had abandoned in the process. Loken expected &lt;a href=\"Ra\"&gt;Ra&lt;/a&gt; to come up from &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;the south&lt;/a&gt; and investigate what was going on, but Ra never arrived. This is because he had discovered that the Pantheon was dead, killed by &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and had locked himself up in the &lt;a href=\"Mogu%27shan%20Vaults\"&gt;Mogu'shan Vaults&lt;/a&gt; in despair. Afterward, Loken exiled all titan-forged from Ulduar and retreated into the depths of the complex.\nThe final two Keepers were &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt;, who had seen what Loken did to the others and left before he could reach them, alongside their friend the giantess &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of the Storm Peaks. Tyr and his allies stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt;, which record all history in the world, to investigate the extent of Loken's betrayal. Discovering the theft, Loken sent horrific monsters called &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi after Tyr's group, but Tyr sacrificed his life to fight the creatures while his comrades escaped with the discs.\nTerrified of what would happen if Tyr, Archaedas, and Ironaya showed the Discs to Algalon and revealed his treachery, Loken created the &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt; and filled it with false information to cover his tracks. Almost all of the information contained within the Tribunal is false. Loken also altered the signal sent to Algalon so that no living being could contact him and he would only arrive upon Loken's death.\nAwakening from dormancy.\nFor thousands of years, the imprisoned Yogg-Saron was unable to do more than keeping the Keepers, Loken included, quiet and complacent inside Ulduar. His grasp on them was tenuous, and convincing them to directly help the Old God had proven fruitless in the past. It was not until &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the Old God-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Ulduar and weakened Yogg-Saron's chains that the entity's influence on the Keepers increased, becoming strong as iron. Yogg-Saron commanded Loken to create a new army from the Forge of Wills. In Loken's hands, the forge churned out legions of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who sought only bloodshed and war.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim finally discovered the truth and, with the aid of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s serving the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, recovered his &lt;a href=\"Krolmir%2C%20Hammer%20of%20Storms\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Reforged%20Armor%20of%20the%20Stormlord\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt;, then brought war to his treacherous brother. However, it turned out to have been an elaborate ruse perpetrated by Loken to lure him out of &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt;, where proximity to his &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;dark master&lt;/a&gt; granted him the power to overcome Thorim's attack. He then captured and took Thorim and his &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-drake&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, so he could be driven mad by Yogg-Saron.\nLoken utilized the services of &lt;a href=\"Ignis%20the%20Furnace%20Master\"&gt;Ignis the Furnace Master&lt;/a&gt; on at least two occasions. One was the transformation of &lt;a href=\"Veranus\"&gt;Veranus&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim's proto-drake, into the plated monstrosity &lt;a href=\"Razorscale\"&gt;Razorscale&lt;/a&gt;. He also ordered the construction of &lt;a href=\"Kologarn\"&gt;Kologarn&lt;/a&gt;, the massive stone construct, to guard the &lt;a href=\"Shattered%20Walkway\"&gt;Shattered Walkway&lt;/a&gt; that leads into the inner halls of Ulduar.\nWhen he was killed in the Halls of Lightning, Loken said that his death \"heralds the end of this world\", after which the map of Azeroth burst into fire and launched a beacon of light toward the sky. According to the &lt;a href=\"Archivum%20Console\"&gt;Archivum Console&lt;/a&gt; in Ulduar, the \"Algalon failsafe\" - an automatic emergency signal following the death of the prime designate - was activated immediately following Loken's demise, resulting in the arrival of &lt;a href=\"Algalon%20the%20Observer\"&gt;Algalon the Observer&lt;/a&gt;. The console then went on to explain:\nWhen asked to explain \"re-origination\", the Console replied:\nIn other words, the Titans would destroy all of Azeroth and everything on it, then rebuild it from the raw materials left behind from that destruction - thus giving credence to the dire warning in Loken's dying breath.\nTribunal of Ages.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Tribunal%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tribunal of Ages&lt;/a&gt; is a false system created by Loken to cover up the crimes he had committed and is not based in historical fact.\nAccording to the Tribunal of Ages, Loken \u2014 also known by various sources as \"Keeper Loken\", \"Sentinel Loken\", and \"prime designate\" \u2014 was named the supreme protector of Azeroth by the Pantheon, leading the &lt;a href=\"aesir\"&gt;aesir&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"storm%20giant\"&gt;storm giant&lt;/a&gt;s) and &lt;a href=\"vanir\"&gt;vanir&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Mountain%20giant\"&gt;earth giants&lt;/a&gt;) following the containment of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Along with his brother &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormlord, as well as Watchers &lt;a href=\"Hodir\"&gt;Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Freya&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mimir\"&gt;Mimir&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, Loken was designated as a guardian to watch over the prison of Yogg-Saron, deep within Ulduar. Over time, however, Loken succumbed to the whispers of the Old God and turned on his allies, taking control of Ulduar and seeking to unravel the plans of his former masters. At some point he provoked a global war to break out between the storm giants and earth giants, which was ended by Loken \"neutralizing\" them. After the conclusion of that war, Loken placed the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, giants, and &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; into stasis at designated holding facilities (presumably, facilities like &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;).\nQuests.\nLoken is also involved in the following quests:\nQuotes.\nEncounter in Halls of Lightning.\n\"See &lt;a href=\"Loken%20%28tactics%29%23Quotes\"&gt;Loken - Quotes&lt;/a&gt;\"\nMyth.\nLoken's name is likely based on , the main trickster of Norse mythology. With Angrboda, he was the father of Fenrir, Jormungandr, and Hel. Although Loki is actually a jotun, he is a blood brother of Odin, and Odin, Thor, and Loki feature in many stories in Norse myth. However, Loki turns on the Aesir when he tricks blind Hodr into killing Balder (or Baldur), setting off the events that would lead to Ragnar\u00f6k. At Ragnar\u00f6k, Loki would lead the jotuns and inglorious dead into battle against the Aesir and the Einherjar (glorious dead), and there he would do battle with Heimdall, the watchmen of the gods, and both would slay each other. Interestingly, it's Loken's death that causes events in WoW to spiral out of control leading to the possible destruction of Azeroth.\nLoken was also referred to as Kronus in the beta, which is a reference to , the first Titan of Greek mythology and father of several deities of the Greek pantheon. This may be an alternate name or a leftover from the alpha, before his name was finalized."}

None could have foreseen that the keeper entrusted to safeguard the world from the Old God's malevolence would be the one responsible for its undoing.\"\nTactics.\nLightning Nova and Pulsing Shockwave.\nIn order to reduce the damage taken from these two abilities, correct positioning and movement is required. The Pulsing Shockwave forces the group to generally stay close to the boss, but whenever he starts casting Lightning Nova (which is announced by an emote), players must run away 20 yards. The group needs to agree beforehand on a run path.\nA frequently chosen pattern is the bright line on the stairs leading from Loken's initial position to a platform and from there further down another flight of stairs. On the pull everybody runs to Loken's initial position, on the first Lightning Nova everybody runs to the platform, on the next back to his initial position. This method has the drawback that people dying on his initial position can be difficult to rez, for this reason it's better to run on the second Nova further down to the end of the stairs, and then back to the platform.\nMoving on the stairs has the general disadvantage that it can cause line of sight problems for the healer. For this reason some groups prefer to run from side to side on the platform where Loken starts (there are pillars on each side of him as reference points).\nArc Lightning.\nThis boss ability has the potential to cause severe damage to the group when people stay close together. If the initial target gets the debuff and all others are within 10 yards, the probability is very high that at least one other player gets the debuff, leading to a nearly neverending chain of Arc Lightnings. To avoid this people need to stay 10 yards apart from each other at all times (this partially conflicts with the positioning required to avoid Pulsing Shockwave). Alternately, players with the debuff can try to run away from the group.\nAlternate Strategies.\nThe problem with running around is that it greatly reduces both healing and DPS, and may cause confusion. So if the healer is able to sustain about 3600 hitpoints healed per second for two minutes, all group members have over 14k health (the tank over 25k), and some form of nature resistance is available, it's possible to simply stay in melee range of the boss and not move at all. The healer in this case must AoE spam heal. This variant works particularly well with a Shaman healer (&lt;a href=\"Riptide\"&gt;Riptide&lt;/a&gt; buffed 4 jump &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; plus &lt;a href=\"Nature%20Resistance%20Totem\"&gt;Nature Resistance Totem&lt;/a&gt;), quite a few groups with shaman healers report success killing Loken in under two minutes for the achievement using this tactic. Average as of patch 3.3 is around 30 seconds using the random dungeon finder.\nOn Heroic level, this should be preferred tactics when all members have 19k health (shield absorption incl.) or better (tank about 30k+). AoE healer a must, preferably priest with &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Redemption\"&gt;Spirit of Redemption&lt;/a&gt; talent, since the fight should be very fast (2mins or less = 3 Nova blasts). Often a Paladin's &lt;a href=\"Judgement%20of%20Light\"&gt;Judgement of Light&lt;/a&gt; can handle most of the Pulsing Shockwave's AoE, assuming that players stand at minimum range. Always good with 2 rezzers to rezz priest, since there will will be casualties in last Nova blast. If party members are below 16-17k at blast they will die. Highly geared players, especially with &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;, can blast Heroic Loken in less than 30 seconds, in which case they only need to worry about one Nova. \nIf the healer sports some integrated self-heal (Paladin or Priests) the following tactic may be appropriate: Loken is kited on his platform as in the standard tactic. The healer is placed 20 yards away from both tanking spots, resulting in a triangle: the two tank spots are two corners of the triangle, connected by the 20 yard run path, the healer stands on the third corner of the triangle, 20 yards away from both other corners. This way, the healer continuously takes damage from Pulsing Shockwave which must be healed through (abilities like &lt;a href=\"Beacon%20of%20Light\"&gt;Beacon of Light&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Binding%20Heal\"&gt;Binding Heal&lt;/a&gt; facilitate this).\nQuests.\nHis death is the objectives of &lt;a href=\"Whatever%20it%20Takes%21\"&gt;Whatever it Takes!&lt;/a&gt; in which players are sent to slay him and take his tongue.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

If Lokholar successfully reaches the Stormpike base, he will stand in front of the &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Baldar\"&gt;Dun Baldar&lt;/a&gt; keep and stay there unless provoked by enemy players, in which case he will give chase until he either leashes back, kills the enemy player, or is killed himself.\nLokholar starts out relatively weaker than his counterpart &lt;a href=\"Ivus%20the%20Forest%20Lord\"&gt;Ivus the Forest Lord&lt;/a&gt;, but he can grow significantly stronger over time if supported by the Horde offensive. Lokholar will gain strength each time an &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; player in the vicinity is killed, and this is shown by the yell: \"Lokholar drinks in your suffering! Let your essence congeal with Lokholar!\" However, Lokholar, while powerful, is not invincible. Without Horde assistance, he can be killed by the enemy Alliance forces with relative ease. Lokholar can be &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d, but due to his frost-based attacks is not easy to do, as he can often &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt; the kiter and kill it before returning to his original position or advance movement.\nLokholar is notorious for his small attackable melee body, with melee players often having to be right dead-center of his body in order to successfully attack him.

Druids are closely tied to nature \u2014 of all the classes, they represent the closest connection to the natural world. Because of this, many druids befriend specific animals, taking them as their animal companions. A druid's animal companion serves as a steadfast ally, and is useful in combat, vigilance and espionage. However, some druids \u2014 particularly among the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elve&lt;/a&gt;s \u2014 give up the standard animal companions. They may feel that it is unfair to put a living member of the natural world through the perils of adventure; they might feel they work better alone; or they might have some other reason. These lone druids focus their extra energy on improving either their combat or spellcasting abilities.\n\"The playable &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; in World of Warcraft is likely the lone druid version of a &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Druid of the Wild&lt;/a&gt;.

Thus, they cannot use &lt;a href=\"glyph\"&gt;glyph&lt;/a&gt;s at all, and can place sigils only on their own bodies.

However, since it must be turned in at Thalanaar, this is of decidedly limited value. The only benefit is that the second character could fly directly to Thalanaar, bypassing the long run there to pick up the book, assuming he already has the Thalanaar FP.

Exceptional quests are quests that were memorable for folks while playing the game or contain a significant amount of lore or world-related information that is interesting for players interested in the world of \"WoW\". Hidden questlines are those that are hard enough to come by that most players never come across them in normal play. Unfortunately, after the launch of the \"Cataclysm\" expansion, many of the older quest lines have been removed from the game, or are at least drastically changed.\nThe list was spawned from a discussion on the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//elitistjerks.com/forums.php\"&gt;Elitist Jerks&lt;/a&gt; forum, called &lt;a href=\"http%3A//elitistjerks.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D10317\"&gt;Long, Hidden, or Exceptional Questlines&lt;/a&gt;.\nNote that items are listed under the first category in which they appear. If a questline is both long and hidden, it appears under \"long.\"\nLong quests.\nCovert Ops - Alpha and Beta.\nA long chain which begins off &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Thenysil\"&gt;Sentinel Thenysil&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; which requires checking up on a night elf sentinel in &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, eventually it leads to killing, material gathering, explosions, distractions and item retrieval for the gnome quest giver &lt;a href=\"Gaxim%20Rustfizzle\"&gt;Gaxim Rustfizzle&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou Are Rakh'likh, Demon.\nAlso known as the \"Fallen Hero\" questline, or simply as the \"Blasted Lands\" questline, this is an exceptionally long set of quests in which the player is tasked with quelling some of the evil demons that have been causing trouble in the Blasted Lands. \nThe questline starts at the &lt;a href=\"Fallen%20Hero%20of%20the%20Horde\"&gt;Fallen Hero of the Horde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;, and continues for many steps. It takes you all around the world, from &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, and has you entering areas that seem to serve no purpose except as a piece of this quest. This is an exceptionally detailed, well-thought-out quest, with a coherent story and good rewards. The chain may require a full group to complete, as it also involves killing four different elites/bosses.\nLinken's quests.\nA gnome NPC named &lt;a href=\"Linken\"&gt;Linken&lt;/a&gt; in Un'Goro gives a rather long questline with some very decent rewards. It, again, takes you all over the world, from Winterspring to Tanaris, and has you helping Linken recover his sword. It's a tribute to the . It begins with &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20a%20Secret%20to%20Everybody\"&gt;It's a Secret to Everybody&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Onyxia Key (discontinued).\nThe quest to get the &lt;a href=\"Drakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; necessary for gaining entrance into &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;'s lair was a long, difficult, elite questline, designed to be completed by a group of 5 players of level 60. The rewards were mediocre, but the questline itself is an excellent example of storytelling and world-building, as it reveals the details of the &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s for the first time, and continues the quests that both factions can do in &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;. \nMoreover, the quests themselves are rather unique. There are a few of the typical, \"Go here, kill this\"-style quests, but there are also unique events, like disguising your character as a member of the Dragonflight and speaking with a dragon. Overall, this questline is worth doing just for the story, even if you never plan to raid Onyxia.\nThis quest chain was largely disabled in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.0.2\"&gt;Patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt; when the requirement of having the amulet was removed from the instance.\nThe Missing Diplomat.\nA long questline for the Alliance that has you running all around the world trying to find the King of Stormwind. Though the questline used to end anti-climatically, it has been continued in &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;. The line is well worth doing if you're looking for some excellent lore about the Human race in WoW. The line &lt;a href=\"The%20Missing%20Diplomat\"&gt;starts here&lt;/a&gt;, and provides &lt;a href=\"Jaina%27s%20Signet%20Ring\"&gt;Jaina's Signet Ring&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Shady Rest Inn.\nThis is a long questline to discover the perpetrators of a hideous act. The second half of the questline was not added until &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.3.0\"&gt;Patch 2.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, so the end remained long hidden, in the spirit of most crime stories. The plot shows a rare example of cooperation between Horde and Alliance to solve a tragic mystery, though the factions characteristically end up getting in each other's way.\nHero of the Mag'har.\nAn exceptional addition to the lore of the Orcs, particularly of Thrall himself, in \"\". This questline has you running errands for Thrall's grandmother, &lt;a href=\"Geyah\"&gt;Geyah&lt;/a&gt;. It's exceptionally long, the rewards are excellent, and the storyline reminds you why you love video games.\nAttunement to the Eye.\nA 25 part quest chain that ends with the player being attuned to the Eye in the Netherstorm. This quest line no longer needs to be completed to enter the eye and formerly awarded the title \"Champion of the Naaru\". The quest line begins with &lt;a href=\"The%20Hand%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;The Hand of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20quests\"&gt;Escape the Lich King's Grasp&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight\"&gt;Death Knight&lt;/a&gt;s start in an instanced version of the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; called the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt; at level 55. After an exceptionally long series of quests involving many famous &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; bosses from &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, you must break free from the Lich's tyrant will with the help of The &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; in a battle with &lt;a href=\"Patchwerk\"&gt;Patchwerk&lt;/a&gt; and his minions. Afterward, the knights ask you to act as an ambassador to the Horde or Alliance. \nOnly One May Rise.\nRated one of the most interesting and difficult quest chains pre-the burning crusade, this adventure begins at &lt;a href=\"Baristolth%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Baristolth of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; and takes people all around Azeroth, exploring unexpected areas and dangerous zones, talking with quiet folk and legends. This is the quest about the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;War of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and is hailed to be the most lore-packed chain in World of Warcraft. Though the quest is not for the everyday quester as it requires effort put into it, players would be tasked with \"unusual\" quests and eventually a focused raid group would have to be formed to battle through the tough Blackrock Mountain, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind Keep, Undercity, The Tainted Scar, Darkwhisper Gorge, Alcaz Island and the Isle of Dread as well as combat World Bosses beyond the difficulty of the four Nightmare Dragons of Azeroth.\nExceptional quests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20For%20The%20Undercity\"&gt;The Battle for Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Apothecary%20Putress\"&gt;Grand Apothecary Putress&lt;/a&gt; have taken the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; by storm and are now holding it as a home base for summoning demons and performing blight experiments. The heroes of the Horde will battle alongside &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; to reclaim the city from Varimathras, while Alliance adventurers must side with &lt;a href=\"Varian\"&gt;Varian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Jaina\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt; to defeat Putress. Each side's viewpoint is unique, so it is recommended that you play it as a Horde and an Alliance character. Both sides, however, will get great enjoyment, as the quest has a rich story and each side will have to fight against multiple bosses to win. \n&lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;.\nWidely hailed as one of the best questlines in the game, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; starts a line of quests that reveals his relationship with the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and explains a large portion of the story behind the army in red. The line begins with &lt;a href=\"Redemption\"&gt;Redemption&lt;/a&gt;, and completes with &lt;a href=\"In%20Dreams\"&gt;In Dreams&lt;/a&gt;. If you level in the Plaguelands, it's definitely worth pursuing this quest line.\n&lt;a href=\"Screecher%20Spirits\"&gt;Screecher Spirits&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdded in a later patch, Screecher Spirits is basically an introduction to the lore that surrounds the god &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, the master of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. It has several pieces that span &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Farrak\"&gt;Zul'Farrak&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Sunken%20Temple\"&gt;The Sunken Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and the rewards are excellent for their level.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Scythe%20of%20Elune%20quest%20chain\"&gt;The Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis is an interesting bit of game. It concerns itself with the lore of &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, though it takes characters around to various places in that area. It also explains the power of &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. The ending to the quest is rather anti-climactic. The intended ending was probably for Alliance characters to go to &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; and retrieve the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, but that never really panned out. The questlines also contains a few bits of cross-faction lore, which is rare in WoW.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Legend%20of%20Stalvan%20quest%20chain\"&gt;The Legend of Stalvan&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quest-line also takes place in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;. Players will be running all around the Duskwood and the other nearby regions to find information on &lt;a href=\"Stalvan%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Stalvan's&lt;/a&gt; past and the horrendous crimes he committed in life, before confronting him as an Undead in an epic battle. Note that since Stalvan has been nerfed into a non-elite, the quest chain does not end off as climactically as before, but is still worth playing for its rich story-line. \n&lt;a href=\"Rewriting%20the%20Battle%20of%20Darrowshire%20quest%20chain\"&gt;Rewriting the Battle of Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Darrowshire\"&gt;Darrowshire&lt;/a&gt; is a ruined town in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The humans could not hold out, and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Horgus%20the%20Ravager\"&gt;Horgus the Ravager&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marduk%20Blackpool\"&gt;Marduk Blackpool&lt;/a&gt; won the day in the name of evil. The trapped spirits would ask your help to save their souls, with you and your allies ultimately battling against Horgus and his army as they invade Darrowshire. \n\"Note: Marduk is not fought because he is now a teacher at the &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.\"\n&lt;a href=\"A%20Letter%20for%20Home\"&gt;A Letter for Home&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quest is quite short, being that you only have to deliver a letter found on the corpse of a supposed \"traitor,\" who had joined the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. However, the traitor in question was actually forced to serve them but had been sabotaging them all along. Your commanding officer has the good taste not to mention your part in the traitor's demise, however, it still leaves a pit of guilt in your stomach, especially after the traitor's loved one writes you back, thanking you.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Lady%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;The Lady's Necklace&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis brief quest has a huge payoff: You give &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; her necklace, and she sings an elven ballad that she remembers from before she was undead. It's absolutely worth spending 30 minutes to complete as a level 80 for this.\n&lt;a href=\"Commander%20Gor%27shak\"&gt;Commander Gor'shak&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis questline, is an excellent way to guide exploration of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, and to get a general sense for the stories and trials that the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Gorge\"&gt;Searing Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Steppes\"&gt;Burning Steppes&lt;/a&gt; are dealing with. The rewards are excellent and the storyline is a great introduction to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth%20quest%20chain\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis series of 8 or so quests has you running errands and finding out about the &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Vargoth\"&gt;Archmage Vargoth&lt;/a&gt;. One of the better additions to &lt;a href=\"The%20Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;The Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the line sports a good story and excellent rewards. See also &lt;a href=\"Malevolent%20Remnants\"&gt;Malevolent Remnants&lt;/a&gt;, available after you finish this line.\n&lt;a href=\"Freedom%20for%20All%20Creatures%20quest%20chain\"&gt;Sprite Darter Egg&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis Alliance-only quest has you running all around the world in pursuit of the final reward: A non-combat Sprite Darter pet. The above links to the quest chain page, but an external guide is available &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.playthingofthegods.net/SpriteDarterHatchlingGuide/SpriteDarterHatchlingGuide.htm\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and the line is recommended to all players just because it's extremely fun.\nHidden quests.\n&lt;a href=\"The%20Moss-twined%20Heart\"&gt;The Moss-twined Heart&lt;/a&gt;.\nStarts from &lt;a href=\"Moss-twined%20Heart\"&gt;Moss-twined Heart&lt;/a&gt;, a drop from the rare mob &lt;a href=\"Blackmoss%20the%20Fetid\"&gt;Blackmoss the Fetid&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Awbee\"&gt;Awbee&lt;/a&gt;'s scale.\nWhile not hidden before \"\", this questline starts in &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Upper Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"The%20Matron%20Protectorate\"&gt;The Matron Protectorate&lt;/a&gt;, making it relatively hidden for the majority of the post-expansion crowd. It explains a small piece of lore dealing with the dragonflights, and has a unique teleportation gimmick in Winterspring that is rather fun. You pick it up from &lt;a href=\"Awbee\"&gt;Awbee&lt;/a&gt; in the dungeon.\n&lt;a href=\"Cortello%27s%20Riddle\"&gt;Cortello's Riddle&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis quest starts from a letter that you pick up inside one of the ships in southern &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;. The line itself ends with a rather simple reward (a 14-slot bag), but the quest texts are riddles, making the line unlike anything else in the game. Don't spoil this for yourself\u2014try to figure out the riddles without resorting to the wowhead spoilers!\n&lt;a href=\"Hilary%27s%20Necklace\"&gt;Hilary's Necklace&lt;/a&gt;.\nNot a hidden quest to the Alliance, but one of the few true cross-faction quests in the game. Horde players can do this quest, but it can rather difficult due to over zealous guards.\n&lt;a href=\"Message%20in%20a%20Bottle\"&gt;Message in a Bottle&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso known as the King Kong quest, this gem of a task starts on the southern beach of STV, where some of the bottles on the beach contain a scroll with a message. The reward is relatively mediocre, but the experience of finding a giant gorilla (&lt;a href=\"King%20Mukla\"&gt;King Mukla&lt;/a&gt;) on an island is pretty outstanding.\n&lt;a href=\"Sully%20Balloo%27s%20Letter\"&gt;Sully Balloo's Letter&lt;/a&gt;.\nPicked up from a letter hidden underwater underneath the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Sweet%20Amber\"&gt;Sweet Amber&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis starts in Westfall, but the level requirement is such that most players will never know it's there. It has you running a small set of errands, and concludes with a nice little trinket reward.\n&lt;a href=\"CLUCK%21\"&gt;CLUCK!&lt;/a&gt;.\nAnother Westfall quest, that has you running around clucking like a chicken for up to five minutes. However, the reward is a &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Chicken\"&gt;Westfall Chicken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"small%20pet\"&gt;small pet&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince &lt;a href=\"patch%203.1.0\"&gt;patch 3.1.0&lt;/a&gt; the same quest is done in &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; so Horde players can get the pet too.\n&lt;a href=\"Test%20of%20Lore\"&gt;Test of Lore&lt;/a&gt;.\nA horde only quest, found in &lt;a href=\"Weathered%20Nook\"&gt;Weathered Nook&lt;/a&gt; started at &lt;a href=\"Dorn%20Plainstalker\"&gt;Dorn Plainstalker&lt;/a&gt;. Takes the player to &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the player have to answer the correct answer to questions about lore along the way."}

The druids raised a veil of mist to shroud the continent of Kalimdor from outsiders before they began their slumber.\n&lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; had become the High Priestess of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and was left alone (by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s who were sleeping in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;) to protect &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; from the dangers of the new &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt;, Tyrande assembled a powerful fighting force from amongst her &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; sisters. The fearless, highly trained &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; women who pledged themselves to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s defense became known as the &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt;. Though they preferred to patrol the shadowy forests of &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; on their own, they had many allies upon which they could call in times of urgency. The demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; remained nearby in the &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. His sons, known as the &lt;a href=\"Keeper%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Keepers of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, kept close watch on the night elves and regularly helped the Sentinels maintain peace in the land. Even Cenarius' shy daughters, the &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s, appeared in the open with increasing frequency. The task of policing Ashenvale kept Tyrande busy. As the long centuries passed while the druids slept, her fears of a second &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; grew. She could not shake the unnerving feeling that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; might still be out there, beyond the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; of the sky, plotting its revenge upon the night elves and the &lt;a href=\"world\"&gt;world&lt;/a&gt; of Azeroth."}

He realized that sea turtles always returned to the shore where they were born, and thus he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Turtle%20Beach\"&gt;Turtle Beach&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt; on Pandaria's southern coast, where he befriended the sea turtle that he named &lt;a href=\"Shen-zin%20Su\"&gt;Shen-zin Su&lt;/a&gt; after the merchant &lt;a href=\"Shen-Zin\"&gt;Shen-Zin&lt;/a&gt;. The turtle carried Liu Lang beyond the mists to the world he knew waited beyond. The common thought of the time was that only Pandaria had not been destroyed in the Sundering, and so Liu Lang was considered to be \"damaged\" in the head for thinking otherwise. This was proven to be incorrect when Liu Lang returned on Shen-zin Su five years later, bringing with him tales of mysterious lands.\nLiu Lang would spend the rest of his life traveling with his sea turtle, making return trips to his homeland every five years, each time bringing with him stories of the wondrous things and races he'd seen, such as &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. Liu always asked others to accompany him, but no one responded. After one visit, as he set out from Pandaria, a single boat followed the turtle. It was a lone, brave soul named &lt;a href=\"Shinizi\"&gt;Shinizi&lt;/a&gt;, who became Liu's wife. During another visit, he requested seven priests for having elements in the back of the turtle. The priests indeed gathered and joined the pair. And so, the brave pandaren joined Liu on his journeys. Shen-zin Su would prove time and again to have grown even larger from the last visit, until his shell had enough space to support an entire colony.\nThose afflicted with wanderlust would often stare out to sea during those five year trips, waiting for Liu Lang's return. This would give rise to the expression \"waiting for the turtle\", asked to someone who is caught gazing off to the horizon for whatever reason.\nAs it is with all pandaren Liu Lang eventually passed on. On his final voyage from Pandaria at the age of 122, weary and old, he placed his bamboo umbrella in what would later be called the &lt;a href=\"Wood%20of%20Staves\"&gt;Wood of Staves&lt;/a&gt; and rested in its shade. It is said that his spirit has merged with the lands on Shen-zin Su's back and that the umbrella grew into a giant tree.\nHis followers' descendants, whom Shen-zin Su would dub the \"grandchildren\" of Liu Lang, still travel on the great turtle's shell to see the world. The turtle has continued to grow since Liu Lang's time to a truly massive size, supporting several villages, forest, and small mountain ranges. The settlers would appropriately call the sea turtle's shell \"the &lt;a href=\"Wandering%20Isle\"&gt;Wandering Isle&lt;/a&gt;\".\n&lt;a href=\"Legacy%20of%20Liu%20Lang\"&gt;Statues&lt;/a&gt; of Liu Lang are always sitting on a matching one of Shen-zin Su, with a lantern to light up the darkness, and an umbrella - just as he did long ago - to protect himself from the weather."}

While most raiding druids are specialists who would find other trinkets superior, this is nevertheless a useful trinket for a variety of situations. Restoration druids who need soloing gear will especially appreciate the proc. Feral Tanks who are close to the armor cap of 35,580 might benefit from other trinkets when tanking. \nThe proc appears to be a flat 3% per spell or attack, with no hidden cooldown (unlike &lt;a href=\"Hourglass%20of%20the%20Unraveller\"&gt;Hourglass of the Unraveller&lt;/a&gt;). The buff can proc while the buff is already up, renewing the duration. Thus, druids using faster attacks (Cat 1.0 attack speed or Tree spamming Lifebloom after every 1.5 second global cooldown) will proc more often. For a Tree druid, this trinket can compete for +heal/5 min with dedicated healing trinkets such as the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City%20Prayerbook\"&gt;Lower City Prayerbook&lt;/a&gt;."}

First, head just to the southeast. In the center of a pit is Master Klem, a level 85 elite human warrior with 387k health. Aggro him, knock off 20% of his health and keep him still as Shaw will spawn 20 yards behind him and stealth up to him.\nGarona, once she gets in range, will stunlock and finish Klem off. Head to the southeast next. Just south of &lt;a href=\"Cannon%27s%20Inferno\"&gt;Cannon's Inferno&lt;/a&gt; is a big twilight building with Mia the Rose inside. She is a level 85 elite night elf rogue with 387k health. Same as before, knock off at least 20% of her health before Garona will spawn. Pop trinkets and fight defensively, she hits hard.\nBlindeye is just to the west, at the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Ascension\"&gt;Altar of Ascension&lt;/a&gt;, so take a slight detour and kill him. He is a level 85 ettin with 154k health. Garona will not help out on this kill, however.\nFinally, keep heading southwest. In the shadow of the Twilight Altar is a small building just to the west of it. Inside is Dame Alys Finnsson, a level 85 elite worgen druid with 387k health. She fights in cat form."}

It is illustrated by &lt;a href=\"Cory%20Godbey\"&gt;Cory Godbey&lt;/a&gt;. The story is an origin myth for the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Child\"&gt;Blue Child&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s smallest moon, and the rare alignment known as the &lt;a href=\"Embrace\"&gt;Embrace&lt;/a&gt;.\nSummary.\nThe story is told by an unspecified narrator to an audience they repeatedly call \"O my dearest, O my loves\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"White%20Lady\"&gt;White Lady&lt;/a&gt; carries out her task of watching over the sleeping &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and her people during the night, while the &lt;a href=\"Sun\"&gt;Sun&lt;/a&gt; holds the same duty during the day. Each night when the Sun sets, the magic of twilight creates a bridge upon which the Lady can walk into the sky from her rest. The Lady loves watching the world and its peoples and guiding the ocean tides, but realizes that this is a distant love and that she longs for someone closer to her. While her friends, the stars, turn to their families to form constellations and the Sun loves himself and does not need a family, the Lady grows saddened when she realizes that there is no one to be her family.\nShe continues her vigil, sometimes turning her face away from the world but eventually always returning. One day, as she looks down on Azeroth and its people, she feels such a fierce love for them that the &lt;a href=\"Blue%20Child\"&gt;Blue Child&lt;/a&gt; comes into being\u2014the narrator notes that even the old stories do not say exactly how. This begins the most joyous time in the cosmos, known to the present only as half-remembered tales of beauty and harmony: the Sun and stars glow brighter than before and Azeroth herself smiles in her slumber. The White Lady and the Blue Child enjoy a time of bliss with each other, dancing, playing and, during the day, slumbering in each other's arms. The Child eventually starts asking questions about where she came from and about the mortals and world that she and her mother are watching over. The Child eventually asks what she was before becoming herself, to which the Lady replies that the Child is everything she wished for and that loving her makes her happy. In response, the Child solemnly asks what she needs to make \"her\" happy. Having not previously realized that her daughter was unhappy, the Lady stays silent and sheds tears onto the world below.\nThe next evening, the Lady wakes up and discovers that the Child has disappeared. Despairing, she asks the stars where the Child has gone without result and then races across the dusk bridge to the Sun to ask the same of him. Though he intimidates her with his size and heat, she remains by his side, her fear and anger causing her to turn red\u2014thus, the narrator notes, the moon turning red is a sign that she's angry. After not receiving any help from the Sun either, the Lady whispers the same question to Azeroth, who remains asleep and doesn't answer. In her anger, the Lady refuses to continue her charge of watching over Azeroth and turns her face away from the world to wait until her Child returns. As a result, the world speeds up, the tides cease, many cities are drowned, and the people of Azeroth plead for the Lady's return. The stars tell the Lady of the suffering she's causing and suggest that the Child might be lost and that she'll come home if she sees her mother's light again. Accepting the advice, the Lady resumes her old position in the night sky, returning the world to normal.\nTime passes, but the Child does not return. Growing fearful again, the Lady starts shining even brighter, growing larger and moving closer to Azeroth until she outshines even the Sun. The constant light causes the tides to rage, the mortals to be deprived of rest, and crops to burn, and the world descends into chaos and starvation. One denizen of Azeroth, a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; mother grieving for her dying child, begins to sing:\nThe stars hear this song and pass it along to the White Lady, who realizes that she is hurting other mothers who also love their children. She dims her light, retreats to her old duties, and waits for the Blue Child to find her. The human mother teaches her song to her daughter, who teaches it to her own daughter and so on, and the narrator notes that this is how this time and this song is still remembered and that only the Lady knows how many have sung it.\nOne day the Child suddenly returns, happier than ever before, and jumps into her mother's embrace. All the inhabitants of Azeroth stop to watch the spectacle, and the narrator states that there has never been a joy greater than the Child's return to her mother. Their combined light stretches across the sky like the love connecting all parents and children. The Child tells her mother that she has traveled to distant worlds and interacted with stars, moons, and suns. The Lady realizes that by going off alone, her daughter has grown wise and become a person all her own. She also realizes that her Child will ultimately grow restless and leave again, but that she'll always return when she is ready. Thus, the narrator explains, most will never see the White Lady embrace the Blue Child, but the sky is luminous with their joy when they reunite and, in the meantime, the Lady continues shining her light on the world.\nSpeculation.\nIt's never stated what (if any) Azerothian culture the story or its narrator hail from. The story's illustrations depict the Lady and Child as elven figures, implying a connection to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elven&lt;/a&gt; mythology. However, the only race referred to by name in the story is &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, a race that the night elves were unaware of and isolated from for the majority of their history, and the narrator's claim that the human mother passing her song down through the generations is the reason the time period is still known today rather implies that the narrator themself is a human."}

Lo'Gosh and his companions enter &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt; to confront a &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;vicious black dragon&lt;/a&gt; and face the evil usurper of King Varian's throne.\nPlot.\nLo'Gosh, &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Broll%20Bearmantle\"&gt;Broll&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Reginald&lt;/a&gt; ride into &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; through the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;. Thargas points out that a more secretive approach would have been safer, but Lo'Gosh counters that a public spectacle will force the dragon into the open and allow them to reveal Varian's impostor for all to see. From the far side of the Valley of Heroes, &lt;a href=\"General%20Marcus%20Jonathan\"&gt;General Marcus Jonathan&lt;/a&gt; spots the approaching company and tells his men to stand at attention and trumpet Varian's return.\n\"Varian\" and &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Katrana&lt;/a&gt; hear the trumpets from within Stormwind Keep and rush out onto a balcony. Upon seeing the newcomers, Lady Prestor is distraught and calls for their arrest, while Varian is shocked to see that the lead rider looks identical to him.\nMeanwhile, in &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;'s room, the prince confides to &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; that he feared his father's strange behavior was a sign that he had been replaced by an impostor. However, after Varian saved Anduin's life and remembered more about his captivity, he's begun to seem more like his old self at times, except for when Katrana is near. Upon hearing the trumpets, Anduin runs out on his own balcony and is confused to see his father accompanying Marshal Windsor and a group of strangers, while his father is also simultaneously standing with Katrana on his balcony. Anduin runs back inside to grab his sword, telling Bolvar that Katrana doesn't rule in Stormwind and that the prince and highlord need to take an active hand in what is happening.\nKatrana tells General Jonathan to throw Lo'Gosh's party in the dungeons. Lo'Gosh tells Marcus that \"he\" is the real King Varian, that Stormwind is threatened by a disguised black dragon, and that the man on the balcony is an impostor pretending to be the king. Marcus tells Reginald that he cannot let them pass, but Reginald reminds him of the time they served together under &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; and firmly states that Lady Prestor is a dragon while Lo'Gosh is their true king. Convinced that Reginald would not lie, Marcus lets Lo'Gosh's party pass.\nKatrana tells the guards to kill the \"impostors\" attempting to enter the keep and to fetch Prince Anduin, despite Varian's protests. Lo'Gosh, Thargas, Broll, and Valeera burst into the throne room and call Lady Prestor by her true name: Onyxia. Huge black wings suddenly unfold from Katrana's back, smashing Varian into a nearby wall, and while the lady's face grows monstrous and reptilian, she declares that Varian is a useless tool and far more trouble than any human she has ever dealt with. Finally assuming her true, massive form, Onyxia declares that she will now deal with the king permanently. The guards around the room also shed their disguises, transforming into &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonspawn\"&gt;black dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; to defend their mistress. While Lo'Gosh and his companions battle the creatures, Varian picks up his own sword and decides that he will no longer be the dragon's puppet.\nAnduin \u2014 armed with a bow \u2014 and Bolvar run toward the sounds of battle in the throne room. After killing a dragonspawn who attempts to seize hold of Anduin, the two of them come upon the fight. Reginald tells Bolvar that he couldn't risk telling him about Prestor's identity earlier since the dragon has spies everywhere. Suddenly, Onyxia sets her eyes on Windsor and incinerates him with her lava breath, killing him.\nWhile fighting the dragonspawn, Lo'Gosh and Varian come face to face and clash. Lo'Gosh considers Varian to be a pretender, while Varian retorts that he had begun to fight off Onyxia's spell and that Lo'Gosh himself must be an impostor conjured by Onyxia to take the king's place. Their duel is interrupted when Onyxia breathes fire at them, attempting to kill them both. Elsewhere in the fight, Bolvar is impressed by Anduin's archery skills, and the prince explains that he was taught by his father. Varian and Lo'Gosh both turn at the sound of their son's voice. Although confused by the two men who both look like his father, Anduin reminds them that they should be fighting the dragon and not each other. After dodging another of Onyxia's fire breaths, Varian and Lo'Gosh decide that the boy is right and agree to sort out their differences after they've sorted out the dragon.\nThe heroes continue trying to assault Onyxia but discover that her scales are impervious to their weapons. Anduin tries to fire an arrow at the dragon's unprotected eyes, but misses his shot and instead simply attracts Onyxia's attention. The dragon grabs Anduin with one of her forelegs, telling him that she's prepared a \"special welcome\" for him at home and that she will test him to see if he is as much trouble as his sire. Onyxia flies up into the air and teleports away, taking the prince with her.\nVarian and Lo'Gosh are left behind in the rubble of the throne room and agree to a temporary truce until Anduin has been saved. They both state that they've begun to remember what happened to them while they were lost; a tale that involves treachery and dark sorcery. Bolvar speculates that once Onyxia is destroyed, whichever Varian is the false one will simply disappear. Against that eventuality, Lo'Gosh suggests that he and Varian compare their memories while the group journeys to &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair\"&gt;Onyxia's Lair&lt;/a&gt;, since together they may hold the key to Onyxia's destruction."}

Crowd control the adds, then focus on the vindicators. These may heal, but their heals are weak enough to simply ignore. The vindicators also have a cleanse, so CCers should pay close attention to the mobs they're in charge of. Packs three and four have varying mobs and NPC types.\nA kill order that worked well for us was Vindicator, Apprentice Star Scryer, Legionnaire, Astromancer, Star Scryer.\nThis pack patrols from Al'ar's room to the entrance, and should be the second pack you kill in the instance. Kill the squires first, as these heal.\nOnce you reach Al'ar's room you'll find 2 of these packs. Each pack patrols in roughly a half-circle, one on the left, the other on the right. Each pack consists of 2 falconers, and 5-7 hatchlings. Pull 1 pack down the hallway with a hunter using Misdirection to the tank to avoid getting knocked back into the room and pulling the other pack. Crowd control the hatchlings as they pass. There is a glitch with LOS in the hallway so that you can not rely on LOS to get the Falconer to move down the hallway. The person with aggro (the tank that was Misdirected onto) must move far enough down the hall (a few steps into the wider section of the hallway) to get out of range of the Falconers to get them into the hallway. Kill any Hatchlings that are not crowd controlled, then focus fire on the Falconers. As much CC as possible is recommended\nThe Crucible.\nFirst is the solo pull of the Crystalcore Devastator that moves backwards and forwards along the entire length of the hall.\nAfter this patrol is destroyed, there will be a group of two Crystalcore Sentinels. Farther down the hall are two more. On each pull, the tanks should separate the two mobs so that the AoEs do not overlap, and be careful not to drag the mob into the ranged / healer group.\nThere are five of these packs, with varying mobs as listed below. The first pack patrols inside 's room, near the door. The other four packs are static, and arranged in a semicircle on the near side of the room, one in the center, two to the left and one to the right. The patrolling pack and the center one need to be pulled back into the hall. The remaining packs can be fought inside the room, with the raid standing up against the wall behind the pack for the pull.\nThe challenge of these pulls is to keep the s from killing the crowd-controlling Warlocks or Mage on the pull. A tactic that worked well for us was to have a hunter use Misdirection on the tank, and then use &lt;a href=\"Multi-shot\"&gt;Multi-shot&lt;/a&gt; to get aggro on both Crystalcore Mechanics. On the first two pulls (into the hallway) the crowd-controlling players should stand just inside the door and apply crowd control as the mobs run past. The kill order should be: Crystalcore Devastator or Crystalcore Sentinels first, followed by the Crystalcore Mechanics, followed by the Tempest-Smiths. The raid should spread out as much as possible when fighting the Smiths to limit the number of players that are hit by the bombs these mobs throw. Healers will need to watch the health of the entire raid while fighting the Mechanics and Smiths, as the AoE Sawblades or Bombs can rapidly kill many players if the healing lags behind. Another tweak that may help is to have a rogue sap the &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Smith\"&gt;Tempest Smith&lt;/a&gt; before the pull to eliminate the stunning bomb they throw.\nThese groups will fully respawn if not completely killed.\nType 1\nType 2\nType 3\nThe Solarium.\nAE the novices and tank the squires.\nTempest Bridge.\nPulls in order: Pack Type One, Patrol, Pack Type One (x2), Pack Type Two (x2), Patrol, Pack Type Two, Boss Time."}

The guardian casts a debuff on you ('Mark of Anzu') every so often that increases your magic damage taken by 10% each time it stacks, so the longer the battle goes, the more damage you will take. \nWhile it doesn't directly matter which form you use to do your damage, this guardian does more ranged damage than he does in melee. He occasionally uses a knockback spell (Twisting Blast) that will throw you back a ways. You will want to position yourself so that you are knocked back into a wall rather than into the water.\n&lt;a href=\"Cat%20form\"&gt;Cat form&lt;/a&gt; often has the best DPS ability, but &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20form\"&gt;Moonkin form&lt;/a&gt; may also be useful if available. If you prefer humanoid form, remember that shapeshifting breaks the polymorph that he also casts. (If you are already shapeshifted, the polymorph has no effect on you.)\nIn Cat form, &lt;a href=\"Maim\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt; can be used for a respite, long enough to get a heal or two off."}

Interrupt Shock when possible and avoid being hit by Cascade and Windwall.\nAround 75% health:\nAt 1% health, the wounded emperor becomes unattackable.\nVorrik and Nisha go to stand a short distance south. Talk to Vorrik to turn in.\nCompleting this quest rewards the \"Storming the Spire\" portion of &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20in%20the%20Sands\"&gt;Secrets in the Sands&lt;/a&gt;. Vorrik offers the followup &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20Under%20Siege\"&gt;Sanctuary Under Siege&lt;/a&gt;, which leads to the final chapter of the &lt;a href=\"Vol%27dun%20storyline\"&gt;Vol'dun storyline&lt;/a&gt;."}
