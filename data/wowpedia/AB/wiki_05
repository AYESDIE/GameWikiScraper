He is a true warrior at heart, and unlike other gnomes has no interest in experiments or gadgets. He was originally located at &lt;a href=\"Marshal%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Marshal's Refuge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s had to help him recover his lost memories and uncover the reason he'd traveled to the crater.\nHe disappeared from Un'Goro after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, but reappears in &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;The Protectors of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gnomeregan%20Run\"&gt;Great Gnomeregan Run&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIt's unclear where Linken comes from, but he has mentioned a \"homeland\" and that he used to embark on travels \"A long time ago\". A &lt;a href=\"%3AFaded%20Photograph\"&gt;:Faded Photograph&lt;/a&gt; depicts him standing with an unknown female gnome in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Heroes\"&gt;Valley of Heroes&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the last step in a journey, Linken came to &lt;a href=\"Un%27Goro%20Crater%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Un'Goro Crater&lt;/a&gt; to fight the evil &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Blazerunner\"&gt;Blazerunner&lt;/a&gt; and recover the &lt;a href=\"%3AGolden%20Flame\"&gt;:Golden Flame&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful artifact from his homeland. He was supposed to send his &lt;a href=\"Linken%27s%20Training%20Sword\"&gt;training sword&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Donova%20Snowden\"&gt;Donova Snowden&lt;/a&gt; so she could magically temper it as well as enlist &lt;a href=\"Eridan%20Bluewind\"&gt;Eridan Bluewind&lt;/a&gt;'s help in creating a totem to dispel Blazerunner's protective aura. However, before he could do these things, he somehow crashed &lt;a href=\"A%20Wrecked%20Raft\"&gt;his raft&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Marshlands\"&gt;Marshlands&lt;/a&gt;, got bumped on the head, and lost all his memories. He wandered the crater until he remembered a piece of advice someone had once given him\u2014\"Go up, up the mountain ahead\"\u2014and made his way to &lt;a href=\"Marshal%27s%20Refuge\"&gt;Marshal's Refuge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"J.D.%20Collie\"&gt;J.D. Collie&lt;/a&gt; was kind to him when he arrived.\nAn &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; found Linken's wrecked boat and belongings and brought the latter to him at the refuge, prompting him to remember that he was supposed to send his sword to Donova. She improved the sword as planned, but in order to finish it, the adventurer would need to speak to &lt;a href=\"Gaeriyan\"&gt;Gaeriyan&lt;/a&gt;, a ghost in &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Tanaris&lt;/a&gt;. After some efforts, the adventurer got a &lt;a href=\"Videre%20Elixir\"&gt;Videre elixir&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Gregan%20Brewspewer\"&gt;Gregan Brewspewer&lt;/a&gt; and used it to speak to Gaeriyan, who instructed them to empower the sword using a &lt;a href=\"A%20Conspicuous%20Gravestone\"&gt;secret gravestone&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Gadgetzan\"&gt;Gadgetzan&lt;/a&gt;. The adventurer gave the finished sword back to Linken, but he still couldn't remember what he'd needed it for in the first place. J.D. Collie revealed that when he'd first come to the refuge in a disoriented state, he'd mentioned having to talk to Eridan Bluewind to make a totem.\nEridan wasn't familiar with Linken, but understood the reason he wanted her help. She had the adventurer gather reagents from &lt;a href=\"Felwood%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; and then bring them to &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Rigger%20Cove\"&gt;Lost Rigger Cove&lt;/a&gt;, where they summoned the elemental &lt;a href=\"Aquementas\"&gt;Aquementas&lt;/a&gt;, the only creature who could transform the reagents into a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Totem%20of%20Aquementas\"&gt;silver totem&lt;/a&gt; to fight Blazerunner. The adventurer brought the finished totem back to Linken, causing the rest of his memories to return. However, he decided that after all they'd done, it was the adventurer who was now the hero, not him, and it was up to them to finish the quest and defeat Blazerunner. The adventurer returned with the Golden Flame, which Linken stated would be returned to his homeland. He gave the adventurer a gift as thanks for all their help and declared them the \"hero of Un'Goro Crater\".\nLater appearances.\nLinken disappeared from Un'Goro after the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, having presumably returned to his homeland as he said he would.\nLinken is one of the companions who can appear during &lt;a href=\"The%20Protectors%20of%20Hyjal\"&gt;The Protectors of Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; to help adventurers fight &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;' forces in &lt;a href=\"Sethria%27s%20Roost\"&gt;Sethria's Roost&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Gnomeregan%20Run\"&gt;Great Gnomeregan Run&lt;/a&gt;, Linken is seen outside the &lt;a href=\"Rebel%20Camp\"&gt;Rebel Camp&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Stranglethorn\"&gt;Northern Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;, cheering at the race participants.\nItems.\nLinken is or was the owner of the following items:"}

Having no parents and being raised among mages, she grew to be talented and cold. Years ago, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; met her. She stopped in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; on her way north. It was unknown at the time that she was secretly training as a &lt;a href=\"necromancer\"&gt;necromancer&lt;/a&gt;, and had been in contact with &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt;. He called her to be by his side as he sowed the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, and she was instrumental in raising the undead to strengthen the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;'s army.\nWith that done, she began training necromancers to further serve the Scourge. She had met with some resistance, as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; did what they could to stop her. The Forsaken were desperate for the powers of a necromancer, and they focused on the trainees to try to entice them to their side. However, the Scourge had so much more to offer a necromancer, and most of them served &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. With Linnena training them, they became as cold and calculating as she was.\nLinnena's whereabouts are currently unknown, but her name is whispered enough to assure Brann Bronzebeard that she is still alive and well, and still raising the undead around &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Brann suspected she was in southern Lordaeron, around the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, or sniffing around the proud city of &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;Aerie Peak&lt;/a&gt;. After depleting the &lt;a href=\"graveyard\"&gt;graveyard&lt;/a&gt;s of their dead, Brann suspected she could be planning on slaughtering the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s in the area and then raising them, but he feared she was hunting the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragon\"&gt;green dragon&lt;/a&gt;s that patrolled and protecting the area. The Scourge was terrifying. The Scourge accompanied by undead green dragons would be a juggernaut."}

When negotiations opened up between the Horde and Alliance each side sent a diplomat to the other side- &lt;a href=\"Nita\"&gt;Nita&lt;/a&gt; was sent to the Alliance and Baenan was sent to the Horde. However, soon after arriving, Nita was placed in chains and &lt;a href=\"Marco%20Heller\"&gt;Captain Heller&lt;/a&gt; claimed that Nita had attacked him when in reality she been taken her prisoner because he wanted to ensure that the Horde sail back to &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen learning that the Horde was demanding their surrender and that not complying would see Baenan die, Heller declared that if Baenan's life was forfeit then so too was Nita's. A confrontation erupted as Lintharel spoke in Nita's defense, declaring that she was just as much as a victim as anyone, and countering that to betray a friend would be an equal sin after her commander accused her of committing treason against the Alliance. With Li Li and Trialin aiding Lintharel, Nita was freed. Although Heller was able to take advantage of the \"Warchief's Fist\" exploding to ram his sword through Lintharel, severely wounding her, he was slain by Atropa before he could finish her.\nSoon after the \"Elwynn\" sank into the sea, with Baenan, Trialin, Lintharel, Atropa, and Nita moving towards land, and &lt;a href=\"Chen\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; and Li Li returning on their quest to reach &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;."}

As predators, lions tend to be and will attack &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s who approach them.\nThey are the fiercest of predators in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. The lions that stalk amongst the tall grass do so with cunning, stealth, and power.\nThe noble and fearless lion is one of the traditional, bestial emblems of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;ity. For generations it has adorned prominently the crests of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (as well as being a popular motif in Stormwind's sister-kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn the RPG.\nMale lions are between 5 to 8 feet long and weighs 330 to 550 pounds. Females are slightly smaller. Some hunters choose them as their animal companion.\nDire lion.\nDire lions are large lions found on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;. Their faces constantly betray a look of aggression. Dire lions are patient hunters, just like their smaller cousin, but apt take on considerably larger prey. Many dire lions grow to be up to 15 feet long and weigh up to 1,000 pounds. A dire lion attacks by running at prey, leaping, and clawing and biting as it rakes with its rear claws. It often jumps onto a creature larger than itself. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; under &lt;a href=\"Dedrik%20Thunderaxe\"&gt;Dedrik Thunderaxe&lt;/a&gt; had trained a dire lion to guard their cavern, and to ignore dwarves (it would not attack them). The lion wore an iron collar with two large loops on the top. They fed it a myriad of delicacies, including &lt;a href=\"gnoll\"&gt;gnoll&lt;/a&gt;s."}

He was particularly close with the middle sister, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;. Though physically weak, he was a brilliant singer and musician and made a name for himself performing at &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Saltheril\"&gt;Lord Saltheril&lt;/a&gt;'s parties. After performing for &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; at one such party, the prince was so impressed that he invited Lirath to &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;'s Artists' Quarter and found him an apprenticeship. Eventually, Lirath was named Royal Musician and began training other musicians.\nDespite his love and talent for music, Lirath still found himself wishing at times that he had become a &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; like his three sisters. When their parents were killed in an apparent &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani troll&lt;/a&gt; attack in &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;, Lirath demanded that Sylvanas--now Ranger-General of the &lt;a href=\"Farstriders\"&gt;Farstriders&lt;/a&gt;--train him to fight. Sylvanas refused, unwilling to let him risk himself in combat and vowing to protect him. Lirath instead went to his sister &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa&lt;/a&gt;, who agreed and began secretly training him at &lt;a href=\"Windrunner%20Village\"&gt;Windrunner Village&lt;/a&gt;. When the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; cut their way into &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; and attacked the village, Lirath was killed along with several uncles, aunts, and cousins.\nSylvanas found and recovered his body. She was crushed by his death and swore she would punish whoever had trained him to fight, believing that if not for them Lirath would have remained safe in Silvermoon. When Vereesa admitted to training him, Sylvanas stopped speaking to her. He was then buried alongside their parents in the family plot. Lirath's oldest sister, &lt;a href=\"Alleria%20Windrunner\"&gt;Alleria&lt;/a&gt;, swore revenge and began hunting down all remaining &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s after the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the third war, Sylvanas (already undead) went to visit Lirath's tomb, praying that he had not become one of the ghosts that haunted the \"Ghost Lands.\" To the relief of the Banshee Queen, her brother's tomb was intact.\nApperance.\nLirath was a thin high elf with pale skin, he had golden blonde hair like his sister Alleria, the reason for his nickname \" Little Lord Sun\" and he had the typical blue eyes of the Windrunners.\nAbilities.\nLirath was known for being an incredibly talented musician, being quite popular in the high elf court, even King &lt;a href=\"Anasterian%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Anasterian&lt;/a&gt; and Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; were impressed by his talent, he was skilled at every instrument but his voice was his best quality."}

In keeping with the goblin fixation upon profit, these large crafts tend to be packed with cargo or paying passengers.\nHistory.\nSecond War.\nZeppelins were ingenious inventions that allowed small teams of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to soar above the countryside and spy on enemy positions. The zeppelins were cumbersome, awkward and maintained no armament. Their airborne capabilities, extensive line of sight, and ability to spot underwater units, however, made them an integral part of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s spy network.\nThese goblins were members of the &lt;a href=\"Steamwheedle%20Cartel\"&gt;Steamwheedle Cartel&lt;/a&gt;. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; zeppelins crews were only a single pilot, but sometimes they also consisted of a pilot and an engine tender.\nThird War.\nAfter the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the goblins realized their mistake and left the Horde. They are now a neutral force, making money off every side. Zeppelins could be hired at special &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20laboratory\"&gt;laboratories&lt;/a&gt; found all over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the late days of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; started employing special &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Barge\"&gt;Sky Barge&lt;/a&gt;s to transport its troops.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIn the times following the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, goblin zeppelins are employed once again by the Horde for the passage of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt; between the continents. Although some of the goblins remain a neutral force, the Horde alone has the privilege of using zeppelins. Modern zeppelins have eight member crews including a sky-captain, a chief officer, a navigator, three crewmen, and two Horde &lt;a href=\"guard\"&gt;guard&lt;/a&gt;s. The goblins also worked on creating the Horde &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt;s, employing a similar technology as the zeppelins.\nLorewise, neutral goblin zeppelins do exist and they allow the transport of soldiers, but heavy weaponry, such as &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s, are forbidden to maintain neutrality. Playful &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s can also buy &lt;a href=\"Darkmoon%20Zeppelin\"&gt;Darkmoon Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Paper%20Zeppelin\"&gt;Paper Zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s.\nZeppelin routes.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", you won't see free-flying zeppelins without a specific course. They now follow established routes with a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin%20tower\"&gt;zeppelin tower&lt;/a&gt; at each end point. Some cargo zeppelins can be seen crashed in places.\nIn the RPG.\nA goblin zeppelin is a form of &lt;a href=\"transportation\"&gt;transportation&lt;/a&gt; that consists of a wooden gondola attached to a large balloon, into which hot air is pumped by a &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt; boiler. They are swift, able to make long journeys, and pass above rough terrain.\nThe pilot of the zeppelin can control the direction through the use of ropes which are connected to both the steering wheel in the gondola, as well as fins on the balloon's back. Altitude is maintained or adjusted by the degree of inflation of the balloon, as well as with ballast. Moving in a direction or changing speed requires thrust, given by one or more rotors.\nThe zeppelin is an example of one of the most stable technological devices to be found on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; (a trait uncommon of goblin inventions), and malfunctions tend to be non-threatening. Naturally, it is possible for the zeppelin to drift off course or develop a leak, but only rarely will the phlogiston boiler have difficulty, and even rarer still will it explode.\nSince the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, zeppelins have become a widespread method of transportation, due to development by the goblins. After the Second War, the goblins rescinded their alliance with the Horde and began selling their goods and services to the highest bidder. Throughout the course of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the zeppelins were employed by both the Horde and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Their speed had increased substantially and the zeppelins were now able to travel over long distances and rough terrain, as well as carry vast numbers of troops.\nZeppelins come in different designs and sizes, and different zeppelins have different crew sizes. Zeppelins are manned by at least a pilot. Some are manned by a pilot, navigator, and &lt;a href=\"engineer\"&gt;engineer&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; do not like goblins, for they see them as materialistic and technology-driven. Wildhammers take pride in zeppelin hunting.\nZeppelins moved at 40 miles per hour in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20RPG\"&gt;Warcraft RPG&lt;/a&gt;, but it was changed to 15 miles per hour in the . Zeppelins can cover about five hundred miles in a twelve-hour day of travel, allowing the crew time to rest and make any necessary repairs. An &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorer's Guild&lt;/a&gt; trip from &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Grove\"&gt;Sunwell Grove&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; was made in just under 80 days.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", a zeppelin built and piloted by &lt;a href=\"Gazlowe\"&gt;Gazlowe&lt;/a&gt; helped &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; travel around the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;. The zeppelin had several components, including a &lt;a href=\"%3Asamophlange\"&gt;:samophlange&lt;/a&gt;, and flew during over ten missions during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;."}

My current assistant is less methodical than I\u2019d like.\nPlease relay to Dr. Boom that I require an assistant with the wit and precision for the work at hand. And if they manage to meet my expectations? Well, I\u2019ll make more."}

Zereketh stands at the entrance to Arcatraz, ready to slay all who would dare challenge him.\"\nStrategies.\nThe fight is very simple, stay away from the Void Zones. Seed of Corruption can be healed through, although this is rarely an issue. If you get the Seed of Corruption, move away from the rest of the group to avoid unnecessary damage to party members. Also, don't stand near people with the debuff. In normal mode, ranged DPSers can avoid his Shadow Nova (~34 yards range) by being at max range. In Heroic mode, his Shadow Nova's range is increased to 45 yards, though. It is imperative that you get out of the Void Zones as quickly as possible, because as soon as they spawn it is instant damage for 1200-1300 every second.\nIt is advisable for the MT to tank the boss with his back to a wall and just move up or down the wall as the void zones appear. This is to avoid getting knocked out of range of heals when Zereketh does his knockback.\nRanged DPS and Heal should stand behind the column on the north-east side of the room. When Zereketh casts Shadownova, move behind the column (out of LoS) to avoid the Shadownova.\nNote: the void zones tend to be spawned underneath random players in the party \"including\" the MT, everyone needs to be wary of them. Valid targets for void zones also includes totems and pets. If at all possible, spread pets and totems out. Totems are immune to the void zone damage.\nHaving shadow resist on the Main tank on this fight makes the boss a lot easier, at 300 Shadow Resist the combat log showed the main tank taking 300-500 damage a hit with roughly 1100-1300 resisted. This set can consist of any armor class just like the pandemonious fight."}

During the &lt;a href=\"%3ANecrolords%20Campaign\"&gt;:Necrolords Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, it is captured by the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord Covenant&lt;/a&gt; and subsequently patrols above &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; was personally involved in the design of the Zerekriss and shaped the form of the vessel with his hands. &lt;a href=\"Whisperer%20Vyn\"&gt;Whisperer Vyn&lt;/a&gt; was present to witness the event. The Zerekriss was stationed above the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt;, moored to a platform in the &lt;a href=\"Ossein%20Foundry\"&gt;Ossein Foundry&lt;/a&gt; by a necrotic restraining bolt and protected by &lt;a href=\"Vo%27treus%20the%20Keyguard\"&gt;Vo'treus the Keyguard&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to bolster the Necrolord defenses at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Vashj\"&gt;Baroness Vashj&lt;/a&gt; devised a plan to steal a necropolis from their foes. With the help of Necrolord &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s, she assembled a crew consisting of surviving members of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Eyes\"&gt;House of Eyes&lt;/a&gt; and renegades from other houses: Whisperer Vyn, &lt;a href=\"Navigator%20Xennir\"&gt;Navigator Xennir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ansid%20the%20Mechanic\"&gt;Ansid the Mechanic&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Helmsman%20Caliroux\"&gt;Helmsman Caliroux&lt;/a&gt;. Reinforced by &lt;a href=\"Khaliiq\"&gt;Khaliiq&lt;/a&gt; and the Maw Walkers, the crew infiltrated the Ossein Foundry and, despite some unforeseen complications, managed to rendezvous, kill the foundry's taskmaster &lt;a href=\"Enforcer%20Borgulla\"&gt;Enforcer Borgulla&lt;/a&gt;, and take control of the Zerekriss' mooring platform. The Maw Walkers then flew with &lt;a href=\"Twigin\"&gt;Twigin&lt;/a&gt; to the apex of the necropolis, plugged a keystone into the &lt;a href=\"Runic%20Keyhole\"&gt;Runic Keyhole&lt;/a&gt;, and killed Vo'treus the Keyguard, allowing the Eyes to take control of the vessel. The Constructs tried to bring down the structure before the hijackers could escape, but the Zerekriss shrugged off their attack and the Eyes steered the vessel away from the House of Constructs to have it instead patrol around Maldraxxus. Inside a &lt;a href=\"Foreman%27s%20Chest\"&gt;Foreman's Chest&lt;/a&gt; aboard the necropolis, the Maw Walkers discovered the lost &lt;a href=\"%3ABindings%20of%20Fleshcrafting\"&gt;:Bindings of Fleshcrafting&lt;/a&gt; and returned to the Seat of the Primus to restore the bindings to the Primus' statue as well as work with Khaliiq to establish a permanent portal connection between the Seat and the Zerekriss. As a fully mobile necropolis, the Zerekriss provided the forces at the Seat with an aerial advantage over all the houses of Maldraxxus.\nThe Necrolords later joined forces with the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; to launch an attack on the Constructs and their ruler, &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Gharmal\"&gt;Margrave Gharmal&lt;/a&gt;. The Zerekriss was moved back to the Construct stronghold to begin an aerial assault alongside the winged kyrian, with Necrolord and kyrian Maw Walkers being tasked with leading the two covenants' ground forces. Gharmal's &lt;a href=\"deathroc\"&gt;deathroc&lt;/a&gt;s in the skies above the stronghold prevented the Zerekriss from getting into position, so &lt;a href=\"Emeni\"&gt;Emeni&lt;/a&gt; asked the heroes to clear out the birds. When the Zerekriss was almost in position, &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; worked with the Maw Walkers to destroy Gharmal's &lt;a href=\"Bilebloat%20Juggernaut\"&gt;juggernauts&lt;/a&gt; and thereby lure the margrave into the open. &lt;a href=\"Xandria\"&gt;Xandria&lt;/a&gt;, Alexandros, and the Maw Walkers then taunted Gharmal into facing them in combat, buying enough time for &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt; to focus the Zerekriss' weaponry and fire a massive bolt of necrotic energy that killed the margrave. With the assault over, the Zerekriss returned to its patrol above Maldraxxus.\nLocations.\nOssein Foundry.\nThe Zerekriss is initially found floating in a stationary position above the &lt;a href=\"Ossein%20Foundry\"&gt;Ossein Foundry&lt;/a&gt; in western Maldraxxus. This version of the necropolis phases out for &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolord&lt;/a&gt; players who complete &lt;a href=\"This%20Way%20Out\"&gt;This Way Out&lt;/a&gt;, but it remains permanently visible to members of other covenants. Non-Necrolords can therefore see two copies of the Zerekriss\u2014one stationary and one moving\u2014existing in Maldraxxus simultaneously.\nPatrolling.\nAfter being captured by the Necrolords, the Zerekriss slowly patrols in a wide, anticlockwise loop above Maldraxxus. One circuit around the zone takes approximately 16 minutes and 45 seconds to complete. This version automatically appears to non-Necrolord players after they join a covenant, and to Necrolord players after they complete the quest &lt;a href=\"This%20Way%20Out\"&gt;This Way Out&lt;/a&gt;. The Necrolord sanctum upgrade &lt;a href=\"A%20Keep%20Above\"&gt;A Keep Above&lt;/a&gt; unlocks a permanent portal connection between the patrolling Zerekriss and the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can travel between the two floors of the necropolis' main chamber using Translocation Spheres, of which there are two on the lower floor and one on the upper floor. They can interact with &lt;a href=\"Twigin\"&gt;Twigin&lt;/a&gt; on the lower floor to leap out of the necropolis' mouth and have him slowly glide them down to the ground, with the option to dive to a target location once they're close enough to the surface. Alternatively, they can exit through the mouth on their own by using a &lt;a href=\"Slow%20Fall\"&gt;Slow Fall&lt;/a&gt; effect from the upper floor. Exiting is a one-way trip down: the only way to get back inside after leaving is to take the portal from the Seat again.\nStanding aboard the Zerekriss in its moving phase counts as being aboard a transport; trying to enter an instance while inside it will produce the error message \"You can't do that while on a vehicle or transport\".\nHouse of Constructs.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Kyrian%20Campaign%23Righteous%20Retribution\"&gt;Righteous Retribution&lt;/a&gt; chapter of the &lt;a href=\"%3AKyrian%20Campaign\"&gt;:Kyrian Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Campaign%23A%20Golden%20Dawn\"&gt;A Golden Dawn&lt;/a&gt; chapter of the &lt;a href=\"%3ANecrolords%20Campaign\"&gt;:Necrolords Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, the necropolis temporarily becomes stationary again and floats above the eastern entrance to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;House of Constructs&lt;/a&gt; until the player completes the chapter."}

A race of mechanical caretakers called the &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; were left behind by the First Ones to facilitate this process.

The water in Zereth Mortis can be walked on, creating a threshold between it and another, even more primordial space below it. Aside from the automa, the realm is home to a &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; faction called the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt;, who seek to protect the First Ones' secrets.

The quests take place almost exclusively in the new zone of &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnlocking the campaign.\nTo unlock this campaign, characters must have finished the first three chapters of the &lt;a href=\"Chains%20of%20Domination%20campaign\"&gt;Chains of Domination campaign&lt;/a&gt;, ending with &lt;a href=\"Good%20News%2C%20Everyone%21\"&gt;Good News, Everyone!&lt;/a&gt;. Once that is done, &lt;a href=\"Call%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Call of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; will be offered automatically as soon as players log in after &lt;a href=\"patch%209.2\"&gt;patch 9.2&lt;/a&gt; goes live.\nThe main campaign chapters were initially time-gated after the release of the patch, with chapters 1-3 being available at launch and with one additional chapter unlocking each subsequent week. Since then, all of the chapters can be played through from start to finish without interruptions or additional requirements.\nMain campaign: Secrets of the First Ones.\nThe primary campaign is eight chapters long and covers the heroes' arrival to &lt;a href=\"Zereth%20Mortis\"&gt;Zereth Mortis&lt;/a&gt;, their search for a way to follow &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt; and defeat him, the creation of a new &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; to restore balance to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;realms of Death&lt;/a&gt; as a whole, and finally the ultimate fate of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nInto the Unknown.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Primus\"&gt;Primus&lt;/a&gt; summons the Maw Walker to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;, where the &lt;a href=\"attendant\"&gt;attendant&lt;/a&gt;s create a new &lt;a href=\"sigil\"&gt;sigil&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20%28title%29\"&gt;Arbiter&lt;/a&gt; and open a portal to Zereth Mortis to pursue the Jailer. &lt;a href=\"Pelagos\"&gt;Pelagos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"kyrian\"&gt;kyrian&lt;/a&gt; volunteers to accompany the Maw Walker. However, a &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; attack disables the portal and leaves the Maw Walker and Pelagos stranded in Zereth Mortis. In exchange for helping him obtain a strange &lt;a href=\"automa\"&gt;automa&lt;/a&gt; core, the &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Firim\"&gt;Firim&lt;/a&gt; leads the two to the &lt;a href=\"Enlightened\"&gt;Enlightened&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Haven\"&gt;Haven&lt;/a&gt;. After the Maw Walker earns the brokers' trust by defending them from the Mawsworn, &lt;a href=\"Elder%20Ara\"&gt;Elder Ara&lt;/a&gt; helps open an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Waystone\"&gt;Ancient Waystone&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a permanent connection between Zereth Mortis and Oribos and allowing the Maw Walker's allies to join them.\nWe Battle Onward.\n&lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt; sends the Maw Walker, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; to find out what the Mawsworn are up to near the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Afterlives\"&gt;Forge of Afterlives&lt;/a&gt;. They discover that the Jailer is converting automa with &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt; magic to weaken the Forge's defenses and that the covenant forces have been infiltrated by &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;. In a duel with &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine&lt;/a&gt;, and the Maw Walker learn that the Jailer and Anduin are headed for the Forge. They arrive too late to stop the Jailer from using the Forge to enter the Sepulcher of the First Ones, taking Anduin with him.\nForming an Understanding.\nPelagos and the Maw Walker head to the &lt;a href=\"Genesis%20Fields\"&gt;Genesis Fields&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the other major threat to Zereth Mortis, the &lt;a href=\"devourer\"&gt;devourer&lt;/a&gt;s. They hear &lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;an automa oracle&lt;/a&gt;'s call for help, but they arrive too late and she falls unconscious. The Enlightened refuse to help, so Pelagos and the Maw Walker bring the oracle to Firim in &lt;a href=\"Exile%27s%20Hollow\"&gt;Exile's Hollow&lt;/a&gt;. The automa core from earlier reacts to the oracle and turns into &lt;a href=\"Pocopoc\"&gt;Pocopoc&lt;/a&gt;, a tiny automa who bonds with the Maw Walker, granting them the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Pocopoc\"&gt;Summon Pocopoc&lt;/a&gt; ability and access to the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Cypher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, completing this chapter gives players access to Zereth Mortis' world quests and daily quests.\nForging a New Path.\n&lt;a href=\"Uther%20the%20Lightbringer\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt; shows up in Haven with the news that Sylvanas has awakened back in Oribos. Bolvar is more concerned with finding a way into the Sepulcher. Elder Ara lends her help by taking the Maw Walker on a pilgrimage: first to &lt;a href=\"Provis%20Esper\"&gt;Provis Esper&lt;/a&gt; to find some First One artifacts, then to &lt;a href=\"Pilgrim%27s%20Grace\"&gt;Pilgrim's Grace&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about them, the &lt;a href=\"Catalyst%20Gardens\"&gt;Catalyst Gardens&lt;/a&gt; to repair them (and deal with haywire automa), and finally back to Pilgrim's Grace to use them to activate the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Translocator\"&gt;Ancient Translocator&lt;/a&gt; between the Sepulcher and the mainland, giving players access to the physical raid entrance. Uther convinces the others to accept Sylvanas' help in saving Anduin from the Jailer, and they head into the Sepulcher to do so.\nCrown of Wills.\nThis chapter takes place after the first eight boss encounters of the Sepulcher, but does not require any raid progress to access.\nThe heroes bring Anduin to Haven in the hopes that he knows how to counter the Jailer's Domination magic, but he has no answers to give. The automa seem to be more resistant to Domination, however, so the Maw Walker is sent to experiment with the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; and finds out that the automa's resistance stems from the &lt;a href=\"Cypher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;language of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. The Maw Walker, Bolvar, and &lt;a href=\"Taelia%20Fordragon\"&gt;Taelia&lt;/a&gt; head to the &lt;a href=\"Endless%20Sands\"&gt;Endless Sands&lt;/a&gt; to collect First One phrases, after which those who've suffered from Domination in the past meet up in &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt; to uncover their memories of what helped them defy it. The Primus gathers the group in the &lt;a href=\"Runecarver%27s%20Oubliette\"&gt;Runecarver's Oubliette&lt;/a&gt; and uses the cyphers and memories to reforge the helm into the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Crown of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, giving the Maw Walker and their allies a way to resist the Jailer's power.\nA Means to an End.\nPelagos comes to Haven to report that something is happening with the oracle\u2014&lt;a href=\"Saezurah\"&gt;Saezurah&lt;/a&gt;\u2014in Exile's Hollow. Saezurah speaks through Pocopoc and guides the Maw Walker on a lengthy trip to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Resonant%20Peaks\"&gt;Resonant Peaks&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve the empty &lt;a href=\"Vessel\"&gt;Vessel&lt;/a&gt; of an &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20One\"&gt;Eternal One&lt;/a&gt;. Back in Exile's Hollow, Saezurah awakens and reveals that\u2014once her preparations are complete\u2014the Vessel will be used to create a new Arbiter to replace the one that the Jailer destroyed.\nStarting Over.\nThe Maw Walker is summoned to Exile's Hollow: it's time to make a new Arbiter, using a soul in the &lt;a href=\"Crypts%20of%20the%20Eternal\"&gt;Crypts of the Eternal&lt;/a&gt;. The Crypts are guarded by Mawsworn, so the Maw Walker and Pelagos put together an army of covenant forces to get inside. The ritual begins, but a nathrezim ruins everything by summoning the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Argus\"&gt;Echo of Argus&lt;/a&gt;. All seems lost until Pelagos decides to offer his own soul as a replacement, and Saezurah transforms him into the new Arbiter. He takes his place in Oribos to allow souls to once again be sent to their rightful afterlives, and only one task is left before balance is restored to the Shadowlands: defeating the Jailer in the Sepulcher.\nEpilogue: Judgment.\nThe final chapter is optional in that it is not required to earn &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Secrets of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;. It takes place after the events of the last three boss encounters of the Sepulcher, but as with the \"Crown of Wills\" chapter, no raid progress is required.\nFollowing the defeat of the Jailer and the saving of the Shadowlands, Sylvanas is escorted to Oribos to be judged by the Arbiter for her past crimes. She hands herself over to her archenemy &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who declares that she'll begin her penance by freeing all of the souls trapped in the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and sending them to Pelagos for judgment. Sylvanas accepts this and disappears into the Maw to get to work, closing off this last part of the Shadowlands storyline.\nSide quests.\nThere are several quest chains in Zereth Mortis. Some of them are needed for &lt;a href=\"Path%20to%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Path to Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nNot Al Are Lost.\nIn this quest chain, the player once again teams up with &lt;a href=\"Al%27dalil\"&gt;Al'dalil&lt;/a&gt;, as he learns what happened to &lt;a href=\"Cartel%20Al\"&gt;Cartel Al&lt;/a&gt; expedition.\nSmall Pet Problems.\nIt seems no place can escape pet collectors, and Zereth Mortis is no exception.\nA Return to Grace.\nThe wellspring next to Pilgrim's Grace has gone dry - and the designs of the First Ones were supposed to be infallible. Something has definitely gone wrong.\nThe Patient Buffonid.\nThis bufonid sure takes his time to go above... This questline requires several days to complete, so treat it like a daily quest.\nJiro to Hero.\nJiro rarely become violent. But desperate times call for desperate measures.\nIn order to be eligible for this questline, the player needs to have researched Altonian Understanding so that they can communicate with the Jiro.\nCompleting this questline allows the player to obtain the &lt;a href=\"Resonating%20Disc\"&gt;Resonating Disc&lt;/a&gt;, which unlocks Cipher weapon drops.\nThe Final Song.\nA small find turns out to lead to something big. Completion of this questline is necessary to unlock the mount creation of &lt;a href=\"Protoform%20Synthesis\"&gt;Protoform Synthesis&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to be eligible for this questline, the player needs to have unlocked the Protoform Synthesis in the first place by researching Dealic Understanding and completing &lt;a href=\"Protoform%20Synthesis%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Protoform Synthesis (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, and then researching Sopranian Understanding.\nReap What You Sow.\nWhile questing in Zereth Mortis, players might have come by the overgrown foundry in the south-eastern part of it. This questline answers what is the deal with it.\nIn order to be eligible for this questline, the player needs to research Sopranian Understanding."}

The word is derived from the &lt;a href=\"Zergling\"&gt;Zergling&lt;/a&gt; rush (sometimes shortened to Zerg rush) strategy in \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\". Zerg is also the name of the race in \"Starcraft\".\nFor example, \"Could you remember to spread &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;, because the &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; keeps getting zerged when he heals you?\"\nNormally, based on the Zergling rush origins, the term application would be to sudden, speedy, surprise assaults to key elements (&lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s, flags, etc) by whatever sources are closest, likely few in number (at least initially) but has somehow reached a basic meaning of \"big group winning\" or \"overpowering group\" outside \"StarCraft\", possibly from the initial attack group swarms in &lt;a href=\"WSG\"&gt;WSG&lt;/a&gt; openings. \nFor example, the original definition would parallel snatching a recently deserted flag in Arathi Basin, even by a solo player, while the current use would go along any big group formed to overpower a defended flag.\nBlizzard, owning both the \"Warcraft\" and \"StarCraft\" names, has broken the fourth wall on some subtle occasions. In WoW, a zergling was a special edition non-combat pet, and an image of Infested Kerrigan is visible on Goblin Shredders.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\", two of the Zerg race units from \"StarCraft\", the Zergling and the Hydralisk, were modeled in the game data. A Hydralisk was tucked into a corner of the map in one of the night elf missions, and both models appeared in a bonus ending to the credits after beating the \"Reign of Chaos\" on \"Hard\" difficulty. Editors could insert the creatures into custom maps through the World Editor."}

All members in a zero-sum DKP start with a score of 0. When an item is given to a &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt; member, they have to pay for it in DKP (going negative if necessary). These DKP spent are immediately distributed among all the raid members. Thus the amount of DKP, i.e. the sum of all members in the system, is always zero. The idea here is that inflation is impossible, since no points enter the system from the outside.\nAlthough \"zero-sum\" describes only a method of earning DKP, and it would in theory be perfectly possible to combine this income method with &lt;a href=\"bidding%20systems\"&gt;bidding&lt;/a&gt; for finding the item prices, nearly no raids actually do that. Instead, about every real-live zero sum system uses &lt;a href=\"fixed%20price\"&gt;fixed price&lt;/a&gt;s, thus the terms \"zero sum\" and \"zero sum, fixed price\" have nearly become synonyms.\nCriticisms.\nIn its pure form, zero-sum has the disadvantage that learning new content is not rewarded. There can be no bonuses for anything - punctuality, killing bosses etc.\nA much bigger problem with zero-sum systems is that they don't actually do their job properly. Zero-sum was invented to fight Inflation, but the underlying problem is not solved by Zero-sum. The deeper problem with Inflation is that it's impossible for new raid members to ever compete for a top-of-the-line drop. In non-zero sum systems the effect is very obvious, if an average run yields 40 DKP, and the top 10 members each have 1000 DKP or more, it's a rather simple matter for a newbie to figure out when he will get his first highend item (maybe after 1 year).\nIn zero-sum systems, the very same deeper problem exists too. The fact that no points enter the system from the outside doesn't prevent veterans from building a large point lead over new members. The system maintains its advertised properties as long as the group is homogenous. If the whole raid starts out with similar levels of equipment, and everybody does the same number of runs, players will stay close together. But if there are differences (and there always are), if for example some run members have filled some equipment slots with &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; items or drops from &lt;a href=\"heroic\"&gt;heroic&lt;/a&gt;s, these members will earn more DKP than they spend. If newbies with sub-par equipment enter the system, they will feed DKP to the well-equipped raid members, see &lt;a href=\"Loot%20system%23The%20DKP%20Gap\"&gt;The DKP Gap&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn summary, the obvious brick wall which every new member can clearly see in the standard systems is replaced by a glass wall, which in the long term has the very same effect, but more subtle and not so obvious.\nThe frequently raised concern that new players enter the system at 0 points, right in the middle of the veteran players, and thus can take drops away from veterans, is usually a non-issue. After a few runs, newbies will regularly find themselfes at the very end of the ladder, because they will get quite a lot of drops which the veteran run members just don't need any more. Most raids actually formalize this dynamic by introducing a rule that newcomers may only get uncontested drops on their first few runs.\nPoint Bank.\nOne method to remedy the problem that no bonuses are possible is to introduce the bank as a member in the system. If the bank takes part in every raid (as 11., 21., 26. or 41. member), a pool of DKP will be available which can be handed out as rewards. This same pool can also be used to \"buy\" all BOE loot from the raid. If the income of the bank is too low, it's possible to give the bank more than one share.\nTaxes.\nA good solution to the DKP gap are taxes, in zero-sum as in any other loot system. Of course nobody likes taxes, but in zero-sum they have the nice effect to be sometimes negative (i.e. increase players point score).\nRelational DKP.\n&lt;a href=\"Relational%20DKP\"&gt;Relational DKP&lt;/a&gt; systems are a more radical alternative. They allow more flexibility on gaining points, while still being fair to newbies and veterans.\nRewarding raid time.\nAs criticised above, Zero-sum systems normally reward only presence at the moment of loot distribution. Beyond the bank solution, there is a more sophisticated system to reward the total time spent raiding, and even to weigh instances differently. To do this, the DKP spent are not immediately awarded to the raid members, but instead held back until the end of the raiding week. At the end of the week, all spent DKP are distributed to the raid members based on the weighted amount of time they spent. An example:\nAssume a raiding week is spent as follows:\n Wednesday: SSC: 4 hours, 25 ppl. Hydross and Lurker down. 4 drops, 80DKP spent\n Thursday: SSC: 4 hours, 25 ppl. No bosskill, 1 random drop for 10DKP\n Sunday: Gruul &amp; Magtheridon, 3 hours, 25 ppl, 8 drops, 1 disenchant for 140 DKP\n Monday: TK: 4 hours, 25 ppl. Voidreaver down, 3 drops, 60 DKP\n Tuesday: SSC: 3 hours, 25 ppl, no drops\nEach evening, the run is fully added to the database, all items are assigned to players and spent DKP are subtracted immediately as well. Only DKP earned will remain at 0 until the end of the week. After the week is over (on Tuesday night), first the total DKP spent is calculated:\n Total DKP: 80 + 10 + 140 + 60 + 0 = 290 DKP\nAssume that the Thursday, Monday and Tuesday runs were labeled as progress runs, so their hours get a factor of 1.5 as bonus. Then the weighted number of hours spent is calculated:\n (4*1)+(4*1.5)+(3*1)+(4*1.5)+(3*1.5)=23.5 weighted hours\nSo each hour of raiding is worth the following amount per raid member:\n 290/23.5 = 12.34\nThus the individual run members will receive (standard zero-sum reward in brackets):\n SSC(Wednesday ): 12.34 / 25 * 4 = 1.97 (3.2)\n SSC(Thursday): 12.34 / 25 * 4 * 1.5 = 2.96 (0.4)\n Gruul/Magth(Sunday): 12.34 / 25 * 3 = 1.48 (5.6)\n TK(Monday): 12.34 /25 * 4 * 1.5 = 2.96 (2.4)\n SSC(Tuesday): 12.34 / 25 * 3 * 1.5 = 2.22 (0)\nFor control, multiply the DKP handed out per player with the number of players in the runs and compare the sum to total DKP:\n 1.97*25+2.96*25 +1.48*25+2.96*25+2.22*25 = 289.75, which is close enough to the total amount of DKP spent (290), thus correct\nComparing the points earned in this system with the rewards from zero sum, it can be clearly seen that progress (wipe) runs have become much more interesting, while farm runs were demoted. Even if no weight was used, farm runs just have the same value per hour as wipe runs. With the introduction of the weight, guild masters and run leaders have a very finely scalable instrument to make runs more or less rewarding.\nThere are two known drawbacks to this system. The first is that points are not handed out immediately. If two players competing for the same drop are very close to each other, so that one run could make a difference on who gets the item, a system which is updated daily will produce different results from this one. Whether this effect is really a problem can be discussed, because it affects everybody equally.\nThe second drawback is that when rewards is solely based on attendance time, a run with a lot of interruptions and afk time will be rewarded just like a raid with many corpse runs. This can be taken into account by a weight - if the run leader feels that there was a lot of idle time, a factor smaller than one could be used as weight for that run."}

Be sure to prevent your units from running into a Blizzard after your enemy steps out of it. Whenever possible aim Blizzard on low hit point units such as ranged units and spellcasters. Try to move the enemy into areas where their retreat is cut off so you can Blizzard them. Cast Blizzard on any enemy units that can't run away. If you see that you are casting Blizzard on friendly troops immediately cancel it.\nBlizzard does 50% damage to buildings. Blizzard is not that effective against buildings but it can work.\nBlizzard will not hurt units with Spell Immunity or protection.\nThis spell must be maintained to get the full effect. If the Archmage moves, the spell will not do its full damage. The ice shards will stack their effects on the area of effect. Force the Archmage to move from his location. This will stop the Blizzard.\nSummon Water Elemental.\nWater Elementals become larger and darker as the spell potency is increased.\nFor solo gameplay or 2 vs. 2s, a common strategy is Archmage and Water Elementals to start out with. This works very well with &lt;a href=\"%23Brilliance%20Aura\"&gt;Brilliance&lt;/a&gt;. Try to have enemy Creeps focus on the elemental, although this should not be done if the creep camp contains units capable of using Purge.\nIf dispellers are available use them to kill the Water Elemental, such as &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryad&lt;/a&gt;s.\nBrilliance Aura (Passive).\nThis aura does increase the Mana Regeneration of the Archmage, so it is useful even when the Archmage doesn't have a lot of other spell casters under his command. This aura is especially useful in allied games because the Archmage can help regenerate mana of other heroes and spell casters.\nMass Teleport (Ultimate).\nThis spell is useful because, unlike &lt;a href=\"Scroll%20of%20Town%20Portal%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Town Portal Scrolls&lt;/a&gt;, you can teleport to any location where there is a friendly ground unit or structure. Town Portal Scrolls can only teleport you to a friendly town hall. The cooldown is fairly short, so the Archmage can teleport to a location, engage in battle, then quickly teleport to the next location.\nMass Teleport is very powerful. It can allow you to teleport all around the map responding to enemy attacks and offensively attacking the enemy. It is especially useful in FFA games and large team games. If an enemy is attacking an allied base, a player can use a teleport scroll to head there. If the enemy attack isn't strong enough and can be easily repelled, then the player can easily return to the battlefield with Mass Teleport.\nNote that the target the Archmage is focused on will be disabled for the duration of the teleport. Try not to use it on a summoned unit or a Hero, as if the former dies too fast, the teleport is cancelled, and using it on the latter will turn them into sitting ducks.\nYou can use Mass Teleport to go anywhere, and invisible units can be targeted to allow for surprise attacks. It does not work on wards for balancing reasons.\nLike the Staff of Teleportation offered by &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Merchant\"&gt;Goblin Merchant&lt;/a&gt;s, casting Mass Teleport does not make the Archmage invulnerable. As it is a channeled spell, forcing the Archmage to move or killing him will prevent him and his units from teleporting away to safety.\nAlternatively if the Archmage is attempting to teleport an army to a location, killing the unit or destroying the building the Archmage is focused on will stop the teleport. This can be risky as there is a very small gap before the Archmage arrives with any units under his command, but can stop reinforcements from arriving if it is pulled off.\nSpeculation.\nHe is presumably an independent wizard drawn to the &lt;a href=\"Magistrates%20Temple\"&gt;Magistrates Temple&lt;/a&gt; and not a member of &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore's&lt;/a&gt; forces. Zerx does not have the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiran&lt;/a&gt; dark green color and will attack the nearby soldiers in &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Thornby\"&gt;Captain Thornby&lt;/a&gt;'s camp if they get too close."}

Over the years he used his victims' energies (gained from his sacrificial rituals) to whip the water elemental, &lt;a href=\"Hydrospawn\"&gt;Hydrospawn&lt;/a&gt;, into unbridled fury, little by little bending its will to his command.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Desperate to show his worth to the Burning Legion, Zevrim Thornhoof told his masters he could enslave the formidable ancients who still roamed Dire Maul. When his own power proved insufficient, Thornhoof turned to other living creatures for additional energy, butchering them atop his sacrificial altar and harvesting their essence in their final, agonizing moments.\"\nDirections.\nAs some people might like to kill him for certain loot (such as the &lt;a href=\"Clever%20Hat\"&gt;Clever Hat&lt;/a&gt;, which is nice for &lt;a href=\"RP\"&gt;RP&lt;/a&gt;), here are detailed instructions on how to find him easily and with minimal fuss:\nEnter Dire Maul East either through the main entrance (A) or the side entrance (B). Follow the path to the northeast corner (1). Turn right into the entrance of a passageway. Turn right again at the fork in the passageway (1B). Head south through the room, towards the southeast corner. Take the circular ramp (2) downwards. Head north through the room, towards the northeast corner. Take the ramp (3) upwards. Zevrim will be on the platform you exit the ramp onto, on your left."}

To aid her, Zhahara enlisted the help of &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rumblefitz\"&gt;Rumblefitz&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nZhahara's superior, a &lt;a href=\"sea%20witch\"&gt;sea witch&lt;/a&gt; who looks like (though is not stated to be) &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Naz%27jar\"&gt;Lady Naz'jar&lt;/a&gt;, ordered her to find the continent of Pandaria, believing it holds the future of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Zhahara believed that Pandaria was destroyed in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;, and against her orders turned to look for the Wandering Isle instead. She also learned of an item called the &lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria%20%28item%29\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and found it in the possession of a &lt;a href=\"murloc\"&gt;murloc&lt;/a&gt;. The murloc was accidentally captured by the pandaren fisherman &lt;a href=\"Wanyo\"&gt;Wanyo&lt;/a&gt;, and he took the pearl from it. Zhahara attacked him, but Wanyo escaped with the help of a giant fish. Zhahara never found Wanyo again, but was convinced that other pandaren would certainly know where he and the pearl could be found.\nPearl of Pandaria.\nZhahara is first seen overlooking the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Blokk\"&gt;Blokk&lt;/a&gt;, an ogre she had hired to help find the pearl, had ran all the way from &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; to inform her that they had found a pair of pandaren and the goblin &lt;a href=\"Rumblefitz\"&gt;Rumblefitz&lt;/a&gt; was following them. Using magic, she spoke with &lt;a href=\"Rahjak\"&gt;Rahjak&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of the portal and summoned a storm to distract the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces while the fel orc Blademaster came through. Zhahara and Blokk watched as Rahjak slaughtered all the defenders at the portal.\nZhahara next appeared after Rahjak kidnapped one of the pandaren they had been tracking, &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;. Li Li was brought to an island where Zhahara was working from, and the naga demanded the location of Wanyo from her. However, Li Li denied knowing anything about Wanyo since he vanished from the Wandering Isle years ago. Zhahara threatened to drown all of the Wandering Isle if Li Li did not talk, and then had her chained up with Blokk watching her.\nZhahara spoke again to her superiors, saying she had almost found the Wandering Isle, but the sea witch reminded her that her mission was Pandaria, not the island. Zhahara was given an ultimatum: return with information on Pandaria's whereabouts, or don't return at all.\nLi Li broke free of her chains and attempted to save &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; from dying to Rahjak, but Zhahara grabbed the young girl and threatened her to reveal Wanyo's location. Li Li still didn't know anything, so Zhahara decided they would watch Bo die together. At that moment, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the island on a rocket mount and saved Bo from Rahjak. Li Li smashed a potion in Zhahara's eyes, stunning her and giving Chen enough time to throw Rahjak's sword, piercing Zhahara right through the torso.\nRelatives.\nShe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Morgala%20Darksquall\"&gt;Morgala Darksquall&lt;/a&gt;."}

Zhi had witnessed the legions of mogu storming the vale in force. As he knew his people were not trained for mass combat, he traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20the%20White%20Tiger\"&gt;Temple of the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; to issue a petition to &lt;a href=\"Xuen\"&gt;Xuen the White Tiger&lt;/a&gt; to open the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20the%20August%20Celestials\"&gt;gate&lt;/a&gt; of the vale and enlist the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Though &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt; as the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Shado-pan\"&gt;Shado-pan&lt;/a&gt; was strongly against the idea, with the help of Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, Sunwalker &lt;a href=\"Dezco\"&gt;Dezco&lt;/a&gt; and brave &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, Xuen was persuaded to open the gate.\nZhi and the other Golden Lotus caretakers gathered the refugees and several members of the Horde and the Alliance at the Gate of the August Celestials in time for the entrance to the vale to finally be opened. Zhi let the refugees set their camp in &lt;a href=\"Mistfall%20Village\"&gt;Mistfall Village&lt;/a&gt; and organized the Golden Lotus' campaign against the mogu from the &lt;a href=\"Golden%20Pagoda\"&gt;Golden Pagoda&lt;/a&gt;.\nBleeding Sun.\nZhi and a handful of Golden Lotus members, including &lt;a href=\"Mokimo%20the%20Strong\"&gt;Mokimo the Strong&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Weng%20the%20Merciful\"&gt;Weng the Merciful&lt;/a&gt;, visited the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Two%20Moons\"&gt;Shrine of Two Moons&lt;/a&gt; to seek a new guardian among the children there. They performed a \"simple test\" involving the use of a special gong to find the child. After Zhi rang the gong, the avatar of &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji the Red Crane&lt;/a&gt; appeared and located Dezco's twin sons. Chi-Ji said that he had not foreseen twins, and that only one child would need to serve the vale. Zhi was shocked to find the new member to be a child of the outsiders.\nThough Zhi gave Dezco time to decide which son would join the order, the sunwalker decided instead to leave the vale with both of his sons, to prevent them from being taken away from him. Learning of this, Zhi sent Mokimo, Weng and &lt;a href=\"Rook\"&gt;Rook&lt;/a&gt; to inform Dezco that the Golden Lotus would respect the sunwalker's decision, and protect him and his sons until they were safely out of the vale. Dezco however suspected this was Zhi's oblique way of asking him to stay in the vale with his children. That night, the group was ambushed by &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, and Dezco paid the price for his decision: the death of his son, &lt;a href=\"Cloudhoof\"&gt;Cloudhoof&lt;/a&gt;. However, amazed by the order's love and concern for his children, and stirred by Mokimo's speech of home, Dezco realized at last the true meaning of &lt;a href=\"Leza\"&gt;his wife's&lt;/a&gt; visions concerning the vale, and gave his remaining son &lt;a href=\"Redhorn\"&gt;Redhorn&lt;/a&gt; to Mokimo, saying goodbye to his only child and his last connection to his wife, in the knowledge that this was in fact the true reason for his tribe's journey to the vale. Mokimo told Dezco that Redhorn would be officially accepted into the order with a ceremony where Zhi would present him before Chi-Ji for anointment.\nDeath.\nAs the war against the mogu continued, Zhi had instructed his fellow caretakers to retrieve the artifacts of the Thunder King: the &lt;a href=\"%3ABattle%20Axe%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;:Battle Axe of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"%3ABattle%20Spear%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;:Battle Spear of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"%3ABattle%20Helm%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;:Battle Helm of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;. He intended to hide them away from the mogu so that the newly-resurrected Thunder King would not be able to wield them as he had in life. With the help of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, the quest for these artifacts was a success. He secured and moved all of them to the &lt;a href=\"Silent%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Silent Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, a secret mogu crypt where he believed they could be kept safe from the mogu's grasp.\nHowever, Zhi was wrong. Though he guarded the artifacts with his life, he could not stop the mogu from penetrating the Golden Lotus's defenses and taking them to the Thunder King. He and several Golden Lotus guardians were brutally killed.\nNotes.\nZhi is still present and participates in the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Celestial%20Experience\"&gt;A Celestial Experience&lt;/a&gt; after patch 5.4.0, even though his quest lines from before then establish that he was killed before then. He, and several of the Golden Lotus quest givers that died later on when the Vale was damaged by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, are also present for &lt;a href=\"A%20Witness%20to%20History\"&gt;A Witness to History&lt;/a&gt;."}

Prior to his arrival, the area now called the Zhu Province was an untamed land still considered part of the &lt;a href=\"Krasarang%20Wilds\"&gt;Krasarang Wilds&lt;/a&gt;. The journey through the area was perilous, and many pandaren lost their lives to the great beasts of the forest while attempting to reach the coast. Tired of the needless loss of life, Zhu, along with his wife &lt;a href=\"Rin%20Longbrow\"&gt;Rin&lt;/a&gt; and their son &lt;a href=\"Po%20Longbrow\"&gt;Po&lt;/a&gt; - both formidable hunters in their own right - carved out and settled a corner of the wilds. Zhu did not want to settle the wilds entirely, though many begged him to do so. In his wisdom, he understood that they, too, served a purpose: protecting the great crane, &lt;a href=\"Chi-Ji\"&gt;Chi-Ji&lt;/a&gt;. He warned against the dangers of trying to conquer the wilds, and asked only that the pandaren contain them. Thus, the Zhu Province and Zhu's Watch were born.\nEver since, the descendants of the Longbrow line have protected the province. &lt;a href=\"Yi-Mo%20Longbrow\"&gt;Yi-Mo Longbrow&lt;/a&gt; is the last descendant of Zhu's line.

One morning, less than a fortnight before the ceremony, Zidormi visited Chronormu in his &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20roost\"&gt;roost&lt;/a&gt; above the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt; to ask what form he'd be choosing and was shocked to learn that he'd still not decided. He tried to ask her what she would do in the same situation, to which she replied that she could not choose for him and that her own Visage Day was still several seasons away. Chronormu complained that decisions always came much more easily to Zidormi and that she surely already knew what duties she'd request and what places she would go to. Zidormi comforted her friend and advised him to seek the counsel of their master &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater, after Nozdormu had advised Chronormu to learn how other dragons had decided on their mortal forms, Zidormi arranged for a meeting between Chronormu and another one of her friends, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"blue%20dragonflight\"&gt;blue dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.

Over time, they rigorously studied the fount's arcane energies, becoming learned sorcerers. They harnessed the powers of the arcane lake and constructed wondrous temples and roadways around it. Magic became an inseparable part of life as the night elves reveled in the power at their fingertips. Pushing the boundaries of their intellect became the driving force of their culture.\nIt was during this era of unprecedented growth that the kaldorei's most prolific leader came to power, &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. Through her unbridled ambition, she elevated her people to new heights. She indulged in sorcerous pursuits and constructed a breathtaking, bejeweled palace on the shores of the Well of Eternity. The elves were so enamored with their queen that they renamed their wondrous capital Zin-Azshari, or \"the Glory of Azshara\", in her honor.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; gifted to its sister city Zin-Azshari the &lt;a href=\"Javelins%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Javelins of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, the most powerful weapons of the city, which could pierce any barrier, even one made by Queen Azshara herself. \nWar of the Ancients.\nZin-Azshari acted as the largest city of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;largest empire&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s history. As the nation's borders expanded in all directions, Azshara herself eventually turned inward. Her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, overseen by the high councilor &lt;a href=\"Xavius\"&gt;Xavius&lt;/a&gt;, began to further investigate the Well itself, with the aim of unlocking all its secrets.\nThis brought the elves in direct contact with the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself. He offered Azshara what she wanted, a purified world, cleansed of the lesser races, for her to rebuild as perfection. Enthralled by the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt; lord's power and promises, they worked to usher forth the Burning Legion into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and managed to open a large &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;gateway&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;royal palace&lt;/a&gt; of Zin-Azshari. Once the demonic forces amassed, Azshara released them from the palace, and they began slaughtering the gathered kaldorei citizens outside the walls. The rest of the city was turned into a ruin, except for the Highborne's quarters. This marked the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, during which the Highborne would continue to try to enlarge the portal to bring Sargeras himself through to Azeroth.\nLater in the conflict, &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and a group of Highborne seeking to defect from Queen Azshara freed the captured &lt;a href=\"priestess\"&gt;priestess&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, and escaped the city. Many of them were picked off by the demons, but Dath'Remar, Tyrande and a small number of Highborne made it through to the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;.\nBy the end of the conflict, the rebel armies managed to push through the Legion's forces and near enough to the capital city. A force consisting of the &lt;a href=\"Red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as important heroes such as &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, assaulted Zin-Azshari and the Well of Eternity by air. They met fierce resistance from the &lt;a href=\"shadowbat\"&gt;shadowbat&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt;s, but they managed to destabilize the portal. It collapsed atop Sargeras himself, who was crossing the gateway between the two realms, and sucked back all the demons that had come through back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, marking the end of the invasion.\nThis however also pushed the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; past breaking point, which crumbled upon itself. The resulting explosion ripped the continent of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; apart, in an event known as the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. Zin-Azshari, caught in the center of the blast, was sunk beneath the waves of the newly-formed &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nAzshara and her Highborne, drowning in the waters, were saved by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for their service, and turned into the serpentine &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;. At the bottom of the Maelstrom, the naga built for themselves a new city, &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, from which they would rebuild their power. It would take over ten thousand years before the naga would reveal their existence to the surface world.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n10,000 years later, the ruins of Zin-Azshari are still standing in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;. Much of the ruins in haunted by Highborne &lt;a href=\"ghost\"&gt;ghost&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIts buildings have existed for millennia, thus there are still ancients mechanisms that allow for stable &lt;a href=\"portal\"&gt;portal&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; thought of reclaiming the ruined city and rebuild it with naga architecture. In order to do so, they wanted to either convince the night elf spirits there to join their side, or remove them entirely. Queen Azshara ordered them instead to leave the spirits and the city alone.\nLocation.\nThe ancient city of Azshara was located at the center of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, surrounding the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. However, the edge of Zin-Azshari was somewhere in the region of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, dominating the landscape. The eastern cliffs were described as overlooking the lost city. &lt;a href=\"Obrahiim%2C%20the%20Traveler\"&gt;Obrahiim, the Traveler&lt;/a&gt; was a scholar who studied its ruins in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn \"\", a scenario map centered around the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt; depicts events (as told by &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leafbeard%20the%20Storied\"&gt;Leafbeard the Storied&lt;/a&gt;) that took place near Zin-Azshari during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. It uses the map of the original Azshara zone, but the geography is the post-\"Cataclysm\" version with the goblin structures and ocean removed.\n\"\" added Zin-Azshari as ruins in &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sea\"&gt;Great Sea&lt;/a&gt;.\nCaverns of Time.\nGlimpses of Zin-Azshari can be seen in the background of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity instance&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place mostly in &lt;a href=\"Azshara%27s%20Palace\"&gt;Azshara's Palace&lt;/a&gt; during the final battle for the city. Heroes relived the final hours of Zin-Azshari as they pushed through the area surrounding the Well, confronting &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt; herself and many of her allies.\nBoth (burning) modern night elf architecture, mostly to the north, and intact versions of the stone buildings seen in night elven ruins, mostly to the south, are present. Lorewise the Well is much larger than how it is portrayed in-game.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Ruins of Zin-Azshari were initially portrayed as a subzone of &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;. It was said \"The sundering caused most of the ancient city to sink to the oceans below. However, a cluster of ruins still clings to the eastern cliffs of Azshara, long shunned by night elves.\" However, no such area appeared in-game. The &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Eldarath\"&gt;Ruins of Eldarath&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Zin-Malor\"&gt;Temple of Zin-Malor&lt;/a&gt;, and what was the &lt;a href=\"Bay%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Bay of Storms&lt;/a&gt; were thought to possibly have been part of Zin-Azshari, or perhaps the city was not represented in the in-game zone. Zin-Azshari was also known in some sources as \"Azshara\". These points were later referenced by &lt;a href=\"Malynea%20Skyreaver\"&gt;Malynea Skyreaver&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nIt is strange that ruins of Zin-Azshari would appear on the mainland of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, since the city was on the shore of the Well of Eternity, hundreds (if not thousands) of miles away from the modern coast. However, there are hints the city may have been incredibly large, stretching hundreds (if not thousands) of miles across the continent.\n&lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; was also described as being a significant distance away from Zin-Azshari, with the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt; never having been pushed back as far as it during the war. Despite this, the zone of Azshara is located relatively close to Mount Hyjal. One theory which may explain these inconsistencies would be that ruined parts of Zin-Azshari were physically displaced long distances by the force of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;."}

They met in the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20Sewers\"&gt;sewers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to open a portal into the deepest parts of the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; and bind a powerful demon to their will in order to grow stronger against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.

Together, they infiltrated the archives of Jagganoth and stole the &lt;a href=\"Tome%20of%20Blighted%20Implements\"&gt;Tome of Blighted Implements&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, they were discovered; Jagganoth, burning with rage, attacked them and knocked all the members of the Council to the ground, except for the Sixth who had managed to flee and return to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Calydus\"&gt;Calydus&lt;/a&gt;, a demon that joined their cause.\nZinnin and the others were thus sent to the dreadlord &lt;a href=\"Mephistroth\"&gt;Mephistroth&lt;/a&gt; on the world of &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt;.

They were led by the &lt;a href=\"Khan\"&gt;High Khan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to unite &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s centaur tribes and conquer the whole of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, but they were stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;powerful elemental&lt;/a&gt; emerged in &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;. He believed that &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s mortal races were responsible for the imbalance in nature that led to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, and, in response, created a bold, \"pure\" race of centaur who would spread over the world and reclaim it from those who had \"defiled\" it. Under the leadership of their High Khan &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt;, the perfect ones spread and took control of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;'s centaur tribes, who served their new masters in the belief that a new age had begun, one in which all centaur would unite and reign over Azeroth. Wherever there was a centaur camp or outpost, the perfect ones were present. Aratas referred to the perfect ones as his \"brothers\" and intended for them to lead his armies into battle.\nIn contrast to the \"older breed\" of centaur\u2014the brutish descendants of &lt;a href=\"Zaetar\"&gt;Zaetar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theradras\"&gt;Theradras&lt;/a&gt;\u2014the perfect ones were strong, majestic, more beautiful, and capable of more advanced combat tactics. They considered Azeroth's other races\u2014anyone not of their image\u2014to be ugly mongrels who should be purged from the world. This extended to the older breed as well: Aratas forbade anyone but his own kind from entering Maraudon, and in at least &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;one case&lt;/a&gt; ordered the perfect ones to kill a member of the older breed who was deemed too weak and misshapen to fit in his vision of a strong, \"pure\" race.\nWhile the elemental remained in Maraudon and continued bolstering the perfect ones' ranks daily, the perfect ones led war parties of Aratas' centaur army in attacking &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; settlements all over Kalimdor and capturing large numbers of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s (to serve as slave labor or food). This was done in order to keep the Horde distracted until Aratas' army and his elemental father could invade and destroy the Horde capitals of &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, before continuing across the rest of Azeroth.\nAfter learning of the centaur threat, a team of the Horde's &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; militia set out to stop them. Many perfect ones fought alongside Aratas against the Garad'kra in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and later outside Maraudon itself. In the latter battle, they almost defeated the Garad'kra until the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt; arrived and helped defeat the centaur. Aratas considered the deaths of his brothers to be insignificant and brought the Garad'kra's leader &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt; into Maraudon to sacrifice her to his father. However, Malgar and the Garad'kra pursued him and managed to destroy both Aratas and the elemental, giving the rest of the Horde time to move their armies into position and scatter the remaining centaur.\nDuring the confrontation with Malgar, Aratas told the orc that he and the Garad'kra had cost him dearly by slaying his brothers who had been meant to lead his armies. Based on this, and the fact that no perfect ones have appeared or been mentioned since, it appears that they were all wiped out."}

Perith also delivered the dwarven mace &lt;a href=\"Fearbreaker\"&gt;Fearbreaker&lt;/a&gt; to Jaina, not only as proof that it truly was Baine that sent him, but also with the request that she return it to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, as Baine no longer felt like he should wield it. As he left, Perith assured Jaina that he would not be caught. He successfully returned to Baine and told him about Jaina's thankful reaction.\nWar Crimes.\nHe, as the most trusted Longwalker, accompanied Baine and &lt;a href=\"Kador%20Cloudsong\"&gt;Kador Cloudsong&lt;/a&gt; to the trial of Garrosh Hellscream. Perith was called as the ninth witness during the sixth day by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt;, who was concerned that Baine was compromising the trial. At first, he refused to reveal any secrets of his chieftain, but Baine ordered him to do so. He explained the role of a longwalker and told the trial about the secret meetings between Baine and Jaina.\nBefore the Storm.\nWhen several Horde figures, including Warchief &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, gathered in &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Rise\"&gt;Spirit Rise&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the catastrophe in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;, Perith arrived and informed Baine about &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; who came to Mulgore to visit Sylvanas. He then took &lt;a href=\"Arandis%20Sunfire\"&gt;Arandis Sunfire&lt;/a&gt; to Magni's location. The dwarf needed a portal as he was too heavy for the city lifts.\nPerith was also the messenger meeting with &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera Sanguinar&lt;/a&gt; who was delivering letters on &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s behalf to the tauren leader. He gave the &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; a letter stating the friendship between Baine and Anduin had to end for now as well as a piece of Baine's horn. He also did not accept the letter from Anduin, so that it wouldn't endanger Baine, but promised her that he would inform the high chieftain about it.\nIn the RPG.\nPerith Stormhoof is a &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"holy%20strider\"&gt;holy strider&lt;/a&gt;. While he is not famous in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the name of Perith Stormhoof is whispered with reverence among the holy striders. He is one of the oldest holy striders. Tauren whisper that he has visited both &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Theramore\"&gt;Theramore&lt;/a&gt; without injury, and he has even seen the shattered remains of &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Perith does not confirm or deny these rumors; he knows that they only strengthen the respect and therefore worth of the holy striders.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Birana%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Birana Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Moanah%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Moanah Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Rizei%20Stormhoof\"&gt;Rizei Stormhoof&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was the first person given the \"gift\" of becoming a &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; by Xavius. He had a mate, and a villa.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Like many of his fellow Highborne, Peroth'arn swore allegiance to the corrupted Xavius in exchange for gifts of demonic power. As a master of fiendish magic and recipient of the satyr curse, Peroth'arn stands outside Azshara's palace in defense of the Burning Legion, ready to destroy those hoping to disrupt the entrance of the Dark Titan, Sargeras, into Azeroth.\"\nAbilities.\nThe Eyes of Peroth'arn.\nAfter Illidan interrupts Drain Essence, Peroth'arn returns to the shadows to ambush the heroes. Peroth'arn unleashes his Eyes of Peroth'arn to search for the players. Players gain the protection of their Shadowcloaks to help them avoid the detection range of the Eyes.\nIf players avoid detection for 40 seconds, Peroth'arn becomes visible and weakened with the Enfeebled effect.\nIf an &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Peroth%27arn\"&gt;Eye of Peroth'arn&lt;/a&gt; discovers a player, Peroth'arn marks the player with Easy Prey, leaps out of the shadows, and attacks the discovered player.\nStrategy.\nThe tank should engage Peroth'arn. The stacks of Corrupting Touch are mostly unavoidable. All players should avoid the puddles created by Fel Flames.\nFel Decay is going to cause &gt;120000 damage to its target. The healer must judge whether a heal can be delayed until the debuff ends, or if the damage must be healed immediately (injuring the healer). It is mathematically similar to a 33% healing debuff so it is a subject of concern, not panic.\nWhen he vanishes and sends out the eyes, players should run to avoid the eyes. If a player is detected the tank will have to taunt periodically because Peroth'arn appears to like to switch to the Easy Prey victim."}

{"id": "13186", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=13186", "title": "Pet", "text": "A pet is any creature that a player can summon or tame.\nAbilities.\nCombat pets have their own abilities. Once a pet is summoned, its &lt;a href=\"Action%20Bar\"&gt;action bar&lt;/a&gt; appears above the player's action bar. All combat pets share six commands; they are &lt;a href=\"Attack\"&gt;Attack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Follow\"&gt;Follow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stay\"&gt;Stay&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Assist\"&gt;Assist&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Defensive\"&gt;Defensive&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Passive\"&gt;Passive&lt;/a&gt;. Each pet can have a maximum of four unique abilities. These abilities are either learnt automatically, or, for Hunter pets, acquired through &lt;a href=\"pet%20talent\"&gt;pet talent&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAggro.\nAll pets, with the exception of non-combat pets, will set their owner in combat when they pull aggro. However, if the owner can break combat through effects like &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Flask%20of%20Petrification\"&gt;Flask of Petrification&lt;/a&gt;, they will remain out of combat until either they or their pet take another aggressive action. This is true even if the owner mounts, which will send any attacking mobs into &lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt;.\nTypes.\nCombat pets.\n\"World of Warcraft\" provides two primary &lt;a href=\"combat%20pet\"&gt;combat pet&lt;/a&gt; classes: &lt;a href=\"hunter%20pet\"&gt;hunter pet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warlock%20minion\"&gt;warlock minion&lt;/a&gt;s. These classes have a number of available combat pets (although only one can be active at a time) and the chosen pet is permanent. &lt;a href=\"mage%20talents%23Frost\"&gt;Frost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"death%20knight%20talents%23Unholy\"&gt;Unholy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s also have permanent combat pets; the &lt;a href=\"water%20elemental\"&gt;water elemental&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Ally\"&gt;Risen Ally&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.\nMany other classes can summon temporary combat pets - &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s have the &lt;a href=\"shadowfiend\"&gt;shadowfiend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"druid%20talents%23balance\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s can use &lt;a href=\"Force%20of%20Nature\"&gt;Force of Nature&lt;/a&gt; to summon 3 &lt;a href=\"treant\"&gt;treant&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;s can use &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Elemental%20Totem\"&gt;Fire Elemental Totem&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Elemental%20Totem\"&gt;Earth Elemental Totem&lt;/a&gt; to summon the corresponding elemental, while &lt;a href=\"shaman%20talents%23Enhancement\"&gt;Enhancement&lt;/a&gt; shamans can also use &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Spirit\"&gt;Feral Spirit&lt;/a&gt; to summon 2 Spirit wolves - but most of these combat pets have a very limited duration, and with sizeable cooldowns are only available part of the time. The only classes not able to summon combat pets are &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s not specialized in the &lt;a href=\"druid%20talents%23Balance\"&gt;Balance&lt;/a&gt; tree also cannot summon any pets.\nGuardians.\nGuardian pets are similar to combat pets but are not under the direct control of the player. They are also temporary, fighting on your behalf until they die or their duration expires. Guardians can be summoned by abilities and talent abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Infernal\"&gt;Summon Infernal&lt;/a&gt;, talents such as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Parasite\"&gt;Blood Parasite&lt;/a&gt;, or even certain items. Some guardian pets are &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s; these are usually reusable but limited by a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; time. A couple of guardian pets are offhand items, (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Cornerstone%20Grimoire\"&gt;Ancient Cornerstone Grimoire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Book of the Dead&lt;/a&gt;). One is a sword, &lt;a href=\"Dragon%27s%20Call\"&gt;Dragon's Call&lt;/a&gt;, which summons &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dragon%20Whelp\"&gt;Emerald Dragon Whelp&lt;/a&gt;s. Others are usable from your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; but will either be &lt;a href=\"consumable\"&gt;consumable&lt;/a&gt; or have a limited number of uses. Guardian pet items can be acquired in the following ways:\nAn early one that many people see is the &lt;a href=\"Dog%20Whistle\"&gt;Dog Whistle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; Library, which drops off of &lt;a href=\"Houndmaster%20Loksey\"&gt;Houndmaster Loksey&lt;/a&gt;, with 3 charges.\nA guardian pet will defend its owner, attacking whatever its owner attacks or whatever attacks the owner, which can lead to its attacking unintended targets before the party is ready for them. Caution is necessary before using such a pet in an &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;. Use one only in confined spaces or areas where all but a few enemies have been killed, or just don't use it.\nCompanions.\n&lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt;s are sometimes called \"small pets\", \"minipets\", \"player pets\", \"trophy pets\" or \"vanity pets\" to distinguish these pets from the pets in the game that can directly help characters in some way (usually by attacking). Companions generally do not fight or respond to commands and are summoned (or dismissed) by right-clicking on an associated item (pet-carrier, collar, stone, etc.). &lt;a href=\"Breanni\"&gt;Breanni&lt;/a&gt;, a pet supplies vendor in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, sell &lt;a href=\"Fetch%20Ball\"&gt;Fetch Ball&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rope%20Pet%20Leash\"&gt;Rope Pet Leash&lt;/a&gt;es.\nSmall pets can be acquired in the following ways:\nMind Control.\nWhile not strictly pets, &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;s may be controlled to act like pets by players or creatures via &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"Gnomish%20Mind%20Control%20Cap\"&gt;Gnomish Mind Control Cap&lt;/a&gt;. While controlling, the player will gain a pet action bar, allowing him/her to command the humanoid. Mind Control on players in PvP only lasts for 8 seconds, and only allows for movement and the use of a basic melee attack; the target's other abilities are unavailable through Mind Control.\nThere are other mind control-like effects:"}

From left to right, they are the storage facility, dockhouse and longhouse. Target the roof of the building, not the sides.\nBe sure to turn up your [View Distance] other wise you might not be able to see the buildings. This is done by pressing [Esc] then click on the [Video] button at the top of the options menu on the ledt you will see [Resolution] and [Effects]. Select [Effects] it is the top slider on the left under the big Video Quality slider. move it to the right for farther [View Distance]. it might slow you down so be sure to put it back after the quest. If it doesnt slow you down keep it there if you want.\nRegarding the Longhouse, hit the roof to get it!\nAlthough there is no timer, if you spend too long in the harpoon control, you'll eventually be catapulted out to land in Daggerbay.

{"id": "14533", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14533", "title": "Item", "text": "An item is something that a \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt; can carry, either in their inventory, represented by an inventory icon, or tracked on a page in the &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt;. An item is a conceptual object in the player's head, not an &lt;a href=\"object\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt; in the game world, although an item may also have an object associated with it. For example, clothing gear items are &lt;a href=\"equip\"&gt;equip&lt;/a&gt;ped, clothing gear objects appear on the character. When a &lt;a href=\"guardian%20pet\"&gt;guardian pet&lt;/a&gt; item is &lt;a href=\"use\"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt;d, a guardian pet is spawned in the game world, much like summoning. \nA &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt; can purchase items from &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt;s, can receive items as rewards for &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;s, and can &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; items from many &lt;a href=\"object\"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt;s, such as &lt;a href=\"corpse\"&gt;corpse&lt;/a&gt;s of kills. Most items can be sold to vendors. Depending on how an item &lt;a href=\"bind\"&gt;bind&lt;/a&gt;s, it may be able to be bought and sold in the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt;ed to another character. \nItems are interacted with, &lt;a href=\"equip\"&gt;equip&lt;/a&gt;ped, &lt;a href=\"use\"&gt;use&lt;/a&gt;d, bought, or sold, by right clicking the icon in the correct venue. Right clicking will have different, perhaps unexpected results depending on the venue; attempting to equip an item when you are talking to a vendor will sell the item to the vendor. (You can buy it back if you notice it.) A few items have passive abilities and only need to be carried. \nThere is a trend to make some items teach a character how to summon, rather than spawning objects directly, so that the item does not continually consume inventory space. &lt;a href=\"Companion\"&gt;Companion&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s are no longer spawned from items, now the pet or mount item teaches the character to summon the pet or mount. \n&lt;a href=\"Container\"&gt;Container&lt;/a&gt; items can contain other items or may represent a conceptual game item that has no representation of its own. \nItems are divided into several categories, based on their rarity and usefulness: see &lt;a href=\"Quality\"&gt;Quality&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nLegendary Heroes can carry up to six special items in a small inventory. The items can turn the tide of battle as they grant the Hero the ability to cast offensive and defensive spells, heal units, utilize special abilities or gain bonuses to specific statistics.\nCreeps, or hostile neutral units sometimes drop Hero Items when they are killed. A Hero Item appears as a Treasure Chest when it is on the ground. Heroes can drop Hero Items onto the ground so that they can pick up another Hero Item whenever they want. Heroes can also buy new Hero Items at Neutral Buildings. \nHero Items are divided into three categories:"}

{"id": "12556", "revid": "40468391", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12556", "title": "Item equipping", "text": "Without macros.\nNote that the need for macro juggling to switch equipment is all but gone with the advent of AddOns such as\n&lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.curse-gaming.com/en/wow/addons-2045-1-itemrack.html\"&gt;ItemRack&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.curse-gaming.com/en/files/details/4784/outfitter/\"&gt;Outfitter&lt;/a&gt;. These addons can themselves be controlled with macros if you like :-)\nBasics.\ncodice_1\nBags count from 0 to 4 from the right, 0 being your backpack and 4 being your leftmost pack. Slots are numbered starting at the topmost, leftmost slot and counting left to right, top to bottom. For example, a 10-slot pack is numbered like this:\ncodice_2\nTo access the first slot on the leftmost bag, the script would be codice_3\nThe basic command works like this:\n/script PickupInventoryItem(inventorySlot)\nPicks up/puts down/switches item into the specified slot.\nSee &lt;a href=\"InventorySlots\"&gt;InventorySlots&lt;/a&gt; for ids and mappings.\nBetter method:\n/script UseContainerItem(bag, slot);\nWill automatically equip the item referenced by bag,slot, placing any existing already equipped item in the bag slot.\nYes, this is undoubtedly easier... until you start dealing with dualwielding. At which point UseContainerItem stops being nice. -- \nPlease be very careful when using the UseContainerItem(bag,slot) command. If you are talking to a vendor and use this macro (assuming no safety measures in the script) then all your macro items will be sold. I just managed to sell 7 items to a vendor. Fortunately, I was able to retrieve the last item and Blizzard restored the other equipment items for me.\nFor those of us that are prone to doing this you can do a check to see if you are interacting with an NPC. example weaponswap(2H &lt;-&gt; 1H/OH):\ncodice_4\nThe best method for ensuring that you do not accidentally sell anything to a vendor is:\ncodice_5\nThe aforementioned if-then script can still fail if you are in a vendor window and target another entity, whereas the CloseMerchant script will always close any merchant window. It's also much shorter, so you can fit more lines of item swapping into the character-limited macro box. --\nMultiple commands.\nThere is a problem when executing multiple Pickup commands because they execute instantaneously on your client, which is not always synched with the server.\nTherefore, follow these simple guidelines:\nGood luck!\nWeapon swapping scripts.\nNOTE: When copying the scripts, make sure they end up on ONE line.\nAlso, you will NEED to change the offhandBag, offhandBagSlot and mainhandBag, mainhandBagSlot names to actual numbers, as the scripts will NOT fit in a macro as it is.\nFrom mainhand/offhand to mainhand/offhand.\nScript to swap items in both hands to other items in both hands.\noffhandBag, offhandBagSlot and mainhandBag, mainhandBagSlot need to be specified (duh).\ncodice_6\nFrom mainhand to mainhand/offhand.\nScript to switch from item in main hand to other items in both hands.\noffhandBag, offhandBagSlot and mainhandBag, mainhandBagSlot need to be specified (duh). \nWeapon in main hand will end up in mainhandBag, mainhandBagSlot.\ncodice_7\nSwitch from a 2h to 1h+shield\ncodice_8\nAny to Any.\nScript to swap from one set of weapons to another, in any combination. I've included an expanded version of the somewhat obfuscated code, although it's a too long to be usable itself. The CloseMerchant() call is included for safety reasons.\nThe shorter version uses bag 3, slot 5 for the main weapon and bag 4, slot 6 for the offhand item, whereas the expanded version uses more descriptive terms for those locations.\nNote that the held weapons will end up in those inventory slots after the swap, so if you're swapping between a two-handed weapon and a one-handed + offhand configuration, you'll need to leave the offhand bag slot empty while you're wielding it, or swapping it out won't work properly.\n\"/script local a,b,c=CursorHasItem,PickupInventoryItem,PickupContainerItem;if(not a())then CloseMerchant();b(17);if(a())then c(4,6);c(4,5);b(16)else c(4,5);b(16);c(4,6);b(17)end end\n /script\n if ( not CursorHasItem() )then\n CloseMerchant();\n PickupInventoryItem(17);\n if ( CursorHasItem() ) then\n PickupContainerItem(offhandBag, offhandBagSlot);\n PickupContainerItem(mainhandBag, mainhandBagSlot);\n PickupInventoryItem(16);\n else\n PickupContainerItem(mainhandBag, mainhandBagSlot);\n PickupInventoryItem(16);\n PickupContainerItem(offhandBag, offhandBagSlot);\n PickupInventoryItem(17);\n end\n end\nFrom mainhand to mainhand.\nScript to switch from item in main hand to another item in the main hand.\nmainhandBag, mainhandBagSlot need to be specified (duh). \nThe equipped weapon will end up on mainhandBag, mainhandBagSlot.\ncodice_9\nSwap Mainhand and Offhand Weapons.\nThis script is pretty simple. On my rogue I wanted to switch my offhand to my mainhand, and vice-versa (use dagger for ambush, then swap so I can SS with the sword). You can accomplish this with a very simple macro that will swap back and forth each time you use it. -- \ncodice_10\nWith Cosmos.\nIf you are using Cosmos, you can use the following commands : \n /saveset &lt;Number&gt;\n /loadset &lt;Number&gt;\nSimple Swap Without Itemslots.\nHalow's Item Switch (1h+Shield to 2h)\nI don't know about you guys but I cant stand item slot specific macros, to complicated for me and a waste of macro space. So I made this little gem...\ncodice_11\nNote** make sure you don't put the &lt;&gt; around your weapons.\nThis macro will equip your 1handed weapon and your shield/offhand weapon when you click it, and when you click it while holding down shift it will equip your 2handed weapon. This should also work for dual wield to 2hander though I haven't tested it.\nWeapon Swap Using Equipment Manager.\nNOTE: You'll have to activate your the Equipment Manager first (Options &gt; Interface &gt; Features &gt; [X] Use Equipment Manger), it will appear at the top right corner of your character frame. \nThe next step is to create a set for each weapon you want to use in your macros. It's important to deactivate all the other item slots, you simply click the yellow arrow at each slot and choose \"Ignore this slot\", this will prevent Error messages in combat.\nAfter you've created the weapon sets, you can include them in your macros using this command:\ncodice_12\nReplace SetName with the exact name of your own weapon set. The advantage of this method is, in comparison to the /equip and /equipslot commands, that it works better when lags appear. Of course it's possible to include multiple sets in one macro using modifiers as shown above."}
{"id": "38364", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=38364", "title": "Item level", "text": "Item level (often abbreviated as ilevel or simply ilvl) is a rather important property of every item. It has two main functions \u2014 to reflect the item's usefulness and at the same time determine the minimum level a character must have in order to use it.\nItem level serves as a rough indicator of the power and usefulness of an item, designed to reflect the overall benefit of using the item. Two items of equal ilvl should in theory therefore be of equal potential use. However, each item spends its ilvl 'budget' differently, in various primary and secondary &lt;a href=\"stat\"&gt;stat&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as in procs and effects. Since each of these values provide different benefits to different classes and specs, the true value of an item varies depending on the user, and cannot be determined solely by ilvl. Additionally, &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Power\"&gt;PvP Power&lt;/a&gt; is not counted towards an item's ilvl budget, allowing PvP gear of a given ilvl to provide an advantage in PvP compared to non-PvP gear of the same ilvl.\nItem level is widely used as a means of assessing a character's power. Ilvl is used as a gating requirement when queueing for &lt;a href=\"dungeon\"&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"raid\"&gt;raid&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt;s, and is often used in a similar way by players organising raids.\nIndividual items' item levels can be found in their tooltips. Each character's average ilvl can be found in the &lt;a href=\"character%20sheet\"&gt;character sheet&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "22081", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=22081", "title": "Item suffix", "text": "An Item suffix is a dedicated suffix given to equippable items that feature randomized &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Secondary_attributes\"&gt;secondary stat ratings&lt;/a&gt; upon generation. These suffixes indicate which secondary stats are present on an item. \nItems of this type, like others, have a base item name. Unlike other items however, their name is followed by a suffix. These suffixes are similar to the item naming convention used in other Blizzard games such as \"Diablo\" and \"Diablo II\". The suffix will always start with the word \"of\" followed by a few words that indicate quickly to the player what enhancements an item will give. The amount of secondary stat ratings an item gives is based on its &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;, which dictates its item budget.\nItems with suffixes are typically , and are often found as world drop &lt;a href=\"BoE\"&gt;BoE&lt;/a&gt;s. Although and items exist, these are most often limited to items created by professions. \nOn some crafting patterns, and item database websites (like &lt;a href=\"Wowhead\"&gt;Wowhead&lt;/a&gt;), these items are listed with their base name (for example, &lt;a href=\"Slatesteel%20Girdle\"&gt;Slatesteel Girdle&lt;/a&gt; or ) and the green text \"&lt;Random enchantment&gt;\" to indicate that the actual items have a randomly assigned enhancement matching the suffixes.\nItem Suffixes.\nAs of ', there are currently six item suffixes in use. Each suffix grants a randomized amount of its fixed two secondary stats. These suffixes are used throughout the game at all levels (suffixes that itemize &lt;a href=\"mastery\"&gt;mastery&lt;/a&gt; do not appear until '). &lt;a href=\"Attributes%23Minor_attributes\"&gt;Tertiary stats&lt;/a&gt; have a chance of appearing on items starting from \"\" and do not affect the amount of secondary stats granted.\nAdditional Suffixes.\nThere are four additional item suffixes that only grant one secondary stat. These suffixes however are limited to a small set of specific gear in game, and do not appear elsewhere. Sources include gear from low level battleground crates (such as &lt;a href=\"Crate%20of%20Battlefield%20Goods\"&gt;Crate of Battlefield Goods&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"crafted\"&gt;crafted&lt;/a&gt; gear from the \"Legion\" expansion.\nRemoved Suffixes.\nFor the most part, \"animal\", \"job\" and attribute suffixes are seen most commonly. Resistance and \"wrath\" drop less commonly, and the miscellaneous ones drop the least often. Of course, in some cases item suffixes are simply part of a unique name or are used to signify an item is part of a set.\nCataclysm introduced &lt;a href=\"%23Four-stat%20suffixes\"&gt;four-stat random enchantment items&lt;/a&gt; with the names of elemental powers and forces of nature, to go with the theme of the expansion. These items always have a &lt;a href=\"primary%20stat\"&gt;primary stat&lt;/a&gt;, a large amount of stamina, and then two related secondary stats (i.e., expertise rating does not appear with intellect, but does exist with strength and agility; similarly spirit only appeared with intellect).\nCertain classes, especially when leveling, will have more of this kind of item than uniquely named items (especially if you are hitting the auction house early rather than waiting on quest rewards or dungeon loot). To help find random enchantment gear that is beneficial for your class and specialization see the section \"Class Preferences\" below.\nSuffixes that increase a single &lt;a href=\"attribute\"&gt;attribute&lt;/a&gt; or stat.\nItems with an \"of Attribute\" suffix typically have less total attribute enhancement than \"of the Animal\". For example, a \"Shortsword of Strength\" may have +10 strength, whereas a \"Shortsword of the Bear\" of comparable level may have +6 strength and +6 stamina.\nIn addition there are a number of suffixes that increase more generic stats, like attack power, spell power, or defenses.\nSpell damage suffixes.\nAnother set of single stat suffixes increase the damage of certain &lt;a href=\"Magic%20schools\"&gt;schools of magic&lt;/a&gt; (or all schools equally).\nResistances.\nThere are some items in the game that increase the chances that a school of magic will be resisted. There are currently no items that increase resistance to holy magic, though there are potions available that can absorb holy magic damage. Often suffix items \"of X resistance\" have some of the highest resistances available, and are useful for difficult resistances like Arcane or Frost, but are nearly impossible to farm.\nThe following two-stat resistance suffixes were introduced with the Burning Crusade. They are only available for characters 57+ as drops in Outland onward, and are significantly superior to the older resistance greens, and in many cases better than the best resist gear blues or purples (in terms of pure resistance) since they have no other stats.\nAnimal suffixes and other Two-stat suffixes.\nThese are commonly found suffixes that indicate an item increases two attribute stats as shown in the tables below:\n\"* On items for levels 1 to 60\"\n\"** Generally on items from Outland onward (exceptions exist)\"\nIn addition to the animal suffixes, there are few more two-stat suffixes for avoidance and spell casting.\nThree-stat suffixes.\nFor the most part, all of the three-stat suffixes were added in \"The Burning Crusade\" with a few additions for \"Wrath of the Lich King\". Items with these random enchantments can be found in a &lt;a href=\"Satchel%20of%20Helpful%20Goods\"&gt;Satchel of Helpful Goods&lt;/a&gt;, as drops from &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; onward, and as repeatable quest rewards. They can even be created with some luck by a few of the crafting professions. The more standard variations such as Beast and Prophet will drop quite frequently, while more obscure suffixes like Knight are very rare, and will only drop as Rare quality (Blue) gear.\nYou will notice that some suffixes add the same stats. The rarer suffixes with the same stats only appear on certain armor types or specific qualities (green, blue, etc.)\nAgility.\n\"* Appears only on leather\"\nStrength.\n\"* Appears only on mail\"\n\"** Appears only on plate\"\nFour-stat suffixes.\nThis section lists the new four-stat random enchantment suffixes introduced in the Cataclysm expansion. These new suffixes all have four stat modifiers, two primary and two secondary.\nFour-stat random enchantment gear has the same value of Stam and a second primary stat (agi, int, or str) as the three-stat suffixes (like \"of the Seer\"), and instead of one amount of secondary stat rating has \"two ratings, each at 2/3 the value\" of the single rating on a three-stat item (for example, trading 120 parry for 80 parry and 80 mastery)\nFour-stat random enchantment items have the following properties:\nFor example:\nThis ratio remains constant for all of the Cataclysm four-stat random enchantment items.\nBelow are charts listing the rating combos for each of the variable primary stats.

He will then will patrol around the field for ten minutes, before pushing into the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf\"&gt;Frostwolf&lt;/a&gt; base. Ivus is more powerful if everyone on your team buffs Ivus as he accepts every buff. Ivus doesn't attack enemy &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s, and will only attack enemy players. If Ivus reaches the Frostwolf base, he will stand in front of &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Keep\"&gt;Frostwolf Keep&lt;/a&gt; and stay there unless provoked by enemy players, in which case he will give chase until he either &lt;a href=\"leash\"&gt;leash&lt;/a&gt;es back, kills the enemy player, or is killed himself.\nIvus is a very powerful NPC, but is not invincible. Without Alliance interference, he can be killed by the enemy Horde forces with relative ease. Ivus, like his counterpart &lt;a href=\"Lokholar%20the%20Ice%20Lord\"&gt;Lokholar the Ice Lord&lt;/a&gt; can also be &lt;a href=\"kite\"&gt;kite&lt;/a&gt;d, but as he is neither attacked nor defended by NPCs on the field, and often delays their eventual movement forward.\nIvus is prone to a bug in summoning where he will fail to spawn and the Calling Circle will disappear. It is unknown what causes this to happen. (As of 11/17/08, this bug still seems to persist.)\nDue to the preferred method of rushing to the enemy base and taking out objectives along the way for the most efficient win, and the time consuming gathering of the Storm Crystals, it is extremely rare to ever see Ivus now. Many newer players have no idea this NPC even exists. However, there are players who have successfully summoned him, even if only for the experience of seeing Ivus at least once.\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nIvus appears as a in the \" set.

He became a leader of raids on the remaining &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, and often urged his brother, &lt;a href=\"Jaruk%20Bloodfyre\"&gt;Jaruk Bloodfyre&lt;/a&gt;, to drink the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20of%20Mannoroth\"&gt;Blood of Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt; as well and join their slaughtering of man, woman and child alike. J'argg forced Jaruk to carry axes but they were ineffective in the shaman's hands.\nDuring a raid, he thought he saved Jaruk's life by killing two draenei. In truth however, Jaruk was trying to help the draenei escape. When he threw a spear into the second draenei, &lt;a href=\"Alius\"&gt;Alius&lt;/a&gt;, he learned that one draenei escaped. He ordered &lt;a href=\"Ra%27nok\"&gt;Ra'nok&lt;/a&gt; to burn the corpses and went for the draenei. He found her as she was trying to distract the orcs. He killed her immediately and eventually found her daughter, &lt;a href=\"Leena\"&gt;Leena&lt;/a&gt;. He ordered Jaruk to kill the child but Jaruk refused, attacking him. During the battle, he lost his left eye. An &lt;a href=\"ogre%20lord\"&gt;ogre lord&lt;/a&gt; suddenly appeared and distracted the two combatants. J'argg for the last time tried to persuade Jaruk to help him. However, Jaruk instead took Leena and escaped. J'argg returned to camp, told the orcs about Jaruk's betrayal and prepared to track the traitor. Thanks to Ra'nok, who tracked them down, J'argg found them but Jaruk was able to stir a hive of &lt;a href=\"fireflies\"&gt;fireflies&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"spore%20walker\"&gt;spore walker&lt;/a&gt;, which attacked the approaching orcs. Some of his orcs died, but J'argg insisted on catching Jaruk.\nYears later, he managed to catch Leena and her new cub, &lt;a href=\"Pebbles\"&gt;Pebbles&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, he and his orcs approached Chantu's house. He tossed Pebbles and laughed when Leena called Jaruk father. He revealed that he had traveled to the Black Temple in order to get demon's blood for Jaruk, because he felt that it was his fault as he had not convinced Jaruk to drink it. As orcs seized Jaruk, J'argg made him drink the demon blood and demanded to kill Leena as a proof of his new allegiance. But Jaruk, still in control of his actions, attacked J'argg and his followers. Apparently victorious, he renounced his brother and walked off to embrace Leena. But in a final act of spite, the dying J'argg managed to thrust his blade through Jaruk's back. The shocked Leena picked up a fallen blade and pierced J'argg's neck, killing him."}

It is used extensively by their games \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft\"&gt;StarCraft&lt;/a&gt;\" (JASS) and \"&lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III\"&gt;Warcraft III&lt;/a&gt;\" (JASS2) for scripting events in the game world. Map creators can use it in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20III%20World%20Editor\"&gt;\"Warcraft III\" World Editor&lt;/a&gt; and the \"StarCraft\" Editor to create scripts for triggers and in custom maps and campaigns.\nJASS was replaced with Galaxy script in \"&lt;a href=\"StarCraft%20II\"&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/a&gt;\".\nFeatures.\nThe language provides an extensive API that gives programmers control over nearly every aspect of the game world. It can, for example, give orders to units, change the weather and time of day, play sounds and display text to the player, and manipulate the terrain. It has a syntax similar to Delphi, although, unlike that language, it is case sensitive. JASS primarily uses procedural programming concepts, though popular user-made modifications to Blizzard's World Editor program have since added C++-like object-oriented programming features to the syntax of JASS.\nSample code.\nThe following function creates a string containing the message \"Hello, world!\" and displays it to all players:\n function Trig_JASS_test_Actions takes nothing returns nothing\n local string a =\"Hello, world!\"\n call DisplayTextToForce( GetPlayersAll(), a )\n endfunction\nor if you want this only for one player:\n function Trig_JASS_test_Actions takes player p returns nothing\n call DisplayTextToPlayer(p, 0,0, \"Hello, world!\")\n endfunction\nAnd if you want to print the message 90 times and show the iterator:\n function Trig_JASS_test_Actions takes player p returns nothing\n local integer i=0\n loop\n exitwhen i==90\n call DisplayTextToPlayer(p, 0,0, \"Hello, world! \"+I2S(i))\n set i=i+1\n endloop\n endfunction"}

He used to be a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; and still retains some knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;, but the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; makes it near impossible to use. One thing he can still manage is the occasional spell to glimpse faraway places.\nJace appears to be quite analytical and intelligent, serving as the technological brains behind the Illidari. He has shown the ability to create &lt;a href=\"Demon%20ward\"&gt;demonic wards&lt;/a&gt; and handles the maintenance and upgrades to the Illidari's &lt;a href=\"Legion%20ship\"&gt;Legion ship&lt;/a&gt;, the \"&lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt;\". He can be recruited as a &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; champion.\nBiography.\nMission to &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;Mardum&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn their mission on the prison homeworld of Mardum, he wants to gather as much intel as possible from the demon leaders in the area. Jace couldn't believe how powerful the demons were as jailers were trying to suck the souls of the other demon hunters. After &lt;a href=\"Inquisitor%20Baleful\"&gt;Inquisitor Baleful&lt;/a&gt; is slain, he sense great power within the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;fellow demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;. Making sacrifices to gather &lt;a href=\"Coilskar%20tribe\"&gt;more allies&lt;/a&gt; is anything that they will do to accomplish their goals he says. Upon spying on a new demon called &lt;a href=\"Aranasi\"&gt;Aranasi&lt;/a&gt; (as if the Legion needed spiders he commented), &lt;a href=\"Brood%20Queen%20Tyranna\"&gt;Brood Queen Tyranna&lt;/a&gt; told the &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Commander%20Beliash\"&gt;doom commander&lt;/a&gt; that demon hunters have invaded the planet. &lt;a href=\"Sargerite%20Keystone\"&gt;Sargeras' Keystone&lt;/a&gt; needed to be kept from them. Jace told the demon hunter to deactivate the &lt;a href=\"Spire%20of%20woe\"&gt;Spires of Woe&lt;/a&gt; to kill Beliash. He also had a feeling of an ultimate sacrifice to bring in &lt;a href=\"Shivarra\"&gt;one more army&lt;/a&gt; to the battle. A cave of a powerful presence awaits them on the other side and Jace told the demon hunter to use their &lt;a href=\"Spectral%20Sight\"&gt;Spectral Sight&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Lord%20Caza\"&gt;Fel Lord Caza&lt;/a&gt; befelled, it was time to take the fight to the Brood Queen. As progressing through her &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Fortress\"&gt;stronghold&lt;/a&gt;, the hold's stabilizers were taken out and Jace told them to find any others to weaken the defenses.\nCapture and freedom.\nWithin the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt;, many demon hunters including Jace were in stasis around the time the Legion launched their third invasion on Azeroth. &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; told the demon hunter to free them to help her stop &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan from another universe&lt;/a&gt;. Jace would secure the elevators and have a fel bat ready for the demon hunter to meet up with Kayn and &lt;a href=\"Altruis%20the%20Sufferer\"&gt;Altruis&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the Battle of the Broken Shore, Jace led the Illidari delegation to the Alliance, helping to expose the demon infiltrators and fending off an attack.\nBattling the Legion.\nJace briefly appeared in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, accompanying Altruis the Sufferer/Kayn Sunfury. To obtain the &lt;a href=\"Aldrachi%20Warblades\"&gt;Aldrachi Warblades&lt;/a&gt;, the commander was to meet with &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Khadgar\"&gt;Archmage Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; to obtain a &lt;a href=\"Crystallized%20Soul\"&gt;Crystallized Soul&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar comments that the demon hunter is tapping into magic even Illidan would have considered dangerous. Upon returning, Jace uses the crystal to communicate with Allari and needed intel of where the Warbaldes were located. Barely heard from the transmission the keys words were &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Caria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, it would have to do Jace told the demon hunter. Upon return from obtaining the artifacts of power, Jace was pleased of the hunt was a success. He then told the demon hunter to give the order to kill the demons souls to empower a portal to the &lt;a href=\"Mardum\"&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Darkstone%20Isle\"&gt;Darkstone Isle&lt;/a&gt;, the priest and Boros mend the wounds of &lt;a href=\"Alora\"&gt;Alora&lt;/a&gt; until interrupted by an inquisitor named &lt;a href=\"Subjugator%20Valith\"&gt;Subjugator Valith&lt;/a&gt;. Luckily, Jace was dealing with him and assisted the party to vanquish their foe. The priest sought out a demon with a &lt;a href=\"T%27uure%2C%20Beacon%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;staff of crystal&lt;/a&gt; and Jace comments that the eredar &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Calindris\"&gt;Lady Calindris&lt;/a&gt; is his prey and didn't want an opportunity to slip past him. He could use someone's back however, so joining up with the priest and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt; would allow him to complete his mission quicker and says that he needed her soul. The portal to &lt;a href=\"Niskara\"&gt;Niskara&lt;/a&gt; was up the hill and went through to obtain the artifact from Calindris. Boros and Jace were separated when the priest approached the paladin to mend his wounds. They rescue the demon hunter and escaped the legion building. A troll mage by the name of &lt;a href=\"Bo%27ja\"&gt;Bo'ja&lt;/a&gt; is freed from the cage and told the party that she had a score to settle with the eredar. She joins and with the priest delivering the final blow to Calindris, her, Jace, and Boros were gasping for breath. The demon hunter felt the power coursing through his veins as Boros told him that it's not too late to turn to the Light and be cleansed of his corruption. Jace told the paladin to spare him his platitudes and wanted to stop the Legion at all cost for nothing is more important than their destruction.\nJace is stationed at &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Stand\"&gt;Illidari Stand&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azsuna\"&gt;Azsuna&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the &lt;a href=\"Fel%20Hammer\"&gt;Fel Hammer&lt;/a&gt; Jace requests the last few parts from the other command centers. Otherwise, the Fel Hammer is ready to jump to Niskara he commented. Upon returning, a loud rumble came from the south of the ship. &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;The Deceiver&lt;/a&gt; appeared before the demon hunter to tell them that joining the &lt;a href=\"Felsworn\"&gt;Felsworn&lt;/a&gt; be the end of the conflict. Declining the offer makes the &lt;a href=\"Caria%20Felsoul\"&gt;Fel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=\"Varedis%20Felsoul\"&gt;soul&lt;/a&gt; siblings to take care of them on Niskara. After dealing a terrible blow to the Legion including Kil'jaeden, Jace was ready to represent his faction: the Illidari.\nLocations.\n \nQuotes.\nGossip.\nI'm glad that you're here, &lt;name&gt;.\nNow, let's be about our business.\nThe crucible? It's a device that we can use to scry upon others or communicate across great distances.\nWe can even use it to contact other dimensions.\nIt feeds on fel energy. The more distant the target, the more energy required by the ritual.\nThe Shivarra and many other demons swore fealty to Lord Illidan when he defeated their former master, the pit lord Magtheridon. We also have naga, broken, and some other creatures working for us.\nIf the Lord of Outland is okay with it, then I guess that's good enough for me.\nSomehow, the Burning Legion is nullifying my demon wards. If we don't get those defenses back in working order, we'll be overrun and I will have failed all of us.\nWe are in your debt, &lt;class&gt;, for aiding in the fight against the Legion.\nMilord &lt;name&gt;. We are most grateful that you have come to lead us to victory against the Burning Legion.\nIn \"Hearthstone\".\nJace Darkweaver appears as a in the \"\" expansion for \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"As a former mage, making the transition from fire to felfire was quite easy.\"\nSpeculation.\nThat Jace used to be a mage but was already a demon hunter by the attack on Mardum during \"The Burning Crusade\", several years before common night elves re-accepted the arcane, may mean that he is a &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;."}

Frost giants are a rare and particularly cruel variety of giant. Some, the &lt;a href=\"Frostmaul%20Giant\"&gt;Frostmaul&lt;/a&gt;s, are found in the mountains of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. Slow and patient, frost giants take great pleasure in wiping out entire herds of others\u2019 domesticated animals or even humanoid settlements. Gangs of them have been known to prepare an attack for over a year, slowly moving and hiding among the mountains, surrounding their target, and cutting off all escape before finally beginning their assault. When the slaughter is over, nothing is left standing, and the corpses are left to rot. Not much is known about frost giant society or mentality, but many scholars theorize that, like some other giants, they are creations of the titans. If this is the case, then their purpose remains a mystery. Perhaps their most famous entry into history occurred 4,000 years ago, when &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; saved the frostsaber queen from rampaging Frostmaul giants, thereby securing the &lt;a href=\"frostsaber\"&gt;frostsaber&lt;/a&gt;s' loyalty. A frost giant stands around 20 feet tall and weighs about 15,000 pounds. This huge creature looks like a snowy cliff face come to life. Ice and rock comprise its stout humanoid body, giving it a grizzled and ancient look. Cold, blue eyes peer beneath its snowy brow.\nAttacks from frost giants are usually vicious and well-coordinated, although a frost giant avoids a fight in which it suspects it might be overmatched. If it has an advantage at range, it stays back, pummeling its opponents with rocks. If melee combat serves it better, it attempts to sunder its opponent's weapons, leaving them helpless.\nThey take on a crystalline blue hue to their skin, their bodies packed with white snow."}

An ice revenant wears flowing black robes under scale mail armor and carries a heavy mace and large metal shield emblazoned with a single light blue-colored image of an eyeball. Etched into the shield, radiating from the eye out to the shield's edges, are yellow beams. The eye sockets of the creature's metallic helm shines with a menacing blue light, and its arms are of ice, much like the visible portions of its legs. Ice revenants are unpredictable creatures, following the winter snows and retiring to the cold plains of the north during the warmer southern months. They may arise anywhere, entering an area at a whim so long as there is snow on the ground or an intense chill in the air. They despise heat and will not enter warm areas or occupied houses. They are known for kidnapping children who wander into the woods on a snowy day. Ice revenants use their &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Nova\"&gt;Frost Nova&lt;/a&gt; spells as soon as possible, even choosing single targets if necessary. They then enter melee.

Where the Amani and Gurubashi claimed the forests and jungles for themselves, the Drakkari claimed the north.\nEarly history.\nAfter curious Zandalari awakened the ancient &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt;, the tribes united under the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;; forming the &lt;a href=\"Empire%20of%20Zul\"&gt;Empire of Zul&lt;/a&gt;, to fight back the &lt;a href=\"aqir\"&gt;aqir&lt;/a&gt;, who threatened to wash over &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;; having already destroyed countless tribes. Under Zandalari instruction, the most ambitious, being the Drakkari, Amani, and Gurubashi, were instructed to spread far and establish new footholds. The Drakkari took the frozen north, battling against the aqir and winning many battles until they came upon a new type of creature, the corrupted &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;. Known as &lt;a href=\"obsidian%20destroyer\"&gt;obsidian destroyer&lt;/a&gt;s, the Drakkari were decimated in battle until new strategies were developed to over come them. Beating back the aqir, the Drakkari emerged victorious, and the ice trolls claimed domination over the tundra. The remnants of the destroyed aqir would burrow underground, eventually evolving into the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s, and their empire of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;. While smaller than the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt; empires, the ice trolls still ruled enough land to be recognized as an empire of their own.\nThe ice trolls would spread out throughout Azeroth, with trolls colonizing &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. When the first &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; awoke, the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s wandered to the west into Dun Morogh, where they clashed with ice trolls.\nDrakkari Empire.\nThe mighty &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; would head the new Drakkari Empire from the temple city of &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt; in the north. Though the smallest among the three newly-emerged troll powers (the others being the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani Empire&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi Empire&lt;/a&gt;) the Drakkari nonetheless thrived within their northern territories. &lt;a href=\"Loa\"&gt;Loa&lt;/a&gt; worship was deeply important to the Drakkari, and many such spirits occupied the empire's pantheon. Structures such as temple cities, shrines, altars, more were constructed to venerate their the loa as well as other gods. In addition, the Drakkari used special &lt;a href=\"prophet\"&gt;prophet&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"high%20priest\"&gt;high priest&lt;/a&gt;s to commune with their deities, as well as oversee their worship. The &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20tribe\"&gt;Winterax&lt;/a&gt; were two of the known member tribes of the Drakkari Empire at this time.\nThe empire of the Drakkari would survive relatively undisturbed for many thousands of years, even as troll mastery of &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; was eventually ceded to the rising &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. Though they did not take part in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, they would ultimately suffer its consequences. The resulting &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Sundering&lt;/a&gt; violently shattered the continent, forming new and smaller landmasses. Much of Drakkari Empire was now lost, with tribes such as the Winterax of Alterac and Frostmane of Dun Morogh completely separated from the Drakkari.\nDespite this, the Drakkari civilization would survive in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; on the new continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Drakkari influence was concentrated in the northeast of the continent, stretching from &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt; in the east, to &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the west. After the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of dead ice trolls was found by &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Nexus\"&gt;Nexus&lt;/a&gt;. For thousands of years, they were allies to the &lt;a href=\"Rageclaw%20tribe\"&gt;Rageclaw tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"wolvar\"&gt;wolvar&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; came to Northrend and reunited with &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and his expedition, the two armies fought together against the undead, wolves, and ice trolls. The prince later hired &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; in order to burn the ships of his men to prevent them from returning home to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and abandon the hunt for &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;. Amongst these mercenaries were a fair number of native ice trolls.\nDownfall of the Drakkari.\nThe Drakkari Empire survived seemingly comfortably for over 10,000 years following the Sundering (longer than they had done before so). The ice trolls maintained large &lt;a href=\"Farm\"&gt;farms&lt;/a&gt;, supplied with a vast aqueduct system spanning the region of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt;. Worship of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; also remained extremely prevalent. Following the war between the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, the Winterax were forced to rejoin their Drakkari cousins in Zul'Drak, as their home of &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20Hold\"&gt;Winterax Hold&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by an avalanche, and the tribe could no longer sustain itself in the valley.\n&lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; would ultimately become home to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; armies of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, based from &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;. When the Lich King awoke and began a major &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; against the living of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Zul'Drak and the Drakkari found themselves in peril. By the time of the Lich King's awakening, the Drakkari were desperate. Many of their people were being slain and used as fodder, turned into &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20troll\"&gt;Scourge troll&lt;/a&gt;s. The legions of undead assaulted the Drakkari kingdom relentlessly, eventually seizing the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Drak%27Tharon%20Keep\"&gt;Drak'Tharon Keep&lt;/a&gt; as countless trolls were turned to undeath. The Lich King's forces continued their advance into Zul'Drak, threatening the entire Drakkari civilization.\nDesperate to turn back the undead, the Drakkari turned on their own gods for strength. Maddened high prophets and their followers sacrificed the animal loa, spilling their blood and harnessing the untapped power. As more parts of the nation fell to the Scourge, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; also arrived to fight both the restless undead and the frenzied trolls. The Winterax were sent to the &lt;a href=\"Amphitheater%20of%20Anguish\"&gt;Amphitheater of Anguish&lt;/a&gt; as a 'power move' against its new inhabitants by the Drakkari, with &lt;a href=\"Korrak%20the%20Bloodrager\"&gt;Korrak the Bloodrager&lt;/a&gt;, leader of the Winterax, infused with the power of the loa. Despite this, Korrak was defeated.\nIn the depths of the capital of &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, the most sacred shrines were said to be steeped in the &lt;a href=\"mojo\"&gt;mojo&lt;/a&gt; of slain gods. Surrounded by this dark energy, twisted Drakkari zealots grew in power, infusing their followers with incredible strength. If left undisturbed, the trolls of Gundrak would unleash their burgeoning might, plunging the entire region into chaos. Mortal &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt;s would succeed in attacking the temple city, preventing this. Some of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20History%20Tablet\"&gt;histories&lt;/a&gt; of the Drakkari tribe and empire were recovered by a mission of &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; based from &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Torga\"&gt;Zim'Torga&lt;/a&gt;, in the hope of preserving the ice trolls' past and heritage.\nCurrent status.\nThe fall of Zul'Drak had a lasting effect on all ice trolls. During the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; would once more try to unite the troll tribes of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and held a meeting of representatives from each. Ice trolls were present at the gathering, alongside &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20tribe\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;, though the Drakkari did not play a role in the following events, presumably too weak to do so. Forced to flee Northrend, the Drakkari would ultimately ally with the Zandalari as they attempted to rebuild the mighty troll empire. \nThe remaining Drakkari would bolster the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Invaders\"&gt;Zandalari Invaders&lt;/a&gt;, a united force of trolls that would eventually invade the northern shores of &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, along with the Gurubashi, Amani, and &lt;a href=\"Farraki%20tribe\"&gt;Farraki&lt;/a&gt; tribes. To mark their suffering at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, they had added &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; to their strength. They took part to the fight during the battle of &lt;a href=\"Horridon\"&gt;Horridon&lt;/a&gt; and the defense of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Elders\"&gt;Council of Elders&lt;/a&gt;, but were ultimately defeated. The death of their king, &lt;a href=\"Frost%20King%20Malakk\"&gt;Malakk&lt;/a&gt;, was the final blow for the Drakkari; as the tribe was no more afterwards.\nSome years later, &lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Malaka%27raz\"&gt;Speaker Malaka'raz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Fallen%20Tribes\"&gt;House of the Fallen Tribes&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; said that the empire no longer existed, and the Zandalari had left him as little more then a curiosity for others to gawk at. &lt;a href=\"Zul\"&gt;Zul&lt;/a&gt; and his rebels would learn from the Drakkari's example and attempt to drain the Zandalari loa in the same way the Drakkari had their loa.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20tribe\"&gt;Winterax tribe&lt;/a&gt; survived where the Drakkari did not. While they were forced to leave Alterac Valley by the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20clan\"&gt;Stormpike clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; and watch the downfall of Zul'Drak, the tribe retains a presence within &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, unlike the Drakkari. Following the defeat of the Drakkari, it is unknown where the Winterax reside now, having last been seen in Zul'Drak. A fair number of Winterax reside in &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;, where they retain presence as &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20Speaker\"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt;, alongside the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20Speaker\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; tribe. &lt;a href=\"Winterax%20Mourner\"&gt;Mourners&lt;/a&gt; from each tribe were also present following the death of &lt;a href=\"King%20Rastakhan\"&gt;King Rastakhan&lt;/a&gt;, showing that if no where else, the Winterax may be refugees in Zandalar.\nIn the aftermath of the Lich King's defeat, the &lt;a href=\"Icetusk%20tribe\"&gt;Icetusk tribe&lt;/a&gt; was formed by &lt;a href=\"Drakani%20Death-Defiler\"&gt;Drakani Death-Defiler&lt;/a&gt;s. The group settled upon a chain of islands known as the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Chain\"&gt;Dread Chain&lt;/a&gt;. In order to survive, the Icetusk turned to &lt;a href=\"necromancy\"&gt;necromancy&lt;/a&gt;, with many of their dead having been risen as servants. They mined &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; along the isles, and came into conflict with adventurers looking to do the same.\nThe ice trolls of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 are currently fighting a guerrilla war against the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The trolls once ruled the surface before the dwarves conquered it from them. They have been forced to live in caves and small encampments surrounding &lt;a href=\"Iceflow%20Lake\"&gt;Iceflow Lake&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown where the location of their former capital was, however the seat of their power was once in the large cave complex of &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20Hold\"&gt;Frostmane Hold&lt;/a&gt;. In the hills of &lt;a href=\"Shimmer%20Ridge\"&gt;Shimmer Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, the ice trolls grow &lt;a href=\"Shimmerweed\"&gt;Shimmerweed&lt;/a&gt; and have several encampments.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Frostmane Hold was over run by &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s, and the Frostmane were forced to retreat to the hills, forming the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20Retreat\"&gt;Frostmane Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. There, they were approached by the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;, who sought to bring them into the fold as well as use their position to strike against Ironforge. This attempt was thwarted by the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, though the tribe was not wiped out.\nSociety.\nLike their forest troll cousins, ice trolls revel in carnage and wickedness. Cannibalistic by nature, ice trolls are renowned for their love of eating their recently slain enemies raw. Their social structure is very similar to that of their forest dwelling cousins. Trolls such as &lt;a href=\"Trollgore\"&gt;Trollgore&lt;/a&gt; were paragons of the savagery of the tribe. The trolls of Northrend were the largest still functioning troll empire until the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, where they progressively lost more and more territory against them.\nAppearance.\nIce trolls are &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; subgroups that live in cold climates. They have angular features, red eyes, and skin that ranges from blue to white and possess many different hair colors. Ice trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20tribe\"&gt;Drakkari tribe&lt;/a&gt; are massive and more than twice the girth of their &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;southern counterparts&lt;/a&gt;, they stand taller and are much more muscular than most other trolls in general while rivaling the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; in height at around 10' tall. \nA few green-skinned ice trolls have also been observed, but they are very rare, for such cases are matters of pigmentation alone (not plant growth, as with the forest trolls). Ice trolls typically have thick manes of hair, and despite being called ice trolls, they have little to no trouble living in other climates. &lt;a href=\"Frost%20King%20Malakk\"&gt;Frost King Malakk&lt;/a&gt; notably had fur growing on his skin.\nThe ice trolls of the Winterax tribe are unique in that they do not share the bulky physique of their cousins. Instead, they are scrawny, akin to &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, with pale white skin.\nCulture.\nIce troll culture differs depending on the tribe.\nDrakkari culture was circulated around Zul'Drak and its construction. Hunting and farming were common, as the Drakkari had made an intricate aqueduct system that spanned the entire subzone; allowing for the Drakkari to build across it with little issues or worry for food or water. The Drakkari worshiped several loa and faith was heavily focused upon; as many shrines to the different gods were scattered throughout Zul'Drak. At the apex was the temple-city of &lt;a href=\"Gundrak\"&gt;Gundrak&lt;/a&gt;, where the high prophets made offerings and great blessings to the gods. When the Scourge came, the animal loa that were worshiped by the Drakkari were sacrificed, &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Torga\"&gt;Zim'Torga&lt;/a&gt;, the Mother of Prosperity, &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Abwa\"&gt;Zim'Abwa&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Zim%27Rhuk\"&gt;Zim'Rhuk&lt;/a&gt;, the Wise One, were neglected entirely. The entire area was a sprawling temple city, filled with many areas for fortresses, living quarters and temples.\nWinterax society was based around hunting and gathering from the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;. After the avalanche that nearly wiped out the tribe occurred and the tribe was forced to head north, they likely adopted whatever cultural norms were present among the Drakkari. They worshiped the same loa as the Drakkari, as Korrak was blessed by their power before he was defeated in the Amphitheater.\nFrostmane society is geared around their state of guerilla war, with even the whelps and novices of their tribe being enlisted into the battle. &lt;a href=\"Headhunter\"&gt;Headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s, hideskinners, and snowstriders form the core of their warrior force, making up the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;-killer and &lt;a href=\"ranger\"&gt;ranger&lt;/a&gt; type warriors of their armies, and &lt;a href=\"seer\"&gt;seer&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"shadowcaster\"&gt;shadowcaster&lt;/a&gt;s act as their &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt; users and spiritual advisers.\nIn the last great war it was observed that the ice trolls of Northrend also had &lt;a href=\"trapper\"&gt;trapper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Troll%20berserker\"&gt;berserker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"high%20priest\"&gt;high priest&lt;/a&gt;, and warlord type martial units, similar to most other troll military forces, and many of them acted as &lt;a href=\"Mercenary\"&gt;mercenaries&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; in the belief that the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; was their common enemy. Unfortunately, Arthas framed and betrayed the ice troll mercenaries, having his men kill them.\nIce trolls outside of the Drakkari have been observed to live in both igloo-like structures and simple tents. Their igloo structures are skilfully crafted and range widely in design, many being equipped with doors. Ice trolls generally live in small villages, usually located in areas shielded from icy winds. This can be seen with the Icetusk tribe, who live near exclusively out of tents. In all cases, the tribes have &lt;a href=\"dire%20troll\"&gt;dire troll&lt;/a&gt;s; with them being so prevalent that &lt;a href=\"Drakkari%20God-Hulk\"&gt;Drakkari God-Hulk&lt;/a&gt;s were one of the few non-Zandalari forces that patrolled the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nLike other trolls, the ice trolls follow the &lt;a href=\"voodoo\"&gt;voodoo&lt;/a&gt; traditions, with a focus on priestly rather than &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;istic voodoo.\nLocations in World of Warcraft.\nEastern Kingdoms.\nThe Frostmane tribe inhabit &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;, while the Winterax tribe once inhabited &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nNorthrend.\nThe Ice trolls are featured in \"Wrath of The Lich King\". They reside mainly in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Drak\"&gt;Zul'Drak&lt;/a&gt; but can also be found in &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;.\nPandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Frost%20King%20Malakk\"&gt;Frost King Malakk&lt;/a&gt; and his forces can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hekima%20the%20Wise\"&gt;Hekima the Wise&lt;/a&gt; leads the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20in%20the%20Snow\"&gt;Blood in the Snow&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"scenario\"&gt;scenario&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nIce trolls are generally evil and like most trolls, they are fierce protectors of their homes and may attack travelers to gain weapons, materials, clothing and food. They practice cannibalism and sometimes eat their slain enemies raw.\nThe ice trolls of the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane tribe&lt;/a&gt; had been the enemies of the dwarven kingdom since the dwarves invaded the surface of Dun Morogh and took it from the trolls hundreds of years ago. Before this catastrophe befell them, the ice trolls had controlled a small empire in Dun Morogh.\nTheir spellcasters wield voodoo, and their culture is primitive and tribal. Also like other trolls, ice trolls seek to reclaim their lost empire. The &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; have a particular hatred for &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, who they believe drove them out of their lands in ages past. Ice trolls in &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; take advantage of the current chaos there to strike against their ancient enemies. However, ice troll mercenaries and slaves are not unknown; an adventurer who purchases the services of an ice troll mercenary can usually count on him to be a steadfast ally, and some such mercenaries take extended contracts. Ice trolls enjoy killing, and as long as their employers allow them to keep doing so, they serve well. Some ice troll mercenaries and slaves reach &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; through the goblin merchant empire. Ice trolls like to get to grips with their enemies, and most throw themselves into melee combat. Ice troll spellcasters stay behind to cast spells. Some ice troll warlords are charismatic and savvy enough to impose more sophisticated tactics on their warriors."}

It is one of the first two / three Horde targets for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; when the battle starts due to the fact that it quickly allows Horde players to defend &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Garrison\"&gt;Iceblood Garrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Tower\"&gt;Iceblood Tower&lt;/a&gt; or for the Horde to attack the Alliance bases (&lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Outpost\"&gt;Stonehearth Outpost&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Bunker\"&gt;Stonehearth Bunker&lt;/a&gt; particularly).\nLike all Horde owned graveyards, it is protected by 4 &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Guardian\"&gt;Frostwolf Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s at the start of the battle. It takes 4 minutes for the graveyard to finish switching control once the flag is captured. Guards are replaced when the graveyard switches control or after a length of time. \nThe spawning point itself is just northeast of the graveyard flag, on a plateau that overlooks the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Field of Strife&lt;/a&gt;. Often Horde players will go down the side of the steep hill to get to the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Strife\"&gt;Field of Strife&lt;/a&gt;, therefore bypassing the Alliance which must use the path to the west. &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Bowman\"&gt;Frostwolf Bowmen&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Tower\"&gt;Iceblood Tower&lt;/a&gt; overlook this path, providing some defense for the graveyard.\nThe hill that separates the graveyard spawn point and the graveyard flag can be climbed (from where the graveyard flag is) making it an excellent position for ranged players and healers to defend the flag.\nThe graveyard is located just north of the chokepoint between &lt;a href=\"Tower%20Point\"&gt;Tower Point&lt;/a&gt; and the graveyard flag. This chokepoint is key for both the Alliance and Horde forces. For the Horde, this is one of the places that can stall, hold, and prevent the Alliance surging further south. For the Alliance, holding the chokepoint prevents any Horde players from slipping around the Alliance force to capture their own bases."}

There are no archers on the middle platform of the tower \u2013 all the archers are on the top of the tower. If killed, they will respawn after a length of time (if tower is still under horde control). It is possible for an alliance player to bypass and not kill any of &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Bowman\"&gt;Frostwolf Bowmen&lt;/a&gt; and capture the flag due to the design of the 'flag room'.\nThe &lt;a href=\"watch%20tower\"&gt;watch tower&lt;/a&gt; is located very close to &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Graveyard\"&gt;Iceblood Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; (just north west of it) and is passed by nearly all alliance players heading south (due to the chokepoint). Defending horde players can often easily recapture the tower in the early starting stages of the battle; most alliance players bypass the tower to take &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Garrison\"&gt;Iceblood Garrison&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iceblood%20Graveyard\"&gt;Iceblood Graveyard&lt;/a&gt; and as such, it is often only taken by one to two alliance players.

Icecrown is dark and inescapably cold, the mountains and glacier that fill the valleys between them so hardened and desecrated that the ice has gone black with corruption. Walls and gates and massive walkways made of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt; lace the ground and connect the various &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; fortresses and citadels.\nIt's been a place of evil since the first &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; crashed down into the ice and made it the center of Scourge activity, the place from which nearly all blight and undeath ultimately flows. When &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; shattered the &lt;a href=\"Veil\"&gt;Veil&lt;/a&gt; between the realms of the living and the dead, the sky above Icecrown was rent asunder, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; to spill into &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the rift in the sky has closed, and returned to its normal lightning-blasted gray self.\nIcecrown is an anchor that holds &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe name of Icecrown became infamous when &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; hurled the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; back into the mortal world. &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;'s prison slammed into the glacier and created the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, and the impact was seen as far away as the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;. Here, he would begin the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and in the process weaken the world in preparation for the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Within the Frozen Throne, the Lich King experimented with his psychic powers and enslaved the local indigenous life forms. The plague of undeath that came from the Frozen Throne transformed each of them into his undead servants. Thus, using his psychic and necromantic powers, he was able to conquer much of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Lich King remained prisoner here until he was freed by his champion, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, and the two beings merged into one. For years, the new Lich King sat dormant, while storms raged across Northrend and his minions constructed &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; around the Frozen Throne.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, troops of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in approaching the stronghold during a counter-offensive, but in the end were repelled by the Scourge. There were many casualties among the high ranks of the Crusade, including &lt;a href=\"Barean%20Westwind\"&gt;Grand Admiral Barean Westwind&lt;/a&gt;, first &lt;a href=\"Orman%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Captain General Orman of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and first &lt;a href=\"Invar%20One-Arm\"&gt;Chief Assassin Invar One-Arm&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Icecrown, previously ravaged by the tremendous force unleashed when &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; merged into a single being, has been heavily fortified by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Massive walls and ramparts have been erected throughout the region, and &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; bars entry from the bordering &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, while the reconstructed &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; looms overhead. The glacier itself is protected by three gates: , and .\nAftermath.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;' death, Icecrown remained occupied by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces for weeks, while the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; here were relatively quiet for years, thanks to being controlled by &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar Fordragon&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands.\nSeveral years later, &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt;, causing a massive rift to open in the sky of Icecrown linking Azeroth to the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Herald%20Dalora\"&gt;Herald Dalora&lt;/a&gt; arrived here, took control of the Scourge and the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; operating in the area, and raised several Scourge champions slain during the war against the Lich King. The Argent Crusade, Horde, and Alliance banded together once more, defended the Argent Coliseum and killed the undead champions stationed all over Icecrown. With the threat halted, the Alliance and Horde converged on the Frozen Throne and entered the Maw.\nGeography.\nThe entire region that encompasses Icecrown is divided by a series of high walls, each with a gate as its only entrance. The sole way for any kind of force to invade &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; would be to breach these gates in turn. Each gate and its wall is made almost entirely of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;, near indestructible, and manned by massive &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; constructs.\nNotable characters.\nRares.\nRare elite NPCs associated with the achievement.\nIn Warcraft III.\nThe obelisks around the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; were guarded by &lt;a href=\"ice%20revenant\"&gt;ice revenant&lt;/a&gt;s, and were hostile to all comers, including the Scourge. A small group of &lt;a href=\"tuskarr\"&gt;tuskarr&lt;/a&gt; could be found nearby. The area is notably forested, with significant amounts of meltwater.\nA melee map named &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Crown\"&gt;Ice Crown&lt;/a&gt; exists. It uses the Northrend tileset and has the following description: \"These frozen woods are haunted by souls in torment, enslaved by the dark magic of the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nIn the RPG.\nIcecrown Glacier, like the name implies, is a glacier that most likely ran into &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; centuries ago or longer and got stuck. Somewhere beneath this ice is the real northwest corner of the continent. It is not known how far it extends \u2014 possibly it could go all the way to the shoreline or be just beyond the end of &lt;a href=\"Crystalsong%20Forest\"&gt;Crystalsong Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Everything here is not frozen soil or snow-covered forest, it is all ice. Nothing grows and nothing lives here. Only a few &lt;a href=\"penguin\"&gt;penguin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"walrus\"&gt;walrus&lt;/a&gt;es and other arctic &lt;a href=\"sea\"&gt;sea&lt;/a&gt; creatures might use the shore as a resting place but that is about it. What surely does have is a lot of &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. It is the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s domain and he rules from center of his power in &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt;. Travelers learned to avoid the place.\nHistory.\nBefore the Lich King's reign, this region was the capital of &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt; spider kingdom. Then &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; arrived, and he used his magic to draw many dead and dying creatures onto the glacier and into his army. He conquered the nerubians and built his undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nStill, you have to give the Lich King credit. He landed in the coldest part of the coldest continent on Azeroth and figured out a way to get loyal, hardworking servants. Undead don't feel cold nor they need food or drink. They don't breathe and neither get distracted or lazy or bored. It is no wonder he managed to build his citadel in a few years when it would have taken even a &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; team decades. All his servants do exactly what he commands, for as long as he requires.\nThe glacier has seen its share of battle within the past few decades: the Scourge fighting and destroying nerubians, &lt;a href=\"furbolg\"&gt;furbolg&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;Drakkari&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; fighting for the right to open the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;'s chamber. Many consider the glacier the most evil place in all &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. More than one adventurer has sneaked onto Icecrown Glacier, trying to kill the Lich King and destroy the Scourge. None return.\nPeople and culture.\nNothing lives here, but the Lich King and his Scourge are not exactly \"alive\". The glacier teems with undead creatures and it is possible more creatures inhabit this one region than the entire rest of the continent, although that is simple speculation. All of the beings here are undead, which makes it a really awful place to visit.\nGeography.\nDescribing the glacier is easy: ice. That about covers it. Literally. A sheet of ice, several feet thick even at the edges, coats the entire region. A &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20River\"&gt;river cuts down through it&lt;/a&gt;, from the upper corner to &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Wintergrasp\"&gt;Lake Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt; below, and much of that is frozen over as well, at least on the surface. Along the southern edges, a few stunted trees cling to survival but that is where the glacier ends and real soil begins again.\nThe glacier is not flat, though. It has levels, some of them gentle hills and valleys and others abrupt tears and sudden cliffs. The banks of the river drop sharply to the water, too high and steep for anyone caught in the waters to climb back out.\nJust like the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, Icecrown Glacier has only one real settlement. Unlike the Fjord, the glacier has no exceptions. &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; teems with Scourge forces, and undead wander the landscape on missions for their cursed leader.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Located in the frozen wastes of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt; on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, the Citadel rises up from the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;, a cathedral of blades and claws made entirely of &lt;a href=\"saronite\"&gt;saronite&lt;/a&gt;. It is a fortress as big as a city, its halls crawling with the most vile and loyal of the Scourge - a great army of the living dead standing between their dark master and those who once sought to destroy him. The fortress is, itself, layer after protective layer of cursed metal wrapped around the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; that once held the spirit of &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, until he joined with &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; to become the new Lich King.\nThe sole way for any kind of force to invade Icecrown Citadel would be to breach the gates that encompass Icecrown, respectively named ; then ; and last . Each gate and its wall is made almost entirely of saronite, near indestructible, and manned by massive Scourge constructs.\nHistory.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; hurled the Lich King into the mortal world, Ner'zhul's prison of ice, known as the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;, slammed into the icy spire of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Glacier\"&gt;Icecrown Glacier&lt;/a&gt;. As the Lich King expanded his influence, the Scourge and the dreadlords built Icecrown Citadel. &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; wrestled for the control of the citadel. As Illidan was defeated, Arthas shattered Ner'zhul's prison and merged with the Lich King. Death knights like &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; were here, training until the Lich King awoke and commanded his subjects to invade the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the start of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Trag%20Highmountain\"&gt;Trag Highmountain&lt;/a&gt; defended &lt;a href=\"Taunka%27le%20Village\"&gt;Taunka'le Village&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt; from an &lt;a href=\"Anub%27ar\"&gt;Anub'ar&lt;/a&gt; attack. The undead tauren fell into their tunnels and continued through them, emerging in Icecrown, with the Icecrown Citadel looming above him. Fighting his way through the Scourge, he soon entered it and clashed with the Lich King. As he was trying to control him, the Lich King blasted Trag out of the citadel.\nWrath of the Lich King.\n\"Icecrown Citadel dominates Northrend - visible from farther away than nearly any other structure and home to the greatest army of undead in the known world. Inside dwells the Lich King - a tyrant with nearly godlike power over his tireless, seemingly infinite subjects - and the will to bring Azeroth to its knees.\"\n\"An assault on the mighty citadel is among the most dangerous undertakings in the history of Azeroth - and the most pivotal. The legendary heroes Highlord Tirion Fordring of the Argent Crusade and Highlord Darion Mograine have joined forces to lead the charge through Icecrown's fortified gates, and both the Horde and Alliance have sacrificed lives - indeed, whole battalions - to get this far. They dare not fail. The Lich King's reign must end.\"\nIcecrown Citadel is a massive structure located on the Dragonblight-Icecrown border. Its southern entrance, &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt;, is surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Skulls\"&gt;Court of Skulls&lt;/a&gt;, and flanked by &lt;a href=\"Fordragon%20Hold\"&gt;Fordragon Hold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Vanguard\"&gt;Kor'kron Vanguard&lt;/a&gt;. The fortified northern entrance to Icecrown Citadel, surrounded by the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20Bones\"&gt;Court of Bones&lt;/a&gt;, is found in the mountains of southern Icecrown. It is surrounded by gigantic ramparts and massive, blade-like spires, the towers are an imposing landmark of the Icecrown skyline, emitting a beacon of light from its pinnacle.\nDuring the final assault on the Citadel, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; were the ones who breached its gates; they sacrificed much, and without question, to see the Lich King fall.\nLegion.\nSeveral &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s entered the halls of Icecrown in search of mighty weapons to fight the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; with.\nShadowlands.\nDuring the course of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt; brought corpses from across Azeroth to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. They were interred in the frigid storerooms beneath the citadel. When &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; abdicated her command of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, the Lich King began to raise them into undeath as &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Although Bolvar sent the death knights away, he recalled other mindless Scourge toward the citadel.\nAfter the defeat of the Lich King at Sylvanas' hands, as announced by King Terenas years earlier, the now-masterless Scourge began marauding all across Azeroth. Off the heels of yet another brutal war, the forces of Azeroth mounted a counterattack and assaulted the source at the Icecrown Citadel.\nDuring its &lt;a href=\"The%20Jailer%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;encounter&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Sepulcher%20of%20the%20First%20Ones\"&gt;Sepulcher of the First Ones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;Zovaal the Jailer&lt;/a&gt; activated the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Forge of Souls&lt;/a&gt; below Icecrown to draw the life force of the &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28titan%29\"&gt;soul of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; into the Sepulcher so that it could power the &lt;a href=\"Machine%20of%20Origination\"&gt;Machine of Origination&lt;/a&gt;, which he could then use to unmake all of existence. With the death of Zovaal, Azeroth was saved and the rift Sylvanas had created in the sky over Icecrown closed.\nFollowing the death of Zovaal, Darion declared that the death knights' vigil was far from over, as without the &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20Domination\"&gt;Helm of Domination&lt;/a&gt; to control them, the Scourge threatened to spread across the world like the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague that created them&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the Ebon Blade mission was to return to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and keep the Scourge in check, while safeguarding Icecrown Citadel.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; passed by the citadel only briefly, however, this much saronite in one place had &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; looking like he might be sick (despite his body being entirely composed of diamond). They also reported that the fortress is still crawling with undead.\nDevelopment.\nIcecrown Citadel is home to the final encounter in \"Wrath of the Lich King\", featuring the Lich King as the final boss. Although players interact with Arthas numerous times during the expansion, including during an event at &lt;a href=\"Angrathar%20the%20Wrathgate\"&gt;Angrathar the Wrathgate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, the instance where the final battle against him will take place was not formally announced until nearly a year after the release of the expansion. The developers have stated that they feel it was a mistake to release &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;, wherein the &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Illidan encounter&lt;/a&gt; takes place, as soon as they did (a mere four months after the release of \"\"). Their goal for \"Wrath of the Lich King\" was to ensure that Arthas did not become just another farm boss too soon before newer, more challenging content is released.\nIcecrown Citadel received an exterior redesign in &lt;a href=\"patch%203.3.0\"&gt;patch 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;, with the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel%20%28instance%29\"&gt;raid instance&lt;/a&gt; inside; the central spire became much taller and more cylindrical, and a platform of ice was added at the spire's summit (where the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; will be inside the instance).\nIn the RPG.\nFrom the name, one would assume Icecrown Citadel was an enormous fortress planted on the glacier, with thick walls, sturdy guard towers, and massive front gates. Not quite. Most of the Citadel lurks below the surface. The glacier is split, creating a deep fissure. Scourge forces lurk down there, and they have carved levels into either side of that massive split and created bridges, walkways and even solid floors across the gap. Not surprisingly, Icecrown Citadel is a cold, unforgiving place. It has no decorations, no furs or rugs, no fires, nothing to provide comfort or warmth. The Scourge creatures move silently from one problem to another, focused on their tasks. All manner of undead dwell here, including zombies, wraiths and beings composed of cold energy. At the bottom of the rift is the Frozen Throne, the heart of the Scourge and the Lich King's personal seat. This throne is the remains of the block of ice that first brought Ner'zhul to Azeroth, the same block that held him prisoner until Arthas freed the ancient orc shaman and merged with him. Arthas sits on the Frozen Throne.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Such as, you cannot change the difficulty in combat or during certain scripted events. To enable it you will first have to have defeated the Lich King on normal mode, and heroic mode does not affect trash in any way and only changes the bosses.\nAccess progression.\nIcecrown Citadel is split into four sections since release, in the following order: The Lower Spire (the first four bosses), the Plagueworks (the next three), the Crimson Hall (the next two), and Frostwing Halls (the last three). There was a period of some weeks after the opening of the first section before going on into the second. The Lich King may not be fought until Professor Putricide, Blood-Queen Lana'thel and Sindragosa are dead. Any heroic modes may not be attempted until the Lich King has been defeated on normal mode, and you cannot face the Lich King on heroic mode during that week's lockout unless you defeat Putricide, Lana'thel and Sindragosa on heroic mode.\nThe second wing of the Citadel, the &lt;a href=\"Plagueworks\"&gt;Plagueworks&lt;/a&gt;, was opened on US servers on January 5, 2010. The third wing, the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Hall\"&gt;Crimson Hall&lt;/a&gt;, was opened two weeks later, on January 19. The fourth wing was opened with content patch 3.3.2 on February 2, 2010.\nDungeon Denizens.\n&lt;a href=\"Ghostcrawler\"&gt;Ghostcrawler&lt;/a&gt; stated that there would be 31 bosses in the Citadel, but later admitted it was a joke.

The encounter has some fun elements, and most guilds and PuGs manage it easily, therefore it is often referred to as the \"Lootship Battle\".\nAbilities.\nAll NPCs have the same abilities regardless whether they're Alliance or Horde, only their designations change.\nBoarding party.\nAll enemy NPCs except the Commanders and the Battle-Mage/Sorceror gain experience the longer they are left alive, starting from Regular and progressing to Experienced, then Veteran, and finally Elite. Depending on rank, damage and attack speed are increased.\nDue to this progression it's a good idea to kill enemy NPCs quickly.\nStrategy.\nBoth ships deal siege damage to each other. The one going down first loses the battle. Siege damage is dealt to the enemy ship by firing the guns. The enemy gunship deals siege damage to the player's ship by shooting rockets.\nBesides this siege battle, the players have to deal with enemy boarding parties and also need to send an offensive boarding party on the enemy ship from time to time. Additionally, the rocket teams and other enemy ranged damage dealers keep strafing all players. The rockets can be avoided by moving away from their target marks (similar to &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron's&lt;/a&gt; rockets, but less damaging than these), the ranged damage can simply be healed through.\nThe raid should be split up in a (smaller) offensive team which includes enough damage dealers (melee preferred) to man the guns, one tank and an appropriate number of healers (1 in 10 player, 2-3 in 25 player), and a (larger) defensive team including everyone else.\nOnly the offensive team needs the jet packs provided by the engineer NPC on the player's ship, but usually the whole raid finds them interesting enough that everybody takes one. They need to be equipped before entering combat, as they are a clothing item (shirt) and cannot be equipped once in combat. The jump pack is used by 'using' it and selecting a destination to jump to (this is usually practiced intensely before the battle starts).\nDefense.\nThe defensive team is concerned with keeping the player's gunship free of enemy boarding parties and with killing enemy ranged attackers.\nEnemy boarders who don't have players on their aggro list instead attack the player's gunship with burning pitch, which deals very high amounts of siege damage. Therefore, all members of the enemy boarding party must be tanked immediately. Ranged &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; is highly effective. Due to their whirlwind, melee must be careful until all Sergeants are dead.\nA few seconds after all members of the previous boarding party are dead, a new boarding party spawns. It may be a good idea to leave the last member of the boarding party alive for some time, so that the ranged damage-dealers can kill the ranged damage dealers on the enemy ship. Another option is to dedicate some ranged damage-dealers full-time to killing the mobs on the enemy ship.\nOffense.\nThe offensive team consists of melee attackers, a tank, and dedicated healers for that tank.\nThe offensive team fires the guns until they're frozen. This freeze occurs every 45 seconds or so. When the guns are frozen, they cannot fire. They're unfrozen by killing the mage on board of the enemy ship. The offensive team leaves the guns and jumps over to the other ship (the healers can actually stay on the edge of their own ship). The tank needs to keep the enemy commander busy. The enemy commander gains a stacking buff while in combat, thus the offensive party must be quick to kill the mage (depending on tank gear 20\u201330 seconds). After the mage is dead, they jump back and resume firing the guns.\nEven if the boarding party is fast, they should not try to kill a few extra mobs on the enemy ship - it is more efficient to quickly man the guns again.\nThe offensive team must be careful not to leave behind anything which could keep the enemy commander in combat (totems, pets or the like). Back on the player's ship, the offensive team should move away from the enemy ship to make sure the Commander gets out of combat.\nThe ship's guns have two different attacks: a normal shot bound to \"1\" which deals 1000 siege damage. Firing a normal shot also generates between 6 to 10 heat, which fills up the heat gauge on the gun (begins at 0, maximum 100, losing 1-2 heat per second while not firing). The second shot is bound to \"2\". It's a heated shot which immediately expels all the accumulated heat on the gun and deals 1000 siege damage plus extra damage for each unit of heat, up to just under 10000 with a nearly filled bar. If the heat meter reaches or exceeds 100, the gun overheats and both shots are locked for five seconds until all heat has been drained. \nBoth types of shot not only deal siege damage but also damage enemy mobs, thus shots should be angled at the rocketeers/ranged NPCs.\nThe siege damage to the player's ship is mainly dealt by the rocketeers. So disrupting them and not allowing them to gain high levels of experience significantly reduces the damage done to the player's ship. This is most effectively done by the gunners shooting at the rocketeers.\nAlternate.\nKeep everything this same, except for the Offensive squad. If the tank and his/her healer can hold the boarding party long enough, all of the DPS can jump to the far boat to down the enemy mage faster, resulting in a faster battle and more time to DPS the enemy boat down. Make sure the tank and healer can handle the mobs long enough for your raid to get over there and back without dying. Try kiting them over to the leader to have him assist if needed.\nSolo strategy.\nThe hardest part of the fight is keeping the ship alive long enough to do enough damage to the opposing ship. There are three sources of damage to the player's ship:\nThe burning pitch is what does the most damage, so any units that can cast burning pitch cannot be left alive while the player is either inside a cannon or on the opposing ship, killing the mage.\nAs of Patch 6.0.2, the damage dealt by your ship's cannon scales with your item level. At level 90+, the enemy ship can be easily destroyed in seconds, before the enemy adds even have a chance to attack.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Ranged classes and healers should spread out, so that they avoid being hit by Arctic Breath. Melee DPS should place themselves at maximum melee range or between Icehowl and the wall so that they avoid the knock back effect of Whirl. The Tank should keep his back against the wall, and is able to avoid most of the knockback by standing in the \"Corner\" formed by a wall pillar in the wall. Whirl will be almost immediately followed by arctic breath, so this positioning is key for melee classes to be effective in this fight.\nAfter a while, Icehowl will go to the middle and use Massive Crash, throwing everyone to the wall, then Icehowl will emote, glaring at a random enemy, and run to the opposite side of him, preparing to use Ferocious Butt. The whole raid gains a 50% movement buff(Surge of Adrenaline)(In normal mode only), and everyone near the spot of Icehowl's target should move away. If Massive Crash doesn't hit anyone, then Icehowl crashes on Coliseum's wall, and gets a debuff that stuns him for 15 secs, increasing damage taken by 100%. If it does hit someone, a hunter should use &lt;a href=\"tranquilizing%20Shot\"&gt;tranquilizing Shot&lt;/a&gt; immediately to remove the rage effect.\nAfter stun, tank should pick him up and repeat.\nLoot.\n\"For loot, see &lt;a href=\"Beasts%20of%20Northrend\"&gt;Beasts of Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

At some point, Icemist Village became the &lt;a href=\"capital\"&gt;capital&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt;, with it also being referred to as the greatest of the taunka villages, decorated with the tusks and skulls of mammoths.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt some point during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Pit%20of%20Narjun\"&gt;fissure&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Azjol-Nerub\"&gt;Azjol-Nerub&lt;/a&gt; opened nearby, and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"nerubian\"&gt;nerubian&lt;/a&gt;s poured out. The &lt;a href=\"Anub%27ar\"&gt;Anub'ar&lt;/a&gt; then assaulted and ultimately razed the &lt;a href=\"taunka\"&gt;taunka&lt;/a&gt; village of Icemist. During the fall of Icemist the Anub'ar killed most of the taunka and captured their High Chieftain &lt;a href=\"Roanauk%20Icemist\"&gt;Roanauk Icemist&lt;/a&gt;, then they bound him in magical chains in the middle of Icemist Village.\nAfter the taunka formally joined the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, they prepared to strike back against the Anub'ar in order to take back Icemist and free High Chieftain Icemist. While the Horde attacked the Anub'ar by ground and sky to thin their numbers, &lt;a href=\"Banthok%20Icemist\"&gt;Banthok Icemist&lt;/a&gt; sent off to the village determined to rescue his father. After acquiring the key, the pair free the imprisoned High Chieftain, and quickly came under attack by &lt;a href=\"Under-King%20Anub%27et%27kan\"&gt;Under-King Anub'et'kan&lt;/a&gt;. The trio and the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s were ultimately successfully and killed Anub'et'kan, before retreating to &lt;a href=\"Agmar%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Agmar's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; reported that despite the victory against Anub'et'kan, Icemist was still abandoned; overtaken by the Scourge, and fouled with nerubian webs.\nIn the RPG.\nA pack of &lt;a href=\"Icemist%20tauren\"&gt;Icemist tauren&lt;/a&gt; settled on the western edge of the &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, on the shores of &lt;a href=\"Lake%20Wintergrasp\"&gt;Lake Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;. The only &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; settlement in the region, Icemist Village, is a pleasant enough town, surprisingly so given its setting, and the tauren there are friendly and helpful. Most travelers in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; stop there when passing in this direction, so you can always find someone with whom to trade or share information over a drink.\nThe tauren keep a ready supply of food, drink, clothes and basic tools, and sell them to anyone in need. They even give things away, if people are desperate, and some people has seen them drag in travelers they found collapsed on the lake or in the surrounding area. The tauren don't venture into the blight proper very often, preferring the clean cold of the lake to this bitter air of doom and death. &lt;a href=\"Tundra%20Coldhoof\"&gt;Tundra Coldhoof&lt;/a&gt; oversees the village and she is a gentle soul who welcomes travelers to Icemist Village as they arrive, making sure the wounded and weary receive whatever care is necessary."}
