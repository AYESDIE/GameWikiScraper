They were made up of many of the former &lt;a href=\"Blessing\"&gt;Blessing&lt;/a&gt; spells. Many of the Hand spells were Blessings that acted as a short-term utility rather than standard raid buff, including the former &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Blessing of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Blessing of Protection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Blessing of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; spells. In addition, &lt;a href=\"Blessing%20of%20Salvation\"&gt;Blessing of Salvation&lt;/a&gt; was converted into a hand spell from a long term Blessing. These spells were from then on known as &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Freedom\"&gt;Hand of Freedom&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Protection\"&gt;Hand of Protection&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Hand of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Salvation\"&gt;Hand of Salvation&lt;/a&gt;.\nAvailable hands.\nThere are numerous hands available to Paladins. The available hands are as follows:\nImproving hands with talents.\nAll Hands (except Hand of Purity) could be improved with &lt;a href=\"Clemency\"&gt;Clemency&lt;/a&gt;. Clemency gave each of these Hand spells two \"charges\", that could be used in quick succession. However these \"charges\" were not on independent or parallel cooldowns, but cooldown sequentially."}

Before the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, they were mostly present and active in &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;, where the greatest of the Exodar's crash corruption on the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt; had taken hold. They are considered elite among the draenei.\nThe Hand of Argus is led by the &lt;a href=\"Triumvirate%20of%20the%20Hand\"&gt;Triumvirate of the Hand&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Vindicators &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Boros&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Kuros\"&gt;Kuros&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Aesom\"&gt;Aesom&lt;/a&gt;.

However, despite remaining mostly on Bloodmyst Isle, the Hand's agents have been seen fighting their enemies in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt;, and on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; alongside their allies of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nCrash on Azeroth.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, Prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; discovered the power of &lt;a href=\"Tempest%20Keep\"&gt;Tempest Keep&lt;/a&gt; and successfully seized it. To escape, the draenei and members of the Hand of Argus came out of hiding and managed to wrestle control of a wing of the keep, the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\", and tried to use it to flee and find aid in retaking their home. Before they could, however, the blood elves managed to sabotage what is essentially the \"engine\" of the draenei's &lt;a href=\"Dimensional%20Ship\"&gt;transdimensional travel&lt;/a&gt;. A month later, the \"Exodar\" crash-landed on a chain of islands, the &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isles\"&gt;Azuremyst Isles&lt;/a&gt;, off the western coast of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. As the surviving draenei salvaged what they could of their ship and tried to help what was left of their people, they began exploring this new world.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt some point, the Hand of Argus created two forward outposts in their new home: &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Watch\"&gt;Azure Watch&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Bloodmyst%20Isle\"&gt;Bloodmyst Isle&lt;/a&gt;. A sub-group named the &lt;a href=\"Defenders%20of%20Blood%20Watch\"&gt;Defenders of Blood Watch&lt;/a&gt; was also formed to protect Blood Watch from any threat under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Knight-Defender%20Zunade\"&gt;Knight-Defender Zunade&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen it was discovered that &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, known as the &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, had followed the draenei to Azeroth to murder them, enslave &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, and steal the \"Exodar\", further investigations led the Hand of Argus to found that the traitor &lt;a href=\"eredar\"&gt;eredar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sironas\"&gt;Sironas&lt;/a&gt; has been leading a group called the &lt;a href=\"Sunhawk\"&gt;Sunhawk&lt;/a&gt;s in abducting draenei survivors. Among those they tortured, until they willingly desired to become man'ari eredar, was the former second-in-command of the Hand of Argus, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Saruan\"&gt;Vindicator Saruan&lt;/a&gt;, who died because of the mistreatment of &lt;a href=\"Matis%20the%20Cruel\"&gt;Matis the Cruel&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn the orders of &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Kuros\"&gt;Vindicator Kuros&lt;/a&gt;, Matis was hunted down and captured by his trackers so that the Triumvirate could judge him for his crimes. After contemplating the direness of the situation, &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; ordered &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Boros\"&gt;Vindicator Boros&lt;/a&gt; to organize the military campaign so that they may end the blood elven menace once and for all. The Hand of Argus spearheaded the campaign, and with the help of Alliance adventurers, they destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Gate\"&gt;Sun Gate&lt;/a&gt;s and defeated Sironas; which consequently prevented Kael'thas from invading &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and corrupting the draenei into &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, a few members of the Hand of Argus came to protect the town of &lt;a href=\"Halaa\"&gt;Halaa&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Nagrand\"&gt;Nagrand&lt;/a&gt; when it was under the control of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Captured%20Halaani%20Vindicator\"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; were captured and imprisoned in the &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt; village known as &lt;a href=\"Garadar\"&gt;Garadar&lt;/a&gt;. Following a skirmish around Halaa, &lt;a href=\"Interrogator%20Khan\"&gt;Interrogator Khan&lt;/a&gt; was in charge of discovering what interests the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20Knights\"&gt;Blood Knights&lt;/a&gt; had in the region and the &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun%20Crystal%20Powder\"&gt;Oshu'gun Crystal Powder&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nA &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; delegation under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Vurenn\"&gt;Harbinger Vurenn&lt;/a&gt; was sent to &lt;a href=\"Valiance%20Keep\"&gt;Valiance Keep&lt;/a&gt; in order to coordinate the draenei involvement in the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. However, both &lt;a href=\"Counselor%20Talbot\"&gt;Counselor Talbot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Arlos\"&gt;General Arlos&lt;/a&gt; were reluctant to accept the help and the general decided to make use of the delegation in an advisory role, preventing the arrival of draenei battalions.\nAfter &lt;a href=\"Harbinger%20Vurenn\"&gt;Vurenn&lt;/a&gt;'s suspicions on the measures against the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; presence in the keep, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Yaala\"&gt;Vindicator Yaala&lt;/a&gt; conducted a secret investigation that lead to the defeat of the cultists. However, she felt that it wouldn't be the last time the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; would see the cultist, stating that \"&lt;a href=\"Last%20Rites\"&gt;\"darkness has a way of hiding in plain light\"&lt;/a&gt;\".\nProphet's Lesson.\nWith &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; in deep contemplation on the eve of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the Hand of Argus' leaders returned to the \"Exodar\" in an effort to reconnect with their brethren on Azeroth, and convened to discuss their people's future on Azeroth in light of the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\"'s repair. &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; came before them, and was outspoken with his opinion: that the draenei should leave to rebuild their second home on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and assist the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20One\"&gt;Lost One&lt;/a&gt;s remaining behind. The Triumvirate agreed, and it was decided that unless Velen ordered otherwise, within a week the \"Exodar\" would take flight for old Draenor.\nTensions were raised by the presence of Alliance refugees from across the ocean, who had come to Azuremyst to seek Velen - whom they saw as a mighty deity - and the draenei's protection. However, violence broke out when the increasingly paranoid refugees began slurring the vindicators as \"demons\" and became belligerent. Unsurprisingly, the battle was one-sided in the angered vindicators' favor, leaving the humans broken and dispersed.\nFollowing the conflict, Velen himself emerged to quell the unrest, and peace was restored. Some of the vindicators were ashamed of having been riled to anger; but others, such as Maraad, were unmoved, feeling justified in their response. It was decided that the draenei would remain on Azeroth to combat the incoming threat.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baatun\"&gt;Vindicator Baatun&lt;/a&gt; met new promising vindicators of the Hand of Argus in the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\" and sent them to meet &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, one of the foremost paladins in the realm at the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Light\"&gt;Cathedral of Light&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, after the latter was impressed with their rapid progress.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Vedaar\"&gt;Vindicator Vedaar&lt;/a&gt; destroyed the remaining forces of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; in the areas known as &lt;a href=\"Felfire%20Hill\"&gt;Felfire Hill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Canyon\"&gt;Demon Fall Canyon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Fall%20Ridge\"&gt;Demon Fall Ridge&lt;/a&gt;, preventing in the process a planned demonic attack against the draenei settlement of &lt;a href=\"Forest%20Song\"&gt;Forest Song&lt;/a&gt; by killing the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Diathorus%20the%20Seeker\"&gt;Diathorus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gorgannon\"&gt;Gorgannon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Draenei%20Paladin\"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; members of the order could also be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Krom%27gar\"&gt;Overlord Krom'gar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"General%20Grebo\"&gt;General Grebo&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Iron%20Horde\"&gt;war against the Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;, members of the Hand of Argus joined the ranks of the Alliance forces in . &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt; notably managed to convince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to sign the declaration of war on the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;. He led the forces of the Alliance against the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, and later, on Draenor itself.\nIn , the presence of the corpse of &lt;a href=\"Arbiter%20Khan\"&gt;Arbiter Khan&lt;/a&gt;, affiliated with the Hand of Argus, indicates that the order also existed on the alternate Draenor.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the Triumvirate led the Hand of Argus to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, beneath &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, in order to pay their respects to the fallen &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Vindicator Boros stepped forward and pledged his order's support to the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Subsequently, many vindicators and members of the Hand joined the reformed Silver Hand, and some of them could be found training new paladins in the &lt;a href=\"Armory%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Armory of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Assault on Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, who came to retrieve Tirion's body and make him the last member of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, a few &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Purifier\"&gt;Argus Purifier&lt;/a&gt;s fought alongside the Silver Hand forces to repel the undead invaders. While they were defeated, the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; itself intervened and burned the surrounded death knights, forcing them to flee and granting victory to the paladins.\nSeveral units of the Hand defended the \"Exodar\" during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the draenei capital. Some of them also appeared at &lt;a href=\"Deliverance%20Point\"&gt;Deliverance Point&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, where they occasionally trained with &lt;a href=\"Stormforged%20Valarjar\"&gt;Stormforged Valarjar&lt;/a&gt;, blessed people with the &lt;a href=\"%3ABlessing%20of%20Kings\"&gt;:Blessing of Kings&lt;/a&gt;, and healed wounded paladins.\nOn &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lightsworn%20Anchorite\"&gt;Lightsworn Anchorite&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"High%20Vindicator\"&gt;High Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s of the Hand were present among the Azerothian forces, they were notably in the \"&lt;a href=\"Vindicaar\"&gt;Vindicaar&lt;/a&gt;\" and on all the battlefields of the campaign.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;end of the invasion&lt;/a&gt;, it is unknown if the Hand of Argus remained affiliated or not with the Silver Hand, although draenei are still present and active in their ranks.\nShadowlands.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baatun\"&gt;Vindicator Baatun&lt;/a&gt; still met new promising vindicators of the Hand of Argus in the \"&lt;a href=\"Exodar\"&gt;Exodar&lt;/a&gt;\". He then sent them to meet &lt;a href=\"Ezul%27aan\"&gt;Ezul'aan&lt;/a&gt;, one of the foremost paladins in the realm at the &lt;a href=\"Training%20Hall\"&gt;Training Hall&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after the latter was impressed with their rapid progress.\nCulture.\nThe members of the Hand of Argus defer to the Triumvirate of the Hand in subtle ways, their obedience derived from a pyramid of authority that tolerated no ego at either its top or its base.\nLike the draenei society, the order is centered around the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light of Creation&lt;/a&gt;. They were introduced to the Light by the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; while sailing across the cosmos aboard &lt;a href=\"Oshu%27gun\"&gt;Oshu'gun&lt;/a&gt;, fleeing from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; that consumed their original home, &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;. The enigmatic holy beings taught them the ways of the Light, and deeply affected by the naaru's words, the draenei vowed to honor the Light and uphold the naaru's altruistic ideals. They serve the Light unquestioningly.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Naaru\"&gt;Hammer of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt; is a Light-blessed crystalline weapon, which is used by many paladins and vindicators in the Hand of Argus.\nThose interested in joining the organization must be trained in the ways of the draenei soldier by superiors and subordinates of the organization. In order to prove their worth and abilities, the disciples must pass many difficult tests, as a member of the order is many things: Obedient, brave, intelligent, and above all, honorable. Becoming a member of the Hand of Argus is a process of rebirth, and with birth comes pain, as heavy-handed violence is not the draenei way, but sometimes it is the only way. According to &lt;a href=\"Kessel\"&gt;Kessel&lt;/a&gt;, \"Honorable people do not always perform honorably. Sometimes they cannot\".\nIn their ranks, the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s have the mission of tracking down and eliminating the organization's targets, or capturing them to bring them to justice.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Vindicator%20Maraad\"&gt;Vindicator Maraad&lt;/a&gt;, unlike the verbal games and unpredictable reactions of the other races of the Alliance, the discourse in the organization is ordered and measured, somehow comforting in its reasonable ebb and flow.\nThe order does not mistreat or beat their prisoners, even during interrogation. However, they can call on the &lt;a href=\"Broken\"&gt;Broken&lt;/a&gt;, as these latter have no issues with violence.\nNotable members.\n\"The members of the Triumvirate of the Hand are the leaders of the Hand of Argus.\""}

{"id": "29333", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=29333", "title": "End-game", "text": "The end-game refers to the part of the game where &lt;a href=\"character\"&gt;character&lt;/a&gt;s have reached the &lt;a href=\"level%20cap\"&gt;level cap&lt;/a&gt; and are no longer focused upon &lt;a href=\"level\"&gt;level&lt;/a&gt;ing. While play prior to this point is oriented around accumulating experience and gaining new skills, the end-game represents the polished 'final destination' for players, at which characters are fully developed and ready to tackle the biggest challenges in the game. In the opinion of many players, the 'real' game begins at end-game.\nThe end is just the beginning.\nSince leveling is an inherently finite process, all progressive characters will in time reach the end-game. The end-game therefore bears the weight of providing ongoing entertainment and challenges for players once their characters have reached max-level. In contrast to other uses of the term, in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" 'end-game' does not refer to the end of the game, but rather the culmination of the leveling process, and the beginning of what to many players are the game's main attractions.\nWhile the game below max-level is an inherently uneven process of expansion and development, inevitably featuring imbalanced and unfinished class design, the end-game represents the finished model of gameplay. Characters have learned all abilities and talents, and are fairly well-balanced against other classes in their strengths and abilities. This affects not only &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; but also &lt;a href=\"PvE\"&gt;PvE&lt;/a&gt;, where performance can be expected to be more even for all classes. Developer models for gameplay and class balance are designed for end-game play, with class rotations, talents and synergies often incomplete until max-level is reached.\nIn contrast to the experience-oriented leveling process, the end-game provides instead a range of goals including acquiring equipment, improving reputation, earning achievements and tackling the biggest challenges in the game. While during leveling gear is quickly discarded in exchange for more powerful new items, the rewards gained at end-game are generally more significant, with players able to accumulate formidable gear which will remain useful for some time.\nActivities.\nFollowing the relatively linear and single-minded nature of the leveling experience, the end-game offers an expansive range of activities for the player to engage in. In contrast to the rapid progression of players through the leveling experience, the end-game is intended to hold players' attention for a substantial time, and consequently features more worthwhile and enduring rewards, as well as many types of play unavailable to players at lower levels.\nNote that 'end-game' can refer to both the type of play found at max-level, and the content originally designed for it. As the game has expanded and the level cap increased, much previous end-game content has become a side-show to the leveling process. While the main consequence of this is that much of that content is now passed-by, it also means that some features such as &lt;a href=\"Arena\"&gt;Arena&lt;/a&gt; that were once limited to the end-game are now available to players during the leveling process. Nonetheless, player participation in this content is very low in comparison to that of current end-game content, and the lack of relevant rewards also makes this type of play different to that of the current end-game.\nPlay at end-game involves most kinds of play found during the leveling process, as well as some types found only at max-level, including:"}

This first instance building up to the fight with the Worldbreaker takes adventurers into one of the many possible futures of Azeroth, revealing what will transpire if Deathwing is not stopped: the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; tried to ensure the End Time would come to be because he believed that this potential future where the Hour of Twilight successfully happens would still make for a much better future than the \"true End Time\" that he had witnessed.\nStoryline.\nThe Dragon Aspects that occupy &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; have a problem: They know that if they cannot destroy their fallen brother &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, he'll consume the world. There\u2019s only one artifact with the power to weaken the Black Scourge, but it has long since been destroyed: the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. To retrieve the golden disk the Aspects must charge the heroes of Azeroth with its retrieval from the depths of time. Deathwing first unleashed the power of the Dragon Soul to stop &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; from entering Azeroth through the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. That means sending players to the Caverns of Time and Nozdormu. Upon arriving, the Aspect of Time will tell them that his ability to send them back to the battle at the Well of Eternity is being interfered with by an entity in the future. First then, players must go forward into the End Time and kill &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;.

You'll find yourself in a very different &lt;a href=\"Dragonblight\"&gt;Dragonblight&lt;/a&gt;, stripped of its snowy landscape, with little more than ruins of the once-great &lt;a href=\"dragonshrine\"&gt;dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt; itself stands only as a reminder of Deathwing's madness\u2014what's left of his scorched remains is impaled atop the structure.\n\"Before you confront the creature disrupting Nozdormu's access to the past, you'll first be called to fight any two of the following four ostensibly familiar leaders, chosen at random each time you play through End Time.\"\n\"These long-dead heroes are mere echoes of their former glory, further warped by the corruptive force of time. Their presence here is a great mystery, even to Nozdormu. Once these shades have been laid to rest, the maniacal figure blocking Nozdormu's vision will be revealed at the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;. None of the Dragon Aspects could have predicted what entity would have such power to interrupt the sight of the Timeless One\u2026 the ability to create a new and infinite dragonflight.

They have been tasked with killing the druid, but I need you to stop the ritual.\nYou'll find the entrance to the cavern east of the &lt;a href=\"Magma%20Springs\"&gt;Magma Springs&lt;/a&gt;. Once inside, you'll see 8 blue runes spread throughout the cavern. You can use these runes to protect you from the fiery creatures, but you need to stamp all of them out to end the ritual. You will need to be swift.\nRewards.\nYou will receive: \nProgress.\nYou must destroy the runes! Hurry!\nCompletion.\nWell done!\nThey've been attempting to start rituals of this sort all over the Molten Front, but we've been able to thwart them every time so far.

The entrance to the depths can be found at , where &lt;a href=\"Theresa%20Barkskin\"&gt;Theresa Barkskin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shalis%20Darkhunter\"&gt;Shalis Darkhunter&lt;/a&gt; are waiting near the corpse of a &lt;a href=\"Devout%20Flamecaller\"&gt;Devout Flamecaller&lt;/a&gt;.\nRun into the cave and start looking for blue runes on the ground. However, Unstable Flameragers are constantly spawning, aggroed upon whomever is foolish enough to be running around inside the cave. They run fairly slowly, but if they catch up, they will hit for 5000-5700 Fire a swing. Additionally, fireballs are getting launched from the lava pools. Anyone standing in their shadow when they land will take ~13000 Fire.\nThere are eight runes. Triggering a rune will kill every flamerager aggroed upon the player within 50 yards or so, but will not kill all flameragers currently active.\nTwo runes are relatively out of the way. One is just to the left of the entrance at the northern tip of the cave and can be accessed by either jumping up the wall or running to it from the northeast side of the cave. The other one is at the southern end of the cave. At the southeast end of the main path is a thermal vent. Jump while standing in it and it will launch players toward the southern island with the isolated rune. Another thermal vent can be found at the other end of the island to launch back to the main path.\nOnce the eighth rune is destroyed, the flameragers will stop spawning, so run back to the entrance in peace. Shalis Darkhunter offers the next quest, &lt;a href=\"Strike%20at%20the%20Heart%20%28Shadow%20Wardens%29\"&gt;Strike at the Heart (Shadow Wardens)&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn complete:"}

Energy regenerates at a fixed rate of 1 energy every decisecond (i.e. every one tenth of a second), in and out of combat, and is under most circumstances capped at 100. This makes energy a very fast-regenerating and fast-depletable resource. Certain energy-using rotations may benefit from &lt;a href=\"resource%20pooling\"&gt;energy pooling&lt;/a&gt; to maximize efficiency. Many abilities using Energy have a fixed &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;Cooldown#Global cooldown&lt;/a&gt; (GCD) of 1.0 seconds that is not affected by haste.\nPool size, regeneration rate and energy restoration.\nThe size of the energy pool and the regeneration rate are both constant - they do not increase with levels, but certain talents and abilities can affect energy regen and maximum energy. In addition, some talents, abilities, items and equipment effects can restore lost energy or allow free usage of abilities that would otherwise require energy. Haste also increases energy regeneration rate, but its effects are negligible unless your character stacks a considerable amount of Haste (regen rate increases by roughly 1 energy per second for every 10% Haste)."}

He was eventually raised into undeath and took his father's place as leader of the Scourge remnants in Stratholme.\nHe is perhaps most well known among the player base for dropping &lt;a href=\"Deathcharger%27s%20Reins\"&gt;Deathcharger's Reins&lt;/a&gt;, an epic &lt;a href=\"skeletal%20horse\"&gt;skeletal horse&lt;/a&gt; mount.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Aurius's fall from grace was precipitous. Failing to exact retribution from his corrupted father, Baron Rivendare, the former paladin was not granted peace in death. He was tragically reforged into an instrument of the Scourge, the evil he had once sworn to defeat.\"\nStrategy.\nThe Aurius Rivendare fight presents two major challenges. First, Unholy Aura \"(Automatically inflicting 100 Shadow damage every 2 sec, to nearby enemies.)\", his damage aura, which applies shadow damage to everyone in range. Second, he periodically spawns waves of skeletons from the bone piles scattered around his room. If these skeletons survive long enough, he casts Death Pact on them, killing them but healing himself.\nTo deal with the shadow aura, have your tank position Aurius against one wall of the chamber. Have your healers and ranged damage dealers stand on the opposite wall. This will allow them to stay out of range of the aura, avoiding the damage and casting interruptions. The tank and melee damage dealers will have to absorb the aura's damage. A &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; can buff the group with &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt;. If the tank has any kind of shadow resistance gear, it's not a bad idea to equip it, although not absolutely required to defeat Aurius.\nThe skeletons will almost always immediately aggro your healer. One of the easiest ways to deal with this is to have a class with high &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; damage, like a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; in the group, and position them right next to the healer. They can then AoE the skeletons, which have moderate damage but very low hit points, as they rush towards the healer.\nIf you don't have a mage or a warlock in the group, there are other ways to deal with the skeletons. A &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt; talent can kill the skeletons and keep the ranged party members healed at the same time, but this is very mana intensive, and he might need that mana to heal through Aurius' damage. A &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; can use &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Wrath\"&gt;Holy Wrath&lt;/a&gt; as well, which will normally kill all the skeletons and hurt Aurius somewhat.\nYou can also try having members of your party use the that can be gathered throughout the instance. One bottle is generally enough for each wave of skeletons.\nOwners of &lt;a href=\"pet\"&gt;pet&lt;/a&gt;s must note to have their pets in passive mode as they enter the chamber, as their response to the shadow aura damage will likely trigger the encounter before the party is ready.\nQuotes.\nAfter Ramstein the Gorger dies, a mass of &lt;a href=\"Mindless%20Undead\"&gt;Mindless Undead&lt;/a&gt; attack from the north.

He had a bargain with &lt;a href=\"Assistant%20Phineas\"&gt;Phineas&lt;/a&gt;, who delivered him the warlocks, but eventually the dreadlord killed him for his servitude. After obtaining some of the souls, the adventurer revealed the true identity of Madam Shadow, and the nathrezim retreated to the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, where the adventurer and &lt;a href=\"Initiate%20Oman\"&gt;Initiate Oman&lt;/a&gt; defeated Banehollow, with his last words being that he'll be back.\nIn the RPG.\nLord Banehollow, something of a demonic politician (and thus beyond even a normal concept of evil), serves as the emissary between the Burning Legion's remaining leaders and the Shadow Council in Shadow Hold in Felwood.

He is found in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nHe was one of the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt;, a vicious group of brigands led by former lords of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; bent on regaining their old territory and taking revenge on their enemies. Falconcrest is rarely seen without his servant and bodyguard &lt;a href=\"Otto\"&gt;Otto&lt;/a&gt; by his side. He is currently marked for death by the &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Militia\"&gt;Stromgarde Militia&lt;/a&gt; for his crimes.\nLegion.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Stromgarde is contested between &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; army and the &lt;a href=\"Witherbark%20tribe\"&gt;Witherbark tribe&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s. With no signs of Falconcrest or the Syndicate, he was likely killed.\nIn the RPG.\nIn Dark Factions.\nLord Falconcrest is the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; based in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. He often dresses as a &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;, but his noble bearing betrays his origins. Falconcrest is in his thirties.\nBiography.\nThough noble born, Falconcrest was but a boy when his family was deposed. Thus, he is more familiar with the ways of a &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt; than a courtier. Falconcrest does not trust &lt;a href=\"Aliden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aliden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt; (expecting him to be as duplicitous as &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;his father&lt;/a&gt;), yet respects him for his deviousness. The plan to take &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; lands worked better than he expected, and Falconcrest jumped at the opportunity to lead the Syndicate faction in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Most nobles there serve him.\nFar from Perenolde's control, Falconcrest slowly grooms the rogues under him to work against Perenolde and the northern Syndicate, although he knows he must move slowly and methodically to make sure his forces are strong enough before he strikes. Falconcrest is younger than Perenolde and is prepared to bide his time until he is ready.\nIn Lands of Conflict.\nLord Falconcrest is a mysterious man who commands the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. He is only in his forties, has red hair, white skin and light blue eyes and dresses in flowing, light garments to keep the sun from burning his sensitive skin.\nBiography.\nLord Falconcrest was one of the many lesser nobles under &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Lord Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;. He never liked the older man, but he admitted that Perenolde had a good idea from time to time, and thought it was a fine idea to work with the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. After they were exiled, he believed the &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; should be under his control as he blamed Perenolde for the loss of their holdings. He thinks he would have been able to get lesser sentences from the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; instead of exile to the wild to fend for themselves like peasants. He does admit that their plans to take &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; lands have worked better than expected, and grabbed the opportunity to lead the Syndicate faction in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. Most nobles there serve him.\nFar enough away from Perenolde's control, Falconcrest is slowly grooming the rogues under him to work against Perenolde and the northern Syndicate, although he knows he must move slowly and methodically to make sure his forces are strong enough before he makes the schism. He is younger than Perenolde and is prepared to bide his time until he is ready. "}

During the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, he joined the ranks of the reformed Order of the Silver Hand, and pledged his allegiance to its new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord&lt;/a&gt;. As the Mission specialist and member of the order's war council, he was in charge of the overall coordination and organization of the Silver Hand's activities in their headquarters and on the battlefields against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLord Grayson Shadowbreaker is present at the Cathedral of Light where he met new promising paladins and sends them on missions to &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, to assist &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Ashlam%20Valorfist\"&gt;Commander Ashlam Valorfist&lt;/a&gt; against the endless undead of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; present in the region.\nWhen the time comes for a paladin to obtain his &lt;a href=\"charger\"&gt;charger&lt;/a&gt;, they are redirected towards Lord Shadowbreaker to be guided through the many trials that will follow, and to test if they are worthy.\nAt first, he sent the paladin adventurer to meet &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Rohan\"&gt;High Priest Rohan&lt;/a&gt; and get his &lt;a href=\"Exorcism%20Censer\"&gt;Exorcism Censer&lt;/a&gt; by sacrificing a large amount of gold to support their cause in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and help the poorest among the dwarf people. Subsequently, he sent them with the censer to drive out the evil spirits that tormented &lt;a href=\"Terrordale\"&gt;Terrordale&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, in order to judge them with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nNow in possession of the exorcism censer, and after having proven themselves with it, Grayson explained to the paladin adventurer that a charger is nothing without proper barding for it, and that it is necessary that the barding was created from the best possible materials and be sufficiently in harmony with the spirit realm. So he sent them to &lt;a href=\"Grimand%20Elmore\"&gt;Grimand Elmore&lt;/a&gt;, who made him his first barding when he went for his own charger, so that they can bring him the materials to creating their &lt;a href=\"Arcanite%20Barding\"&gt;Arcanite Barding&lt;/a&gt;.\nFor the next step, the master paladin sent them to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;, in order to eliminate the corrupt treant &lt;a href=\"Tendris%20Warpwood\"&gt;Tendris Warpwood&lt;/a&gt; and save the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Equine%20Spirit\"&gt;Ancient Equine Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, to then feed him with &lt;a href=\"Manna-Enriched%20Horse%20Feed\"&gt;Manna-Enriched Horse Feed&lt;/a&gt;, created and provided by &lt;a href=\"Merideth%20Carlson\"&gt;Merideth Carlson&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;, and get its special blessing on the barding.\nFor the last step, he ordered the paladin adventurer to obtain &lt;a href=\"Azerothian%20Diamond\"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Pristine%20Black%20Diamond\"&gt;diamonds&lt;/a&gt; and assemble them with the censer to create a &lt;a href=\"Divination%20Scryer\"&gt;Divination Scryer&lt;/a&gt;. Then he sent them in the depths of the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Ossuary\"&gt;Great Ossuary&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knight%20Darkreaver\"&gt;Death Knight Darkreaver&lt;/a&gt;, saving its &lt;a href=\"Darkreaver%27s%20Fallen%20Charger\"&gt;charger&lt;/a&gt; from the torment of its servitude by holding the &lt;a href=\"Charger%27s%20Redeemed%20Soul\"&gt;Charger's Redeemed Soul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Blessed%20Arcanite%20Barding\"&gt;Blessed Arcanite Barding&lt;/a&gt;, which bound it as the charger of the paladin.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nGrayson took part in a grand ceremony for the fallen Alliance members who died in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, where two night elf Sentinels arrived to tell &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; what had happened to their fellow night elves in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;. At the request of the King, the paladin went to get food and drink for the women, an attitude described by &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; as that of a paladin for whom any service, as modest as it is, was born from the Light as long as it helped others.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker still took care of sending promising paladins on missions. To honor the dedication of a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;hero&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; commissioned the royal armorer &lt;a href=\"Therum%20Deepforge\"&gt;Therum Deepforge&lt;/a&gt; to forge a special weapon for them, thus Grayson sent the adventurer to obtain unique materials that could only be found in the cursed &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. He later sent them to fight the enemies of the Alliance in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;, and prevent the deaths of allies at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; forces.\nLegion.\nFollowing the death of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Grayson Shadowbreaker moves to the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt; to serve the new &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Highlord of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;. There he volunteered to serve as a mission specialist, next to the paladin &lt;a href=\"Scouting%20Map\"&gt;Scouting Map&lt;/a&gt;, to help coordinate their forces on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; and strike back against the Legion, by advising the Highlord on various missions during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nFollowing the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, that crashed towards the coast of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, and listening to the message of the &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; to save Azeroth by bringing the heart of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker organized a meeting of the Silver Hand, bringing together all the leaders of the Order, to discuss their goals and next actions against the Legion.\nAfter the Order's victory over &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt;, he sent &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Cyssa%20Dawnrose\"&gt;Champion Cyssa Dawnrose&lt;/a&gt; to contact the Highlord to join him in the Sanctum of Light. There he explained that he wanted the leader of the Silver Hand to have a new mount suited to his status, as he did for young paladins, but times have changed as they now have most of those materials at hand. He just asked to the Highlord a strong, thick, and heavy barding, before redirecting them to &lt;a href=\"Alard%20Schmied\"&gt;Alard Schmied&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; who is able to modify the barding to make it worthy for the steed who will bear it.\nNow in possession of the &lt;a href=\"Plated%20Barding\"&gt;Plated Barding&lt;/a&gt;, Grayson Shadowbreaker announced to the Highlord that it was time to purify the barding, with both material and immaterial means, and that it was necessary to in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to recover &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water%20%28quest%20item%29\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water (quest item)&lt;/a&gt;, in order to overcome the will of Rivendare's mount, &lt;a href=\"Shadowmane\"&gt;Shadowmane&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe waited for the Highlord inside &lt;a href=\"Alonsus%20Chapel\"&gt;Alonsus Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, now at the hands of the Order of the Silver Hand, where he announced that he had made preparations for the ritual but that three of his best men did not return after being sent to secure the holy water. He asked the Highlord to take two paladins to be assisted in the city, then to find the missing paladins and the holy water necessary for the ritual. When they returned, he thanked the Highlord for saving his men and instructed them to proceed to channel the holy magic in the barding, before taking them to Rivendare's crypt to confront his specter.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Slaughter%20House\"&gt;Slaughter House&lt;/a&gt;, he discovered that the tomb had been desecrated and the body of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Aurius%20Rivendare\"&gt;Lord Aurius Rivendare&lt;/a&gt; had been taken away. He fought then alongside the Highlord against &lt;a href=\"Raemien%20the%20Soultaker\"&gt;Raemien the Soultaker&lt;/a&gt; who attacked them while announcing that he would unleash the plague again on the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Following their victory, Grayson took Shadowmane to the Sanctum of Light with the help of the Silver Hand paladins, so that the mount can be redeemed into &lt;a href=\"Glowing%20Reins%20of%20the%20Golden%20Charger\"&gt;Glowing Reins of the Golden Charger&lt;/a&gt; and claimed by the Highlord.\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nMay the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; protect you this day.\nShould you ever need my assistance, you know where to find me.\nYour will is our command.\nRelatives.\nHe may be related to &lt;a href=\"Jubeka%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Jubeka Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt;."}

It thus seems that Creed sought to take Gilneas for himself or his flight, turning its inhabitants into his unwilling servants.\nGiven that Creed holds enough prestige to lead a force into Gilneas City without question and his affluency was not questioned by his followers, he was likely masquerading as a nobleman for a long time to build up that trust, or he has impersonated an actual nobleman."}

{"id": "27146", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=27146", "title": "Lord Incendius", "text": "Lord Incendius is a &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt; that guards the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt; located in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Baron%20Geddon\"&gt;Baron Geddon&lt;/a&gt; taught Incendius to harness his destructive powers, but the baron never expected his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to grow so lethally efficient. Increasingly wary that Incendius might usurp him, Geddon sent the blazing elemental out of the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; to guard the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;' fabled &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nStrategy.\nStealth run.\nLord Incendius is reachable in a typical &lt;a href=\"stealth%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt; run in about 2 minutes flat, and takes about a minute to kill. To reach him, go straight left as soon as you enter the instance and unlock the door, avoid the roaming fire elemental and distract either the left or right dog. Pass this small group by staying close to the dwarves. Note that the dogs will detect stealth at an alarming distance, but as a level 60 you will have no problems passing as close as 1\u20132 feet away from the dwarves even if they are facing directly at you (no improved stealth required). Then simply head right and pass trough the large door, and across the bridge. After this you'll pass by 3 groups of 2 fire elementals, still nothing so far should have attacked you.\nSoloable kill.\nIncendius was fairly easy to solo either as a &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;, presuming you had at least 150-200 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance\"&gt;Fire Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.10\"&gt;Patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt; Incendius received a considerable buff. He now gives a stackable Fire Resistance Debuff (-100 FR), making him near impossible to solo without consumables. It is necessary to use a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Fire%20Protection%20Potion\"&gt;Greater Fire Protection Potion&lt;/a&gt; as soon as you enter the instance so you can drink one more during the fight. Unless you can easily make these, it is recommended that you duo him to eliminate error and wasting useful consumables.\nAs a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; he is soloable in fact, since his &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; debuff counts as a curse. They can remove it and not get the -100 &lt;a href=\"Fire%20resistance\"&gt;Fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; debuff. However, the easiest way is to use &lt;a href=\"Omen%20of%20Clarity\"&gt;Omen of Clarity&lt;/a&gt; and melee him in the normal &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; form. It can take time, but he will go down. Since patch 1.11, all druids, no what matter spec, can cast &lt;a href=\"Innervate\"&gt;Innervate&lt;/a&gt;, so it's basically just a matter of time, and you'll be surprised how much you resist of his attacks with 150 fire resistance.\nIncendius is a trivial kill from level 70 onwards. Some classes (Fire Mages, as one example) may have slightly more difficulty with him than others, but he should not present major problems.\nWarlock kill.\nHere's how to solo him as a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;. Being affliction specced or having &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Sacrifice\"&gt;demonic sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; is highly recommended to do this, as the fight can be fairly long and you'll need health regen to heal through the fireballs and regenerate some mana. You will need the &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20Key\"&gt;Shadowforge Key&lt;/a&gt; to open the 3 doors that are directly left after entering the instance. \nAfter opening the last door take the way up, killing the patrolling elemental on the way. You have to take the left corridor, and jump through the window at the end of it. There's a patrolling elemental that can be single pulled, to reduce the number of mobs.\nUse a &lt;a href=\"voidwalker\"&gt;voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; to aggro all the dwarves that guard the way, directly sending him on the next pack when he has aggroed one. When you're at the middle he should be near death, sacrifice him and run through the window. Directly below the window is a small platform, from which you can jump down to a large platform leading to Lord Incendius. The mobs will reset after a while once you've jumped. You will lose some health doing this, so have a healthstone ready.\nOnce you've jumped down on the platform, be careful of the dwarf patrol standing there. You can proceed to killing the 4 groups of two elementals that guard the way. Just banish one while killing the other.\nOnce you finally get to the boss, you will have to kite him by running on the circular edge around the room. Just throw and refresh your instant dots on him. He will periodically stop to cast his various spells, giving you time to put distance between you and him. The main difficulty here is directing your character so you don't fall into the lava below. If the boss catches up, the knockback can throw you in the little niches around the room, so be very careful getting out of them before you go back to running around. You can also turn around to cast a bolt while he's channeling a spell, in order to speed up the process.\nTwo-person kill.\nOne &lt;a href=\"Rogue\"&gt;Rogue&lt;/a&gt; and one &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt; can kill this boss and be out of the instance in 5 minutes or less, no &lt;a href=\"fire%20resistance\"&gt;fire resistance&lt;/a&gt; required (though it always helps). Simply stealth to him and kill him, although bringing along a full party of blacksmiths is wise so they can all use the Black Anvil. Let the rogue tank, while the druid heals and mixes in some moonfire to speed up the damage."}

There are many decisions you will make in the coming times, and I hope you are wise enough to make the correct ones.\nBelieve me, &lt;race&gt;, when I tell you this - there are correct choices.\n\"Itharius clasps.\"\nYou are quite inquisitive, though such inquisitiveness belies a general lack of understanding. I say this because were you to have a definite purpose in being here, the question you ask would seem pointless\nWith that, I bid you good day. \nYou know I do, mortal; I am abandoning a fair number of pretenses here, and I recommend you do the same.\nYou have come here clearly because you know that what you possess, garned from your actions within the Sunken Temple of the Atal'ai, has brought you to me for a purpose. The purpose is to put my associate... my brother, to rest. He is trapped within a nightmare within the Dream itself. He cannot break free alone.\nThe god that the Atal'ai trolls had brought forth is to blame for this. We destroyed the god's physical manifestation and sunk the temple but the god was so much stronger than even we had anticipated. Its seed of corruption ran deep twisting everything in its path.\nEranikus was charged to watch over the sunken temple to ensure that neither the simple Atal'ai nor their god would rise again. He was an unwitting victim of this corruption, and we in underestimating its potency.\nThe fact that you are here is a first step... a correct choice if you will, in aiding Ysera's Dragonflight.\nYou may be here for purely the lure of personal gain, or you may be here because you are morally compelled. Neither reason is important on its own, but both are in fact critical to this end: The agony that Eranikus endures is what rousted me from my Dream, and it is now my charge to see his torment ended. I now ask you to aid me in this quest.\nYes?\nI can show you the aftermath of Deathwing's destruction at the Maelstrom, if you wish."}

He was not well liked, but he was respected nonetheless.\nLord Jaraxxus was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Wilfred%20Fizzlebang\"&gt;Grand Warlock Wilfred Fizzlebang&lt;/a&gt; when the gnome attempted to summon a &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; for the next challenge during the &lt;a href=\"Trial%20of%20the%20Crusader\"&gt;Trial of the Crusader&lt;/a&gt;. Jaraxxus killed Fizzlebang for his efforts, and next planned to kill the adventurers and open a portal to let the Burning Legion invade Azeroth once more. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Timear\"&gt;Archmage Timear&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; had foreseen the event, and the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Six\"&gt;Council of Six&lt;/a&gt; had therefore sent adventurers to participate in the trial and kill Jaraxxus, which they also succeeded at doing.\nJaraxxus is one of the many demons summoned by in front of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to attack the forces of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; in the climactic, disastrous battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nHis location after the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Legionfall\"&gt;Legionfall&lt;/a&gt; is unknown."}

They are stunnable.\nStrategy.\nLord Jaraxxus is a fight with relatively simple mechanics with a moderate amount of healing required. Jaraxxus himself should be tanked in the center of the room, with ranged and healers set up in a wide circle. Spread healers evenly to avoid having large areas that are out of healing range. Fel Lightning, a chain lightning ability that increases in damage with each hop, can be very dangerous if the raid is not spread out. In order to reduce tank damage, Fel Fireball should be interrupted. &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Resistance%20Aura\"&gt;Fire Resistance Aura&lt;/a&gt; also helps reduce incoming damage.\nEvery 60 seconds, Jaraxxus alternately spawns a Nether Portal or a Fel Volcano. Nether Portals spawn a Mistress of Pain, while Volcanoes spawn 3 Felflame Infernals. Both types of adds must be tanked and nuked down by ranged as fast as possible. Melee should stay on the boss. \nJaraxxus will randomly cast Incinerate Flesh on one raid member. This debuff absorbs all healing on that target until a certain amount of healing has been done (10-man: 30,000; 10-heroic: 40,000; 25-man: 60,000; 25-heroic: 85,000). Healers need to react quickly: if the debuff wears off, the target blows up, causing a Burning Inferno to hit the entire raid for large amounts of damage over time.\nThe other debuff which Jaraxxus randomly deals to raid members is Legion Flames. This continuously spawns flames under its target for six seconds. The target should run away from other raid members (towards the room wall) while remaining in range of healers.\nLord Jaraxxus will also occasionally give himself 5 stacks (25-man: 10) of Nether Power that increases magical damage dealt by 20%, totaling 100% (25-man: 200%). Mages should &lt;a href=\"Spellsteal\"&gt;Spellsteal&lt;/a&gt; this buff as it will increase their DPS and reduce Jaraxxus's damage. If there are too few mages to remove it efficiently, the debuff should be dispelled by priests, shamans, protection warriors and hunters (Tranquilizing Shot). In 25-man, more than 2 mages are needed: Spellsteal is very mana-intensive and triggers a global cooldown, so removing 5 stacks per mage will take a long time and nearly exhaust the mages' mana pools.\nTo do list:\nPassive healing or damage reduction should be used as much as possible to make healer's lives easier. Use healthstones, health potions, bandages, etc. to get rid of Incinerate Flesh, and don't forget &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Life\"&gt;Drain Life&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodthirst\"&gt;Bloodthirst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rune%20Tap\"&gt;Rune Tap&lt;/a&gt;.\nHeroic mode tactics (25-man).\nThe main difference between normal and Heroic mode is that the Nether Portals and Fel Volcanoes don't despawn. Instead, they will continue to spawn adds until the portals themselves are killed. Jaraxxus himself has a very forgiving enrage timer, but the portals are quite difficult to kill quickly enough. That means all DPS should prioritize portals and immediately switch to them when they appear. The portals will always spawn off Jaraxxus's left shoulder at 8 o'clock, about 10 yards away from him. Tanks should position the boss such that the portals will spawn approximately in the center of the room so that all DPS can quickly target them. All melee (except for Fel Fireball interrupters) should preemptively move to where the portals will spawn about 5 seconds beforehand. Once the portal is dead, melee can return to the boss.\nIf Jaraxxus is in the middle of casting Legion Flame or Incinerate Flesh on a raid member when it's time for a portal spawn, he may be turned at an odd angle and the portal might appear in an inconvenient spot. Everyone should be ready to dynamically adjust if this happens. Also, the timing of the Nether Power buff varies quite a bit and can cause a problem if its appearance overlaps with a portal spawn. Mages should be prepared to spellsteal the buff up until the moment a portal appears, at which time they should prioritize killing the portal.\nThe raid should aim to kill Nether Portals before more than one Mistress can spawn, and to kill Fel Volcanoes before more than three Infernals can emerge.\nIt is particularly important to avoid having multiple Mistresses, as they have gained a nasty new ability called Mistress's Kiss. The victim of this spell takes up to 14,350 shadow damage and is interrupted for eight seconds the next time he attempts to cast any spell with a cast time. The victim should cast a spell in a school he does not plan to use, so he is locked out of that school instead of his primary school. Players can avoid taking the damage while clearing the debuff if they cancel the spellcast before it goes off. Holy &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt;, whose spells with cast times are all in the Holy school, are able to avoid getting interrupted by starting a cast and interrupting it right away (Aura Mastery used on conjunction with Concentration Aura does not prevent the interrupt). If multiple Mistresses spawn from the portal, &lt;a href=\"shamans\"&gt;shamans&lt;/a&gt; should blow &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; and melee should swap targets and help burn them down.\nThe infernals can also cause a few problems. They are difficult for the assigned tank to pick up, and their constant movement makes focus-fire on any given one problematic. They will frequently target a random player, fly across the room to their position, and begin AOE'ing. The infernal cannot be moved once it plants itself, so nearby players have to run out of range. If the infernal targets a melee player, the tank needs to move the boss to somewhere safe. Mages should take particular care not to get separated from the boss by the infernals - they should always remain close enough to the boss to spellsteal.\nThe adds don't have a large number of hit points, so it is usually easy to kill them before the next portal phase, and Jaraxxus has an extremely lax enrage timer. However, it will take at least 5 or 6 portal phases to kill Jaraxxus, so the main challenge of the fight becomes burning down the portals both quickly and consistently.\nLoot.\nAs with the other bosses in the instances, there are separate versions of each item for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; raids and for &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; raids.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

After being stolen by some thieves, whom he had eliminated, he summoned a promising &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; to retrieve a &lt;a href=\"Sealed%20Azure%20Bag\"&gt;Sealed Azure Bag&lt;/a&gt;, which was sold with its secret contents as a holy relic to some &lt;a href=\"Timbermaw%20Shaman\"&gt;Timbermaw Shaman&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, whether by stealing it or by the hard way, before bringing it to &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Xylem\"&gt;Archmage Xylem&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Xylem%27s%20Tower\"&gt;his tower&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe asked a favor to the Archmage and the rogue adventurer to remove the enchantment that prevented the opening of the bag. Jorach Ravenholdt eventually obtained the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Key\"&gt;Azure Key&lt;/a&gt;, which the rogue adventurer brought to him after defeating a green drake known as &lt;a href=\"Morphaz\"&gt;Morphaz&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Atal%27Hakkar\"&gt;Temple of Atal'Hakkar&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Swamp%20of%20Sorrows\"&gt;Swamp of Sorrows&lt;/a&gt;. He thanked the rogue adventurer by allowing them to take an enchanted garment in his stores, as they are reserved for rogues of exceptional skill and loyalty.\nHe ended up opening the bag and was bathed in a golden glow from within, his eyes widened while he stared inside.\nHe also tasked &lt;a href=\"Dirk%20Thunderwood\"&gt;Dirk Thunderwood&lt;/a&gt; to track down a new and extremely effective poison compound that could be crafted from the venom sacs of the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Ravenholdt and his league stole &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;'s egg from the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, bringing him to Ravenholdt Manor, where he eventually hatched and began operations to exterminate the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt some point after her defeat in the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Ravenholdt helped &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;. She was also promised the position of the final Shadow.\nLegion.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Jorach Ravenholdt came into contact with a rogue hero by sending a &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Courier\"&gt;messenger&lt;/a&gt; carrying a sealed letter, inviting them to join him alone and in complete discretion in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; through his contact &lt;a href=\"%22Red%22%20Jack%20Findle\"&gt;\"Red\" Jack Findle&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Glorious%20Goods\"&gt;Glorious Goods&lt;/a&gt; of Dalaran. In the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Chamber of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, he met the rogue hero alongside the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Council of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and invited them to take their seat as the final Shadow, and help them lead the Uncrowned.\nAfter the presentation of the secret organization, their methods, and their goals, Jorach Ravenholdt organized with the now complete Council of Shadows the obtaining of the legendary artifacts that are &lt;a href=\"The%20Kingslayers\"&gt;The Kingslayers&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Anguish\"&gt;Anguish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sorrow\"&gt;Sorrow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"The%20Dreadblades\"&gt;The Dreadblades&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Fate\"&gt;Fate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fortune\"&gt;Fortune&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Fangs%20of%20the%20Devourer\"&gt;Fangs of the Devourer&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Gorefang\"&gt;Gorefang&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Akaari%27s%20Will\"&gt;Akaari's Will&lt;/a&gt;, to equip their champion who would operate outside and vanquished their foes.\nAfter successfully securing all of the artifacts, Ravenholdt was poisoned among the members of the Council of Shadows during their meeting by &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;, Kingpin of the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;, who wanted the place of the final Shadow. Following her defeat against the rogue hero, he left her no choice but to serve the latter or be executed the Uncrowned. He then expressed his grief to imagine her &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;father&lt;/a&gt; being disappointed in her actions.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, he began recruiting and mobilizing their agents on the Broken Isles with the help of &lt;a href=\"Nikki%20the%20Gossip\"&gt;Nikki the Gossip&lt;/a&gt;. Following the discovery of the body of an agent in the &lt;a href=\"Underbelly\"&gt;sewers of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, Ravenholdt feared that the SI:7 would take too much interest in them. Subsequently, he sent his agents to investigate the situation in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered that &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; had increased the number of agents he has in Horde territory, and ordered the elimination of &lt;a href=\"Amber%20Kearnen\"&gt;Amber Kearnen&lt;/a&gt;.\nRealizing that something was wrong with Shaw's behavior, Ravenholdt sent agents of the Uncrowned to investigate the relationship between the SI:7 and the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Blade\"&gt;Red Blade&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Citrine%20Bay\"&gt;Citrine Bay&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, where they discovered that the Spymaster ordered the pirates to execute Amber Kearnen in exchange for access to Stormwind Harbor and a royal pardon for their past crimes committed. They also got their hands on a mysterious letter with a complex code that they brought to him, and began to decipher it to find out the reasons for Mathias to eliminate his best agent.\nAfter translating the letter and uncovering the plan of the &lt;a href=\"dreadlord\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the rescue of &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and the elimination of the demon to prevent a new conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, Lord Jorach Ravenholdt rewarded the Last Shadow for their many exploits with the title of Shadowblade, and also with the &lt;a href=\"Shadowblade%27s%20Murderous%20Omen\"&gt;Shadowblade's Murderous Omen&lt;/a&gt; after they deal with the &lt;a href=\"Homunculi\"&gt;Homunculi&lt;/a&gt; alongside &lt;a href=\"Lilian%20Voss\"&gt;Lilian Voss&lt;/a&gt; in the Hall of Shadows and in the cities of the Alliance and the Horde.\nFollowing their victory, Lord Ravenholdt was one of the order hall champions who met &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velen\"&gt;Velen&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Krasus%27%20Landing\"&gt;Krasus' Landing&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the &lt;a href=\"Pillars%20of%20Creation\"&gt;Pillars of Creation&lt;/a&gt;, as the Uncrowned joined the other orders to form the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;Argus Campaign&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, Mathias Shaw mentions in his report that the Uncrowned are still active with Jorach Ravenholdt at their head.\nQuotes.\nThe Uncrowned will do what no others can: finish this war.\nSpeculation.\nAs prior to the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; the area of &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt; belonged to the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, it is presumed Jorach was formerly a noble of the kingdom."}

After the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Kazzak remained on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, and later reopened the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, allowing the Legion to invade once more and marking the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;. Though Doom Lord Kazzak himself was defeated, he returned as Supreme Lord in the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nWhen the Burning Legion began its &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;second invasion of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Kazzak participated it, being summoned by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, coming right after &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;. His most fearsome lieutenant was &lt;a href=\"Razelikh%20the%20Defiler\"&gt;Razelikh the Defiler&lt;/a&gt;. Following the defeat of the Burning Legion at the end of the Third War, the remaining enemy forces, led by the colossal demon Lord Kazzak, pulled back to the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. He tasked Razelikh to secure the land.\nIn the year 25, Kazzak was located in the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;, terrorizing the adventurers of the Horde and Alliance.\nOne year later, with the future in peril, a relic of the past had also surfaced, radiating renewed energy. This relic had enabled Lord Kazzak to activate the current &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, thereby reopening the gateway to the shattered realm of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. With the portal now opened, Lord Kazzak was seen departing through the Dark Portal. In his stead he left his most powerful lieutenant, &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;, to sow fear and confusion among the defenders. He also entrusted him with retrieving the shards of the &lt;a href=\"Glaive%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Glaive of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nAccompanied by a host of infernals, Kruul was seen near a number of major cities in Azeroth. Once Lord Kazzak passed through back to Outland, he was promoted to &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Lord%20Kazzak\"&gt;Doom Lord Kazzak&lt;/a&gt;, commanding the Legion in the broken world, and set up his seat at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;, a mountain in the &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt;, which he protected until he was defeated.\nKazzak re-emerged from the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; in the alternate version of and is located at the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Kil%27jaeden%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Throne of Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; where adventurers of the Horde and Alliance attack him once again.\nIn the RPG.\nKazzak is a &lt;a href=\"doomguard\"&gt;doomguard&lt;/a&gt; and is known as Kil'jaeden's Right Hand and Lord of the Doomguard demons.\nArchimonde left his blade, the Warblade of Archimonde, in Kazzak's hands. Kazzak wields it in deference to his commander, often holding the weapon aloft and shouting \u201cFor Archimonde!\u201d as a battle cry when entering combat. Lord Kazzak's main goal \u2014 indeed, his only goal \u2014 was to reopen the Dark Portal and return to Draenor, now the shattered realm of Outland. It was unknown if he had the intent to serve Illidan or raise an army to fight the night elf betrayer.\nAfter his master's defeat Kazzak pulled back. He and his forces then occupied a ravaged area in the Blasted Lands known as the Tainted Scar. He lived in a tower hidden in the poisonous fog. Kazzak was a mighty demon with great power, but he lacked independent initiative. Trapped within the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt;, he was completely cut off from contact with any other demonic forces on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Even if such personages \u2014 such as &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 became aware of his presence, they would likely avoid contact for fear of Kazzak's power.\nUnlike many demon leaders, who tend to stay behind the lines and direct their minions against a foe, Lord Kazzak loves nothing more than to wade right into the heat of battle. There, he shatters formations with his shadow storm ability while laying waste to individual heroes with his mighty greatsword. As the battle enters its most critical phase, he flies into a rage, reveling in an orgy of destruction."}

{"id": "24040", "revid": "38896978", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=24040", "title": "Lord Kazzak (tactics)", "text": "Lord Kazzak was originally found in &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince &lt;a href=\"WoW%27s%2013th%20Anniversary\"&gt;WoW's 13th Anniversary&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Kazzak is available during the anniversary event.\nInformation.\nLord Kazzak was a &lt;a href=\"World%20raid%20encounters\"&gt;world raid encounter&lt;/a&gt;, which means that players are allowed to participate in high-end content without the time investment necessary to hack one\u2019s way to the bottom of the dankest dungeons. Instead, he spawned within the back of the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, a valley that is guarded by elite demonic forces left over from the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. The addition of these encounters opens up new game dynamics, both good and bad. While &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; expects a certain amount of competition for such high-end creeps, some players have been abusing Kazzak's special abilities with the specific intent to harass other players.\nStrategy.\nFrom: http://www.thottbot.net/?n=657895\nOnce he is aggroed and the fight begins, you have no more than three (3) minutes to kill him. I'll explain later why. He starts off with everything he's got. He keeps meleeing the main tank while Cleaving once in a while for rogues swarming around him and keeps sending Shadowbolt Volleys to hurt everyone around. The volleys are not on a timer, instead he casts them as he sees fit. In some rare cases there's about 30 seconds between the casts, sometimes he does it every five seconds. In the meantime, he casts Twisted Reflection and the rarer Mark of Kazzak on random people. \nWhat to do here: \nSend your main tank in and let him build some aggro for a short while, just enough so he won't come at you the first time you cast something on him. Then unload. Have your DPS classes give him everything they have. Priests have to be extra mindful about the magical debuff he casts on your group. It has to be removed as soon as possible or the attempt will soon end in a disaster. Priests are also in charge of healing their groups thanks to that Shadowbolt Volley that keeps hitting everyone all the time. Mages need to be on top of the curse situation. Mark of Kazzak can and will cause a wipe if you let it go off on you. Dispel the curse as soon as you can. All casters should also leave about 1000 mana in their mana pool just in case he casts the curse on you. That'll give the mages four seconds to dispel before it goes off. In other words, 1000 mana is out of mana in this raid encounter. Also, anyone dying during the fight is not an option. Unless it happens during the first five seconds of the fight, you've failed already. Do not use grounding totems, pets or other small things he can kill for the 70,000 health heal. \nYour group will have exactly three minutes to finish the demon off. If you fail to kill him in that time due to lack of DPS, people dying or not dispelling Twisted Reflection properly, Lord Kazzak will enter what is called the Supreme Mode. Named after his yell once it triggers, the supreme mode causes him to cast his Shadowbolt every second. That's 800-1000 DPS on everyone, and that means a wipe.\nLoot.\nThere are a number of epic items that a player could only acquire by killing Lord Kazzak, this loot table is identical to that of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt; post &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Each of these ten items are listed below. Since there are ten items, each item had a 10% chance of dropping from Lord Kazzak after a successful kill. Also note that he dropped more than one item.\nOne interesting item that players could get from Lord Kazzak is &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;The Eye of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;, a component in the &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"epic\"&gt;epic&lt;/a&gt; class quest. The reward is a &lt;a href=\"staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; that can transform to suit the talent build of the &lt;a href=\"Priest\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Anathema\"&gt;Anathema&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Benediction\"&gt;Benediction&lt;/a&gt;. The reason this is important is that there is a 100% chance Lord Kazzak will drop this item, which is significantly better than the 0.5% chance a Priest will have on the Demons in &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper%20Gorge\"&gt;Darkwhisper Gorge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. Some items he drops grant shadow and fire resistance."}

He had no significant loot table, but was required for the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt; quest line.

Throughout the fight he will attempt to recast this so just dispel it every time. Spread out your raid as much as possible as his chain lightning will arc through players and in turn cause the stackable Static Conduit. He will hit your tank for around 1000 to 1200 damage on average.

Although chimaeras are able to fly, the ones on the isle have not been seen since the event, which suggests that the isle was destroyed faster than they could make their escape.

Pieced together by the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; from the bones of a thousand vanquished adventurers, he is the guardian of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Spire\"&gt;The Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and wields the power of the throne itself. His weapon is the axe &lt;a href=\"Bryntroll%2C%20the%20Bone%20Arbiter\"&gt;Bryntroll, the Bone Arbiter&lt;/a&gt;.\nStrategy.\nLord Marrowgar is a fairly simple encounter that should not give any guild prepared for Icecrown Citadel much difficulty.\nTanking.\nTanks need to stand on top of each other to soak Bone Slice. If you are short on tanks and the raid has plate DPS available, one can be put in front of the boss with the tanks to help soak the Bone Slice damage. If said DPSer has a tanking set, equipping a piece or two to increase their HP is an option should they be taking too much damage. Note that the tanks will take substantial damage during the fight - using an off tank of this sort is not advised, as it will make healing even more difficult, although it is better than insufficient tanks.\nIt is entirely possible to single tank Marrowgar, in 10man, should the tank be sufficiently geared. In 3.3(a) Marrowgar's damage was further reduced, making this an even more viable strategy. Be advised that although this frees up another DPS in your 10man raid, the tank will take heavy damage.\nThe key to the fight is managing the transitions between the Bone Storms and going back to the Bone Graveyard phase. You have 10 seconds from the end of Bone Storm until Lord Marrowgar starts casting Bone Slice again (until then he simply melees his target) - the tanks need to pick him up and position themselves together in that time. (The 10 second grace period also applies to the beginning of the encounter, counting from when he is first aggroed, giving the tanks time to set themselves up.)\nTanks should avoid sandwiching themselves between Marrowgar and a wall. The trails of fire need a place to land behind the tanks, or they will be cast inside the hit box, affecting the tanks.\nDPS.\n\"Lord Marrowgar has a gigantic hit box\" You will want to have a dedicated 'spike team' - chosen dps members who will kill the Bone Spike Graveyard as soon as it impales a player. If you're doing 10-man without a dedicated spike team, the melee need to be grouped near the healers until you out-gear the encounter, or are attempting his heroic mode. Melee can choose to stay close to the boss to avoid the Coldflame, which starts stay out of range of the 8 yd Coldflame and still attack the boss. \nBone Spike Graveyard.\nRanged DPS, or nearby melee, should immediately free players impaled with Bone Spike Graveyard. If the raid has an abundance of melee, members should stay relatively close together to reduce travel time. Bone Spikes should die within 3 seconds (two GCDs); any longer and you will have issues.\nIn addition, it is confirmed that Paladin ability &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Reckoning\"&gt;Reckoning&lt;/a&gt; removes Bone Spike Graveyard, and it's most likely that similar abilities remove it too.\nColdflame.\nColdflame is a single line of frost that runs radially outward for 8 yards. Touching it inflicts a large amount of damage. Since it moves in a straight line, melee can sidestep out of its way, while ranged players can avoid it entirely. Because it starts a small distance away from Lord Marrowgar, melee can also avoid it by staying in very close, but only do this when Lord Marrowgar is not casting Bone Storm. In heroic, touching the line of frost will apply a bleed effect.\nCold Fire during his non-Bone Storm periods will be directed at a given person, thus ranged should spread out radially, preventing more than one from having to move from any given spawn.\nBone Storm.\nEvery 30 seconds Marrowgar will execute Bone Storm. This whirlwind attack cannot be avoided, and damage is dealt every two seconds based on your proximity to the boss as he spins. The closer you are, the more damage you take. Additionally, in heroic this will also leave a bleed effect on anyone hit by it.\nWhile in his Bone Storm Lord Marrowgar will randomly target and charge a raid member. When he reaches them he stops moving for around six seconds before targeting another random raid member. Every time Lord Marrowgar reaches his target and stops he will fire four lines of Cold Fire along the semi-cardinal points (NE, NW, SE, SW - they form an X). Unlike during phase 1, the cold flame lines start directly underneath him. After his fourth target the Bone Storm will end.\nTanks will need to be close by to absorb Bone Slice when Bone Storm ends.\nHealing.\n\"Need clarification and correction here.\"\nThe tanks take a fair amount of damage during combat (10-15k damage every second from Bone Slice, or 13-17k damage on 25 man). \nDuring the Bone Storms, every raid members takes damage. People who don't move when they're targeted by the boss during Bone Storm will be taking full Bone Storm damage in addition to Cold Fire damage from up to four separate Cold Fire effects, which will probably result in their death. \nNote that Lord Marrowgar has a red positioning reticule below him. Stacking your entire raid (with the exception of the three tanks and any hunters) on the back edge of the reticule does three things:\nThe raid must disperse during Bone Storm. Bone Storm damage is negligible, but Priests need to be mindful that Inner Fire charges are depleted by this ability. Stay mobile, and re-collapse to the rear of the positioning reticule once the tanks regain control after it stops.\nNote that tanks do not take damage during the Bone Spike Graveyard cast, which can be very handy for moving into position or catching up on healing.\nTips: During bone storm try only to move to avoid the cold flame, it is easy to heal through the bone storm. Simply keep an eye on Lord Marrowgar to see whether or not you will be in the way of the cold flame\nAlternative positioning strategy.\nThe entire raid (except the tanks) collapse into a single group behind Lord Marrowgar within the red circle visible on the ground when he is targeted. Hunters should stand as close to this group as possible, but still be far enough away that they can still shoot. Communication from any Hunters is important should they get hit with Bone Spike, the DPS can quickly react to it and make adjustments. This strategy has the bonus of being able to very quickly bring players out of the Bone Spikes, and if everyone is within the red circle, any Cold Flames launched at players will miss, as the flames don't land on the ground until they are just outside of the circle.\nAs a downside, players must quickly move out several seconds before Bone Storm begins otherwise the raid will take heavy damage. Players must also watch their positioning to make sure they don't stray into the front of the boss and risk getting hit with the Bone Slice.\nHeroic Mode.\nThe same strategy you use in normal mode should work in heroic mode, as the fight is largely unchanged though with drastically increased Bone Storm damage. The cold flame lasts longer and if you use a strategy where everyone stands inside Lord Morrowgar hitbox, your tanks will need to work around 3 or more cold flames up. During the bonestorm phase, Lord Morrowgar will continue to cast bone spike. This could lead to easy deaths if the bone spike sits on top of a cold flame, with Morrowgar spinning at the same location. Players caught in this situation need to be vocal and ask for a healer cooldown to survive.\nQuotes.\nSound files.\nSee \"&lt;a href=\"PlaySoundFile%20macros%20-%20Icecrown%20Citadel%23.C2.A0Lord%20Marrowgar\"&gt;Sound Files of Icecrown Citadel: Lord Marrowgar&lt;/a&gt;\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

As a member of the order's war council, he participated in the meetings for important decisions, and notably fought during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt; and the battle against &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nThe Ashbringer.\nSoon after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, Lord Maxwell Tyrosus joined &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s crusade against the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and insisted on working with other races. Maxwell accompanied his lord and comrades, &lt;a href=\"Brigitte%20Abbendis\"&gt;Brigitte Abbendis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fairbanks\"&gt;Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Monastery&lt;/a&gt; where they found troll &lt;a href=\"Zabra%20Hexx\"&gt;Zabra Hexx&lt;/a&gt;. While Brigitte insisted on killing him, he stopped her to speak with the troll.\nFollowing Alexandros' demise, the order became more zealous and fanatic and eventually reformed itself into the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. He left the order with &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Officer%20Pureheart\"&gt;Pureheart&lt;/a&gt; and joined the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;, eventually succeeding &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Raymond%20George\"&gt;Lord Raymond George&lt;/a&gt; and becoming its leader in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and one of the highest-ranking officers in the organization as a whole. He found &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and let him join the order. Maxwell brought him to the &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Point\"&gt;Chillwind Point&lt;/a&gt; and learned that Alexandros' spirit may be alive. He wanted to help Darion to attack &lt;a href=\"Naxxramas\"&gt;Naxxramas&lt;/a&gt;, but Darion insisted that he was very important to the Dawn. Instead, Darion found volunteers at the Point.\nMaxwell and the rest of the Dawn moved to the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt; where the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; was about to attack them. Darion, having visited &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, returned to the Chapel and Maxwell revealed to him the Chapel's secret. When the Scourge attacked, he alongside other Argent Dawn members defended the place and witnessed the sacrifice of Darion. He then remained in contact with Tirion Fordring.\nCompendium of Fallen Heroes.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20the%20Sanguine\"&gt;Siege of the Sanguine&lt;/a&gt;, a major battle between the Scourge and the Argent Dawn at Light's Hope Chapel, Lord Maxwell Tyrosus dealt a critical blow to &lt;a href=\"Kirkessen%20the%20Zealous\"&gt;Kirkessen the Zealous&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; who reported directly to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; himself. Since its defeat, the lich is now no longer able to assume a corporeal form.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nLord Maxwell Tyrosus resides in Light's Hope Chapel and rarely sees visitors from outside his organization, as it has been years since he has granted an audience to outsiders. From there he coordinates the troops of the Argent Dawn to fight the Scourge in the Eastern Plaguelands, and was planning with &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Zverenhoff\"&gt;Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff&lt;/a&gt; an offensive on &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; to eliminate &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Rivendare\"&gt;Baron Rivendare&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe also received a husk from a silithid by an adventurer sent by &lt;a href=\"Colossus%20Researcher%20Sophia\"&gt;Colossus Researcher Sophia&lt;/a&gt;, which he thought to be useful in the war against the Scourge.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell led the troops of the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights%20of%20Acherus\"&gt;Death Knights of Acherus&lt;/a&gt;, alongside &lt;a href=\"Nicholas%20Zverenhoff\"&gt;Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Korfax\"&gt;Korfax, Champion of the Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Highlord Tirion Fordring joined the battle, Maxwell sided with him in front of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; and his defeated death knights. He then witnessed the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;, and the merger of the Argent Dawn with the remains of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; which became the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; under the command of Tirion Fordring, he subsequently joined the new order.\nAs the newly formed Argent Crusade set out to annihilate the Scourge in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell remained the Crusade's operations chief in the Eastern Plaguelands. He began the fortification of Light's Hope Chapel, then undertook to take over the old watchtowers of the region and to restore them.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the fall of the Lich King, Maxwell continued with the admission of new members in the Argent Crusade while reducing the Scourge numbers in the region through some imposed trials.\nThe first test he gives is to go behind the chapel and enter the small crypt, where the bodies of fallen heroes who gave their lives in the war against the Scourge are located, then to read the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Scroll\"&gt;Argent Scroll&lt;/a&gt; in order to summon and fight the spirit of Maxwell's predecessor, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Raymond%20George\"&gt;Lord Raymond George&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe second test is to reduce the number of undead and cultists present in the &lt;a href=\"Noxious%20Glade\"&gt;Noxious Glade&lt;/a&gt;, because despite their proximity to the chapel the crusade could not completely remove them.\nFinally, the last test he gives is once again to reduce the number of undead present this time in &lt;a href=\"Northdale\"&gt;Northdale&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nFollowing the failed Argent Crusade's assault of the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, and the loss of &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell journeys to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; came into contact with a paladin champion. There he informs the paladin that the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt; has devastated the forces of the Argent Crusade, and that it was necessary to reunite those who still have the conviction to save their home.\nHe later informed the paladin champion of the existence of holy artifacts that would give them a chance to stop the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, and accompanied them in search of &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; who was lost when Tirion Fordring was defeated. Faced with the impossibility of finding the legendary weapon, Maxwell accompanied the paladin champion at &lt;a href=\"Uther%27s%20Tomb\"&gt;Uther's Tomb&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to find answers from the ghost of the deceased paladin. After having exorcised the spirits and purified the graves of the deceased disturbed by the \"death\" of the Highlord, they could finally communicate with Uther who revealed that Tirion yet lives.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, he rallied his forces to launch an attack on the Broken Shore in order to rescue Highlord Tirion, with his troops he fought the demon army which awaited them under the orders of &lt;a href=\"Jailer%20Zerus\"&gt;Jailer Zerus&lt;/a&gt; and found Tirion with whom he remained in his last moments, as the artifact was recovered by the paladin champion who repelled Balnazzar, before ordering that his body be transported to be buried amongst the ancient heroes of the Light buried beneath Light's Hope Chapel. He also asked the paladin champion to clear the area where Tirion fell so the Silver Hand could sanctify it.\nInside the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;, where all of Azeroth's paladin orders have gathered, he announces the champion paladin as the heir of Highlord Tirion Fordring and the new leader of the reborn &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Order of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, to which the Argent Crusade he represents swears loyalty. After the ceremony, he announced to the Highlord that as long they wield the Ashbringer, the Legion will do everything in their power to strike them down, and so he humbly submits himself to act as the eyes and the blade of the Highlord until his dying breath as a champion of the Silver Hand.\nDuring one of his expeditions to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell saw an extraordinarily luminescent object emerge from the &lt;a href=\"Felstorm\"&gt;Felstorm&lt;/a&gt; that fell down towards the coast of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;, cutting a swath through the tempest itself. The object was none other than the &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Heart\"&gt;Light's Heart&lt;/a&gt;, bearer of &lt;a href=\"High%20Exarch%20Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;'s message to save Azeroth by bringing the heart of the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Xe%27ra\"&gt;Xe'ra&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt;. Later, Maxwell was present at the meeting requested by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Grayson%20Shadowbreaker\"&gt;Lord Grayson Shadowbreaker&lt;/a&gt;, as a leader of the Order, where he asks the Highlord what will be the next actions of the Order following Turalyon's warning.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; the chapel, in order to raise Tirion Fordring as a death knight to be a part of the &lt;a href=\"Four%20Horsemen\"&gt;Four Horsemen&lt;/a&gt;, Maxwell is subdued by &lt;a href=\"Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to protect the entrance to the sanctum.\nMaxwell participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Exodar\"&gt;Battle for the Exodar&lt;/a&gt;, battling against &lt;a href=\"High%20General%20Rakeesh\"&gt;High General Rakeesh&lt;/a&gt; alongside the Highlord and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Liadrin\"&gt;Lady Liadrin&lt;/a&gt; to protect the draenei people and the &lt;a href=\"naaru\"&gt;naaru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"O%27ros\"&gt;O'ros&lt;/a&gt;, targeted by the Legion so that they could not unlock the knowledge contained within Light's Heart.\nLater he was present during the battle at the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; with the troops of the Silver Hand who came to support the priests of the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt;.

During &lt;a href=\"The%20Sanctuary%20Must%20Not%20Fall\"&gt;The Sanctuary Must Not Fall&lt;/a&gt;, he appears at the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorld first \"heroic\" kill on 25-man achieved 5.7.2011 by Premonition - US-Sen'Jin.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Rhyolith is one of the most ancient elementals in existence, born from the primordial fires that forged &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; itself. He is responsible for the creation of new &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s in the Firelands and still possesses a searing hatred of the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s for what he considers their monumental arrogance in relocating him.\"\nRhyolith made his appearance in Hyjal attacking the &lt;a href=\"Sanctuary%20of%20Malorne\"&gt;Sanctuary of Malorne&lt;/a&gt;. However, &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; summoned &lt;a href=\"Malorne\"&gt;Malorne&lt;/a&gt;, who ultimately defeated Rhyolith.\nAbilities.\nStage One: Nuisances, Nuisances!\nLord Rhyolith ignores players while his armor is intact, but they can attack his feet to control his movement.\nStage Two: Now you will BURN!\nWhen Lord Rhyolith reaches 25% remaining health, his Obsidian armor shatters. He becomes attackable and no longer ignores players.\nStrategy.\nPhase One: Drive his feet.\nThe goal of phase one is to ablate his obsidian armor and damage him enough to start phase two. Causing the boss to step on active volcanoes is critical to this process. However, most of the raid will be concentrating on staying alive by destroying adds and avoiding lava and other environmental damage.\nTanks are not on the boss during phase one. They are instead managing adds. One tank should be responsible for the Sparks, pulling them away from the group, while the other tank gathers the Fragments for AoE.\nWhen the battle starts a UI element appears which illustrates how players are affecting Rhyolith's navigation. Causing damage to one of Rhyolith's feet causes him to turn toward that foot. A yellow bar, if present, indicates which direction he is turning. Typically only a few players are assigned foot duty. Note: the longer phase 1 lasts, the more damage Rhyolith's phase 2 abilities will last, as he will continue gaining a stacking damage buff once his armor is gone until he reaches 25% and transitions to phase 2. The DPS on foot duty should \"always\" be damaging one of the feet, even if the goal is to keep him moving straight (in this case, split dps between the feet).\nThe exact rules governing this foot-driving are poorly understood at this point, but the feet will steadily restore toward center, and this occurs more quickly the faster he is turning. What is well-understood is that if he is not maneuvered correctly he will reach the lava at the edge of the platform and Drink Magma, causing massive damage to the raid and very likely a wipe. Also, you want to drive him over \"active\" volcanoes to ablate his Obsidian Armor. Another desirable result of volcano-stomping is that it ends that volcano's fire damage plaguing the raid. Inactive volcanoes can be run over as well. This will not reduce his armor, but will prevent that volcano from being activated later in the fight.\nWhile the foot team is managing Rhyolith's position the rest of the raid is dealing with the Fragments and Sparks that spawn periodically throughout the fight. Fragments spawn in a swarm and should be destroyed before their explosions (30 second timer) damage the raid. Sparks spawn one at a time and have a pulsing aura that damages nearby players. As long as they are alive they are stacking Infernal Rage which increases the damage they deal to the tank and other nearby players.\nPhase Two: Burn.\nOnce the boss reaches 25%, he becomes molten, becomes tankable, and can be attacked directly. The raid should group up behind the boss for AoE healing and burn the boss down as quickly as possible.\nSolo strategy.\nThe feet-driving mechanic still comes in to play, and the 80% damage-taken reduction is annoying until Rhyolith has run over a few volcanoes. Focus the Liquid Obsidian adds in heroic mode and clear out the rest of the adds, as they spawn fairly frequently. Save cooldowns until the legs are taking more damage (or he reaches 50% health) to make the burst more effective.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

He is elegant, polished, impeccably tailored, and blessed with a perfect physique. \nBiography.\nA lesser quel'dorei noble, Saltheril's extravagant parties were famous throughout &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe lord was moved to tears by &lt;a href=\"Lirath%20Windrunner\"&gt;Lirath Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s rendition of &lt;a href=\"Lament%20of%20the%20Highborne\"&gt;Lament of the Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, and offered the young musician his patronage. He and his latest paramour, &lt;a href=\"Elisara%20Sunstriker\"&gt;Elisara Sunstriker&lt;/a&gt;, hosted the Windrunners at his &lt;a href=\"Saltheril%27s%20Haven\"&gt;country abode&lt;/a&gt; and had Lirath perform for the haughty nobles of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt;. Saltheril even arranged for his young prodigy to play for &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, prince of Quel'Thalas, during one of the prince's rare returns from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nThis party proved a scandalous affair, as the antics of a young &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; saw Lord Saltheril and Elisara afflicted by &lt;a href=\"woundwood\"&gt;woundwood&lt;/a&gt; intended for &lt;a href=\"Aravan%20Salonar\"&gt;Aravan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rendris%20Salonar\"&gt;Rendris&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Salonar\"&gt;House of Salonar&lt;/a&gt;. Saltheril indignantly banished both Windrunners from his haven in response. Attending the party was the Farstrider &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt;, who interceded on the Windrunners' behalf and won Lirath clemency, but nothing would ease Saltheril's loathing for Sylvanas, whose exile he insisted upon. To his relief, the party's turn amused rather than offended Prince Kael'thas, who sponsored the youngest Windrunner in Silvermoon. Later, he attended the Remembrance at the &lt;a href=\"Court%20of%20the%20Sun\"&gt;Court of the Sun&lt;/a&gt; and met with Sylvanas again.\nSaltheril attended Lirath's funeral after his death in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Years later, Sylvanas \u2013 now the Dark Lady of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; \u2013 would return to her homeland to negotiate its entrance into the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. On a nostalgic whim, the dark lady asked after Saltheril's fate and was surprised to learn he'd survived the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. According to the kingdom's regent lord, not even &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; could halt his parties for long \u2013 even if Lord Saltheril now taps into his &lt;a href=\"Suntouched%20Special%20Reserve\"&gt;Suntouched Special Reserve&lt;/a&gt; with greater frequency.\nQuotes.\nOh, hello there.. um... what's your name?\nNo matter, what brings you to my home-away-from-home here out in the beautiful countryside?\nSpeculation.\nHe might be related to &lt;a href=\"Tirathon%20Saltheril\"&gt;Tirathon Saltheril&lt;/a&gt;."}

He was moved by the prince's proclamation regarding their fallen people and the new identity the elves would embrace: the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nSolanar changed his surname as a further homage to his fallen brother.

He thus decided to surround himself with the arcane and locked himself within the halls which were to become his tomb. He was defended by a host of skeletons and &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Mistress of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Maiden%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Maidens of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, some of whom were studying in an adjacent library. He was defeated by Rexxar who claimed &lt;a href=\"Talendar%20Skull%20Helm\"&gt;his hollowed out skull&lt;/a&gt;, ironically now a powerful magical artifact.\nSpeculation.\nTalendar was likely a &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; in life - his obsession with the arcane as well as his fate to haunt the Tomb of the Ancients are typical of the Highborne who remained in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. While his tomb is located in Dustwallow Marsh, there are definitive night elf ruins at &lt;a href=\"Nightmare%20Scar\"&gt;Nightmare Scar&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Magistrates%20Temple\"&gt;Magistrates Temple&lt;/a&gt; is located nearby. The make and adornment of the Tomb of the Ancients is thoroughly unlike that of other natives of Kalimdor, and is the same at the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Peak%20caverns\"&gt;caverns under Stonetalon Peak&lt;/a&gt;, likely of Highborne origin as well. The Mistress of Shadows and the Maidens of Shadows use &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sorceress\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt; models, further supporting the idea that they and Lord Talendar were Highborne of some description."}

He was the last boss in the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Set%202\"&gt;Dungeon Set 2&lt;/a&gt; quest line.\nHe could still be summoned until &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.2\"&gt;patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt; by players who still possessed a &lt;a href=\"Brazier%20of%20Invocation\"&gt;Brazier of Invocation&lt;/a&gt;. His health was significantly buffed in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", which made for a very long fight.\nBackground.\nA &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt; noble and a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; of immense power, Valthalak was the former General of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=\"General%20Drakkisath\"&gt;Drakkisath&lt;/a&gt; rose to power. He was slain by the &lt;a href=\"Veiled%20Blade\"&gt;Veiled Blade&lt;/a&gt; mercenary company for his spellbook, but ended up avenging himself even after his death using his necromantic powers.\nAttacks and abilities.\nPhase 1.\nValthalak has a caster type weak melee attack in phase 1. A slow one that does 400-500 damage to a warrior.\nShadow Wrath.\nA shadow-based, chain life drain, which obviously translates into healing for himself. Hits for 750 Shadow damage on the first target, and will jump to another target if anyone is close enough. Each time it jumps, it doubles in damage in the manner of Holy Wrath from &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Venoxis\"&gt;High Priest Venoxis&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;. At the 4th jump, the damage will be 6k and lethal for most people. Being a life-drain, all damage dealt will heal Valthalak.\nHeal.\nThe chain life drain (noted above) will replenish his health, so it is important that you have a warrior tank the mob alone (until phase 2). Alternately, if you have more people in melee range, you will need to interrupt when he casts the life drain. It will show as a purple beam that chains between friendly targets.\nHave one or two people mana drain him (his regen and total mana are quite low). The spell is also interruptible using standard methods (&lt;a href=\"Shield%20Bash%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Shield Bash (Classic)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Earth%20Shock\"&gt;Earth Shock&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Counterspell\"&gt;Counterspell&lt;/a&gt;, etc.). A mod such as EnemyCast or Spell Alert can be helpful. All his spells will sadly not show up on the standard 'EnemyCastBar' you can have displayed below the enemy portrait.\nLord Valthalak apparently has no specific animations when he heals. Warriors with &lt;a href=\"Mortal%20Strike\"&gt;Mortal Strike&lt;/a&gt; would greatly assist, as well as rogues with wound poisons. It is also possible to just DPS through the heals. The rate that Valthalak heals himself appears to be random.\nSpectral Assassins.\nThese spawn two at a time throughout phase 1. They will run towards someone in your raid (can include pets) and eventually cast a mindflay-like Defile ability (a purple vile beam). Defile cannot be dispelled/cleansed and stuns its target for ten seconds. If the spell is allowed to complete, its target dies and is transformed into an additional Spectral Assassin. The assassins have around 1,500\u00a0hp with little to no armor and resistances.\nPhase 2: Enrage.\nAt 40% health he will switch weapons and start hitting very hard. He stops spawning Spectral Assassins but still does Shadow Wrath if he has mana.\nPhase 3: Shadow Bolt Volley.\nAt 15% health, he will frequently cast an AoE &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;Shadow Bolt&lt;/a&gt; on the entire raid in addition to the changes in phase 2.\nSummary.\nThis strategy results in an easy, but long fight, usually 7\u201310 minutes. Your healers need to come prepared for an endurance fight, other than that it makes for an easy run.\nSolo notes.\nHe is still a tough fight at level 80 even in &lt;a href=\"Tier%2010\"&gt;Tier 10&lt;/a&gt;-level gear if you intend to solo him. The spectral assassins must be dealt with immediately before they can cast Defile with its 10-second stun; otherwise, Valthalak will get 10 seconds of free DPS and healing if Life Drain is also up (meaning death to cloth-wearing characters). Life Drain also works on pets/minions, which makes this ability all the more dangerous to either you or your pet, depending on which one is at the end of the chain. This is a major DPS race to try to keep more than a couple of spectral assassins from spawning while keeping Valthalak's damaging abilities to a minimum. Be prepared for several deaths while you get the feel of the fight."}

After committing suicide rather than acknowledge a worgen as his lord, Godfrey's body was recovered and reanimated by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, but after turning on them as well, he fled into the abandoned ruins of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where he and his followers remain.\nBiography.\nLord of His Pack.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Godfrey was among the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; nobles who accompanied King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; to create the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Genn trusted his counsel but was always suspicious of his ambitions. Godfrey suggested that to stay in the good graces of their sister kingdoms for the benefit of trade and tariffs, Gilneas should only send a small token force instead of the whole Gilnean army, a sentiment echoed by &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt;. Genn noted that unlike &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;'s empathetic urge to aid the other human nations, Godfrey's notion was a smart political play that ensured notoriety for himself, as he was the commander of Gilneas' standing militia. However, Genn also saw the wisdom in Godfrey's advice and stated that he would consider it.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Genn told Godfrey of his intentions of constructing the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; to seal Gilneas off from the rest of the world. Godfrey pointed out that while Genn was considering building the wall through the lands of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Marley\"&gt;Lord Marley&lt;/a&gt;, constructing it through a mountainous region in Lord Crowley's domain would make for a more secure natural barrier, although doing so would cut off the northern villages of &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt;. Genn warned that Darius might not take well to having his lands cut off, but Godfrey insisted that it was the best course of action for Gilneas. The fact that this placement of the wall would make Godfrey's own lands the most strategically valuable \u2014 as they would form the realm nearest to the wall and would thus be Gilneas' buffer to the outside \u2014 did not escape Genn, but he conceded that Godfrey was right, regardless of his personal motives. As Godfrey finished his goblet of wine, he fought the urge to smile.\nThe Fall of Gilneas.\nGodfrey is first seen at &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Manor\"&gt;Greymane Manor&lt;/a&gt; after Genn learns about the apparent death of &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;. He was told to have the towns near the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; go on full alert against the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; that attacked Halford, and he also wanted the woods searched. Godfrey believed it was a waste of time to search, but he would make it happen.\nA few days later, a number of nobles were asking Greymane about the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; just outside their wall, the missing livestock in the countryside, and the &lt;a href=\"Starlight%20Slasher\"&gt;Starlight Slasher&lt;/a&gt; murders. Godfrey asked what the king intended to do about the worgen, and Greymane replied he would instate a curfew. Godfrey scoffed, insisting he be given ten men and set loose on the Blackwald to hunt them. He accused Greymane of going soft and proposed that he take a respite and leave the decision-making to someone else. Greymane told Godfrey to watch his treasonous tongue, then ordered him to leave.\nLord Vincent Godfrey spent his life defending the kingdom of Gilneas. When the worgen curse ravaged this land, Godfrey was one of the first Gilneans to take up arms against the beasts. During the evacuation of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, Godfrey argued with Genn about rescuing &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and prefer leaving the traitor to be killed by the worgen rather than saving him.\nThe day of the worgen attack on Gilneas City, Godfrey and two guards witnessed Halford Ramsey and &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; escaping the city and being trailed by feral worgen. One of the guards asked if they should intervene, but Godfrey wanted to see how it played out. Belysra fended off the beasts with the light of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;, and Halford noticed Godfrey and the soldiers. Belysra called out to them that they were not his enemies, but Godfrey replied by shooting Halford in the chest. One of the soldiers asked what to do about Belysra, but Godfrey said whatever she is, she's not Gilnean and to leave her to the wolves.\nFollowing the evacuation of Gilneas City, the cursed Gilnean hero is confronted by Godfrey in a cage in &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, who reminds them of what they were before the curse and revealing that they were spared because the Gilneans still hoped that they can be saved, wondering if there is still a shred of humanity left within them. Later the hero is found to have been put in stocks and Godfrey tells &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt; that it is \"time to put this one down\" in accordance with protocol. However, King Greymane intercedes, asking if those who gave their lives so the survivors could escape were following \"protocol\". This interaction and later actions reveal that Godfrey is prejudiced against those that have been afflicted with the worgen curse. After the Forsaken started their invasion, Godfrey went to the fields near Duskhaven where he worked with the adventurer to fight the forsaken on the battlefield, the two captains of Forsaken ships and to kill the leader of the assault &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Thyala\"&gt;Dark Ranger Thyala&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, he accompanied Genn to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; where he met Darius and demanded to support the war against the Forsaken. After Genn revealed his worgen form to them, Darius agreed. Days later, Greymane traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tempest%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Tempest's Reach&lt;/a&gt; with Godfrey and &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;. While in the carriage, Godfrey held Greymane at gunpoint and decided that the only way to negotiate with the Forsaken was if he had something they wanted. Krennan called Godfrey an idiot, warning him that Greymane was a worgen, and Godfrey tossed the alchemist out of the carriage in response. At Tempest's Reach, Godfrey told the king it would not be long now before he began negotiating with the Forsaken. He kidnaps Greymane and holds him for ransom, believing he would be able to save Gilneas if he turned the king over to the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. A worgen &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; sent by Krennan killed &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Baron Ashbury&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Walden\"&gt;Lord Walden&lt;/a&gt; and suddenly appeared behind him. Greymane told his old friend it was over and not to make it difficult, but in response Godfrey jumped off the cliffside, deciding he'd rather die than have a worgen for a king.\nBecoming a Forsaken.\nLord Godfrey is later raised as a Forsaken himself by the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. Once he returned to \"life,\" he led the attack against &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;, where Lord Crowley and other survivors of Gilneas had settled. During this time he also used necromancy to resurrect &lt;a href=\"Sean%20Dempsey\"&gt;Sean Dempsey&lt;/a&gt;, who had been eaten by crocolisks, only to murder him again. He later kidnaps Crowley's daughter &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna&lt;/a&gt; and holds her for ransom as commanded by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, where he would rather kill her and raise her as a member of the forsaken, hoping to force a ceasefire between the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt; and the Forsaken. After Crowley surrenders to Sylvanas at the shattered &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; Godfrey betrays her, shooting and killing the Banshee Queen (who is shortly afterward resurrected by the Val'kyr). Now wanted by both the Alliance and the Horde, Godfrey made a run for nearby &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowfang Keep.\nSurrounded by remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and the whispering ghosts of those who've met their end in the keep over the years, Godfrey now plots the downfall of both the Alliance and Horde within Shadowfang Keep.\nLord Godfrey replaces &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; as the final boss of Shadowfang Keep in both normal and heroic modes. Both &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; want him dead.\nQuests.\nAs a quest giver.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;: \nIn &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;:\nAs a quest objective.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Ruins of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;:\nIn &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;:\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nGilneas.\nNo hard feelings, &lt;name&gt;.

It was the final confrontation between &lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt;'s demonic legions and &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;'s followers for the control of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoading screen.\n\"Later that day, at the base of Magtheridon's Black Citadel, Illidan marshals his forces for their final strike.\"\nQuests.\nMain Quests.\nShadowkeys.\n\"The Pit Lord Magtheridon rules with the absolute power of the Black Citadel and its regime of Demonic minions. Slaughter Magtheridon's two dark lieutenants, the Master of Pain and the Mistress of Torment, in order to seize their Shadowkeys and gain access to his throne chamber.\"\nSlay Magtheridon.\n\"The gates to Magtheridon's throne chamber have been thrown wide open, leaving the Pit Lord vulnerable to attack. Destroy Magtheridon so that Lord Illidan can claim power over Outland and take the Citadel as his fortress.\"\nOptional Quests.\nDisable Defenses.\n\"The seemingly impenetrable defenses of Magtheridon's Black Citadel are powered by a series of magical Generators. If someone could sneak past the guardians and destroy the Generators, each layer of defenses could be negated, allowing easy access to the rest of the stronghold. Perhaps Akama and his Draenei followers would be up to the task.\"\nSiege Bastion.\n\"Within the many halls of the Black Citadel lie old armaments of now-forgotten wars. Find and seize the old Chaos Orc Demolishers so that you can bring them to bear against Magtheridon's defenses.\"\nPrelude.\nAfter successfully closing Magtheridon's Shadow Portals and thereby cutting off the mighty Pit Lord's supply of reinforcements, Illidan, &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt; marched upon the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Magtheridon was outraged by this development, but typically for his arrogant kind he was not unduly worried- his citadel was extremely well protected by war machines and armies of Fel orcs and demons, led by the powerful &lt;a href=\"Mistress%20of%20Torment\"&gt;Mistress of Torment&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Master%20of%20Pain\"&gt;Master of Pain&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt; made their approach he swore to crush the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Hunter\"&gt;Demon Hunter&lt;/a&gt; and his retainers.\nBattle.\nIllidan split his forces, joining Kael in a frontal assault of the Temple whilst Vashj and her &lt;a href=\"Naga\"&gt;Naga&lt;/a&gt; insinuated themselves into the vast citadel's sewer and aqueduct system. Kael and Illidan immediately ran into problems in the form of Magtheridon's infernal war machines, which slaughtered many blood elves as they assaulted the Temple gates. Fortunately, &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; arrived, pledging their services to Illidan. They were able to infiltrate the Temple and destroy the network crystals which powered the war machines, allowing Kael and Illidan's forces to overrun the gates. They claimed an armoury containing several fel orc &lt;a href=\"demolisher\"&gt;demolisher&lt;/a&gt;s, which they used to blast apart the &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt; encampments. Using the shadowy might of the Draenei again and again to sabotage Magtheridon's war machines, Illidan and Kael swept aside the fel orcs and demons to battle and then kill the Master of Pain.\nMeanwhile, Vashj and her small group of Naga routed several flotillas sent to engage them and destroyed two subterranean bases, the fel orcs proving no match for the awesome might of Vashj's &lt;a href=\"Naga%20Royal%20Guard\"&gt;Royal Guard&lt;/a&gt;. With her remaining troops Vashj then fought the Mistress of Torment and her retinue, the &lt;a href=\"Sea%20Witch\"&gt;Sea Witch&lt;/a&gt; eventually overcoming the vicious &lt;a href=\"Succubus\"&gt;Succubus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith both of his lieutenants dead, the door to Magtheridon's chambers opened. Illidan, Kael, Akama and Vashj joined forces along with several captive fel orcs and demons and assaulted the Pit Lord directly. After a terrible battle which killed many of the &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt;, Magtheridon was finally defeated. \n&lt;a href=\"Magtheridon\"&gt;Magtheridon&lt;/a&gt; was shocked by his defeat at the hands of these strangers. The beaten pit lord asked Illidan if he was an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; sent to test him. Illidan laughed and replied that he had come to replace Magtheridon.\nAftermath.\nIllidan claimed himself Lord of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;, and the remaining &lt;a href=\"fel%20orc\"&gt;fel orc&lt;/a&gt;s and demons bowed down to their new master. However, the Betrayer's triumph was short-lived; barely an hour after the battle, the skies above the Black Temple clouded and the spectral form of &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt; appeared, demanding Illidan complete his task of destroying the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. Cowed, Illidan once again gathered the Blood Elves and the Naga to him and marched upon &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. \nAs with &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, Magtheridon was originally thought dead, but instead Illidan held him captive underneath the Hellfire Citadel, using his blood to create more fel orcs."}

Separated from &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; by a narrow strait, the continent of Lordaeron stretches from the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; in the south to the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Woods\"&gt;Eversong Woods&lt;/a&gt; in the far north. Historically, the continent has been populated by &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s in the northern, western and southern regions, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s in the eastern regions; the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; in the far-northern &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. After the recent events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;War against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, however, the vast majority of the human population has turned &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, and the high elves are now mostly known as &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. The climate of Lordaeron is moderate, although the land is rugged and largely mountainous in and around the &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;. The southern, northern and western regions of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; are characterized by mild forests and farmlands whereas the north-eastern region of &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Aman\"&gt;Zul'Aman&lt;/a&gt; is covered by a thick and wild forest.\nHistory.\nThe territories of Lordaeron have seen major power shifts as of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;.\nInvasion of Gilneas.\nEmploying the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to raise a mighty army, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have begun a bold campaign to secure their hold over &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. By orders of the new Warchief of the Horde, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken mobilize and move into &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; to secure a port for the Horde in southern Lordaeron. The Forsaken have conquered much of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and have been battering the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; with their siege weapons. The Forsaken soon aligned themselves with &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Wolfcult\"&gt;Gilnean Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt; and helped him infiltrate Gilneas so that he could spread the worgen curse and sow civil discord in Gilneas. The &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; then caused the Greymane Wall and many of the nation's defenses to fall, allowing the Forsaken to invade freely. The Gilneans, now transformed into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, attempt to fight off the invaders as best they can. Eventually, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; arrive in Gilneas, bringing both vital military aid and the truth behind the worgen curse. Likewise, orcs reinforce the Forsaken forces, causing an escalation into an all-out battle between the Alliance and the Horde in the region. The Forsaken, against the orders of the Warchief to cease production, unleash their devastating &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; against Gilneas. Many of the survivors flee across the sea to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, where the night elves grant them sanctuary.\nFall of Southshore.\nThe Forsaken forces later march onto the town of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and completely annihilated all life with in the region by deploying the &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;New Plague&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt; led the ones who managed to escape Southshore and fled to the town of &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Southshore\"&gt;Ruins of Southshore&lt;/a&gt; is left inhospitable and will be so for several decades. The ramifications of the Forsaken Blight forced the high echelons of the Horde to reconsider the free use of such a potent weapon. Instead, the Horde has issued a diluted version of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Blight\"&gt;Forsaken Blight&lt;/a&gt; for the Forsaken to use. The town of Hillsbrad Fields was later finally destroyed by the Forsaken, concluding the Hillsbrad campaign initiated by &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; years ago. &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Henry%20Maleb\"&gt;Magistrate Henry Maleb&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Refugee\"&gt;Hillsbrad Refugee&lt;/a&gt;s to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where they have been taking refuge. A few Hillsbrad residents and &lt;a href=\"Magistrate%20Burnside\"&gt;Magistrate Burnside&lt;/a&gt; stayed behind and led a resistance but were eventually defeated and imprisoned by the Forsaken war machine; others remained in the &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt;, where after an attack by the Forsaken's domesticated spiders, they too were captured and are being shipped off for experimentation. Those who stayed to defend Hillsbrad eventually became prisoners in what is now known as the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;, a Forsaken death camp where the mad &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Stillwater\"&gt;Warden Stillwater&lt;/a&gt; cruelly experiments on his prisoners and even fellow Forsaken. When the other Forsaken discovered this, he was punished for his crimes against his own people, yet not for his misdeeds upon humans.\nThe Bloodfang Pack.\nEven with Gilneas falling into the hands of the Forsaken, the fighting between the Gilnean worgen and the Forsaken continues. Bloodfang worgen who had recently allied themselves with the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Gilneas Liberation Front&lt;/a&gt;, destroyed three Orc gunships that had arrived. The ships were full of supplies, weapons and soldiers. Later, the Forsaken kill some of the Hillsbrad refugees on &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; and resurrected them, bolstering Forsaken forces and somewhat making up for the loss of the three &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; gunships. However, after this attack, many of the Hillsbrad refugees decide to take the worgen curse offered by Darius, rather than be resurrected as Forsaken. Later, the Forsaken discovered that lord &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; are having a meeting in &lt;a href=\"Deep%20Elem%20Mine\"&gt;Deep Elem Mine&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; sent a squadron of elite &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Veteran Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Master%20Forteski\"&gt;Master Forteski&lt;/a&gt; to trap and slay the worgen leaders. However, the Forsaken soon discovered that instead of trapping an enemy, they were trapped themselves. As a result, the whole squadron of elite Forsaken Troopers was destroyed.\nA convoy of &lt;a href=\"Veteran%20Forsaken%20Trooper\"&gt;Veteran Forsaken Trooper&lt;/a&gt;s and Forsaken catapults were ambushed by the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; while attempting to cross &lt;a href=\"Olsen%27s%20Farthing\"&gt;Olsen's Farthing&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The ambush resulted in all those Forsaken troopers being killed and the destruction of the Forsaken catapults. &lt;a href=\"Warlord%20Torok\"&gt;Warlord Torok&lt;/a&gt; sent Sea Dogs to fight the Hillsbrad worgen that were swimming to the &lt;a href=\"Decrepit%20Fields\"&gt;Decrepit Fields&lt;/a&gt; from Fenris Isle. The Sea Dogs attacked the Hillsbrad worgen but were eventually defeated after killing many worgen.\nSilverpine Forest.\nMeanwhile, &lt;a href=\"7th%20Legion\"&gt;7th Legion&lt;/a&gt; reinforcements from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, sneaked their way into Gilneas and aided the Gilneas Liberation Front in retaking &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;. Together, the Alliance forces were able to neutralize &lt;a href=\"Rutsak%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Rutsak's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dreadwatch%20Outpost\"&gt;Dreadwatch Outpost&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Forward%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken Forward Command&lt;/a&gt;. The Forsaken forces eventually had to fall back to Silverpine Forest but not before recovering the corpses of &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; and the Gilnean traitors, whom they raised to undeath as Forsaken allies. The Gilneas Liberation Front continued to harass Forsaken forces in Silverpine while the 7th Legion retook &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s in the Gilneas Liberation Front used their bear form in guerilla warfare against &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces at the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Front\"&gt;Forsaken Front&lt;/a&gt;, which resulted in the loss of a few Horde battalions. Eventually, the Horde forces learn of this tactic, and it becomes ineffective after counter-measures are implemented.\nEventually, the tide turned. The worgen and their Alliance allies were driven back. The town of &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; was conquered by Forsaken forces and its inhabitants converted to Forsaken. Another town, &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;, was burned to the ground and the Alliance's battle plans were stolen thanks to Lord Godfrey's guidance. In a final push, Alliance and Gilnean forces met the Forsaken army on the &lt;a href=\"Battlefront\"&gt;Battlefront&lt;/a&gt; for one final battle. The Forsaken emerged victorious as the Gilneas Liberation Front was coerced to retreat back into Gilneas after Sylvanas kidnapped Lorna Crowley, and blackmailed &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; with threats to raise Lorna as an undead slave. The celebration was short-lived though as Lord Godfrey and his allies unexpectedly betrayed the Horde and assassinated Sylvanas. When Sylvanas was brought back to life, she remains determined to get her revenge on Godfrey and the Alliance and the Alliance's push on Silverpine was stemmed.\nSylvanas' leading the invasion into the area was halted by Godfrey's betrayal; ironically securing the area for the Alliance, who at this point were mostly composed of Gilneans that he had betrayed. Following the events prior to the final battle, all Forsaken land basses in Gilneas were either retaken or destroyed. Currently, the only assaults by the Horde are &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;by sea&lt;/a&gt;, as they are attempting to re-establish a land base in Gilneas to once again begin a proper invasion. The invasion by sea, which is ongoing, has met an issue as the Gilnean forces have been heavily reinforced by the Alliance, currently the Horde has been unable to properly re-establish a land base on the coast, as the Alliance has met them to deter or repel these attempts.\nFollowing the events at Silverpine Forest, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt; have since been fighting a guerrilla war with the Forsaken forces at Hillsbrad. They are later found allying with the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; and have been amassing their forces at &lt;a href=\"Purgation%20Isle\"&gt;Purgation Isle&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the efforts of &lt;a href=\"Kingslayer%20Orkus\"&gt;Kingslayer Orkus&lt;/a&gt; and Horde adventurers, their plans to launch an all-out attack were uncovered. &lt;a href=\"High%20Warlord%20Cromush\"&gt;High Warlord Cromush&lt;/a&gt; asked for reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt;, but were denied by &lt;a href=\"Drek%27Thar\"&gt;Drek'Thar&lt;/a&gt;, who despises the Forsaken's way to make war. Cromush panics at the Frostwolf clan's abandonment but later composes himself and sends Horde adventurers to blow up the Alliance vanguard forces before their offensive on Hillsbrad could begin.\nStromgarde.\nForsaken forces are later found establishing &lt;a href=\"Galen%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Galen's Fall&lt;/a&gt; for their impending invasion on the nation of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; in their plan to conquer all of Lordaeron. To aid them in their efforts, they have raised into undeath the fallen prince of Stromgarde, &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. He aids Horde adventurers in taking the legendary sword, &lt;a href=\"Trol%27kalar\"&gt;Trol'kalar&lt;/a&gt;, so that the Forsaken may use it as a weapon against the Alliance.\nForsaken forces have since tried to invade the Hinterlands and launched an all-out assault on the Highvale elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;. The combined Alliance forces were able to drive back the Forsaken assault and retain their hold over Quel'Danil Lodge.\nThe Plaguelands.\nWith the weakening of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; after the war against the Lich King, the Alliance forces led by &lt;a href=\"Thassarian\"&gt;Thassarian&lt;/a&gt; have claimed the western part of &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; forces led by &lt;a href=\"Koltira%20Deathweaver\"&gt;Koltira Deathweaver&lt;/a&gt; have claimed the eastern part of the city. The two factions are currently fighting each other for control of the whole city. During the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Andorhal\"&gt;Battle for Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken, their ranks bolstered by the use of the &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; to raise their slain foes, push the Alliance out of the city and conquer Andorhal.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the Alliance retaliated with a massive assault on the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to retake the former human kingdom. The &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; ended with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; releasing the &lt;a href=\"blight\"&gt;blight&lt;/a&gt; and rendering the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; uninhabitable, but weakening the Forsaken's control over the region considerably. Lordaeron was apparently militarily occupied by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; afterwards.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; drastically reshaped the balance of power in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, and in Lordaeron in particular, with the Alliance waging an active campaign against the remaining Forsaken settlements throughout the conflict. The Fourth War eventually ended in an uneasy armistice, and the Alliance successfully reclaimed &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; from the Forsaken, strengthening their presence considerably in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. The Alliance also triumphed in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, apparently returning most of the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; back into the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Kingdom of Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;'s sovereign control, under &lt;a href=\"Danath%20Trollbane\"&gt;Danath Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. \n&lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; remain under Forsaken control, although &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20Keep\"&gt;Lordaeron Keep&lt;/a&gt; itself remains blighted, the blight is apparently slowly receding, but it will take a long time for its lingering effects to disperse completely."}

Here, King &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt; and his ancestors ruled over their country from the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20chamber\"&gt;imperial chamber&lt;/a&gt;. The most significant treaties in all of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; had been agreed and signed in the &lt;a href=\"imperial%20hall\"&gt;imperial hall&lt;/a&gt;, which overlooks much of the city. Behind the palace itself are the &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Gardens\"&gt;gardens&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Menethil\"&gt;Menethil&lt;/a&gt; family resided here, and so did Prince &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. Various other guests stayed there over the years such as &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thoras%20Trollbane\"&gt;Thoras Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, king of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; and friend to Terenas.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the palace, along with the rest of the Capital City, were overrun by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, killing its denizens. When Arthas was later betrayed by the &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;Dreadlord Insurgents&lt;/a&gt;, he ran through the palace and used a secret passageway in his room to get out of the building. He noted that the palace was empty.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Ruined Palace is located above the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; capital of &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, a city that spans beneath much of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron's ruins&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;Terenas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Imperial%20chamber\"&gt;throne room&lt;/a&gt; and the royal crypts are still intact. The bloodstain where &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; slew his father can still be seen. The magnificent &lt;a href=\"Palace%20Gardens\"&gt;gardens&lt;/a&gt; are also accessible, though they have grown wild and play home to lurking beasts."}

Originally an &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathorian&lt;/a&gt; city-state, it was an empire by the time of its fall during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nRuled by the &lt;a href=\"Menethil\"&gt;Menethil&lt;/a&gt; family, the kingdom took part in the birth of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; shortly before the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The kingdom of Lordaeron spearheaded the Alliance forces during the campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the war. Unfortunately, the nation would be almost entirely consumed by the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, which occurred fourteen years later.\nLordaeron's territories are presently contested between the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, and the remnants of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; used to completely control the core regions of the ruined human kingdom which include, in some degree, &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, and also had a significant presence in the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; drastically reshaped the balance of power in the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, with the Alliance rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and having contested &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Vrykul.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, the Titanic Watcher left in charge of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; fell to corruption, the titan watcher, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, and his allies stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the extent of Loken's betrayal; fleeing south. Discovering the theft, Loken sent horrific monsters after Tyr's group, but Tyr sacrificed his life to fight the creatures while his comrades escaped with the discs. The &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi &lt;a href=\"General%20%28rank%29\"&gt;generals&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakazj&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kith%27ix\"&gt;Kith'ix&lt;/a&gt; engaged in combat with Tyr, the conflict ending with Tyr and Zakazj dead while the wounded Kith'ix fled to the west. The area was dubbed as \"&lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt;\" which in the &lt;a href=\"Vrykul%20%28language%29\"&gt;vrykul tongue&lt;/a&gt; translated to \"Tirisfal\". They buried Tyr and his foe where they lay and placed Tyr's massive silver hand atop his final resting place as a memorial to his valiant sacrifice. The peaceful &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; that were accompanying the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s wanted to further honor Tyr and decided to settle near the battlefield and protect the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt;; their allies respecting their wishes, though the other watchers and their creations continued further south.\nOver time, the area became a place of legend for the vrykul people in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Fleeing to this place following dictations from &lt;a href=\"King%20Ymiron\"&gt;King Ymiron&lt;/a&gt; to slaughter all malformed infants born as a result of the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;; the vrykul and their children settled within Tirisfal Glades, transforming into beings called &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. The remaining Vrykul of Tyr's group had formed the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Knowing they would not live forever; they allowed the humans to join the order. The humans that lived here were the &lt;a href=\"Lordain%27s%20tribe\"&gt;Tirisfal tribe&lt;/a&gt; of humans; laying the seeds of what would become the kingdom of Lordaeron.\nArathor.\nThe humans that lived in Tirisfal were led by the great warrior named &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt;, and were considered more refined than the uncouth and savage humans from the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The human tribes of Tirisfal were religious people and had the custom to perform rituals in their shrines across the region. &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; was considered sacred by them, and they even had pendants with its image. This was the only tribe powerful enough to end &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s dream of uniting humanity. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Alteraci%20tribe\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt;, the humans of Tirisfal did not submit to shows of force, and to win their loyalty, Thoradin had to appeal to their religious beliefs. The proclaimed human king and his personal guards made a pilgrimage to Tirisfal's shrines and sacred groves, where Thoradin performed their usual rituals; including wearing a silver hand pendant.\nAt the end of the pilgrimage, Thoradin finally met with the tribe's leader, Lordain. The king pledged that if they joined him, he would adopt their religious ways and spread them among the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;. To seal this promise, Thoradin ran his palm along the blade of his own sword, &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt;, and mixed his blood with the earth of the Tirisfal Glades while saying: \"Between our people, let this be the only blood we spill.\" And with that, the humans of Tirisfal bent the knee to their new king, with Lordain becoming one of his generals. Lordain's sister, &lt;a href=\"Mereldar\"&gt;Mereldar&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the first human followers of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, which was adopted by the Arathi as per Thoradin's promise. This would eventually give rise to the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the final days of the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, while King Thoradin and his forces were retreating to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Fortress\"&gt;Alterac Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani began to gain terrain on the humans fast, threatening to flank and overwhelm Arathor's armies. To avert disaster, General Lordain volunteered to hold back the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, knowing he would not survive. Lordain and his warriors died fighting valiantly, but their sacrifice secured the victory for Arathor and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. After the Troll Wars, many of Arathor's soldiers migrated to the fertile lands of Tirisfal where the Arathi established a central stronghold in a region which the veterans renamed as \"&lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;\" in Lordain's honor. Years later, when Arathor was fracturing, the nobles of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; departed for the fertile valleys of the north in which they would found a city-state and named it after the surrounding region, &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn time, the kingdoms gradually developed rivalries, as before the coming of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, the human kingdoms of Lordaeron faced challenges and obstacles from each other as the games of politics played out. Decades before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, while Azeroth enjoyed a time of relative peace, villages squabbled with villages, and kingdoms spied on kingdoms. In the Eastern Kingdoms, humans engaged in rigorous trade with dwarves, gnomes, and high elves. Some nations, like Lordaeron, acted as regional leaders and trendsetters, mediating disagreements between smaller kingdoms and used their strong militaries to impose order over the land. Still, others focused their resources on defending themselves from old rivals.\nFirst War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Llane%20Wrynn%20I\"&gt;King Llane&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; dispatched messengers to the other human kingdoms, warning of &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;mysterious, fearsome green-skinned invaders&lt;/a&gt;. However, no help was received as the reports were not believed. Lordaeron was considered the most likely nation to help. However, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; disguised as a visiting Stormwind noble openly mocked King Llane and claimed the threat was actually a rebellion of disgruntled citizens, causing Lordaeron to only politely wish Llane luck with his troubles.\nSecond War.\nFollowing the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; and the ending of the First War, the nation of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; fell to the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Orcish Horde&lt;/a&gt;, and not long after the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; region of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; shared the same fate. &lt;a href=\"Refugee%23Exodus%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Refugees&lt;/a&gt; from Stormwind, led by Lord &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt;, fled across the sea to the southern shores of the continent of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. There, Lothar and the young &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; convinced the leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Seven%20Kingdoms\"&gt;human nations&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the dwarven refugees of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, and the proud &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, to join forces in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nUnder the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; and Lord Lothar, the Alliance was victorious in the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, pushing the Horde back to the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, and destroying the gateway to the orcs' homeworld. Lothar fell in the assault on &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, and with the loss of his political skill, rifts developed between the Alliance nations. The main issue of dispute was a tax levied by King Terenas to finance the internment of the orcs. Though Lordaeron attempted to retain its central role, several nations pulled their support from the Alliance. Only &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; stood fast in its commitment to the Alliance, although the distance between the kingdoms of Stormwind and Lordaeron made their union a hollow one. Following the war, many &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; refugees decided to stay in Lordaeron.\nAfter the end of the Second War, Lordaeron built a military outpost along the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The outpost was raided by the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; in order to get the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; back from the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;i.\nThe kingdom later at least partially annexed the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. At the outset of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; traveled through the &lt;a href=\"King%27s%20Road\"&gt;King's Road&lt;/a&gt; toward &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;, and its inhabitants considered him their lord, with the citizens also taking up arms for Lordaeron.\nScourging of Lordaeron.\nFollowing years of debate over the internment of the orcs, the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; emerged and a &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; appeared in the north of Lordaeron. As it spread throughout the towns and cities of Lordaeron, one after another fell to the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, most notably &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. After Stratholme was purged, some former paladins, now called &lt;a href=\"Deathlord%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Deathlords&lt;/a&gt;, committed the same heinous act in many other cities across Lordaeron, but after years of constant war and suffering, some &lt;a href=\"Heretics\"&gt;members&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;clergy&lt;/a&gt; also lost their sense of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nFinally, with the corruption of the heir to the throne of Lordaeron, Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, the capital city itself succumbed. Arthas's captains, &lt;a href=\"Falric\"&gt;Falric&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Marwyn\"&gt;Marwyn&lt;/a&gt;, were responsible for the slaughter of the aristocracy. Thus, in an ironic twist of fate, it was Lordaeron that lay in ruins, with refugees streaming to &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Azeroth%20%28continent%29\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Many others later fled with &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; while remnants of the Lordaeron armies remained. After King Terenas was murdered and Capital City fell, the Scourge army swept across Lordaeron. Neighboring human and dwarven nations converged on Lordaeron to vanquish the Scourge. Even the elven &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, no longer an Alliance member, sent their priests to help defeat the undead. The Scourge was numerous and defeated any resistance. Ultimately, the Scourge took Lordaeron.\nArthas briefly assumed the title of King, and ruled as an agent of the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, before the eruption of a &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands%20civil%20war\"&gt;civil war&lt;/a&gt; between his forces, the remaining &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord%20Insurgents\"&gt;dreadlord&lt;/a&gt;s, and the &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%27%20Forces\"&gt;free undead&lt;/a&gt; (later known as the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;) led by &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. While Arthas was summoned to Northrend to defend the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Windrunner's forces, with the help of a traitor &lt;a href=\"Dreadlord\"&gt;Dreadlord&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, and the remaining &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20resistance\"&gt;Alliance resistance&lt;/a&gt; forces under Grand Marshal &lt;a href=\"Othmar%20Garithos\"&gt;Othmar Garithos&lt;/a&gt;\u2014 whom Sylvanas tricked into helping her\u2014 achieved a victory over the other dreadlords and the Undead they controlled. After the final battle, Sylvanas betrayed the Alliance remnants she allied with by ordering Varimathras and her Forsaken to kill Garithos and to slaughter the remaining Alliance resistance forces. Afterwards, they claimed the ruined former capital of Lordaeron (the \"&lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;\"), under which they inhabited the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome Lordaeron refugees managed to get to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Flynn%20Fairwind\"&gt;Flynn Fairwind&lt;/a&gt; believe that refugees of Lordaeron must have wanted a way to honor their fallen king, so they buried &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil%20II\"&gt;Terenas Menethil II&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20crown\"&gt;crown&lt;/a&gt; in an unmarked grave at the lighthouse in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;.\nAftermath.\nAfter the collapse of Lordaeron, the kingdom's territories were broken down into four major groups, those who simply claimed to be remnants of Lordaeron, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe first were the folk of southern Lordaeron which remained loyal to the Alliance. These humans once controlled two towns, Southshore and Hillsbrad Fields. Southshore was the most important of these townships, and the only port north of the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt; under Alliance control. To the north, nestled in the rolling foothills of Alterac laid the rich &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt;. The town controlled an important mine on the coast, &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt;. These towns found some support from neighboring forces; such as the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the shielded Dalaran. West of Hillsbrad, the Gilnean towns of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt; were also friendly; the latter of which receiving aid from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. It is unknown if the two towns directly aided those in Hillsbrad, but the dire curse laid upon Pyrewood by the mage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; left the village turning into feral monsters known as &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; during the nights. To the south of the town laid a series of refugee camps outside of the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; that were made up of Lordaeron's former citizenry. The &lt;a href=\"Hinterlands\"&gt;Hinterlands&lt;/a&gt;' local dwarves, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; remained in firm control of their holdings, contending more with the local trolls than undead (a matter they were aided with by the High elves of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Danil%20Lodge\"&gt;Quel'Danil Lodge&lt;/a&gt;). Lastly, the Alliance held some presence in the Plaguelands by way of &lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Camp\"&gt;Chillwind Camp&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; held lands scattered throughout northern Lordaeron, and at one stage were by far the most numerically well-endowed of the human factions of the former kingdom. Unfortunately, the faction was so fearful of the undead that they attacked virtually any individual on sight. They held several key positions in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, including farmlands in the west, and their great stronghold in the region, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; along the north coast. In the &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; they once controlled the entire northern part of the zone from &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt;. They also formerly maintained a presence in &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;. In the Eastern Plaguelands, they controlled &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;, and controlled the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Enclave\"&gt;Scarlet Enclave&lt;/a&gt; as a massive, although it has become depopulated due to invasion by the Scourge, and migration to Northrend. They also controlled the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Bastion\"&gt;Scarlet Bastion&lt;/a&gt;, a region of the once mighty city of &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Argent Dawn, controlled the least amount of territory. Though they had camps spread around the Plaguelands, the Argent Dawn was primarily found at &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;. Having splintered off from the Scarlet Crusade, the Argent Dawn took a more level-headed approach to the war with the Scourge. They opened their ranks to all willing to aid them, accepting Horde and even Forsaken into their ranks.\nThe Forsaken managed to take control of the heart of the old kingdom, claiming the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; beneath) as their base of operations. They used it to keep hold over much of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, and control the towns &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Deathknell\"&gt;Deathknell&lt;/a&gt; along the main east-west road of the region. They also control &lt;a href=\"The%20Sepulcher\"&gt;The Sepulcher&lt;/a&gt; in the center of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the town of &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nBeyond these four factions, a few other factions had managed to claim territory that once belonged to Lordaeron. The Syndicate, in an attempt to punish Lordaeron for its role in the fall of their kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt; took the fortress of &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20Keep\"&gt;Durnholde Keep&lt;/a&gt; and the surrounding countryside, although the &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt\"&gt;Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt; (a league of assassins) have attempted to curb their strength from their base at &lt;a href=\"Ravenholdt%20Manor\"&gt;Ravenholdt Manor&lt;/a&gt; (which also lies in former Lordaeron).\nFinally, the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; held core areas of Lordaeron such as &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt; in the southern &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. The necromancer traitor, &lt;a href=\"Thule%20Ravenclaw\"&gt;Thule Ravenclaw&lt;/a&gt;, ruled over swaths of Silverpine Forest in the name of the Scourge. Scourge undead mindlessly wandered countless areas of &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=\"Devlin%20Agamand\"&gt;Devlin Agamand&lt;/a&gt; commanding some of their forces in &lt;a href=\"Agamand%20Mills\"&gt;Agamand Mills&lt;/a&gt;. The Scourge were overwhelmingly the dominant force in much of Lordaeron, with a presence in all its zones except the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, Lordaeron's landscape changed dramatically.\nThe Forsaken strengthened their grip on &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; by conquering &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ambermill\"&gt;Ambermill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; and attacking the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; on the hills overlooking Hillsbrad, as well as &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt; in the Western Plaguelands. Tarren Mill was reinforced, with many farmsteads in Silverpine being converted into bases such as &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20High%20Command\"&gt;Forsaken High Command&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken%20Rear%20Guard\"&gt;Forsaken Rear Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Tirisfal Glades was dominated by Forsaken power, with areas such as &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt; being rebuilt in the new architecture of the Forsaken. They scored major victories against every Alliance force in the north with the exception of the Wildhammer clan and Quel'danil Lodge.\nThese accomplishments effectively collapsed the Alliance's hold over any part of Lordaeron. Southshore's destruction as well as that of Hillsbrad Fields led to many of its surviving remnants to head to &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt;. There, the survivors took over &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; as a last stand for their people. They eventually joined with the Gilnean forces that came into the area past the now collapsed Greymane Wall, turning into Worgen in order to prevent themselves from being turned into undead by the Forsaken's new &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. This joint force was eventually defeated and a bulk of their leadership slain. The people of Hillsbrad Fields became monstrous undead in horrific experiments being conducted in what was once their home, the &lt;a href=\"Sludge%20Fields\"&gt;Sludge Fields&lt;/a&gt;. The survivors of &lt;a href=\"Azurelode%20Mine\"&gt;Azurelode Mine&lt;/a&gt; were held as captives by the Forsaken and sent to the Sludge Fields. The last of Alliance presence in Lordaeron was in Andorhal, where the Forsaken warred to claim the area against them. The Horde was ultimately victorious, laying claim over the entirety of the city. With this destruction, the Alliance was reduced down to Chillwind Camp, Aerie Peak, Quel'danil Lodge, and the Stormpikes.\nThe Argent Dawn was reformed during the war with the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. This crusade commanded wide swaths of land in &lt;a href=\"Western%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Western Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;; taking control of &lt;a href=\"Hearthglen\"&gt;Hearthglen&lt;/a&gt; and a number of farmsteads across the region as well as &lt;a href=\"Northridge%20Lumber%20Camp\"&gt;Northridge Lumber Camp&lt;/a&gt;. The Crusade also took command of the various towers that dotted the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Plaguelands\"&gt;Eastern Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;, with Light's Hope being reinforced and the city of &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; eventually getting conquered by the &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Brotherhood of the Light&lt;/a&gt; in the name of the Argents. Due to their neutral nature, the Argents ended up becoming the closest representation of the living in Lordaeron in the wake of the Forsaken's victories.\nThe Scarlet Crusade presence was reduced heavily. Most of their citadels of power were conquered either by the Forsaken or the Argent Crusade; leaving them only with a few holdings in Tirisfal Glades. Those outside of Tirisfal were either obliterated or turned into the undead &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;. These forces too were eventually defeated by the Argents.\nThe Syndicate was removed from Durnholde Keep, but remained active in Strahnbrad. The Scourge suffered dramatically following the Cataclysm. They lost the majority of their holdings outside of the Eastern Plaguelands, where they maintained their strongest grip. In Western Plaguelands, the Cult of the Damned attempted to fight both the Alliance and Horde for Andorhal but were ultimately routed back to Scholomance. Some Scourge remained in Tirisfal Glades; though their threat was effectively diminished to a nuisance in the area. The Scourge was effectively completely removed from Silverpine Forest after Thule lost control of Fenris Keep.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe modern-day &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, with forces led by &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, attempted to regain control of Lordaeron's capital during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in response to the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, the ruined capital was left &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;blighted&lt;/a&gt; and unclaimed.\nThe Alliance and Horde forces waged an active campaign against each other throughout the formerly Forsaken-controlled lands, in an attempt to gain hold over the remaining regions of Lordaeron.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; eventually ended in an uneasy armistice between the two sides, but the Alliance managed to capture and reclaim &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. The neighboring Gilneans also re-established control over their once hold of &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; under the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt; remained under Forsaken control. \nPeople and culture.\nLordaeron's &lt;a href=\"Team%20color\"&gt;national colors&lt;/a&gt; are both white and blue. In ' Lordaeron forces are represented in blue (white is notably not a playable color as it was in ') while in ' Lordaeron is instead most commonly represented as a light blue. Along with the Lordaeron sigil, both twin and single-headed &lt;a href=\"eagle\"&gt;eagle&lt;/a&gt;s often adorn Lordaeron banners and tabards. &lt;a href=\"Lion\"&gt;Lion&lt;/a&gt;s are also a common symbol.\nSomething originating from Lordaeron is called \"Lordaeronian\".\nLike the other realms, the Kingdom of Lordaeron applied the death penalty for its criminals, the task being accomplished by an &lt;a href=\"executioner\"&gt;executioner&lt;/a&gt;, including hanging as gallows were present in their cities, such as &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;. After his &lt;a href=\"excommunication\"&gt;excommunication&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that he would in turn be hanged for his treason by saving &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt; from his execution. The court of King Terenas employed &lt;a href=\"High%20Executor%20Wroth\"&gt;Wroth&lt;/a&gt; as a royal torturer. The town of &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt; had its own court and tribunal, and allowed the death penalty by hanging.\nLordaeronian revere the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; played a significant role in Lordaeron society. Centuries ago, Lordaeron's leaders codified the different Light-based traditions and belief systems. From these efforts, the Church of the Holy Light came to be. Lordaeron served as the home of this church and became a popular destination for travelers seeking healing, wisdom, and inner peace. The church constructed &lt;a href=\"temple\"&gt;temple&lt;/a&gt;s and shrines throughout the far-flung human lands, and it created a hierarchy of religious leaders to oversee its followers. The most important places of worship were located in the verdant &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;. Among the oldest and most revered of these holy sites were &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andorhal\"&gt;Andorhal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt;. Thus, the armies of Lordaeron were said to be deeply religious, while Capital City had its own cathedral, where &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; met for the first time.\nMilitary.\nSoldiers and citizens from Lordaeron.\nSee also: &lt;a href=\"Durnholde%20military\"&gt;Durnholde military&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"1st%20Legion\"&gt;1st Legion&lt;/a&gt;\nTerritories.\nBy the time of the Third War, the kingdom of Lordaeron controlled the &lt;a href=\"Eastweald\"&gt;Eastweald&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, the northern part of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, the majority of the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and parts of the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;Alterac Mountains&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"Chillwind%20Point\"&gt;Chillwind Point&lt;/a&gt;, and the town of &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt;). Also the region of &lt;a href=\"northern%20Lordaeron\"&gt;northern Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, which is currently a &lt;a href=\"closed%20zone\"&gt;closed zone&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn Warcraft II.\nLeader: \"&lt;a href=\"King%20Terenas\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt;\"\nNation Color: \"White\"\nBackground: \"Ruled by the benevolent King Terenas, the nation of Lordaeron stands as the last bastion of hope for humanity.

During the war, he sacrificed himself to hold off a large force of &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; that threatened to destroy the Arathorian host. The region (and later the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;city&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;) of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; was named in his honor.\nBiography.\nLordain was a great &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; who led the &lt;a href=\"Lordain%27s%20tribe\"&gt;unnamed people&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. They were the only human tribe powerful enough to end the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt; king &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s plan of uniting the humans into a single nation, and they would not submit to shows of force. To win their loyalty, Thoradin and his guards appealed to their religious beliefs by making a pilgrimage to the region's sacred sites and performing rituals according to the custom of Lordain's people. At the end of the pilgrimage, Thoradin met with Lordain and promised that if the tribe joined him, he would spread their mystic ways among the Arathi. To seal his promise, Thoradin ran his palm along the edge of his sword, &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt;, and mixed his blood with the earth of Tirisfal while telling Lordain: \"Between our people, let this be the only blood we spill.\" Lordain and his people thereafter bent the knee to Thoradin. Thoradin considered Lordain to be a \"great friend\".\nLordain became one of Thoradin's two most prominent generals in his nation of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;, the other being &lt;a href=\"Ignaeus%20Trollbane\"&gt;Ignaeus Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; began encroaching on Arathor's borders, Thoradin sent the two generals to gather intelligence on their foe and prevent them from straying too deep into the empire. Lordain and his regimented warriors thoroughly patrolled Arathor's northern borders and killed any Amani raiding parties that approached the kingdom. During the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, Lordain and Ignaeus acted as the vanguard of Arathor's army, riding days ahead of the human host as it marched to meet the Amani army in &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;. After engaging the trolls, Thoradin's army began a slow retreat south to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Fortress\"&gt;Alterac Fortress&lt;/a&gt; in order to lure the trolls into a trap. At one point during the retreat, the Amani began gaining on the humans too fast and threatened to flank and overwhelm them. Lordain volunteered to waylay the trolls, knowing full well that he would not survive. He and five hundred of his warriors held off the Amani host in a narrow valley, sacrificing their lives in order to allow the rest of the Arathi army to continue south. Their sacrifice helped secure the humans' and their &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; allies' victory in the war.\nLegacy.\nLordain's legacy of pure selflessness and sacrifice lived on among his people in the millennia that followed. After the Troll Wars, many humans settled in the Tirisfal Glades and renamed the region \"&lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;\" in honor of Lordain. Centuries later, many of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt;'s noble families migrated to the region and founded a city-state which they also named &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; after the surrounding region.\nOne of the soldiers Lordain saved was his sister, &lt;a href=\"Mereldar\"&gt;Mereldar&lt;/a&gt;, who after the war became one of the first humans to come in contact with the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Lordain's nephew, &lt;a href=\"Kelsing\"&gt;Kelsing&lt;/a&gt;, moved to Lordaeron after the war and intended to protect the place named after his uncle \"until [he] was buried next to him\", which indicates that Lordain's body was buried somewhere in Lordaeron."}

They were led by the great warrior named &lt;a href=\"Lordain\"&gt;Lordain&lt;/a&gt;, and were considered more refined than the uncouth and savage humans from the &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Mountains\"&gt;mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The human tribes of Tirisfal were religious people and had the custom to perform rituals in their shrines across the region. &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"The%20Silver%20Hand%20%28artifact%29\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; was considered sacred by them, and they even had pendants with its image.\nThis was the only tribe powerful enough to end &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s dream of uniting humanity.\nHistory.\nUnlike the &lt;a href=\"Alteraci%20tribe\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt;, the humans of Tirisfal did not submit to shows of force, and to win their loyalty, Thoradin had to appeal to their religious beliefs. The proclaimed human king and his personal guards made a pilgrimage to Tirisfal's shrines and sacred groves, where Thoradin performed their usual rituals. He even wore a silver hand pendant.\nAt the end of the pilgrimage, Thoradin finally met with the tribe's leader, Lordain. The king pledged that if they joined him, he would adopt their mystic ways and spread them among the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20tribe\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;. To seal this promise, Thoradin ran his palm along the blade of his own sword, &lt;a href=\"Strom%27kar%2C%20the%20Warbreaker\"&gt;Strom'kar&lt;/a&gt;, and mixed his blood with the earth of the Tirisfal Glades while saying: \"Between our people, let this be the only blood we spill.\" And with that, the humans of Tirisfal bent the knee to their new king, with Lordain becoming one of his generals.\n&lt;a href=\"Knight\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt;ly in appearance and mindset, Lordain's forces patrolled the edges of &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor&lt;/a&gt;'s northern borders. On the rare occasions that &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; raiding parties approached the human kingdom, Lordain's soldiers put them to the blade.\nDuring the final days of the &lt;a href=\"Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, while King Thoradin and his forces were retreating to &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Fortress\"&gt;Alterac Fortress&lt;/a&gt;, the Amani began to gain terrain on the humans fast, threatening to flank and overwhelm Arathor's armies. To advert disaster, General Lordain volunteered to hold back the &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt;s, knowing he would not survive. He and five hundred of his bravest warriors held off the Amani in a narrow valley while the rest of the Arathorian army retreated.

Along with Darrowmere, this lake has been marked by many events that took place around it. Here, many &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;s, at the age of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, that were prosperous, have been found around the lake's shores and nearby mountains, including &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;.

However, they were ultimately removed by the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;.

By the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, however, it was ultimately claimed by the Alliance again, as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20Pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt; overtook the Horde forces there and claimed it for themselves. The Horde later distracted these forces to evacuate &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; refugees across the lake. The Fenris Isle apparently remains under &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;'s control even after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThis freshwater lake is enormous, occupying a great fraction of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;'s midwest.

Now, &lt;a href=\"Dawning%20Isles\"&gt;Lordamere's isles&lt;/a&gt; are infested with monsters and its shores polluted with &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; filth. The lake borders five separate regions and provides an untapped means of transport between these areas.\nLordamere contains an island called &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Isle\"&gt;Fenris Isle&lt;/a&gt; on which the ruined &lt;a href=\"Fenris%20Keep\"&gt;Fenris Keep&lt;/a&gt; lies.

It is not even possible for Maraad to know if Durotan died with the fur, thus it's possible that it's not meant to be literal.\nDurotan's eyes.\nThe eyes color of young Durotan was brown (and red when consumed with bloodlust), but when depicted older, his eyes color was blue.\nLocations.\n&lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\nSpeculation.\nDurotan's eyes.\nThis may probably imply that the orcish eyes color change with age.\nVarian's knowledge and placement in the timeline.\nIt is possible that this meeting with Maraad and Varian happened after repelling the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; invasion in the Blasted Lands. It may be supported by the facts that Varian already knew all about the enemy, a thing that he would learn from the &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20the%20King\"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;. More importantly, the Alliance king said - marching forces into Draenor - which may imply that Blasted Lands was already retaken. It would mean that the Alliance and Horde forces were stationed in front of the Dark Portal canyon, as evidenced by the chess pieces.\nDespite this, the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde%20Invasion%21\"&gt;first introductory quest&lt;/a&gt; to the Ironmarch counterattack already introduced you the name of the enemies."}

{"id": "14453", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14453", "title": "Lore", "text": "Lore in the Warcraft series of games is a term used for \"background story\". The use of the term stems from Blizzard's snippets of \"lore\" for many of the multiplayer maps in their Warcraft RTS games, although how much of it has a relationship to the main &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt; storyline is unclear.\nWhat is \"canon\" lore?\nCanon is a term oft-used to refer to official lore, specifically the fictional accounts in the Warcraft universe. It is used to define which lore should be considered a genuine part of the universe's history. \nThe Warcraft 'canon' comprises those works and sources of information considered to be authoritative and representative of the 'true' or official history of the Warcraft universe. Therefore, 'canon' or 'canonical' lore is that which is part of this body of work, and is thus considered part of the true history of the Warcraft universe.\nIn contrast, 'non-canon' information, while often containing characters and depicting events from canon sources, is not necessarily a reliable source of official information regarding the Warcraft universe. An example of non-canon lore might be a piece of fan fiction which introduces new characters or events, or expands upon the background of a known character such as Thrall. \nCharacters, events and items from non-canon sources do not necessarily exist in the official Warcraft universe. Non-canon versions of known events may differ substantially from official sources. Non-canon sources frequently feature characters from canon lore, but their exploits in these sources are not considered canon. \nNote that even canon lore is sometimes contradictory (or &lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retconned&lt;/a&gt;), often representing the beliefs or perspectives of an individual or group, rather than any absolute truth. Nonetheless, the beliefs themselves can be considered a genuine part of the Warcraft universe as &lt;a href=\"flavor%20lore\"&gt;flavor lore&lt;/a&gt;, regardless of their accuracy.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nAzeroth's scale.\nThe representation of the world in \"World of Warcraft\" is not entirely canon as Azeroth's scale had to be reduced for gameplay purposes. For example, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; is a lot bigger than we see in the game. Similarly, &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; is bigger in lore as evidenced in the \"&lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Azeroth\"&gt;Battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;\" cinematic. The \"\" series also offers of the world, continents and islands, than the in-game world map; for instance, the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; are shown to be roughly the size of the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; is about the size of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the .\nFor example of continental size, &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; in-game is about 20,920 yards, or roughly 19 kilometers long from the bottom of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; to the tip of &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt;. When compared to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa\"&gt;Africa&lt;/a&gt; in real life, which is about 8,000 kilometers long, Kalimdor is a meager 0.002375% the size of Africa. As such, Kalimdor would be somewhere around 421 times longer in lore than it is in-game if the size of Azeroth is comparable to &lt;a href=\"https%3A//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth\"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt; and Kalimdor to Africa.\nDungeons, quests, mobs and other.\nSometimes, player actions in dungeons are not taken into consideration, as observed in the story of &lt;a href=\"Blackfathom%20Deeps\"&gt;Blackfathom Deeps&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that the players / adventurers killed its inhabitants, when the dungeon was updated, it was stated that the inhabitants were killed by the new inhabitants instead of players / adventurers. Another example may be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; encounter where players from both factions killed the Emperor, but \"\" established that Dagran was killed by the Alliance agents. Another one may be seen in the original &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt; dungeon with the &lt;a href=\"Corrupted%20Ashbringer/Scarlet%20Monastery%20Event\"&gt;Ashbringer event&lt;/a&gt; which were made non-canon as they were retconned by the .\nSeveral quests and quest lines become non-canon and retconned when overwritten by a later source of lore such as the ending of the &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%27s%20Lair%20attunement\"&gt;questline&lt;/a&gt; (originally available since Vanilla) being replaced by the story of ' (happening between the events of ' and \"\").\nIn several occasions, \"\" brought continuity errors, such as mobs being killed (their heads being brought to the quest givers) but remained alive after the revamp (such as the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Weldon%20Barov\"&gt;Weldon Barov&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexi%20Barov\"&gt;Alexi Barov&lt;/a&gt;). Sometimes, these \"deaths\" were explained as having evaded death and being just wounded as in case of &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Valorcall\"&gt;Lieutenant Valorcall&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe final cinematic of \"\" doesn't seem to be entirely canon as Blizzard stated that &lt;a href=\"Archimonde%20%28Hellfire%20Citadel%20tactics%29\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; died in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; instead of at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Gate\"&gt;Black Gate&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Tanaan%20Jungle\"&gt;Tanaan Jungle&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nBlizzard's universes.\nAlthough some easter eggs exist within the Diablo, Starcraft and Warcraft games, the Diablo and Warcraft lore is separate.\nWowpedia's position on canon lore.\nWowpedia strives to have a on official lore due to it being rarely discussed by &lt;a href=\"Blizzard%20Entertainment\"&gt;Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, although examples exist:\nWhile we cannot stop the use of the term \"canon\" in talk page discussions, the term is not allowed in articles. The only exceptions are when one is denoting RPG information, or when verifiable public quotes from actual first-party Blizzard employees (such as Chris Metzen) are allowed in articles, and then only if there are direct links to the sources of the quotes.\nFor more on Wowpedia's lore policy, see ."}

The Breath of Rukhmar was named after their sun goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and channeled the energies of the sun into incredibly destructive power.\nBackground.\nThe weapon was used two thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt; as they marched on &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;. When it was first activated, a violent tremor shook the spire as solar energies roared through it and a white-hot beam exploded from the mechanism to lance through Taala's chest, blowing it apart in a cloud of spores and ash. The Breath of Rukhmar sliced through the &lt;a href=\"botani\"&gt;botani&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"genesaur\"&gt;genesaur&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Gnarled\"&gt;Gnarled&lt;/a&gt;, incinerating thousands in an instant. The few that survived retreated to Talador in terror, but they were engulfed in flames by the Apexis's Anhari order. The forests that had crept into Arak were seared away. Once the attack was halted, blackened earth and smoldering roots stretched as far as the eye could see.\nCenturies later the Breath of Rukhmar was destroyed when the Apexis fell into civil war between the Anhar order and its counterpart, the Skalax which used &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt;. The civil war engulfed the spire for many months, and to turn the tide of the conflict the Anhari harnessed the Breath of Rukhmar. As the weapon ignited the Skalaxi leader knew they would be doomed against it and led a handful of his most gifted sorcerers to the top of the spire where they stormed through the Anhari guards. As the Anhari cut down the intruders the Skalaxi leader weaved a spell to destabilize the Breath of Rukhmar. It worked, but the result was catastrophic: a furious explosion erupted from the Breath of Rukhmar, instantly killing most of the arakkoa on the spire and shattering the land into several smaller spires.\nRise of the Horde.\n1,200 years after the Apexis fell, a recreated Breath of Rukhmar would come to be known as the crystal superweapon or Focusing Iris. Created by &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;High Sage Viryx&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt; artifacts, the superweapon focused the power of the sun to destroy the Adherents' enemies. It was used by the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; to scorch the settlements of their ancient enemies, the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. The main focusing lens was located on top of the pinnacle of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; itself, whilst the secondary lens was located on top of a nearby, shorter spire. Two other focusing lenses, which &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt; called false suns, were located at the &lt;a href=\"Windswept%20Terrace\"&gt;Windswept Terrace&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Dawn\"&gt;Terrace of Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. It does not seem to be as powerful as the original Breath of Rukhmar, based on the original's description in \"Chronicle\".\nDuring the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kargath%20Bladefist\"&gt;Kargath Bladefist&lt;/a&gt; temporarily allied with the Arakkoa Outcasts to kill the Adherents of Rukhmar and destroy the weapon. What the Outcasts lacked in numbers they made up for with their magic and destroyed the mechanism atop the city. A blinding explosion tore through the sky and set the heavens aflame.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nAt the beginning of the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak%20storyline\"&gt;Spires of Arak storyline&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the weapon fired on &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Akraz\"&gt;Veil Akraz&lt;/a&gt;, burning it to the ground. &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Zekk\"&gt;Veil Zekk&lt;/a&gt; was also destroyed. The weapon also played a role in the fight with &lt;a href=\"High%20Sage%20Viryx\"&gt;High Sage Viryx&lt;/a&gt;, as she called down the powerful focusing lens to scorch the ground beneath her foes. In this universe, it was eventually rendered useless by destroying the two smaller focusing lenses.\nA &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-empowered version may be under construction/reclamation at the &lt;a href=\"Farlight%20Terrace\"&gt;Farlight Terrace&lt;/a&gt;, if not just a similarly-shaped object."}

Brendon is from &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; and joined the Faire as a child to escape from his family, specifically his father who tried to kill him. When he first encountered &lt;a href=\"Silas%20Darkmoon\"&gt;Silas Darkmoon&lt;/a&gt;, he recalls telling him \"I never want to see my family again.\" As a result, Brendon spent most of his childhood and adult life at the Faire. Sadly, Brendon is now deceased and the cause of his death is unknown.\nThe city of Strom stopped being known as Strom many centuries before \"World of Warcraft.\" Assuming the dialogue writer did not actually mean &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;, it would seem that Brendon has been dead for a very long time and Silas Darkmoon is much older than he appears.\nSpeculation.\nIt could be worth speculating that Brendon died at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Rona%20Greenteeth\"&gt;Rona Greenteeth&lt;/a&gt;, whom happens to sell various foods that originate from her victims of various races. This is slightly reinforced by the fact that Rona sells meat with reference to human remains. In addition, Brendon's ragged clothing might indicate he was in a sort of prison or cage at one point. The presence of cages hanging from trees north of Rona's location (and near where Brendon's ghost wanders) also help reinforce this.\nIf Rona did not kill Brendon, then he possibly died at the hand of wildlife or some other means.\nIn the case that Strom isn't an error, and they really meant Strom and not Stromgarde, it's also possible Brendon may have died of old age.\nHe could be related to &lt;a href=\"Robert%20Paulson\"&gt;Robert Paulson&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Paulson\"&gt;Lieutenant Paulson&lt;/a&gt;."}

It is the busiest market and largest trade hub in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; outside of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;, with the surrounding farmland serving as a breadbasket for the whole kingdom.\nIts importance would make it a major target for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, during which they attacked and overran large parts of the town. In response to this threat and others, Brennadam would become a center for the &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt; militia in protecting the inhabitants of the valley, and for &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; forces as they lent aid to their Kul Tiran allies.\nHistory.\nBrennadam, and all of &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;, historically fell under the authority of &lt;a href=\"House%20Stormsong\"&gt;House Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;, a dynasty which ruled the area since &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s first arrived there. Eventually, the valley grew into the agricultural heart of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, and Brennadam became a thriving market town for its produce, located near the border with &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, however, the area would descend into danger and chaos as multiple threats appeared to terrorize its citizens. As the local farmers suffered attacks from &lt;a href=\"quilboar\"&gt;quilboar&lt;/a&gt;, House Stormsong itself succumbed to the whispers of a &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;dark presence&lt;/a&gt; and turned its back on its people. Without protection, Brennadam almost fell when the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; began an invasion of the region on the orders of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;. It was only with the aid of a newly-formed militia, bolstered by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, that Brennadam's citizens were able to hold back the assault and rescue the unarmed civilians who were being slaughtered by the Horde.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Roz\"&gt;Mayor Roz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Calvin\"&gt;Sergeant Calvin&lt;/a&gt;, Brennadam's defenders fought the Horde in the western section of the town, who were equipped with war &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s and siege weaponry. While evacuating civilians and putting out major fires, the militia would also assassinate the Horde's field commander, &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Lockjaw\"&gt;Champion Lockjaw&lt;/a&gt;. By commandeering an enemy &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; war machine, Alliance heroes were also able to decimate reinforcements coming from &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt;, securing the safety of Brennadam.\nAt the same time, Brennadam would serve as a base for &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Pike\"&gt;Brother Pike&lt;/a&gt;, one of the remaining &lt;a href=\"tidesages\"&gt;tidesages&lt;/a&gt; not taken in by &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Stormsong\"&gt;Lord Stormsong&lt;/a&gt;'s corruption. Many of the town's citizens would gather outside his house and demand answers for the recent disasters. Pike and heroes of the Alliance would eventually set off from Brennadam with the goal of getting to the bottom of these mysteries.\nAs these events took place, a militia faction formed from local volunteers and uncorrupted tidesages would come into being. Known as the &lt;a href=\"Storm%27s%20Wake\"&gt;Storm's Wake&lt;/a&gt;, they made it their mission to protect the citizens of Stormsong Valley from their recent woes, and Brennadam would become their central hub.\nInhabitants.\n\"For the inhabitants of the western portion of town, see &lt;a href=\"Brennadam%20Square%23Inhabitants\"&gt;Brennadam Square&lt;/a&gt;.\""}

Both Brennadam and the valley helped feed the entire kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; for generations. As the nation's breadbasket, the settlement would become a strategic target for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; when they invaded the island during the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nOn orders from &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, a force of Horde soldiers launched a surprise attack on Brennadam from their base at &lt;a href=\"Warfang%20Hold\"&gt;Warfang Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Caught unawares, many unarmed civilians were killed when Horde &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt;s devastated Brennadam Square. This was quickly followed by ground troops, who continued to slaughter any Brennadam villagers they could. The attack, led by &lt;a href=\"Champion%20Lockjaw\"&gt;Champion Lockjaw&lt;/a&gt;, soon threatened to overwhelm the entire town.\nThough caught by surprise, Brennadam's citizens managed to form a small militia to stop the Horde's rampage from spreading. Led by &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Roz\"&gt;Mayor Roz&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Calvin\"&gt;Sergeant Calvin&lt;/a&gt;, they established a cordon leading across the bridge from Brennadam Square to the southern part of town across the river. However, the attackers continued to ravage the square until help came from &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;champions&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, recently arrived in Stormsong.\nWith the villagers' help, they thinned the Horde's ranks while also putting out many of the fires destroying the town, and disarming Horde bombs dropped from the air. They targeted Lockjaw himself, and retrieved &lt;a href=\"Warchief%27s%20Orders\"&gt;the orders&lt;/a&gt; from the Warchief off his corpse. Finally, as enemy reinforcements threatened to arrive from the north, the defenders commandeered an &lt;a href=\"Experimental%20War%20Machine\"&gt;Experimental War Machine&lt;/a&gt; belonging to the Horde that was set up on a hill overlooking the town. The machine's guns were trained on the arriving reinforcements, decimating them and stopping the Horde's attack from succeeding.\nAttacks from the Horde in Stormsong Valley would continue on Brennadam Square throughout the war, though the invaders were always contained and prevented from taking the rest of Brennadam."}

{"id": "296491", "revid": "234131", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=296491", "title": "Brewfest", "text": "Brewfest is a holiday loosely based on the Bavarian . It contains quests and novelty things such as outfits, kegs, and riding rams. The main events are just outside of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, although there are also beer gardens set up outside of all the major cities. The only small exception to this is Shattrath; its beer garden is between the Aldor/Scryer elevators, likely so the city's sanctuary status would continue to be easily maintained. (There are even &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil%20Pink%20Elekk\"&gt;Teldrassil Pink Elekk&lt;/a&gt; to be seen within this area by the inebriated.)\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%205.4.0\"&gt;patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20Tsing\"&gt;Brewmaster Tsing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20Tao\"&gt;Brewmaster Tao&lt;/a&gt; set up a tent at the &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Grounds%20%28Dun%20Morogh%29\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Grounds%20%28Durotar%29\"&gt;Grounds&lt;/a&gt; outside &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; respectively, offering drinks created by pandaren brewmasters from across &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;. These brews are regularly sold only on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.0\"&gt;patch 8.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, Brewfest was updated to include many more races, including recently-released &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;s such as &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiran humans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Void%20elf\"&gt;void elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20troll\"&gt;Zandalari troll&lt;/a&gt;s and such. In &lt;a href=\"patch%2010.1.7\"&gt;patch 10.1.7&lt;/a&gt;, Brewfest expanded into &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nEvents, minigames, and quests.\nCampground Chaos.\nEvery thirty minutes, one group of either &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt;'s lackeys, &lt;a href=\"Mischevious%20Alemental\"&gt;Mischevious Alemental&lt;/a&gt;s, or &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt; attack the festivities. Fend them off by drinking an &lt;a href=\"Alcohol-Free%20Brewfest%20Sampler\"&gt;Alcohol-Free Brewfest Sampler&lt;/a&gt; (or eighteen) and bonking the attackers on their heads with the empty bottles. Defeat all of the invaders and they will leave behind an object on the ground that can be looted once a day and turned in for 10x &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt;. In contrast to previous years, the humanoid invaders (but not the alementals) can also be attacked and damaged like normal mobs.\nOnly one of these three quests can be completed a day. Even if players fend off different types of attackers, only one of the quests will be offered.\nBrewfest Chowdown.\nFour players compete in an eating contest to clean ten plates of brats the fastest without choking. Each brat adds ~25% to the player's 'fullness' bar, which slowly goes down on its own, or players can take a drink to knock off 50% of the bar. Don't let the bar fill or the player will choke for three seconds, preventing all actions. Each plate has a random amount of brats to be eaten (from two to four), and after clearing a plate players must manually call for another.\nThe first time players participate for the quest &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Chowdown\"&gt;Brewfest Chowdown&lt;/a&gt;, they will acquire 25x &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt;. Winning will award players a &lt;a href=\"Chowdown%20Champion%20Token\"&gt;Chowdown Champion Token&lt;/a&gt;. Trade in five champion tokens for a &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Chowdown%20Trophy\"&gt;Brewfest Chowdown Trophy&lt;/a&gt;. Well-played games take two minutes to complete, and after the contest players are debuffed with Full Stomach, preventing them from competing again for three minutes.\nBrew For Brewfest.\nWhat good is Brewfest without brew? The organizers have opted to rope participants into the work by having them run kegs from a nearby town in exchange for 2x &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt; each run. Before doing the run, players are taught the mechanics in one-off quests &lt;a href=\"Now%20This%20is%20Ram%20Racing...%20Almost.\"&gt;Now This is Ram Racing... Almost.&lt;/a&gt; to learn the four mount speeds, and &lt;a href=\"There%20and%20Back%20Again\"&gt;There and Back Again&lt;/a&gt; to learn the route and location of the apple barrels (and pick up 10 tokens).\nAfter learning the route, players will be given the daily quest &lt;a href=\"Brew%20For%20Brewfest\"&gt;Brew For Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;. Completing the quest \"instantly\" starts the minigame, and plants players on the mount. If not ready to start the game, don't complete the quest! The mount buff lasts for four minutes, and thirty seconds are added to the buff with each run, so good runners can clear north of fifteen runs (worth 30 tokens) each day, as efficient runs take roughly 45 seconds to complete. Dismounting will end the run for the day.\nFor more details and tips, see the &lt;a href=\"%23Racing%20ram%20tips\"&gt;racing ram tips&lt;/a&gt; section.\nCoren Direbrew.\nLevel 10+ players can queue for the &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt; encounter in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. The first time players kill him, he drops &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%27s%20Dire%20Brew\"&gt;Direbrew's Dire Brew&lt;/a&gt;, which starts &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%27s%20Dire%20Brew%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Direbrew's Dire Brew (quest)&lt;/a&gt;. Killing Coren also awards the achievement &lt;a href=\"Direbrewfest\"&gt;Direbrewfest&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnce a day, he will drop a &lt;a href=\"Keg-Shaped%20Treasure%20Chest\"&gt;Keg-Shaped Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt; for level players, or a &lt;a href=\"Keg-Shaped%20Treasure%20Box\"&gt;Keg-Shaped Treasure Box&lt;/a&gt; for level 10+ players, which contains 10-15x &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt;, and a rare chance of some of the following:\nDirebrew also directly drops trinkets:\nBarking for Brews.\nPlayers can choose to bark for one of two competing breweries each day using a loaned racing ram (just like on the keg runs). The wrinkle is that there are no apple barrels to clear the ram's exhaustion bar, so players will need to pace their rams. Players will earn 15x &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt; each day by completing one of the following quests:\nValdrakken dailies.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;, players may complete two daily quests, each worth 10x &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=\"Bubbling%20Brews\"&gt;Bubbling Brews&lt;/a&gt;, dragonriding through bubbles near the questgiver, and &lt;a href=\"Barreling%20Down\"&gt;Barreling Down&lt;/a&gt;, riding a barrel of brew from the &lt;a href=\"Ruby%20Enclave\"&gt;Ruby Enclave&lt;/a&gt; and dodging obstacles on the way.\nOne-off quests.\nWhen Brewfest begins, players will get a breadcrumb to the festivities from commoners in capital cities, in the form of the quest &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%21\"&gt;Brewfest!&lt;/a&gt;. Should players skip the breadcrumb, &lt;a href=\"Welcome%20to%20Brewfest%21\"&gt;Welcome to Brewfest!&lt;/a&gt; is offered instead. Both quests offer a free drink.\nFirst-time revelers will be offered the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Supplier%20of%20Souvenirs\"&gt;A New Supplier of Souvenirs&lt;/a&gt;, which rewards the &lt;a href=\"Overflowing%20Purple%20Brewfest%20Stein\"&gt;Overflowing Purple Brewfest Stein&lt;/a&gt;.\nPlayers can learn how to fend off invasions by drinking beers and chucking the empties at a &lt;a href=\"S.T.O.U.T.\"&gt;S.T.O.U.T.&lt;/a&gt; for 10x &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt; in the quest &lt;a href=\"Chug%20and%20Chuck%21\"&gt;Chug and Chuck!&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the event grounds, should players find themselves drunk (whether from alcohol or the &lt;a href=\"Synthebrew%20Goggles\"&gt;Synthebrew Goggles&lt;/a&gt;), they will be able to see &lt;a href=\"wolpertinger\"&gt;wolpertinger&lt;/a&gt;s. Capture five for &lt;a href=\"Catch%20the%20Wild%20Wolpertinger%21\"&gt;Catch the Wild Wolpertinger!&lt;/a&gt; to earn the &lt;a href=\"Wolpertinger%27s%20Tankard\"&gt;Wolpertinger's Tankard&lt;/a&gt; battle pet, awarding the achievement &lt;a href=\"Does%20Your%20Wolpertinger%20Linger%3F\"&gt;Does Your Wolpertinger Linger?&lt;/a&gt;.\nContinuing the drunk escapades, players are asked to go on a world tour in &lt;a href=\"Pink%20Elekks%20On%20Parade\"&gt;Pink Elekks On Parade&lt;/a&gt;, using their provided &lt;a href=\"Elekk%20Dispersion%20Ray\"&gt;Elekk Dispersion Ray&lt;/a&gt; to dispel three elekks outside other capital cities. This is worth 40x &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt;!\nThe Tapping of the Keg.\nAt a little past 6:10 AM and 6:10 PM region time (CEST or PDT), representatives from the breweries arrive at their faction's respective Brewfest camp to give a short speech and just before 6:15, tap the small keg on the stand at the Brewfest grounds. Characters attending this ceremony receive a Brewfest Enthusiast buff granting 10% extra experience for two hours. If a character still has the buff from an earlier Tapping, the duration will not be refreshed, so players should be sure to cancel their existing buff before trying to get a new two hour one. This buff does persist through death.\nCollectables and rewards.\nBrewfest offers many rewards for players who participate, most of which are available for purchase using the event currency: &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Prize%20Token\"&gt;Brewfest Prize Token&lt;/a&gt;. Players can earn roughly 90 tokens a day:\nMounts.\nTwo mounts are \"rarely\" contained in the &lt;a href=\"Keg-Shaped%20Treasure%20Chest\"&gt;Keg-Shaped Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt;, which drops from &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt; once a day for max-level players:\nShould players manage to loot one they will earn the achievement &lt;a href=\"A%20Brew-FAST%20Mount\"&gt;A Brew-FAST Mount&lt;/a&gt;.\nPets.\nOne pet is a quest reward:\nThree pets can be purchased for each:\nToys.\nSix toys are available for purchase from the token redemption vendors &lt;a href=\"Blix%20Fixwidget\"&gt;Blix Fixwidget&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belbi%20Quikswitch\"&gt;Belbi Quikswitch&lt;/a&gt;:\nOne toy is available for purchase from the sausage vendors &lt;a href=\"Keiran%20Donoghue\"&gt;Keiran Donoghue&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bron\"&gt;Bron&lt;/a&gt;:\nOne toy is a reward for winning the Brewfest Chowdown five times:\nFood and drink.\nMany vendors sell themed food and drink from their faction. Sampling a sufficient variety of food and drink will award the achievements &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Brew%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Strange Brew (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Strange%20Brew%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Strange Brew (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Brewfest%20Diet\"&gt;The Brewfest Diet&lt;/a&gt;. They are also eligible for the general achievements &lt;a href=\"Tastes%20Like%20Chicken\"&gt;Tastes Like Chicken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Happy%20Hour%20Somewhere\"&gt;It's Happy Hour Somewhere&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe origin of Brewfest is recounted in the graphic novel \"&lt;a href=\"Pearl%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Pearl of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\".\nShortly before traveling to Kalimdor and meeting the halfbreed &lt;a href=\"Rexxar\"&gt;Rexxar&lt;/a&gt;, the famous pandaren brewmaster &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt;, having been overwhelmingly recommended to try Thunderbrew beer, found his way to Dun Morogh and &lt;a href=\"Grimbooze%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Grimbooze Thunderbrew&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Distillery\"&gt;Thunderbrew Distillery&lt;/a&gt;, challenging the dwarf to a drinking contest to decide who was the better brewer. In the end, when the two were nearly passed out, Chen declared Grimbooze to be superior. However, Grimbooze liked Chen's beer more. After a brief and lighthearted argument, the two decided to hold a contest in Dun Morogh for all dwarves to taste their drinks and decide. &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt; whined his way into getting a position in the contest as well. In the end, Chen and Grimbooze were neck-in-neck while Coren only had two votes, one from himself and one from Chen out of pity. The Dark Iron attacked them in anger, and Chen fought him off. Grimbooze's brew was declared the victor by a single vote.\nThe festival continued annually, with the Gordok ogres replacing Coren and the Barleybrew dwarves replacing Chen, eventually evolving into the modern Brewfest. Coren Direbrew, never forgetting his humiliation, has led attacks on the festival every year since.\nIt's a shame that Direbrew couldn't keep his temper in check, for while his brew at the time may have been substandard, his current &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%27s%20Dire%20Brew\"&gt;Dire Brew&lt;/a&gt; could have been the talk of Brewfest... if he hadn't gotten himself uninvited all those years ago.\nBrewfest now holds appeal among all the races of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; and beyond, serving as a celebration of both Azerothian and brew culture. &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s lead the celebrations on the side of the Horde. Being a contrarian, Coren Direbrew kept attacking the Alliance festivities despite the Dark Iron clan formally joining them before.\nGrimbooze's son &lt;a href=\"Ragnar%20Thunderbrew\"&gt;Ragnar&lt;/a&gt; co-hosts the tapping of the keg with &lt;a href=\"Maeve%20Barleybrew\"&gt;Maeve Barleybrew&lt;/a&gt;, but while giving their speech, claimed that it was his father that founded the festival, without mentioning Chen at all.\nBrew and buffs.\nBrewfest is about brew, and the brew is good, and is cheap or free. \nThere are three brew vending stalls in the Brewfest celebrations, selling brews for various levels. Two sell faction-specific brew selections, and both celebrations have neutral ogre brew vendors. The brews vended by the brewers are both &lt;a href=\"tipsy\"&gt;alcoholic&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=\"drunk\"&gt;inebriating&lt;/a&gt;), refresh &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; like a &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;, and provide a &lt;a href=\"Well%20Fed\"&gt;well fed&lt;/a&gt; buff, similar to the &lt;a href=\"Rumsey%20Rum%20%28brand%29\"&gt;Rumsey Rums&lt;/a&gt;. The brewers have representatives at other cities vending the same brews. There are three vendors vending three kinds of brew each, several tiered by level allowed to drink and a few high-end brews with different buffs. The prices are good relative to similar mana refreshments. Beware, these Brewfest libation items, labeled \"requires Brewfest\", disappear when Brewfest ends. \nNote that &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; has a small celebration with three brew vendors. Whereas the other cities' vendors are strictly faction specific, not counting the ogre vendors common to both factions, one of the vendors in Shattrath is a neutral goblin wearing a dwarf mask selling dwarven &lt;a href=\"Thunderbrew%20Apprentice\"&gt;Thunderbrews&lt;/a&gt;. The third vendor in Shattrath is an Orc selling &lt;a href=\"Drohn%27s%20Distillery%20Apprentice\"&gt;Drohn's brews&lt;/a&gt;, who will not sell to Alliance characters. \nThere are also four smaller stalls, three selling food, a &lt;a href=\"bread\"&gt;bread&lt;/a&gt; vendor, a &lt;a href=\"cheese\"&gt;cheese&lt;/a&gt; vendor, and a &lt;a href=\"meat\"&gt;sausage&lt;/a&gt; vendor, and one wine vendor selling other normally available inebriating drinks. The food vendors sell both special Brewfest items and normal vended food. The specific Brewfest foods have a well-fed buff and cost half as much as similar level vendor food that do not provide a buff. Beware, these Brewfest repast items, labeled \"requires Brewfest\", also disappear when Brewfest ends. These vendors are at the main celebrations only. These vendors will not sell cross-faction, but the same Brewfest food is available from both factions vendors.\nThere is an achievement, &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Brew%20%28Alliance%29\"&gt;Strange Brew (Alliance)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Strange%20Brew%20%28Horde%29\"&gt;Strange Brew (Horde)&lt;/a&gt; to sample each purchasable Brewfest brew, and an achievement, &lt;a href=\"The%20Brewfest%20Diet\"&gt;The Brewfest Diet&lt;/a&gt;, to sample each purchasable Brewfest food. These food and drink items also count toward the &lt;a href=\"Tastes%20Like%20Chicken\"&gt;Tastes Like Chicken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"It%27s%20Happy%20Hour%20Somewhere\"&gt;It's Happy Hour Somewhere&lt;/a&gt; achievements.\nOne sample, a choice of three, is given as a reward by the lead-in quest to find the Brewfest. This includes an option for the lowest brew that anyone can drink, thus, all can participate. This sample is the same item as you would purchase from one of the brew vendors, and counts toward the drinking achievements.\nBrewfest Steins.\nA &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Stein\"&gt;Brewfest Stein&lt;/a&gt; is awarded for the completing an easy Souvenir quest (see \"Quests\" below) which will allow you to drink a few of these selections for free. These are used to collect a drink from the sample kegs, of which there are three available, one for each vendor. One of these is again the lowest brew that anyone can drink. The sample kegs are available at the main celebrations and at the city celebrations, but note that the ogre's samples at the city celebrations look like a wagon full of smaller kegs, not like a huge keg. These samples have the name of the purchasable brew and cause inebriation, but do not count toward the drinking achievements. \nYou can use the Brewfest Stein to collect a sample of brew that is above your level. Drinking this will cause you to vomit shortly afterward. \nYou can also collect samples of brews of the other faction from their sample kegs. These will act as normal for a brew of their level of your own faction. Drinking a cross-faction sample does not count for any achievement. \nThe complementary sample brews used to pelt the Dark Iron dwarves are now non-alcoholic, and so actively participating in the defense will no longer get you plastered. These also do not count toward the drinking achievements. \nOther than the brewers there are many Brewfest Revelers around getting drunk, cheering, and dancing. Having a /drink with one of the Brewfest Revelers will reward you with a 15 stamina buff for 30 minutes.\nFor those who want to control their impairment, a pair of &lt;a href=\"Synthebrew%20Goggles\"&gt;Synthebrew Goggles&lt;/a&gt; are available for the asking from or . These goggles give a \"buff\" that simulates inebriation for the purposes of Brewfest and can be removed quickly by removing the goggles (normal inebriation requires time to dissipate).\nBrewfest mounts.\nTwo holiday mounts, the &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Swift Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Brewfest%20Kodo\"&gt;Great Brewfest Kodo&lt;/a&gt;, are available as rare loot from defeating the holiday boss encounter, &lt;a href=\"Coren%20Direbrew\"&gt;Coren Direbrew&lt;/a&gt;. Once per day after queueing for and defeating him using the &lt;a href=\"Dungeon%20Finder\"&gt;Dungeon Finder&lt;/a&gt; tool, players will receive a &lt;a href=\"Keg-Shaped%20Treasure%20Chest\"&gt;Keg-Shaped Treasure Chest&lt;/a&gt; that has a low chance to contain either mount. Despite being clearly Alliance- and Horde-themed, either mount is an equally likely drop for any player regardless of faction.\nIn the first Brewfest in 2007, &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Swift%20Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Swift Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt; were purchased, not looted. The &lt;a href=\"%22Honorary%20Brewer%22%20Hand%20Stamp\"&gt;\"Honorary Brewer\" Hand Stamp&lt;/a&gt; was sold for 600 , which started a quick quest that allowed the player to purchase the mounts with gold. Any player who has completed the quest can still purchase the rams, but the Hand Stamp itself is no longer obtainable. Therefore, the &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%20Ram\"&gt;Brewfest Ram&lt;/a&gt; is only available to those players. Note that both factions offered Rams for purchase; the Kodo was introduced later.\nToken redemption.\nThere are several items you can get from redeeming . To redeem your tokens, or turn 2007's into tokens, visit \nLarkin Thunderbrew and Ray'ma remain available all year round and will vend to you if you have Brewfest Prize Tokens, but as of Brewfest 2009, it is no longer possible to buy from them after Brewfest since the Tokens now disappear the moment Brewfest ends. (For Brewfest 2008 they redeemed Brewfest Prize Tokens for some time after Brewfest 2008 ended (as long as your tokens had not expired, several days, depending on when you earned them.) They did not offer to vend after Brewfest unless you were carrying at least one Brewfest Prize Token. It was, for instance, possible in 2008 to purchase a Wolpertinger from them for cash as long as you were carrying a Brewfest Token.)\nSince 2007's prize tickets do not expire, it is best not to convert them into tokens until you want to use them to make a purchase.\nNote that any item labeled 'requires Brewfest' disappears when Brewfest ends. The hops, in particular, come in multiple varieties (only three per faction), but only the &lt;a href=\"Preserved%20Brewfest%20Hops\"&gt;Preserved Brewfest Hops&lt;/a&gt; remains after Brewfest. (The buff from a hops to change your mount remains in force when Brewfest ends, for the duration of the buff.) \nQuests.\nContinuing to help out Brewfest.\nAfter completing the quest \"There and Back Again\" by your respective faction, you will unlock the quest the previous two were training you for: &lt;a href=\"Brew_For_Brewfest\"&gt;Brew_For_Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; from your faction's . There is a unique daily to help out by delivering more ale from the village/crash site to the . Once accepted, this quest will automatically complete itself; the amount of tokens that are rewarded is completely up to you and your ram racing skill.\nJust as the previous quests, this quest gives you a &lt;a href=\"Rental%20Racing%20Ram\"&gt;Rental Racing Ram&lt;/a&gt; for four minutes. If the &lt;a href=\"Rental%20Racing%20Ram\"&gt;Rental Racing Ram&lt;/a&gt; buff is dispelled or canceled, you cannot restore it; you simply have to wait for dailies to reset. If you accidentally &lt;a href=\"Blink\"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt; yourself off the ram, you will have consumed your attempt. If you are shapeshifted, you will be unable to mount the ram, but you will have consumed your attempt. When the mechanic is started, you will be given &lt;a href=\"Ram%20Racing%20Reins\"&gt;Ram Racing Reins&lt;/a&gt;, however, you can also request them from the neighboring NPC to get a head start, usually to place the reins in a favorable action bar slot.\nThe quest mechanic works the same as the \"There and Back Again\" quest, except that for each successful delivery, you are awarded an extra 30 seconds on your &lt;a href=\"Rental%20Racing%20Ram\"&gt;Rental Racing Ram&lt;/a&gt; buff and .\nThe maximum number of tokens that can be obtained is debatable. It is known that the ram racing buff will last a maximum of 15 minutes, regardless of all other factors (including any time the buff shows). However, within that limit, the number of potential runs is limited by the time it takes to deliver each barrel:\nIgnore any remainder on the number of runs - partial runs do not count. Remember that each run gives , so for example, if you have 6 successful runs you will receive . Multiple contributors have reported several runs of 23 rounds, which is just over 39 seconds on average (remembering the first round is slower), and hits the 15 minute maximum duration for the buff.\nInvasions.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%208.2.0\"&gt;patch 8.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, the enemies that invade Brewfest camps are &lt;a href=\"hozen\"&gt;hozen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"alemental\"&gt;alemental&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Alcohol-Free%20Brewfest%20Sampler\"&gt;Alcohol-Free Brewfest Sampler&lt;/a&gt;s come in handy.\nDirebrew's lackies.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%20Invader\"&gt;Direbrew Invader&lt;/a&gt;s attack, they need to be knocked out by mugs. Once the attacks are repelled, &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%20Cog%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Direbrew Cog (quest)&lt;/a&gt; can be picked from &lt;a href=\"Direbrew%20Cog\"&gt;Direbrew Cog&lt;/a&gt;.\nHozen.\nDuring hozen attacks, &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20Raider\"&gt;Hozen Raider&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20Flyer\"&gt;Hozen Flyer&lt;/a&gt;s need to be knocked out. Once the attacks are repelled, &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20Totem%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Hozen Totem (quest)&lt;/a&gt; can be picked from &lt;a href=\"Hozen%20Totem\"&gt;Hozen Totem&lt;/a&gt;.\nDefeat\nAlementals.\nDuring alemental attacks, &lt;a href=\"Mischevious%20Alemental\"&gt;Mischevious Alemental&lt;/a&gt;s need to be knocked out. After the alementals are defeated, &lt;a href=\"Contained%20Alemental%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Contained Alemental (quest)&lt;/a&gt; can be picked from &lt;a href=\"Contained%20Alemental\"&gt;Contained Alemental&lt;/a&gt;\nDark Iron attacks pre-8.2.\nEvery half hour, a party of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Guzzler\"&gt;Dark Iron Guzzler&lt;/a&gt;s will crash the party at the main Brewfest grounds outside Ironforge and Orgrimmar. Hitting these dwarves with a beer mug will knock them out cold, thus 'killing' them and stopping them from stealing the free brew. Here's how you can participate in saving the free brew for the invited guests:\nPick up a &lt;a href=\"Alcohol-Free%20Brewfest%20Sampler\"&gt;Alcohol-Free Brewfest Sampler&lt;/a&gt; from any one of the square tables. Using this item will cause you to quickly drink it and throw the empty mug. Staying in range (roughly 40 yards) of the NPCs that represent each brewery around the area while using a complementary brew sampler will cause the Barkers and Brewmaidens to toss you another sample. If you need to, you can always manually loot another one from the table.\nIf there are Dark Irons close enough and in front of the player, the mug you throw will likely hit one of them in the head and knock them out. It is a random chance and does not depend on character level. This is a somewhat unique battle in WoW where a low-level character can contribute as much as a high-level character. It is useful to bind the mug to a hotkey in order to drink and throw rapidly. The mug works even with no Dark Irons around; it will either hit your target or if you have no target it just lands on the ground.\nIt is not useful to chase the Dark Irons. The empty mugs travel quite far, and moving interrupts throwing. In addition, the Dark Irons have a brawling move that throws player characters away from them and interrupts throwing mugs, so keeping your distance allows you to attack more often. Standing behind a keg you are defending prevents the Dark Irons from reaching you. The mugs have an adequate range, but you may find that you need to move forward if you've eliminated all of your targets.\nFrequently, &lt;a href=\"Super%20Brew%20Stein%E2%80%8E\"&gt;Super Brew Stein\u200e&lt;/a&gt;, which are large silver mugs, will be placed on the ground. Walking through one of these mugs will give the player a whirlwind attack buff for several seconds. When one such mug is placed on the ground, a Barker/Brewmaiden will yell out \"\". If you get the buff, aim yourself at large groups of Dark Irons to stun them en mass. Note that this ONLY stuns them, it does not kill them off - but this may be more effective; the stun time appears to be longer than the replacement time, and the replacement rate seems to target a fixed number of Dark Irons invading. In general, stunning groups of dark irons will turn them into sitting ducks, allowing other players enough time to pick off individuals, then take out the stationary groups.\nSuper Brew Steins can also be ridden over with a mount. Using a mount with a 'tall footprint' such as gnome &lt;a href=\"Mechanostrider%20mounts\"&gt;Mechanostrider mounts&lt;/a&gt;, troll &lt;a href=\"Raptor%20mounts\"&gt;Raptor mounts&lt;/a&gt; or blood elf &lt;a href=\"Hawkstrider%20mounts\"&gt;Hawkstrider mounts&lt;/a&gt; should allow you to view the red trail easier. You will gain the Drunken Master buff while being able to speed around on a mount. Being mounted will also let you get to the Steins much faster and allow other players to focus on defense. If you are level 60, you can use your flying mount. Oddly, the Steins can be taken by combat pets, and even stranger, the &lt;a href=\"Blingtron%204000\"&gt;Blingtron 4000&lt;/a&gt; can also receive the buff. On the very rare occasion, a Barker/Brewmaiden can spawn the mug right in front of themselves and end up with the buff instead.\nBeating the waves of Dark Irons is a group effort: there are too many and the drink and toss rate is too low for any one character to do this by themselves. Your assistance is always welcome by other defenders, but if you are setting aside time to do this for the quest tokens, do it at a time when the server, particularly PvP servers, is busy so that you will be part of a heavily defended Brewfest celebration. On the other hand, surprisingly few people can succeed at this defense. \nThe &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Mole%20Machine%20Wreckage\"&gt;Dark Iron Mole Machine Wreckage&lt;/a&gt;, a large cog, only spawns if the Dark Irons are defeated, which is accomplished by defending the free beer kegs for five minutes. It will offer the quest &lt;a href=\"This%20One%20Time%2C%20When%20I%20Was%20Drunk...\"&gt;This One Time, When I Was Drunk...&lt;/a&gt; so you can get your tokens. One way to tell that things are going well is if the Dark Iron Song is sung all the way through, which is five minutes. If at least one keg survives the attack, the players win. \nYou do not have to take part in the defense in order to collect this quest. The cog is available for anyone to loot if the defenders are successful. You can log several characters out near the cog and rapidly switch and loot the cog when it appears. The cog will remain for 15 minutes. \nThe \"Chug and Chuck!\" quest is training for how to throw the mugs to do the defense, but you do not have to complete the \"Chug and Chuck!\" quest first. You do have to loot a sample mug from a table in order to participate, and the sample mugs behave like conjured items; they disappear when you log out, and you will have to loot another one to participate in a defense. The \"Chug and Chuck!\" mugs are the same lootable mugs as the defense mugs and can be used for the defense. \nYou can defend against the Dark Iron attack at the opposing faction's Brewfest celebration, but you will not have replacement mugs tossed to you, you will have to loot them from the tables, and you will not be able to loot the Dark Iron cog for the daily quest if successful. (It doesn't make sense that the cog would know your faction, but it does make sense that neither faction's quest end point will reward you for the defense.) If you attempt this, it is helpful to stand on or near one of the tables. \nThe defeated Dark Irons running toward their exit point can still be attacked and will still knock you back. Stunned Dark Irons who revive late can occasionally be seen running to the despawn point after their conveyance has departed. \nIf you need to clear a bag slot quickly (see ram racing below), the lootable defense mug is a good item to toss, since it can be easily replaced.\nDuring the first Brewfest event in 2007, a stacking mark buff was awarded to individual players based on how many Dark Irons they had knocked out, which could then be turned into tickets. However, this system was chaotic and unreliable at best, and the attacks had to be disabled for the rest of the holiday. For 2008 the Dark Iron Mole Machine Wreckage was implemented instead.\nIt used to be that the event was harder to do if you have good graphics. With poor graphics, you did not get the full effect of &lt;a href=\"Drunk\"&gt;inebriation&lt;/a&gt; from the alcoholic &lt;a href=\"Complimentary%20Brewfest%20Sampler\"&gt;Complimentary Brewfest Sampler&lt;/a&gt;, and could still see your targets. With good graphics, as the defense progresses, you became plastered, your screen blurs, and your targets will be vague blobs. The mechanics of the defense do not require you to see your targets to hit them, but it is useful to be able to see where defense is needed, and that part gets harder. Many players simply decided to disable the effect. To disable the visual effect of inebriation, type the following command (without the quote marks) into your game chat window: \"/console ffxGlow 0\". (If you desire to re-enable the effect, simply change the zero into a one, like so: \"/console ffxGlow 1\".)\nDark Iron Song, sung by the unseen &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Herald\"&gt;Dark Iron Herald&lt;/a&gt; during the event:\nRacing ram tips.\nSeveral of the quests involve the racing rams, including the barking runs and the keg delivery. The ram racing event mechanics do not depend on character level.\nThe rams have 5 speeds, controlled through the special button (Giddyup!) that appears above your action bar. Using Giddyup! \"encourages\" the ram to speed up; encourage it enough times and its speed increases (see the speed table below). It takes a few Giddyups to go up to the next speed, and you have to Giddyup on a regular basis to stay in any one speed range. Using Giddyup more frequently than the maintenance rate will speed up the ram's pace, while not using it for a while will slow down. Binding the extra action button or the &lt;a href=\"Ram%20Racing%20Reins\"&gt;Ram Racing Reins&lt;/a&gt; to a hotkey allows easier and more precise control of the reins while steering with the mouse. The first ram practice quest teaches you how to achieve the speeds and provides an opportunity to set up hotkeys.\nIf the ram is worked up to its two highest speeds, Canter and Gallop, the player gets a stacking debuff called Ram Fatigue. If this debuff stacks to 100, the ram becomes exhausted and slows almost to a crawl for 15 seconds. The lower speeds cause stacks to go back down. Running directly past an apple barrel, placed in predefined locations along the keg delivery route, clears all stacks instantly. It is essential to manage ram fatigue; the two repeatable ram racing events, keg delivery and barking, require two different strategies for doing so.\nThe keg delivery quest (but not the barking quests) gives players the &lt;a href=\"Ram%20Racing%20Reins\"&gt;Ram Racing Reins&lt;/a&gt;. The item can be used to perform the same effect as the Giddyup! special button. The easiest way to do this is to place the item on the action bar and hit the corresponding key. The item can also be obtained by talking to a nearby NPC. While clicking the special button may be simpler for some, it is far more restrictive to regularly click the button with the mouse while steering at the same time. Players aiming to optimize the ease and longevity of their ram riding may therefore wish to make use of the Reins item or bind a hotkey to the Extra Action button; it is also possible to make a &lt;a href=\"macro\"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt; with \"codice_1\", performing the same function.\nKeg delivery.\nThe daily quest to deliver kegs completes immediately rather than remaining active during the activity. Upon completion, the player is immediately mounted on the ram by receiving the &lt;a href=\"Ramstein%27s%20Swift%20Work%20Ram\"&gt;Ramstein's Swift Work Ram&lt;/a&gt; buff, and will automatically receive and deliver kegs when riding near the appropriate NPCs as long as this buff is active. If the buff expires or the player is dismounted, the quest cannot be abandoned, reacquired, or reset until the next day.\nThe initial 4-minute duration of the ram is increased by 30 seconds for each keg delivered. However, the buff has a maximum total duration of 15 minutes. Even delivering the 23rd keg, which increases the duration to 15m30s, still results in automatic dismount at the 15m mark. Galloping the whole way, a single keg trip can easily take as little as 40\u201360 seconds, earning you 2 , meaning that expert ram riders can stretch out the 4-minute keg run to 10 minutes or more, getting more than 20 Brewfest Prize Tokens. (The 2007 event allowed for 50, but this was only a temporary increase from the norm to make up for the Dark Iron attacks being disabled.)\nApple barrels are placed along the keg delivery route which resets the Ram Fatigue debuff to zero when a player rides past at a close distance. This allows galloping at full speed for the entire delivery run, maximizing the number of deliveries possible before time is up. The apple barrels work on any ram, but the barking run does not have barrels along most of the route, only one or two that might be used near the beginning before entering the city.\nReceiving the benefits of each barrel is critical to a successful run, as the typical routes are set up to only visit essential barrels, so exhaustion will occur if an intended barrel is skipped. Players should keep a close eye on the fatigue stacks to make sure they disappear each time. It's more expedient to return to a barrel that failed to clear fatigue, than to suffer exhaustion by continuing onward.\nPlayers with lag may find that riding past the barrels does not always trigger fatigue removal. Ramming the barrels for a few moments and then sliding around them usually compensates for this. An alternate method is to make an arcing, banana-shaped path around the barrel resulting in a longer path through the barrel's trigger radius without having to pause forward movement. Jumping in the proximity of the barrel seems to give you a fraction of a second longer for the fatigue dispel to proc. This extra time in proximity to the barrel will reduce the chance that you will miss your reset and exhaust your ram. (The 2007 Brewfest allowed stopping at a barrel momentarily by pressing the \"back up\" key, but this is no longer possible.)\nPlayers receive an emote, item notification, and sound indicating the keg has been acquired when they get close enough to the correct NPC. However, these do not occur until around a second \"after\" the pickup has in fact been triggered. Even later, the NPC can be seen throwing the keg to you; the keg itself will travel slowly through the air, usually reaching the ram a few seconds later. Turning in the keg works similarly, but this time tokens are added to the bags while the keg is removed.\nBoth picking up a keg and returning one are triggered while still at a significant distance from the related NPC, especially picking up. Because of this, with practice, you can turn back from the NPC around a second before confirmation of the hand-off has been received. Use visual landmarks, such as the distance from the nearest fence, to mentally mark the earliest possible cut-off point. While risky, this can shave substantial amounts of time off your run, allowing you to return more kegs each time. If a hand-off fails to trigger, simply immediately race back toward the NPC before too much time is lost.\nThe best time of day is when the server is least busy, since fewer events will fail to trigger due to server load. Typically, evenings are busiest and best avoided.\nOptimal path for Alliance.\nThere are four apple barrels along the route - barrel 1 in the ram pen, barrel 2 at the crossing, barrel 3 at the gnome house (new in 2008); this was moved to across the street in 2009, and barrel 4 in Kharanos behind the keg thrower (moved in 2009 to near the carts on the other side of the street). You should avoid using barrel 4, since barrel 3 is so close to the keg thrower. Just make a quick 180 shortly before you'd ride past the guard (Ironforge Mountaineer), and ride back to barrel 3. Similarly, you should avoid using barrel 1, since barrel 2 is so close to the keg receiver. Just make a quick 180 shortly after you ride into the clearing where the receiver stands. You should use as few barrels as possible; each entails a slight but cumulative delay. There are a few fast routes, but you will have to compromise some guidelines.\nOptimal path for Horde.\nSince 2011 and due to the , the path for the keg run was dramatically changed, forcing players to ride through a heavily obstructive blockade.\nIf jumping the fence and riding through the center of the blockade works is too tricky, follow this course instead:\nWhatever the route, the Horde course features ample apple barrels, with little reason or good opportunity to skip them. Because of this, the player should keep the ram at full speed for the entire duration.\nGeneral tips.\nYou can also hold down your left mouse button after rotating the view to remain facing where you've turned the camera. While doing this, pressing the right mouse button will instantly change the direction as above.\nAnother tip to try and maximize your runs involves jumping. If you jump while your ram is Galloping, then in midair you switch to Canter, you can get a few seconds of Gallop speed with the fatigue cost of Canter. So with some good timing you can get 2 to 4 seconds of free Gallop time between the barrel thrower and the apples. Also for those without lag, take note of how soon you can turn around. It's much sooner than you may think.\nKeep your thumb on the space bar to jump, because you will get hung up on scenery items, and jumping will usually release you. If that doesn't work, try quick turns. \nIf the Exhausted Ram debuff procs, you are kind of screwed; even if you are at a barrel, with zero fatigue, the debuff will run for its full 15 seconds. Don't sweat it, just do your best and get the most tokens you can out of the remainder of the run. If the debuff procs and your fatigue is still high, around 85, then trot or canter to the nearest barrel, don't gallop, then resume the run after you've cleared your fatigue.\nTo restate the point, if you can consistently shave seconds off your runs, you will get more tokens. Don't feel bad if you screw up, it is a learning process, and this run has all kinds of room for improving your technique. If you at least try, you will get some tokens. But the curve of run time vs how many tokens you get takes off asymptotically toward infinity as you approach a 30 second run. So, as your runs get very good, fractions of a second saved can accumulate to several tokens difference.\nIt is vital to ensure that you have bag slots available for the reins, the keg, the tokens you will be receiving, and if you are close to 200 tokens, for a new stack of tokens. If you accept the run with insufficient bag slots, you've used your run and you will not be able to get another until the time limit has passed. If the ram spawns, do not despawn it. Clear space while mounted and use the remainder of your time. If you despawn the ram, you've used your run. If you have no slot for the barrel, you will be able to do the runs, but will not receive the barrel and will earn no tokens. If you have no space for additional tokens, you will not receive the tokens for the run. If you have 199 tokens and no space, you will not receive one token for the run, you need to be able to receive two per run. \nThis event is as much about managing failed procs and damage reduction as anything. Even if you optimize your route, some points are going to fail. Having a plan B helps maximize your take; don't sweat it when it happens. \nIt seems the Horde runs take a bit longer, and the average token earnings on the Alliance side is somewhat higher, perhaps as much as six tokens. However, this may have changed with the Cataclysm. \nBarking runs.\nFor the barking runs, there are no apple barrels along the route, and you will have to pace yourself. Gallop becomes counterproductive; you will build up fatigue too rapidly and be forced to go too slow. Mixing canter for speed and trot for fatigue recovery while still moving will allow you to complete the task. \nAnother strategy to complete barking runs faster is to canter most of the way, occasionally tapping the reins just enough for a split-second gallop, while simultaneously jumping. This will give you a slight but noticeable speed boost but should not last long enough to grant you the extra fatigue. This can also be used during trot to gain a split-second of canter speed. \nWhen you complete the quest and are returning to the NPC, both the Alliance and Horde versions will afford you the opportunity to take a downhill shortcut. Take it if you can. Leaving Iron Forge, go down the mountainside toward the Brewfest. If you pick your way, you can have damage under 1%, but expect over 1%. If you jump straight down expect over 50% damage. In Orgrimmar, leaving the Valley of Spirits, fortuitous use of jumping down to rooftops will allow you to take a straighter route out of the city. \nThe quest objectives are to bark at four locations in the city, but returning to the quest NPC is not a \"quest objective\". This means you only have to return to the NPC to turn in the \"already completed quest\". You can switch to your normal mount, as long as you barked at all four locations while mounted on the ram (you still need the reins in your inventory and must return to a quest giver before the timer expires).\nOther ram tips.\nThe rams work much like any other mount, and performing most actions while mounting will despawn the mount. That means when you are on a ram, and if you are you are on a ram racing quest, stay focused on the ram quest, do not do anything else. Be careful which hot key you press. Your faction's , next to NPC offers replacement reins. These do not summon a ram, however, they are useful to prep for the non-quest mechanic, when &lt;a href=\"Brewfest%23Continuing%20to%20help%20out%20Brewfest\"&gt;continuing to help out Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe rams are actually a spell &lt;a href=\"Rental%20Racing%20Ram\"&gt;Rental Racing Ram&lt;/a&gt; that lasts for four minutes. You could probably creatively exploit this for your low level character. You might use it to run toward Loch Modan for the delivery quest and to pick up the fight path. If you do this on the initial ram racing quests, rather than the repeatables, you can abandon the quest and get another ram.\nDo not ram race whilst intoxicated. The unpredictable movement can make for a bad run.\nNPCs.\nHorde.\nMany of the Horde goblin NPCs for the Brewfest are wearing dwarf masks. This appears to be an homage to the dwarves' legendary brewing and drinking abilities.\nThe goblin vendors outside of Orgrimmar have an neutral aura, but will not talk to Alliance characters. Alliance characters cannot initiate their quests, nor can they purchase from the Brewfest Prize Token vendor. \nThe goblin vendor selling Thunderbrew dwarven brew in Shattrath City will sell to Alliance (the Orc selling Drohn's will not).\nThe Ogre vendors in both locations (outside Orgrimmar and in Shattrath City) have a neutral aura and will sell to Alliance characters; presumably this is reciprocal in the Alliance Brewfest celebration.\nAchievements.\nThe title is available by completing the &lt;a href=\"Brewmaster%20%28achievement%29\"&gt;Brewmaster (achievement)&lt;/a&gt; achievement.\nWith the way event bosses work (through the LFD Tool) you must now be 85 to kill Coren Direbrew.\nAll of the achievements obtainable during Brewfest:\nMusic.\nThere are several background musical tracks in the game specifically for Brewfest: 3 for alliance and 3 for horde. They can all be played manually with the following scripts:\n /script PlaySoundFile(\"Sound\\\\Music\\\\ZoneMusic\\\\BrewFest\\\\BF_Dwarves1.mp3\")\n /script PlaySoundFile(\"Sound\\\\Music\\\\ZoneMusic\\\\BrewFest\\\\BF_Dwarves2.mp3\")\n /script PlaySoundFile(\"Sound\\\\Music\\\\ZoneMusic\\\\BrewFest\\\\BF_Dwarves3.mp3\")\n /script PlaySoundFile(\"Sound\\\\Music\\\\ZoneMusic\\\\BrewFest\\\\BF_Goblins1.mp3\")\n /script PlaySoundFile(\"Sound\\\\Music\\\\ZoneMusic\\\\BrewFest\\\\BF_Goblins2.mp3\")\n /script PlaySoundFile(\"Sound\\\\Music\\\\ZoneMusic\\\\BrewFest\\\\BF_Goblins3.mp3\") \nTo end playback of these files, use codice_2 instead of codice_3\nThe tracks contain holiday-appropriate music as well as background banter of the respective faction races, including many quotable jokes and one liners.\nYearly updates.\n2020.\nCoren Direbrew's trinkets are now item level 425 at level 120.\n2019.\nCoren Direbrew's trinkets now level 395 at 120.\n2018.\nCoren Direbrew's trinkets are level 335 for level 120s.\nPast bugs.\nThe Dark Iron attack was not awarding tickets due to a bug in the 2007 event. This was replaced in 2008 by the cog world item that gives a daily quest for tokens. The cog only drops if the invaders are repelled.\nDuring the first Brewfest in 2007, players were shown that emoting codice_4 to their local Brew Barker, Brewery Barker, or Brewmaiden would have them toss you a &lt;a href=\"Complimentary%20Brewfest%20Sampler\"&gt;Complimentary Brewfest Sampler&lt;/a&gt;, as ammunition for the Dark Iron attacks. Keeping this sampler and waving again caused a new mug to fly through the air and bonk the player in the head, bouncing off to fall within a 360\u00b0 circumference of the player and disappearing through the ground. The problem: Players figured out that macroing multiple codice_4 emotes into a single macro would have the NPCs throw a mug for each codice_4 \"simultaneously\". This created a 'beer mug fountain' effect, like water spraying outward at the top of a water foutain. While many found this highly amusing, even only a few players doing this at the same time would cause significant lag to other players with less robust internet connections. Many who realized this would stop out of courtesy to those players, but this became only one item of a list of problems with the Dark Iron attack event. This forced Blizzard to disable all components of the attack, so that it could be retooled for 2008.\nBlizzard was reworking the \"Catch the Wild Wolpertinger!\" and \"Pink Elekks On Parade\" quests for 2008, but ran into a problem that could not be hotfixed, and only solvable through a patch. The problem came up too late to be patched in time, which forced Blizzard to disable the quests. These quests returned in 2009, though only for US realms.\nThe reset time on the &lt;a href=\"Brew%20For%20Brewfest\"&gt;daily ram-racing quest&lt;/a&gt; was bugged for some people, causing the reset time to be 18 hours instead of the 'intended' 12 for the 2009 Brewfest event. This bug did not affect everyone, but if the quest didn't reset after 12 hours then player had to try again after 18. There was no official response by Blizzard, but the reset time bug seemed to be fixed by Blizzard; the reset time was set to 18 hours as could be seen on Blizzard's world event guide. However, some players reported to be still experiencing 12 hour reset timers.\nGuiness World Record.\nBrewfest holds the Guiness World Record for the Largest Virtual Beer Festival.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

Ironforge's brewmasters wanted to name the first batch as &lt;a href=\"Anduin%27s%20Amber%20Ale\"&gt;Anduin's Amber Ale&lt;/a&gt;.\nNamed.\nOthers.\nMojo Dark-Ale, Sinjo Honeybrew, Kesha Wildbarley, Tatsa Sweetbarrow, Mushi Ale-Hearth, Jinto Reedwine, Masha Storm-Stout, Polo Barrel-keg\nIn the RPG.\nBrewmaster is a prestige class in \"&lt;a href=\"Dark%20Factions\"&gt;Dark Factions&lt;/a&gt;\".\nThe &lt;a href=\"Goldtooth%20dwarves\"&gt;Goldtooth dwarves&lt;/a&gt; are also known for being brewmasters in Khaz Modan.\nThe pandaren are an old and refined culture, with many traditions and arts important to their way of life. Perhaps none influence the pandaren so thoroughly as the art of brewing. Scholars believe that drink influences every aspect of pandaren life, and because of the craft involved, a tradition of brewing potent fluids is a cultural institution for the gentle people of Pandaria. Pandaren brewmasters travel the world for new and exotic ingredients and recipes. These affable yet deadly warriors practice a unique combination of healing arts and martial skill. With their knowledge of alchemy, potion making and brewery, pandaren create superb ales and liquors that are welcome at any adventurer\u2019s table either before or after a battle. Brewmasters practice a unique fighting style. They combine typical pandaren finesse and strength with the appearance of being drunk, stumbling apparently at random. When they sway to avoid a blow or swing a wild fist, their proficiency appears accidental. \nWhile the path of the brewmaster might be learned by any race, the pandaren keep the craft of the brewmaster a closely guarded secret. Ancient ways and methods of brewing result in a potent ability to craft traditional pandaren brews. Pandaren are reluctant to share the secrets of this craft, though a brewmaster might take the most disciplined and spiritual of individuals under his wing. Those who do take the path of the brewmaster are typically pandaren, and show allegiance only to the ways of their craft. While brewing is a mystical art, as the pandaren say \u201cgood drink shows no bad faces,\u201d and anyone who seeks out a brewmaster is likely to find him willing to provide a draught or two in exchange for coin.\nAny race can become a brewmaster though most known brewmasters are pandaren.

A large key turns in its back, making it look like a giant wind-up toy with a red hat and goggles. It swings a spear with its left hand.\nThey are some of the first creations an intermediate &lt;a href=\"goblin%20tinker\"&gt;goblin tinker&lt;/a&gt; makes when he experiments with self-ambulatory devices. They are useful as an exercise, but not so much as real soldiers \u2014 the design\u2019s original specifications seem in error, for after a short period of time, the goblin shuts down. Rather than redrafting the blueprints, some enterprising goblin in the past made just a few adjustments, so that rather than shut down the clockwerk goblin explodes, making it sort of a mobile bomb.\nClockwerk goblins go where they are programmed to go. What this usually means is that the tinker sets up an inert clockwerk goblin (or row of them), and, when the time is right, activates it. The clockwerk goblin bumbles along in a generally forward direction. After a period of time (which the tinker sets when he activates the goblin), the mechanism detonates. Clockwerk goblins are simple devices. They are capable of following specific targets, moving along the ground, making up to 360-degree turns, and swinging their spears, but that\u2019s about it."}

{"id": "33539", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=33539", "title": "Clothadin", "text": " is a term used to describe a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; who wears &lt;a href=\"cloth%20armor\"&gt;cloth armor&lt;/a&gt; to increase their &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; abilities. Since the only benefit of plate is increased mitigation of physical damage and healers don't take part in melee, a large number of paladins have been known to wear cloth, leather as well as shaman mail armor. This was more popular prior to The Burning Crusade expansion, when the best cloth and leather healing equipment was significantly better than the best plate healing equipment available. Since the release of The Burning Crusade, good plate healing gear is a lot more common. Often times &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s will wear any gear that strongly benefits healing, regardless of the armor type. Some paladins may keep cloth armor only for certain bosses where they know they will not receive melee damage, like for the final boss of &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Labyrinth\"&gt;Shadow Labyrinth&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;.\nSince many cloth items yield high &lt;a href=\"intellect\"&gt;intellect&lt;/a&gt; bonuses, a primary attribute for &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s, it is not uncommon for them to wear one or more pieces of &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; armor, especially when they are the main healer for a group and their ability to heal becomes critical. While wearing &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; armor can certainly increase a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"mana\"&gt;mana&lt;/a&gt; reserves, it also causes them to take more physical damage when struck in combat. This makes preventing mobs from attacking a clothadin even more important for the group's &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;. It is advised to protect clothadins at all costs, because they are &lt;a href=\"squishy\"&gt;squishy&lt;/a&gt; and will likely die first.\nFor any paladin considering wearing cloth armor, it is important to always keep a spare set of plate armor on you. When in a party that is struggling with particular mobs, switching to plate armor can give the other members of the party a few more seconds to pull mobs off of the healer before they die, thus making a wipe less likely. But if you need the cloth armor for healing, it is wise to keep it for the instance.\nClothadins tend to be more common on servers with a low priest population. Nevertheless, clothadins should be \"extremely\" tactful in deciding to roll on loot if another member of the party (especially priests or druids) wants the item, even if the other member only heals as an &lt;a href=\"off%20spec\"&gt;off spec&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe term clothadin is often used as a joke and has been seen in two famous WoW videos, &lt;a href=\"Leeroy%20Jenkins\"&gt;Leeroy Jenkins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Illegal%20Danish\"&gt;Illegal Danish&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are, however, not part of the \"whole &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt;s scene\" and are not really related to the classic Azerothian &lt;a href=\"dragonflight\"&gt;dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;s. Thousands of years ago, the cloud serpents were feared as monsters and wild animals, both cunning and dangerous. During the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Troll%20Wars\"&gt;Zandalari Troll Wars&lt;/a&gt;, a century after the founding of the &lt;a href=\"Pandaren%20Empire\"&gt;Pandaren Empire&lt;/a&gt;, a young girl named &lt;a href=\"Jiang\"&gt;Jiang&lt;/a&gt; took a small cloud serpent named &lt;a href=\"Lo\"&gt;Lo&lt;/a&gt; into her care. The &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; numbers were vast, and their bat riders fought in such a way the pandaren had no counter to. Jiang and her cloud serpent friend, however, swooped in, plucking the Zandalari from the bridge and striking down their bat riders. The war would still take many months to win, but this was the turning point. Soon Ji was training other pandaren how to ride as she did, upon the backs of other serpents. From that day forward, the serpent became a symbol of hope to the pandaren people, and the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt; was founded.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Loh-Ki\"&gt;Loh-Ki&lt;/a&gt;, an otherworldly storm was summoned by &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, the Thunder King, in his final moments, and blanketed the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; with rainfall and struck jagged spears of lightning into the hills. With its final breath, the storm struck the center of the lake, igniting the very water itself. The lake burned with a crimson hue for many days. When the blaze subsided, a cloud serpent hatchling could be seen flying around the center of the lake. Its scales sparked with storm and fire, and where it flew, great clouds formed in the sky. The &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; named it &lt;a href=\"Alani\"&gt;Alani&lt;/a&gt;, the Stormborn.\nCloud serpents \"are\" wild and tempestuous by nature and, if mistreated, may still grow to be that way as adults. But a cloud serpent is not bound by its nature, no more than any of the sapient races.\nCloud serpent eggs are rare and look like jewels, and were once worth their weight in solid gold. The serpents are known to lay their eggs in nests at only two places in Pandaria: on the beach of &lt;a href=\"Shan%27ze%20Dao\"&gt;Shan'ze Dao&lt;/a&gt; off the coast of &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;, where the local &lt;a href=\"Sprite\"&gt;wood sprite&lt;/a&gt;s are known to steal them whenever they can, and on &lt;a href=\"Windward%20Isle\"&gt;Windward Isle&lt;/a&gt;, off the east coast of the &lt;a href=\"Jade%20Forest\"&gt;Jade Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe wild cloud serpents live in a delicate balance with nature. Their rare eggs are quite vulnerable to enemies. Recently the nests of the Jade Forest have come under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Slitherscale\"&gt;Slitherscale&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"saurok\"&gt;saurok&lt;/a&gt;. At first, the Slitherscale were too frightened to approach the wild serpents. Soon however they began snatching the eggs under the cover of night. Now, they are slaughtering adults and hatchlings alike and eating their eggs for dinner.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Vale%20of%20Eternal%20Blossoms\"&gt;Vale of Eternal Blossoms&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed by &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20Y%27Shaarj\"&gt;Heart of Y'Shaarj&lt;/a&gt;, the industrious cloud serpents rescued the &lt;a href=\"Jewel%20Danio\"&gt;Jewel Danio&lt;/a&gt; and relocated them to the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to thrive once more.\nBreeds.\nFrom their infancy, thundering cloud serpents are drawn to storms. They have been known to chase lightning through the blackened, roiling clouds, and to bathe in the pouring rain.\nAs a mount.\nIn \"\", a large amount of different cloud serpent mounts are available through a variety of different methods. Originally all of these mounts required &lt;a href=\"Cloud%20Serpent%20Riding\"&gt;Cloud Serpent Riding&lt;/a&gt;, obtained by reaching and completing the questchain for the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Cloud%20Serpent\"&gt;Order of the Cloud Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, but the requirement was removed in &lt;a href=\"patch%206.0.1\"&gt;patch 6.0.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs a hunter pet.\nCloud serpents are tamable by &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s as part of the &lt;a href=\"Lesser%20Dragonkin\"&gt;lesser dragonkin&lt;/a&gt; family (prior to \"\", they were in the &lt;a href=\"serpent\"&gt;serpent&lt;/a&gt; family). Only &lt;a href=\"pandaren%20%28playable%29\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; hunters can tame them by default; other races must learn the skill from &lt;a href=\"How%20to%20School%20Your%20Serpent\"&gt;How to School Your Serpent&lt;/a&gt;, which can be purchased from &lt;a href=\"San%20Redscale\"&gt;San Redscale&lt;/a&gt; when with the Order of the Cloud Serpent and unlocks the skill for all hunters on that account. This requirement extends to &lt;a href=\"Elegon\"&gt;Elegon&lt;/a&gt;, who is classified as a &lt;a href=\"spirit%20beast\"&gt;spirit beast&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Jade\"&gt;Avatars of Jade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"%3ACelestial%20Dragon\"&gt;:Celestial Dragon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Green%20Dragon%20Orb\"&gt;Tiny Green Dragon&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Dragon%20Orb\"&gt;Tiny Red Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Competitor%27s%20Souvenir\"&gt;Essences of Competition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20of%20Competition\"&gt;Spirits of Competition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Willow%20%28Moonglade%29\"&gt;Willow&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Crimson\"&gt;Crimson&lt;/a&gt; resemble cloud serpent hatchlings with small wings, but it's unclear whether or not they are actually cloud serpents."}
