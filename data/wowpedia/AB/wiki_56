Peddlefeet during the event. During previous years, he could be found near the leaders:\nNow, however, he can be found in more easily accessible locations: \nFrom a character's point of view, all six appear to be the same NPC, except with regard to the voting described below and the factional quest that they handle.\nAfter the event, Kwee Q. Peddlefeet will remain in one of these cities for an additional week, selected by the voting described below.\nBuffing.\nIf a player blows him a kiss using the /kiss command, they will be given the &lt;a href=\"Smitten\"&gt;Smitten&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; and gain 200 extra health points for one hour. Kwee Q. Peddlefeet's buffs from different cities are said to stack, although crossing a boundary and causing a load screen removes the buffs if there are two or more.\nQuest endpoint.\nKwee Q.

Peddlefeet. This counts as one vote for the popularity of that leader. At the end of the Love is in the Air seasonal event, the capital city leader with the most gift collections will have Kwee Q. Peddlefeet stay by them to buff players for another week.\nYou can ask Kwee Q. Peddlefeet about the gift voting standings. He gives the number of turn-ins for each participating city leader and the totals for each faction. (In the 2009 event, the Stormwind result names the former temporary regent &lt;a href=\"Bolvar%20Fordragon\"&gt;Bolvar&lt;/a&gt;, not the current returned king Varian. This appears to be a failure to update the quest text from the previous year to match the progression of game-world events.) \nDisproportionate voting stacked toward one particular leader will give either faction that does so a better chance of winning.\nCompanion.\nThere is also a &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt; version of Kwee Q. Peddlefeet, called simply \"Peddlefeet\". It is much smaller than the Kwee Q. Peddlefeet NPC, no more than half his height. The Peddlefeet companion can be summoned by a &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Shafted%20Arrow\"&gt;Silver Shafted Arrow&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Truesilver%20Shafted%20Arrow\"&gt;Truesilver Shafted Arrow&lt;/a&gt;, both obtainable during the Love is in the Air seasonal event. The Silver Shafted Arrow summons a Peddlefeet companion on another player that you target and shoot with the Silver Shafted Arrow. The Truesilver Shafted Arrow teaches you the ability to summon the Peddlefeet companion to yourself at will.\nNotes.\nKwee Q. Peddlefeet hovers in the manner of flying &lt;a href=\"companion\"&gt;companion&lt;/a&gt;s. He is goblin sized.

She and her surviving friends were later freed by &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s and chose to stay in Maldraxxus for a time to help the Maw Walkers' allies in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; before returning home to &lt;a href=\"Bastion\"&gt;Bastion&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nKynthia is in a romantic relationship with her fellow Ascended &lt;a href=\"Apolon\"&gt;Apolon&lt;/a&gt;. The two of them often used to sneak off to watch the &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; flows together.\nAlongside many other kyrian, Kynthia was captured during the House of Constructs and &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Rituals\"&gt;House of Rituals&lt;/a&gt;' attack on the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Courage\"&gt;Temple of Courage&lt;/a&gt; and taken to the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Constructs%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;Construct stronghold&lt;/a&gt; in Maldraxxus, where she was held imprisoned by an &lt;a href=\"Orb%20of%20Power%20%28Maldraxxus%29\"&gt;Orb of Power&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Chains\"&gt;Hall of Chains&lt;/a&gt;. She watched the other kyrian getting tortured, including the blinding of &lt;a href=\"Aspirant%20Thales\"&gt;Aspirant Thales&lt;/a&gt;. She found some solace in talking to him and the three &lt;a href=\"steward\"&gt;steward&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Hipokos\"&gt;Hipokos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kou\"&gt;Kou&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Koa\"&gt;Koa&lt;/a&gt;, but with each day she lost more hope that their allies would show up. Back in Bastion, Apolon feared for what had happened to his love, but his &lt;a href=\"soulbinding\"&gt;soulbind&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Artemede\"&gt;Artemede&lt;/a&gt; reminded him to have faith in Kynthia's strength.\nEventually, a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt; allied with the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20the%20Chosen\"&gt;House of the Chosen&lt;/a&gt; arrived in the House of Constructs and helped Thales free Kynthia and the stewards. She declared that the Constructs would know her wrath and relocated to &lt;a href=\"Spider%27s%20Watch\"&gt;Spider's Watch&lt;/a&gt;, from where she helped Maw Walkers carry out bombing runs on the Constructs.\nKynthia later partook in the joint kyrian and &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;necrolord&lt;/a&gt; assault on the Constructs, during which she was reunited with Apolon. The two sprinted to embrace each other before fighting side by side. At the start of the assault, Kynthia stayed aboard the &lt;a href=\"Zerekriss\"&gt;Zerekriss&lt;/a&gt; with Apolon and Artemede. She later arrived to the Hall of Chains to report that &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at the &lt;a href=\"Stitchyard\"&gt;Stitchyard&lt;/a&gt; were being overrun and subsequently flew the Maw Walkers there to reinforce him. After the battle, Kynthia decided that she and her friends had to stay in Maldraxxus and continue to help the House of the Chosen who had taken them in.\nAfter the battle of &lt;a href=\"Desmotaeron\"&gt;Desmotaeron&lt;/a&gt;, she and the other former Construct captives visited the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; to witness &lt;a href=\"Draka\"&gt;Draka&lt;/a&gt;'s promotion ceremony. With the Chosen being set upon their path again, Kynthia, Thales, and the stewards finally returned to Bastion. She later escorted the repentant &lt;a href=\"Forsworn\"&gt;Forsworn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nikolon\"&gt;Nikolon&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href=\"Forsworn%20Representative\"&gt;Forsworn Representative&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Eonian%20Archives\"&gt;Eonian Archives&lt;/a&gt; to speak with &lt;a href=\"Polemarch%20Adrestes\"&gt;Polemarch Adrestes&lt;/a&gt;, and shortly after traveled to &lt;a href=\"Elysian%20Hold\"&gt;Elysian Hold&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=\"Kyrestia%20the%20Firstborne\"&gt;the Archon&lt;/a&gt;'s announcement that the &lt;a href=\"Citadel%20of%20Loyalty\"&gt;Citadel of Loyalty&lt;/a&gt; would be rededicated as the &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Devotion\"&gt;Temple of Devotion&lt;/a&gt;, with Adrestes as its Paragon. Kynthia subsequently accompanied Adrestes, &lt;a href=\"Kleia\"&gt;Kleia&lt;/a&gt;, Nikolon, &lt;a href=\"Uther\"&gt;Uther&lt;/a&gt;, and a Maw Walker to the Citadel to reclaim it from the Forsworn occupying it. She and Kleia joined Adrestes at the top of the temple and helped protect him from attacking &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt; while he used &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt; to rededicate the temple.\nKynthia attended Adrestes' promotion ceremony at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Archon\"&gt;Seat of the Archon&lt;/a&gt; alongside Apolon and her friends from Maldraxxus. During the event, she thanked the Maw Walker who had saved her from the House of Constructs and told them that she was happy to be back home and reunited with her love."}

Here's the answer! Your very own novel guide.\n\"Warcraft\" imprint.\nThese books were published using the WARCRAFT trademark.\nOriginal series.\nDespite being clearly numbered, \"The Last Guardian\" is set years before \"Day of the Dragon\" and \"Lord of the Clans\", during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; send a young mage, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, to serve as an apprentice to the Last Guardian, the great &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;. After spending some time within the &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and teaming up with an &lt;a href=\"Garona\"&gt;unlikely person&lt;/a&gt;, Khadgar discovers a horrible truth.\nTwo years after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 accompanied by elven ranger &lt;a href=\"Vereesa%20Windrunner\"&gt;Vereesa Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and the dwarf &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 is sent on a special mission in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;. They soon discover the mission involves dragons and their legendary leaders, the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nMany years after the end of the Second War, \"Lord of the Clans\" and \"Of Blood and Honor\" happen contemporaneously. While the former gladiator known simply as &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; is liberating his people from the internment camps, the honor of paladin &lt;a href=\"Tirion\"&gt;Tirion&lt;/a&gt; is being tested when an orc saves his life.\nThese novels can be read in any order, as all contain spoilers for the events of ' and '.\nWar of the Ancients.\nAll by Richard A. Knaak\nThough acting as a prequel to the events of all Warcraft games and novels, this trilogy involves characters from \"Day of the Dragon\" traveling through time, and thus has spoilers for that novel and ' and '. Though reading \"Day of the Dragon\" and Reign of Chaos are helpful for understanding events and characters, they are not required.\nWoW imprint.\nThe following novels were published under the WORLD OF WARCRAFT trademark (this is the publication order):\nIn spite of the trademark and the slogan \"based on the best-selling video game\", some of these books are not set during the events of \"World of Warcraft\". \n\"Cycle of Hatred\" is set 1 year before WoW; \"Rise of the Horde\", though told through a series of flashbacks just prior to ', is set almost a century earlier; \"Tides of Darkness\" and \"Beyond the Dark Portal\" relate the events of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. \"Arthas: Rise of the Lich King\" deals with the early years of &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; and its aftermath. \"Night of the Dragon\" is set prior to the events of ' and reveals the state of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and \"Stormrage\" is set after the defeat of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; but shortly before those of '. \"The Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm\" takes place after Stormrage but before Cataclysm, heralding its coming. Both, \"Wolfheart\" and \"Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects\" take place during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;. \"Jaina Proudmoore: Tides of War\" is set after the death of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; and ties to \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\". \"Dawn of the Aspects\" taking place during the events on Pandaria shows the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; before mortal history through flashbacks. \"Vol'jin: Shadows of the Horde\" deals with the aftermath of the assassination attempt on &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and with a new &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; threat. &lt;a href=\"Garrosh\"&gt;Garrosh&lt;/a&gt;'s imprisonment in the end of \"Mists of Pandaria\" is dealt with in \"War Crimes\" which bridges \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\".

He fought against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. Following this intervention, he retreated into seclusion, immersing himself in his duties. He emerges only infrequently when events require his direct presence. He intervened in the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; and his allies, one of the few times he has been seen in the skies of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the threat of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and the advent of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Shattering&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu found himself less able to ignore the needs of his fellow Aspects and their allies. After aiding in the defeat of Deathwing's abominable creation &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; and his own &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;insane potential future self&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspect of Time joined his brother and sister Aspects in killing Deathwing &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;once and for all&lt;/a&gt;, but at the cost of most of his power, becoming mortal.\nDuring the events of , Nozdormu alongside Kalecgos and Alexstrasza rediscover their ancient home of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu plays an instrumental part in re-introducing the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; to the world, and is part of the leadership of the &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken%20Accord\"&gt;Valdrakken Accord&lt;/a&gt;; seeking to restore the aspectral powers of the aspects. His main foe is that of the resurgent &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;; which seeks to subvert Nozdormu into &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, his dark alternate self and ultimate leader of the flight. Their dark magic clouded his visions of the future, leading him to a state of depression. Their plots are ultimately foiled by &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;, freeing Nozdormu from his melancholy and restoring his ability to peer into the timeways.\nBiography.\nDawn of the Aspects (past).\nIn Azeroth's ancient past, the Dragon Aspects were &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s who stood united against a foe who threatened their entire species: the bloodthirsty Father of Dragons, &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu was a dust-brown male who first met &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; when he saved them from being devoured by Galakrond. He was contemplative and, like Malygos, seemed to be relatively intelligent even compared to other sentient proto-dragons.\nLike the other proto-dragons Nozdormu rallied under &lt;a href=\"Talonixa\"&gt;Talonixa&lt;/a&gt; by accepting her as alpha in order to deal with the threat of Galakrond and the &lt;a href=\"not-living\"&gt;not-living&lt;/a&gt;. During this time Nozdormu quickly became fast friends with Malygos, Neltharion, Alexstrasza, and Ysera. While not agreeing with all of Ysera's beliefs Nozdormu was rather stunned at Talonixa's deception of herding the bitten into a cave and then collapsing it on them, which eventually killed all the bitten who had begun to act like Galakrond.\nNozdormu later found himself as part of Talonixa's proto-dragon army that moved to combat Galakrond. Before the proto-dragon army engaged their enemy in battle Malygos devised a plan in which the army would fly higher in the air where Galakrond could not fly. Quickly informing Talonixa of his plan Malygos was relived that to note that she was considering it. However, hearing his sigh Talonixa took it as a sign of Malygos's satisfaction of her bowing to his wisdom and engaged Malygos in battle. While Nozdormu and Neltharion were quick to help Malygos, Talonixa was helped by her two lieutenants. Despite Nozdormu encouraging a retreat, Neltharion openly called for Malygos to fight Talonixa and became the new alpha an action which enraged Talonixa and brought more of her followers to join her, which caused the trio to flee high into the air.\nUsing his not-living Galakrond was able to lure Talonixa's army into a trap where he erupted from the ground when the army was in position and swiftly shattered it. After killing Talonixa, Galakrond was unable to devour the fast of the army due to the actions of Malygos, Nozdormu, and Neltharion. As Malygos broke off to find Ysera and Alexstrasza, Galakrond ended engaging in battle against the future aspects only to be driven off by Tyr after being stunned by his hammer.\nAn unknown time later, Tyr met with the five proto-dragons, informing them that Galakrond was sleeping in a mountain range to the north and that it was the perfect time to attack. He told them to eat before doing so, and just before they left Tyr held the octagonal artifact before Nozdormu and Neltharion as he had to the others before. After doing so, Tyr vanished in the blink of an eye.\nTyr and the proto-dragons met up near Galakrond's slumbering place, which Kalecgos would later note in his visions was nowhere near Galakrond's Rest. Save for Ysera, they all began the battle against Galakrond, who had grown larger and even more mutated than before. Throughout the battle, the octagonal object on Tyr's belt glowed ever brighter. When Galakrond suddenly expanded in size without warning, Tyr's hammer could no longer harm him. With a flap of wings, Galakrond called up a massive wind that scattered the fighters. Ysera suddenly appeared and Galakrond attempted to devour her, but Tyr silenced his laughter with a mighty blow from his hammer. Tyr pulled Galakrond to the ground and began to mercilessly beat him even as Galakrond began mutating further - as he began to resemble a true dragon.\nIn the battle, Tyr's hammer and the strange artifact were knocked free from his person. Tyr reached to grab the artifact, just as Galakrond's massive maw came within range and the monster clamped down on Tyr's hand. Malygos moved to save Tyr, examining the bloody stump as Galakrond roared in triumph and grew ever larger. An unconscious Tyr was brought to a frozen lake by the proto-dragons, only to vanish from the shore. After being attacked by two not-living Ysera and the others found they could not find Tyr where they left him, concluding that some beast must have taken him for food.\nAfter recuperating Nozdormu and the others decide to hunt down Galakrond in order to kill him once and for all or die trying. Nozdormu, along with the others would be stunned to learn that Galakrond had begun to devour the not-living in order to feed his hunger and shortly after would engage in battle with the behemoth. During the battle, Nozdormu would work closely with Ysera and Galakrond would ultimately be killed after Malygos and Neltharion forced a boulder down his throat.\nAfter killing Galakrond, Nozdormu and the others were approached by two other watchers, who revealed that they had taken Tyr to help him. After Nozdormu agreed to protect Azeroth with his friends, the two watchers were joined by two others and the titan &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, acted through the keepers to transform Nozdormu and the others into the Dragon Aspects, where one of their first acts was to encourage the rumor that the titans created them from Galakrond. This was done to prevent the truth about Galakrond from leaking to ensure no one would follow in the behemoth's footsteps. Specifically, &lt;a href=\"Highkeeper%20Ra\"&gt;Highkeeper Ra&lt;/a&gt; channeled &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;'s powers to give Nozdormu (and through him, the future &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;) a portion of his mastery over time itself, enabling him to hold \"dominion over the interweaving pathways of fate and destiny\".\nGreat secrets were revealed to Nozdormu after he was granted a portion of Aman'Thul's power. He captured that knowledge within &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Duty\"&gt;a relic&lt;/a&gt;, an echo of what is, what has been, and what must always be. The dragon then hid the relic in a corner of every &lt;a href=\"timeline\"&gt;timeline&lt;/a&gt;, so that he would always remember these, in case he ever &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;lost them&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Winterskorn War.\nWhen fallen &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; instigated the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;, fought between the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn\"&gt;Winterskorn&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; and his allies fought on the earthen's side. However, when Tyr realized that they could not win against the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; alone he called upon the Dragon Aspects for aid. The noble Aspects grew enraged upon seeing so many dead titan-forged. Their fury only deepened when they learned that proto-dragons had been enslaved. Without hesitation, the Aspects took wing and unleashed their powers on the Winterskorn's iron ranks.\nMuch as they had done in the fight against &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, the Aspects worked in unison to overwhelm the vrykul army. &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; held the Winterskorn at bay with towering walls of enchanted fire. &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; drained the magical essence that fueled the constructs and golems, rendering them useless. He also shattered the enchanted snares that bound the proto-dragons and set the beasts free. &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; raised mountains from the earth to corral and contain the vrykul and their giant masters. Lastly, &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and Nozdormu combined their powers to create a spell that would bring a decisive end to the conflict.\nYsera and Nozdormu enveloped the Winterskorn in a cloying mist that caused them the titan-forged to fall asleep. These incapacitated creatures were then locked away in tombs cities across northern Kalimdor. They would not know the peaceful slumber of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Rather, they would languish in a timeless, unconscious slumber for thousands upon thousands of years.\nThe War of the Ancients (past).\nNozdormu was missing at this time because he was trapped in a time anomaly caused by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, Nozdormu's interests were represented by his mate, &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, who added a portion of Nozdormu's essence into the Dragon Soul in his absence, thus imbuing it with his power. At the end of the war, upon the destruction of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s portal and the halting of the Old Gods' attempt to escape, Nozdormu was freed from his entrapment. He assisted the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu placed an enchantment upon it to ensure that as long as the colossal tree stood, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; would never age past their prime.\nThe Watchers.\nThe Bronze Dragonflight rescued &lt;a href=\"Xarantaur\"&gt;Xarantaur&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first tauren druids, from death and took him before their master, Nozdormu. He granted him immortality as a Watcher, tasked to bear witness to the history of Azeroth as one of his agents. He also gave him the &lt;a href=\"Lorehammer\"&gt;Lorehammer&lt;/a&gt;. At some point, he similarly blessed &lt;a href=\"Jonathan%20the%20Revelator\"&gt;Jonathan the Revelator&lt;/a&gt;.\nChronormu's visage.\nOver the years, Nozdormu helped countless members of the bronze flight prepare for their &lt;a href=\"Visage%20Day\"&gt;Visage Day&lt;/a&gt;s\u2014the ceremony in which dragons decide what their mortal form will be. The young bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt;, who could not make up his mind about what visage he would choose, at one point sought out Nozdormu at the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; to seek his counsel and ramblingly tried to ask if he could reveal what visage the future Chronormu would choose. After getting him to calm down, the Bronze Aspect assumed his own mortal guise and stated that just as the dragons' visages allowed them to see the world as the young races do, it informed how the young races perceived the dragons. Since this choice was deeply personal, he would not say anything that might sway Chronormu's decision and instead advised him to seek out other dragons\u2014friends or otherwise\u2014to learn how they made their choices.\nWhen the day of the ceremony arrived, Nozdormu was in attendance at &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;\u2014as befit the Visage Days for members of his flight\u2014and announced the beginning of the ceremony and the arrival of Alexstrasza, who officiated the event. After it was revealed that Chronormu had chosen the form of the female &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; Chromie, Nozdormu told her that she had made a wise choice (though he refused to say if he'd known all along what her decision would be).\nDay of the Dragon.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nekros\"&gt;Nekros&lt;/a&gt; managed to get a hold of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Demon Soul&lt;/a&gt;. He used it to enslave &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, the Queen of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, and force her brood to serve the orcs. It was eventually destroyed at &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; by the mage &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt;, who had obtained a scale from &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself (since Deathwing was the only dragon not to add his power, his matter was the only thing that could harm the object). Nozdormu, convinced by &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; (who had been appealed to by &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt;) to help, finally aided the other &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspects&lt;/a&gt; in chasing off Deathwing after the Demon Soul was destroyed.\nThe Third War.\nNozdormu had no real involvement in the second invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, but he did make a choice that affects the world still today. When the mortal races banded together and made a last stand at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; was sacrificed to destroy &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, the night elves once again became mortal. The &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, created a new World Tree off the coast of Kalimdor and named it &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, however, this tree did not receive Nozdormu's, or any other Aspect's, blessing.\nThe War of the Ancients (present).\nAfter the end of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Rhonin\"&gt;Rhonin&lt;/a&gt; was called away, once again, by his friend and mentor, the dragon-mage &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu, trapped between different times, had barely managed to contact Krasus and draw his attention to a strange anomaly in the mountains of Kalimdor. Krasus convinced Rhonin to travel with him to Kalimdor to investigate. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Broxigar\"&gt;Broxigar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gaskal\"&gt;Gaskal&lt;/a&gt; were sent by their &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; on a similar mission, having caught wind of the strange event taking place nearby. Once there, Krasus, Rhonin, and Brox discovered a 'hole' in time. They were pulled in and ended up 10,000 years in the past, just before the first invasion of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the war ended and the heroes returned, he had a brief conversation with Krasus, where he thanked him for his assistance and agreed to temporarily watch over the clutch of blue dragon eggs the dragon-mage had saved. This marked one of the few (if not the only) times the Aspect had allowed the timeline to be altered, in the belief that a few blue dragons would be better than no blue dragons and then apologized for the wrongs he would commit in the future. After their mission was complete, Nozdormu returned Krasus and Rhonin to the present. The sanctity of the timeways had been upheld, but it would not be the last time that anomalies would appear in history. Nozdormu became obsessed with unraveling the mystery of &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;what&lt;/a&gt; - or &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;who&lt;/a&gt; - was responsible. He disappeared into the timeways and would not be seen again for years.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nNozdormu's whereabouts during this period are unknown. Ruling the Bronze flight in his stead are &lt;a href=\"Anachronos\"&gt;Anachronos&lt;/a&gt; (leader of the &lt;a href=\"Brood%20of%20Nozdormu\"&gt;Brood of Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;), Prime Consort &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt; (leader of the &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20the%20Sands\"&gt;Scale of the Sands&lt;/a&gt;), and &lt;a href=\"Andormu\"&gt;Andormu&lt;/a&gt; and his sister &lt;a href=\"Nozari\"&gt;Nozari&lt;/a&gt; (leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Keepers%20of%20Time\"&gt;Keepers of Time&lt;/a&gt;).\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThough absent for most of the plot, Nozdormu is seen briefly at the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Dragonshrine\"&gt;Bronze Dragonshrine&lt;/a&gt; during the quests &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20the%20Infinite\"&gt;Mystery of the Infinite&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mystery%20of%20the%20Infinite%2C%20Redux\"&gt;Mystery of the Infinite, Redux&lt;/a&gt;, where he appears as a vision as the \"leader of the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;\". &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; dismisses the vision as incorrect, since it makes no sense to her.\nCataclysm.\nThrall: Twilight of the Aspects.\nFollowing &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;'s instructions Thrall and a green dragon named &lt;a href=\"Desharin\"&gt;Desharin&lt;/a&gt; traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt; and became aware that even the bronze dragonflight did not know where Nozdormu was. Thrall, however, becomes aware of the Infinite dragonflight, and is told that his escape from Durnholde Keep was one such example of the Infinite dragonflight's attack. So Thrall and Desharin attempted to mediate on helping the Bronze dragons to find Nozdormu when an assassin - later to be revealed as from an alternate timeline - decapitates the green dragon. Thrall was rescued by a Bronze and hurled into one of the Caverns of Time portals. After a few adventures in different timelines, Thrall asked the elements to help him find Nozdormu. In that moment, an image of the Timeless One appeared before him, beckoning Thrall forward. He appeared in different times of his life, and each time, an image of Nozdormu was present in that specific \"timeline.\" Finally, he found himself into an alternate timeline. After a spirited conversation, Thrall came to the realization that there are not multiple timelines, but only one. One past, one present, and one future. He realized that Nozdormu must be trapped in all moments of time at once, and that he now knew where to find him. He closed his eyes and found himself outside of the Timeline, floating in space but not-space, with infinite portals to the timeline around him. He found himself back in the Caverns of Time with Nozdormu, and on each one of the Timeless One's scales was a portal to a moment in Thrall's past, present, and future. Nozdormu came to the realization that he became lost in time after Thrall's alternating between various events of his life, some that have happened, some that should have never happened. Nozdormu then told Thrall that every single event in Azeroth's history, all the harm that came to the Aspects, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, the madness of Neltharion and Malygos, are all intertwined, orchestrated by the same dark hand. Nozdormu became stuck in time while trying to figure out who was responsible for it and to prevent it. And he realized, that the one responsible for sending Blackmoore after Thrall was himself. Nozdormu explained that in one of the potential futures, he will become the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight. He further explained that he had not yet figured out how to stop himself from becoming the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight, but made it abundantly clear that he did not wish to become it. So Nozdormu told Thrall that his next task must be to rouse Alexstrasza from her grief of losing &lt;a href=\"Korialstrasz\"&gt;Korialstrasz&lt;/a&gt;. She couldn't get over the fact that Korialstrasz would have destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;.\nLater during the Aspects fight against &lt;a href=\"Chromatus\"&gt;Chromatus&lt;/a&gt; the Bronze dragons, with Nozdormu at their front, joined the battle. However, the first thing the Timeless One urged was they all had to retreat, stating that if they had persisted, they all would have died as he had seen this in the timelines. As they fled, Nozdormu explained that they were all born as a part of something whole. And they realized that they were only four parts out of five, and as long as the fifth part remained empty, they would not be able to defeat Chromatus. So Thrall offered to give his spirit of Earth in the battle with Chromatus, so that all five spirits of the Aspects were whole once more. The four Aspects renewed their attack upon Chromatus after the ritual, but this time with a much more unified power. With their combined power, Chromatus fell, lifeless, to the ground. The Aspects attempted to destroy the husk of Chromatus but were unable to do so. &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; stated that Malygos created a number of Arcane Prisons during the &lt;a href=\"Nexus%20War\"&gt;Nexus War&lt;/a&gt;, and Alexstrasza decided that representatives from all the flights will watch over him, as he is not dead.\nAfter the battle, Nozdormu took the time to explain that in one of the future timeways, he becomes the leader of the Infinite Dragonflight. Stunned, the three other Aspect listened as Nozdormu explained why he was late to the final battle: He was following another thread of information. He discovered who was behind the vast and dreadful conspiracy: The &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu confirmed that they caused all of the horrible events against the Dragonflights and Azeroth. He stated that he believes even himself becoming the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; leader in one timeline is caused by the Old Gods. Ysera told them all that they need to continue to fight as one, in order to avoid the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Before Thrall left, each of the Aspects gave him a scale from their hides, representing what he had done for each of them. The Bronze dragon &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; told Thrall that whenever he needs the aid of the Dragonflights, he can use the scales.\nRage of the Firelands.\nNozdormu appears as himself in patch 4.2 during the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Bonds%20questline\"&gt;Elemental Bonds questline&lt;/a&gt; intro. He is present during the meeting to restore the world tree along with Ysera, Alexstrasza, Kalecgos, Malfurion, Thrall and &lt;a href=\"Aggra\"&gt;Aggra&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter Thrall's wedding he says to players when you click on him:\nCharge of the Aspects.\nNozdormu arrives at Mount Hyjal to find &lt;a href=\"Tick%20%28drake%29\"&gt;Tick&lt;/a&gt; and a dying &lt;a href=\"Zirion\"&gt;Zirion&lt;/a&gt;. Zirion is leaking the &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; which Nozdormu attempts to reverse to no effect. He is shocked to discover that his powers had been predicted and countered by equally powerful spellwork. Tick then says Zirion came from the future, the &lt;a href=\"Hour%20of%20Twilight\"&gt;Hour of Twilight&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu realized that he would descend into madness with the Hour of Twilight. He asks how Zirion was injured, and Tick answers saying that it was the &lt;a href=\"Infinite%20Dragonflight\"&gt;Infinite Dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and their &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt;. Nozdormu then pleads for forgiveness from Zirion before he passes away. Zirion uses the last of his strength to look away from the Timeless One with a look of terror in his eyes. Nozdormu then ventures to Nordrassil to have a meeting with the other aspects when he explains that he killed Zirion and will become the Infinite leader. &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; ponders the thought of an aspect being charged to protect their flight but then killing one of their own before Nozdormu departed.\nShortly afterwards, Ysera and Kalecgos come up with an idea of retrieving the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; from the past to vanquish Deathwing. After telling Alexstrasza, the Dragonqueen departs to tell Nozdormu. The two aspects eventually meet and discuss the plan. Nozdormu admitting that he once pondered on whether he should go back in time and save the dragonflights and Malygos. They debate on Alexstrasza's intentions but eventually agree that sometimes life must be taken in order to preserve it. Nozdormu then returns, and the aspects work out a plan which involves going to the future to defeat Murozond and open the timeways to allow them to retrieve the Dragon Soul during the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28instance%29\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;. The aspects then ask &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to wield the Dragon Soul for no dragon can use it without causing themselves harm. Thrall agrees but asks if the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;short-lived races&lt;/a&gt; can assist him. Alexstrasza agrees. Not long afterwards, Kalecgos brings up the fact that the Titans blessed the aspects for a reason, to stop the Hour of Twilight, but what would become of them afterwards. The aspects establish that they are intended to preserve the gifts they were given, for time, life, nature and magic last forever.\nEnd Time.\nThe Dragon Aspects, with allegiance from Thrall, have devised a dangerous and unorthodox strategy to bring &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; down once and for all. But to do so, they must acquire the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; from a pivotal moment in the distant past. One of an infinite number of potential outcomes, the \"&lt;a href=\"End%20Time\"&gt;End Time&lt;/a&gt;\" timeway depicts the desolate future of Azeroth should its defenders fail to stop Deathwing. In this bleak future, Nozdormu has identified an anomaly that bars access to both the past and the Dragon Soul: a powerful creature from out of time, living alone amid time-twisted echoes of the past. In order for Nozdormu to provide you the ability to travel back in time to a point before the Dragon Soul was hidden by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; from anyone who'd seek its power, heroes must first go to a distant and desolate future to discover the anomaly blocking the past. The maniacal figure named &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; blocking Nozdormu's vision has the ability to create a new and infinite dragonflight.\nMurozond is, in fact, the future version of Nozdormu who will inevitably go mad and try to interfere with the past, thus his past self will send &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s into the future to strike him down. Right after Murozond is slain Nozdormu told them:\nFighting Murozond technically makes Nozdormu the second Aspect which can be fought and killed, &lt;a href=\"Malygos\"&gt;Malygos&lt;/a&gt; being the first, and &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; the third.\nHe is later seen in the next instance of the Well of Eternity where he saves the Dragon Soul from falling into the collapsing font.\nHour of Twilight.\nAfter the Dragon Soul was brought to the present, it had to be transported by Thrall and mortal heroes to &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;, a place of great power connected to the &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20the%20Aspects\"&gt;Chamber of the Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, where the artifact was originally imbued. Since Deathwing learned of their intent, he and his minions converged on the temple to waylay them at all costs. At Wyrmrest the Aspects infused it with their essences once again, making it more potent than it ever was. Kalecgos altered the Dragon Soul's properties so that it would affect Deathwing. But the artifact was imbued with the essences of the four Aspects and Deathwing never imparted his into it. To use the weapon to defeat him, they had to infuse it with the power of the Earth-Warder. Thrall possessed a portion - however small - of that exact thing: the essence of Azeroth itself. After the death of the twilight dragon &lt;a href=\"Ultraxion\"&gt;Ultraxion&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall unleashed the Dragon Soul upon its creator. Wounded, Deathwing fled, attempting to return to the relative safety of &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, through the Maelstrom. Thrall, the Aspects, and the Adventurers gave chase, riding a gunship after the Aspect of Death, battling his personal escort along the way.\nAfter catching up, the adventurers leapt onto &lt;a href=\"Spine%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing's back&lt;/a&gt; and began prying the elementium plates from his back, eventually making an opening big enough for Thrall to blast a hole into Deathwing's chest with the Dragon Soul, causing Deathwing to crash into the Maelstrom. The defenders of Azeroth briefly rejoiced at having rid themselves of the Destroyer, but Deathwing rose from the Maelstrom.\nWithout his armor, Deathwing's molten form began to mutate, granting him a form far more terrifying than before. The &lt;a href=\"Madness%20of%20Deathwing\"&gt;final battle for Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; began in earnest, until one final surge of power from the Dragon Soul, infused with the complete essence of each Aspect, completely obliterated Deathwing, with Nozdormu using all his power to bind the moment in time and prevent the killing blow from ever being undone. After Deathwing's death, the remaining Aspects, having fulfilled their duty and expending all that remained of their ancient powers, became mortal. The glow in the Aspects eyes faded and the &lt;a href=\"%3ASands%20of%20Time\"&gt;:Sands of Time&lt;/a&gt; from Nozdormu's broken spaulder pour into his hand. With the loss of Nozdormu's powers, the Dragon Soul was returned back in time to the point where it was taken.\nDawn of the Aspects (present).\nAdhering to their tradition to meet when the two moons of Azeroth were at a particular cycle, Nozdormu and the other former Aspects gathered together. When &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; reports that the timeways appear to be a state of flux, possibly due to the moment of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt;'s taking from the ancient past, Nozdormu states resolutely that the timeways are no longer the bronze dragonflight's concern, beyond his current ability to control, and thus fall now to the responsibility of the mortal races to protect. At the end of the brief meeting Nozdormu, along with Alexstrasza and Ysera, decided that they would officially end the Accord one month from now, to the shock of Kalecgos.\nLater on, Nozdormu and the others responded Kalecgos's request for a meeting, where using an artifact from Watcher Tyr reminded them about their past battle against Galakrond and that they didn't need to be aspects to help safeguard the world. Agreeing with him, the other three decided to continue their affairs in protecting Azeroth and that the Accord would continue. They also swore Kalecgos to secrecy about the nature of Galakrond, as they did not want anyone to follow in his dark path.\nThe Vow Eternal.\nDuring &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;'s quest for information on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, he turned to Nozdormu for aid. However, Nozdormu refused to even grant him an audience. After the Dragon Isles were awakening, he joined the other dragons at the &lt;a href=\"Wyrmrest%20Temple\"&gt;Wyrmrest Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nForbidden Reach.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Dragon Aspects' ancient enemies called the &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, breaks free of her prison, Nozdormu travels to the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt; to confront her. Though she escapes, Nozdormu tells the &lt;a href=\"dracthyr\"&gt;dracthyr&lt;/a&gt; that had been slumbering on the island to go and warn the kingdoms of the world of her threat.\nLegacies.\nNozdormu encounters the dracthyr &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Emberthal\"&gt;Scalecommander Emberthal&lt;/a&gt; and helps her with her amnesia by informing her of the history of dragonkind. He also enabled her help in order to discover a moment in history blocked from him, which turned out to be the exact moment &lt;a href=\"Neltharion\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; fell to the whispers of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; as he used their power to defeat and seal Raszageth.\nDragon Isles.\nNozdormu later convened with &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to discuss Raszageth's return. Though concerned about her freeing the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu was most concerned about the potential release of &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; and his hunger. Thus the decision was made that the Aspects would seek to reclaim their lost powers.\nSometime later, he traveled to &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; would inform him and &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; of his battle against &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt;. In the subsequent meeting, Kalecgos revealed that while &lt;a href=\"Raszageth\"&gt;Raszageth&lt;/a&gt; was fended off her storms still persisted around the &lt;a href=\"Vakthros\"&gt;Vakthros&lt;/a&gt;' tower. In return, Alexstrasza voiced her confusion on the matter as the other &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; were not imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Azure%20Span\"&gt;Azure Span&lt;/a&gt; and wondered what else she could be after, turning to Nozdormu for insight. However, he revealed that his vision was still clouded and remarked that for all he knew, the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; could be within &lt;a href=\"Valdrakken\"&gt;Valdrakken&lt;/a&gt;. Thus the aspects decided that they had to protect their home and search out any Primalists within the city. A wise precaution as &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Drine\"&gt;Captain Drine&lt;/a&gt; and the adventurer discovered that Primalists had infiltrated into the city and were seeking to create discontent against the Aspects.\nAt the bronze flight's base in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Temporal%20Conflux\"&gt;Temporal Conflux&lt;/a&gt;, the infinite dragonflight attacks and attempts to corrupt Nozdormu into Murozond. During the fighting, &lt;a href=\"Chronormu\"&gt;Chronormu&lt;/a&gt; and the infinite dragon &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; are lost in time. Nozdormu, &lt;a href=\"Soridormi\"&gt;Soridormi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Andantenormu\"&gt;Andantenormu&lt;/a&gt;, and an adventurer chase them across time to save them. After returning to the present, Nozdormu allows Eternus to leave for now because she helped Chromie get home. Eternus does leave, but promises that she will corrupt Nozdormu eventually.\nNozdormu agrees with her conclusion, and resigned to his fate, knows that the day in which he will become Murozond is coming soon. He asks Chromie when that time comes to do what must be done, and Chromie says that she will find another way. Despite Nozdormu insisting that his fate is inevitable, Chromie says that she'll search every timeline for a way to save him. With a smile and his confidence restored, Nozdormu tells her how proud he has always been of her.\nIn a titan sanctum decorated with runes mentioning &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;, an adventurer finds a &lt;a href=\"Echo%20of%20Duty\"&gt;swirling sphere&lt;/a&gt; which seems to whisper Nozdormu's name. Upon delivering it to the Aspect, Nozdormu recognizes the sphere and thought it had been lost. He recounts how after he had been empowered by Aman'Thul, great secrets had been revealed to him. He captured that knowledge within the sphere: an echo of what is, what has been, and what must always be. He hid the sphere away in a corner of every timeline so that he would always remember those words, even after he reached his fate.\nWith the Bronze Oathstone restored, Nozdormu and the adventurer returned to Valdrakken and informed Alexstrasza that all the oathstones were now active.\nSometime later Alexstrasza decided to show their mortal allies the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Scale\"&gt;Silver Scale&lt;/a&gt;, that &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt; had left in their possession long ago, which served as a symbol of unity and friendship to the dragonflights. However as she revealed to it, Kalechos noted that it pulsed with magic, which was a surprise to her and Nozdormu, who thought it was an example of the scale simple changing in their absence. However, Alexstrasza believed that their return to the Dragon Isles had awakened the scale, that Tyr had left them on last enigma for them to investigate. Thus she directed &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; and adventurers with venturing to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; for answers.\nAs the pair investigated, they ultimately awaken the magic within Tyrhold by placing the scale within and subsequently used the scale to draw out the secrets about the place. They ultimately created a spark, whose creation was felt by Kalecgos, who shared it with his fellow aspects, and the trio departed from Valdrakken to join the pair at Tyrhold. After witnessing a memory of Tyr's departure from the original five aspects, Nozdormu reflected on how the bronze dragonflight tended to forget it can be pleasant to linger on certain moments and admitted that he missed Tyr. After Alexstrasza expressed her hope that Tyr would be proud of their accomplishments and that \"dragonkind thrives\", they were group were would be stunned when the spark reacted to that statement and revealed a message from Tyr directing them to reactivate the forge within Tyrhold, while revealing that the Silver Scale was the key. Following this deed being done, the silver scale was placed within the forge, where to the shock of all present it had forged a new lifeless body of Tyr, himself. Though noting that the body didn't have the spark of life, Alexstrasza couldn't help but be overcome with gratitude that a long-lost friend had been returned to them, and expressed that they must do what they could to restore his true self.\nAfter sensing Alexstrasza's attempt at using the Mother Oathstone to restore their aspectral powers, Nozdormu quickly returned to Tyrhold. However, upon his arrival she was nowhere to be informed, having rushed off in an attempt to stop Raszageth from breaking into the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Incarnates\"&gt;Vault of the Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; to free her fellow &lt;a href=\"Primal%20Incarnates\"&gt;Primal Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; from their prison. Fearing that the timeways will bend to a dark future for all of Azeroth should Raszageth succeed, he sent adventurers to regroup with Alexstrasza, who revealed that she was unable to stop Raszageth from breaking into the vault. While he and the Dragon-Queen planned for whatever is to come, Kalecgos, &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;, and adventurers were into the vault to stop her.\nIn time he was informed that while Raszageth was slain, she had successfully freed her siblings. Upon hearing this news Nozdormu found that his vision was still clouded but sensed a dark future was coming, which causes Alexstrasza to reflect that Raszageth's reckless haste had caused her death and that the other Incarnates would not make the same mistake. Khadgar noticed that they were particularly concerned with &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt;'s release over the others, causing the pair to reveal that while &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; were loyal to the Primalists ideals, it was Iridikron who had truly devoted himself to the war, striking dark bargains to do so. However, Kalecgos rallied them together by reminding them that only together do they have a chance at victory. Thus the group vowed to move forward together as one against the Incarnates and were determined to protect Azeroth.\nEmbers of Neltharion.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Incarnates\"&gt;Incarnates&lt;/a&gt; opened the way into the &lt;a href=\"Zaralek%20Cavern\"&gt;Zaralek Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; called upon &lt;a href=\"Ebyssian\"&gt;Ebyssian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabellian\"&gt;Sabellian&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;, and the adventurer to enter and deal with &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;. During this meeting, Nozdormu admitted that seeing the past through Emberthal's eye gave them insight into Deathwing and how he pursued deeply misguided means to stop his foes. Though revealing that the Aspects would never forgive him, Nozdormu believed that the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; which they believed so thoroughly poisoned shall be one of the greatest strengths in the battles to come. However he admitted that it wasn't something he saw within the timeways, but as something he feels as a fellow dragon.\nNozdormu was present when the group returned and learned that Fyrakk had consumed &lt;a href=\"Shadowflame\"&gt;Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt; and bore witness to Alexstrasza initially barring the black dragonflight from returning, unwillingly to risk losing them, before Ebyssian convinced her that they had the strength to resist what lies below. In the aftermath of Ebyssian being selected as the new Aspect of the black dragonflight, Alexstrasza declared that the threat of Aberrus had been quailed and had made them grow stronger, while declaring that soon Azeroth would welcome a &lt;a href=\"The%20Sisters%27%20Tear\"&gt;s symbol hope&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and that they would protect it. Nozdormu admitted that as much as he wanted to enjoy the victory, he couldn't. He revealed that the moment he feared draws ever closer, with nothing he can do to stop it. He then declared that when that moment happened, he knows that the adventurer would do what must be done. He then subsequently thanked them now, before he was unable to do so.\nDuring this time he aided dracthyr with crafting &lt;a href=\"Nasz%27uro%2C%20the%20Unbound%20Legacy\"&gt;Nasz'uro, the Unbound Legacy&lt;/a&gt; for them to use from the shard of the &lt;a href=\"Oathbinder\"&gt;Oathbinder&lt;/a&gt; they obtained from &lt;a href=\"Scalecommander%20Sarkareth\"&gt;Scalecommander Sarkareth&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn time he called adventurers to return to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt;, as he felt the energy that transcends time in the Silver Scale and believed that this would enable them to collect memories that Tyr did not implement on the scale. Adventurers and &lt;a href=\"Watcher%20Koranos\"&gt;Watcher Koranos&lt;/a&gt; were subsequently sent to &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Tyr\"&gt;Tomb of Tyr&lt;/a&gt; to acquire whatever memories were present. After obtaining memories and witnessing Tyr's final moments, they returned to the Aspects and uploaded the memories. However, the copy of Tyr only briefly moved before shutting down once more, dismaying Nozdormu who hoped for a future with Tyr to help guide them. He further admitted that the timeways grew ever more difficult to read and that all that was left was to prepare for the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nFractures in Time.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; inquired if the clouds still accosted his mind, Nozdormu revealed that something worse had happened, a moment of clarity in which he had seen that the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Iridikron\"&gt;Iridikron&lt;/a&gt; had struck a bargain, involving his descent into &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;. While he was pessimistic about his fate Alexstrasza declared that she and their allies wouldn't give up on him.\nSometime later he called upon adventures, as they were one of the few he entrusted the safeguarding of their future with, to meet with him in &lt;a href=\"Eon%27s%20Fringe\"&gt;Eon's Fringe&lt;/a&gt; to speak more of this dark alliance opposing the &lt;a href=\"bronze%20dragonflight\"&gt;bronze dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;. However, upon their arrival, they met with a sandy version of Nozdormu who directed them with checking on Alexstrasza who had become increasingly upset over the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Primalists\"&gt;war against the Primalists&lt;/a&gt;, while a future version of &lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; claimed that she was there to solve the matter that Nozdormu wished to speak with them about.\nHowever, this proved a ruse as this future Chromie was in reality &lt;a href=\"Morchie\"&gt;Morchie&lt;/a&gt;, a Chromie who had become a member of the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; and sought to bring about the rise of Murozond. As the infinite dragonflight invaded the &lt;a href=\"Bronze%20Temple.\"&gt;Bronze Temple&lt;/a&gt;, Nozdormu arrived and remarked that it was too late for him, only for Chromie to argue that it was never too late and swore to not give on him. Reflecting on how she was ever the optimist, Nozdormu agreed that they had to try. As Nozdormu and his allies confronted the infinite dragonflight, Nozdormu tracked them to the moment where he dared not thread, the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;'s death.\nAs he stayed behind, Chromie and adventures gave chase into the distant past, where they discovered that the bargain between the infinites and Iridikron involved them taking him to the time of Galakrond's demise so he could claim the fallen dragon's essence, while agreeing to act as a distraction to any allies of the bronze dragonflight that sought to stop them. Their plan finally came to pass, as while Chromie and adventures were focused on stopping Iridikron from acquiring Galakrond's essence, &lt;a href=\"Chrono-Lord%20Deios\"&gt;Chrono-Lord Deios&lt;/a&gt; did battle with the Proto-Aspects and seemingly corrupted the proto-dragon version of Nozdormu into Murozond. With this single time alteration, the infinite dragonflight changed the history of Azeroth and created a new timeline. In order to restore Azeroth's timeline, Chromie and her allies made their way back into the past and aided the Proto-Aspects in stopping Deios, while Iridikron was able to successfully claim Galakrond's essence.\nIn the aftermath, Nozdormu thanked adventures for saving him from the fate that he thought was all but inevitable, showing his belief that the descent into Murozond is no longer an inevitability. Though it is unclear if the rise of Murozond has been completely averted, as presumably other members of the infinite dragonflight like &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; would still be seeking the rise of Murozond. Nozdormu further revealed that the clouds in his visions have parted and that he while couldn't see where Iridikron had gone after his escape through a void gate, he did behold burning embers encroaching upon &lt;a href=\"Amirdrassil\"&gt;Amirdrassil&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Alexstrasza stated that &lt;a href=\"Merithra\"&gt;Merithra&lt;/a&gt; must be warned and that as dangerous as he was they had to leave Iridikron to his schemes and steel themselves for whatever &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vyranoth\"&gt;Vyranoth&lt;/a&gt; were preparing to unleash. In agreement, Nozdormu declared that Chromie was right in saying that the future was worth fighting for.\nFury Incarnate.\n&lt;a href=\"Chromie\"&gt;Chromie&lt;/a&gt; had arranged for Nozdormu to meet with &lt;a href=\"Eternus\"&gt;Eternus&lt;/a&gt; in the hopes of swaying Eternus to their point of view, with Nozdormu noting that it would be a delicate meeting. At this meeting, Nozdormu admitted that while &lt;a href=\"Dragonflight\"&gt;their flights&lt;/a&gt; viewed the timeline differently, he hoped to discuss peace between them. An outraged Eternus declared that he had no idea what drove them to accept the infinites' ethos, causing him to ask her to help him understand as he sought to mend the rift between their people. Thus Eternus revealed that she joined the &lt;a href=\"infinite%20dragonflight\"&gt;infinite dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; due to the death of her sister &lt;a href=\"Moraidormi\"&gt;Moraidormi&lt;/a&gt; and her not being allowed to save her. Seeking to understand the infinites, Nozdormu allowed Eternus to show them the past and attempt to save her sister. Through this, Nozdormu was able to make Eternus see that Moraidormi had chosen to sacrifice her own life to save a hidden bronze whelping. Eternus subsequently decided to respect her sister's choice and they returned to the present. Upon their return, Eternus questioned if Nozdormu was going to tell her that he was right, only for the Timeless One to admit that he wasn't because Moraidormi's death was a tragedy, that shouldn't have happened. He then revealed that as a steward of the timeline he must always take the greater good and free will of others into account, but tht Eternus had reminded him that compassion must be considered and the one thing he agreed with the infinites with was that some events were worth changing because their hearts wished it so. In response, Eternus acknowledged that he never wished to become &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt;, that she herself must remember compassion, how it told her to follow him as he was, and promised to speak with the other infinites.\nAs a gesture of goodwill, Eternus pledged her assistance in finding the disc that contains &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s memories, and traveled to &lt;a href=\"Tyrhold\"&gt;Tyrhold&lt;/a&gt; with Nozdormu and Chromie. In time, they discovered that the disc was sent to the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Elisande\"&gt;Elisande&lt;/a&gt;'s possession, to which Nozdormu warned that &lt;a href=\"Travard\"&gt;Travard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt; would need time to prepare before retrieving the disc as Elisande will be a dangerous foe.\nFuture corruption.\nSome day in the future, Nozdormu will fall to madness. Tricked by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old Gods&lt;/a&gt; into trying to subvert his own mortality, Nozdormu will shatter the timeways and create the infinite dragonflight, becoming &lt;a href=\"Murozond\"&gt;Murozond&lt;/a&gt; in the process.\nQuotes.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nEnd Time.\nYes, &lt;name&gt;?\nDragonflight.\nI fear time may unravel if we do not act.\nIn the RPG.\nNozdormu is a slim and sinuous bronze dragon, with scales of a metallic golden-brown color, and can arrange sand to conform to his body, cementing into one definite form. His eyes are made from gemstones, the color of the sun. He moves with a speed and grace belied by his monstrous form. Curiously, his position seems to change from moment to moment, as though its location in space were constantly in flux.\nNozdormu is tasked with ensuring that the flow of time occurs normally, without interruption, and that events happen as they are fated. To accomplish this mission, Nozdormu knows much about the nature of time. He uses his abilities and powers to prevent others from discovering these same secrets. Should a sorcerer or other mortal being begin to delve too deeply into magic that alters or affects time, Nozdormu always steps in to remove the threat, one way or another. Nozdormu is closely associated with time itself and is the very soul of patience. He has few worshippers, save perhaps among the night elves who wish to become once again timeless themselves. He pays no attention to those who venerate him, neither accepting nor disapproving of their efforts. Nozdormu lives in the &lt;a href=\"Caverns%20of%20Time\"&gt;Caverns of Time&lt;/a&gt;, a closely guarded complex located deep in the &lt;a href=\"Tanaris%20Desert\"&gt;Tanaris Desert&lt;/a&gt;. Those who venture there and get past the bronze dragon sentinels rarely emerge unchanged. Some age, or become so youthful they are but infants. Others are lost in time and return decades or even centuries later. There are even legends of some who leave the caverns before they even enter!\nNozdormu is difficult to defeat because of his ability to look into the corridors of time and repeat events if they do not progress as he feels they should. He is extremely wise and uses his insight to determine the best course of action before proceeding. Should this fail, he simply tries again as necessary or uses his power to avoid the encounter entirely. Nozdormu can take any form he desires, as though constantly under the effects of a shapechange spell. He frequently takes on the role of a humanoid creature and travels incognito as a simple commoner or peon. When doing this, the only consistent trait he displays is the absence of any need to hurry.\nIn the early years, it is said that &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s black flight attempted to subjugate the bronze dragons. The assault was unsuccessful, primarily because the bronze dragons did not stay and fight as expected. His command of time offering insight into the blacks' plans, Nozdormu alerted his flight of the danger. The bronze dragonflight scattered to the four corners of the globe, where they continue to monitor events.\nIn Hearthstone.\nNozdormu appears as in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\". His flavor text reads: \"Time to write some flavor text.\"\nHe reappears in the \"\" expansion as the legendary paladin card . His flavor text reads: \"Time is mana!\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

There are different reasons of why it is not possible to maintain a \"state of nuking\" over longer durations of time:\nSituation examples.\nThere are several situations which may require nuking.

Simple enough, \"healing nuking\" (if such a term exists) is the act of &lt;a href=\"spamming\"&gt;spamming&lt;/a&gt; powerful - either swift, effective, or both - and costly healing spells in situations where the player itself or/and the group/raid is taking heavy damage.

Now we're just waiting for the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to finish their stockpiling and the transport of the war material can begin.\nLooks like the last of the goods we've collected are shipping out to &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; over the next 5 days. And once that's done, someone will have to come along and ring the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scarab%20Gong\"&gt;gong&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Scarab%20Dais\"&gt;Scarab Dais&lt;/a&gt;, outside of Ahn'Qiraj, to open the &lt;a href=\"Gates%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj%20%28subzone%29\"&gt;gates&lt;/a&gt;.

Have one of your demons tank the overfiend while you stay out of range of Fel Sear and Felflame Shield.\nStage 3: Demon Hunting.\nMephistroth has traveled to a clearing on the other side of the river.\nHead across the stone bridge until you reach the area covered in Hellfire, which reduces movement speed by 85% and deals heavy Fire damage to anyone standing in it. Place a &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Gateway\"&gt;Demonic Gateway&lt;/a&gt; on the other side of the Hellfire area to travel across to where the dreadlord is standing.\nStage 4: The Legion.\nWaves of enemies begin to emerge from the large building nearby.

It will soon be destroyed!\"\nAs you travel along the path, a &lt;a href=\"Dreadfall%20Infernal\"&gt;Dreadfall Infernal&lt;/a&gt; suddenly falls from the sky and attacks you. After destroying it, proceed to the dreadlord. At level 100, Mephistroth has 481,000 health and mainly uses a ranged &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Blast\"&gt;Mind Blast&lt;/a&gt; spell. He can also cast \"Haze of the Dreadlord\", which summons moving clouds that reduce movement speed by 75% and inflict Shadow damage every second to those who stand in them.\nAggro:\nWhen he has almost been reduced to 1% health, the dreadlord teleports away in a cloud of smoke.\nStage 6: The Skull of the Man'ari.\nThe Skull of the Man'ari is floating in the middle of the area. Loot and equip it.\nFinal Stage: There's a New Master in Town.\nA &lt;a href=\"Portal%20of%20Thal%27kiel\"&gt;demonic portal&lt;/a&gt; has appeared nearby.

A dark apothecary who bleeds himself, can drip the blood into a vial of water to create one dose of poison.

What is a secret \u2014 at least, what many inscribers would like to keep secret \u2014 is that they can use runes for a darker purpose.

They are considered as the elite agents of the Forsaken on the battlefields, and once, served as the personal guards of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Ranger Lord &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; trained a new generation of dark rangers comprising of undead humans. Following the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, numerous night elves were raised to undeath and became dark rangers under the lead of their captain, &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt;. At the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, some of the dark rangers joined Sylvanas and her &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;loyalists&lt;/a&gt; after she abandoned the Horde, the others remained loyal to the Forsaken and their faction.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were reclaimed by the Forsaken, the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; allowed the kaldorei dark rangers to rejoin the Alliance, for those who wish to return to their people.\nHistory.\nThird War.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Prince Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;invaded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, he raised the fallen members of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;'s army either as incorporeal &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s or as intact bodies. These fallen &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; would become known as Darkfallen, prowling the lands as dark rangers for the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. Over time, some returned to the forests, others were sent on missions, and a few simply stayed put. When Arthas' power began to wane after his return from &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas called the dark rangers to her side. They accompanied her to &lt;a href=\"Deatholme\"&gt;Deatholme&lt;/a&gt;.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nThe dark rangers joined the Forsaken assault into &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, and many were seen as part of the &lt;a href=\"Hand%20of%20Vengeance\"&gt;Hand of Vengeance&lt;/a&gt;. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Undercity\"&gt;liberation&lt;/a&gt; of the Undercity from the traitors &lt;a href=\"Putress\"&gt;Putress&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken as a whole came under scrutiny, and the &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Elite\"&gt;Kor'kron Elite&lt;/a&gt; were stationed in the Undercity. Among the changes made were the additions of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Clea\"&gt;Dark Ranger Clea&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Cyndia\"&gt;Dark Ranger Cyndia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Anya\"&gt;Dark Ranger Anya&lt;/a&gt;, now serving as the elite patrols within the Undercity, replacing the &lt;a href=\"Seeker%20%28guard%29\"&gt;Seekers&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs the war in Northrend drew to a close, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt; herself traveled to the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Halls\"&gt;Frozen Halls&lt;/a&gt; to take vengeance upon &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Vorel\"&gt;Dark Ranger Vorel&lt;/a&gt; enlisted agents of the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to meet with the Dark Lady along with Dark rangers &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Loralen\"&gt;Loralen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Kalira\"&gt;Kalira&lt;/a&gt;. Loralen is ultimately slain by the Lich King, though Kalira manages to gather reinforcements in the form of &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Orgrim's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; in order to escape the halls.\nTheir sudden reappearance during the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; would foreshadow the introduction of the &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; class to the Forsaken.\nCataclysm.\nFollowing the death of the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken have reinforced their territories and took a far more aggressive stance in their war against the remnants of the Scarlet Crusade, the Scourge, and the Alliance. Consequently, the dark rangers have taken on a more visible presence, and could be seen throughout &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Gilneas\"&gt;Battle for Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, a number of dark rangers accompanied Lady Sylvanas and discovered the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, the likes of which would allow the Forsaken to have full dominion over the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, though it escaped from their grasp.\nUnder the command of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Alina\"&gt;Dark Ranger Alina&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Galen%20Trollbane\"&gt;Galen Trollbane&lt;/a&gt;, the Forsaken have set their sights on the Arathi Highlands. Later, Alina believed that the fallen nation of &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; would make a fine setting for a new Undercity.\nDuring the Hillsbrad conflict, dark rangers were seen with domesticated &lt;a href=\"spider\"&gt;spider&lt;/a&gt;s doing battle with the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. They are empowered by &lt;a href=\"Helcular\"&gt;Helcular&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; in decline, Forsaken troops led by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; were sent to remove the last traces of it from their territory.\nLegion.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Ranger Lord Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; finished training a new generation of Forsaken rangers made up of undead humans, making the undead racial composition of the order more diverse.\nPrior to the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, dark rangers could be seen at the &lt;a href=\"Dranosh%27ar%20Blockade\"&gt;Dranosh'ar Blockade&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, preparing for the assault. They were later present on the battlefield, alongside the forces of the Horde against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Later, a contingent of dark rangers led by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Unseen%20Path\"&gt;Unseen Path&lt;/a&gt;, the union of all hunters on &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Storm.\nAs the &lt;a href=\"Gathering\"&gt;Gathering&lt;/a&gt; occurred in the &lt;a href=\"Arathi%20Highlands\"&gt;Arathi Highlands&lt;/a&gt;, Sylvanas took 200 dark rangers with her to &lt;a href=\"Thoradin%27s%20Wall\"&gt;Thoradin's Wall&lt;/a&gt;. When Sylvanas noticed the Forsaken of the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt; walking towards &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20Keep\"&gt;Stromgarde Keep&lt;/a&gt;, defecting to the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, she ordered the dark rangers to kill every Forsaken on the field but spare the humans. The rangers mounted bats and carried out the task, harming no humans. Then they regrouped with their queen where she just killed &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt;. As King &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; gathered Calia's body, Sylvanas and her dark rangers simply left.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, dark rangers participated in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; and other major conflicts. After the fall of the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, a group of them conducted a guerilla war from the abandoned town of &lt;a href=\"Strahnbrad\"&gt;Strahnbrad&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nNumerous &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; slain during the War of the Thorns were raised to undeath as &lt;a href=\"Darkfallen\"&gt;Darkfallen&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. These undead kaldorei became &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Dark%20Ranger\"&gt;Kaldorei Dark Ranger&lt;/a&gt;s, and are since led by &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; who acts as their new captain. The &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; was also raised to join the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, but as a \"Dark Warden\". They later participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; as part of the Horde forces.\nDuring the conflict, dark rangers were generally used as elite enforcers of Sylvanas' will, executing the warchief's secret orders and protecting its loyalists. While some of them &lt;a href=\"Banshee%20loyalists\"&gt;sided&lt;/a&gt; with Sylvanas when she betrayed the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, many more remained with the Horde however.\nShadowlands.\nFollowing the end of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Jailer\"&gt;war against the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, a number of dark rangers joined the Forsaken as they mustered in the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;. In the rebuilding &lt;a href=\"Brill\"&gt;Brill&lt;/a&gt;, they took position to protect the town and destroy the blighted undead in the area. After the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Ruins of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; were cleansed, the dark rangers moved there and began to patrol, while &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Velonara\"&gt;Dark Ranger Velonara&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Desolate%20Council\"&gt;Desolate Council&lt;/a&gt;, the new governing body of the Forsaken. \nAmong the night elves raised as Darkfallen during the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and others dark rangers decided to stay with the Forsaken, while others had the right to return to their own and rejoined the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nRaces.\nNearly all dark rangers are &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; with blood-red eyes and deathly pale skin, once &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Elven%20ranger\"&gt;rangers&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, killed by &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge%20invasion%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Scourge invasion of Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore he trained a new generation of &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; rangers comprising of undead humans, making the undead racial composition more diverse, &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt; was the only one human dark ranger.\nNumerous &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; killed during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; were later raised from the dead by Sylvanas and her &lt;a href=\"val%27kyr\"&gt;val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;s, turning them into loyal dark rangers.\nAppearance and attire.\nElven dark rangers are typically clad in a leather-looking outfit complete with a hood, which could be seen as a dark twist of the &lt;a href=\"Farstrider\"&gt;Farstrider&lt;/a&gt; attire. Nearly all of them are seen with a cloak. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Anya\"&gt;Dark Ranger Anya&lt;/a&gt; is a prominent example of this style. Another dark ranger outfit, as sported by &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Ranger%20Lyana\"&gt;Dark Ranger Lyana&lt;/a&gt;, is also not an uncommon dark ranger style of choice.\nThe generation of Forsaken rangers, comprising of undead humans trained by Nathanos, appear to favor the woodsman axe and the crossbow in contrast to the bow and arrow typically employed by their undead elf counterparts. Like Nathanos, they sport a leather-looking outfit and optionally a hood and face mask.\nIn Warcraft III.\nIn \"&lt;a href=\"The%20Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;The Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;\", Sylvanas Windrunner \u2014 after being raised as a &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 regained her physical body and became the first dark ranger. Dark Rangers are a playable hero class.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, Banshee Queen of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, regained her physical body, she realized that the natural world would never respond to her wishes again. Angered by this development, she turned to the arts that were becoming more and more natural to her: &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromancy&lt;/a&gt;. She altered her &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt; teachings into a new form. Thus, the dark rangers were born.\nAbilities.\nDark rangers are similar to their high elven cousins but focus on shadowcraft more than nature. Dark rangers are silent and invisible stalkers of the shadows, felling unsuspecting opponents with a single arrow. Dark rangers still favor the bow as the ultimate weapon, using the same arts that Quel'Thalas taught for millennia. Their spells work with manipulating the essences of life and death, as well as various horrible curses and mind-enslaving abilities.\nDark rangers' senses grow sharper than even those of other Forsaken. The dark ranger learns how to fade into dark conditions, wrapping herself with shadows. The skilled dark ranger can notice the tiny movements of her enemies along with other visual and auditory cues that allow her to react more quickly in combat.\nWhile they no longer study nature, dark rangers remain some of the best trackers in the world. Naturally, most dark rangers hail from the scout class, but many newer rangers are former rogues, who use their stealth abilities to act as silent and near-invisible slayers for the Dark Lady.\nRelations.\nOnce fully trained, Sylvanas's dark rangers once again assumed their roles as guardians and hunters, now working for the Forsaken. Some undead, especially former elves, view rangers as a necessary force and trust them implicitly. Other Forsaken view these shadow killers as relics of an old past, with an inability to move along with the times.\nDark Rangers serve as generals for Forsaken armies, as well as elite &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"assassin\"&gt;assassin&lt;/a&gt;s. Like most Forsaken, dark rangers remain in the back lines, performing precision attacks and curses.\nConversion.\nAn elven ranger who dies and returns as a Forsaken undergoes a great shock. She can no longer cast elven ranger spells and loses her woodland stride ability. While some may choose to let things be, most immediately seek out a dark ranger to relearn their arts.\nAn elven ranger seeking to convert to a dark ranger must, of course, have died, returned as a Forsaken, and seek to learn the arts of the shadow rather than the wild. This ordeal is difficult, as the dark ranger must twist everything she was taught about nature to start learning her darker trade. Then comes the hard part. A dark ranger-to-be must undergo a lengthy trial, where she unlearns everything she was taught as an elf and learns the new arts of a Forsaken.\nFaith.\nA recent movement among the Forsaken has taken hold of dark rangers. The &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20Forgotten%20Shadow\"&gt;Cult of Forgotten Shadow&lt;/a&gt; moves like wildfire among the undead, and the dark rangers are no exception to the obsession with the faith.\nTo fill the void left by the \"loss of their druidism,\" the dark rangers latched onto the Forgotten Shadow. Most dark rangers sympathize with the origins of the Forgotten Shadow and perhaps understand the Shadow more than any other undead in Lordaeron. While this movement disturbs &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sylvanas\"&gt;Lady Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, she allows it to continue.\nCharacter customization.\nThe quest achievement &lt;a href=\"Return%20to%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Return to Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; unlocks \"Dark Ranger\" customization with white skin and glowing red eye options for &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;blood elf&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"void%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;void elf&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; characters. The customization isn't available to &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt; characters.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"patch%209.2.5\"&gt;patch 9.2.5&lt;/a&gt;, it was possible to almost fully replicate the dark ranger look and outfit in \"World of Warcraft\". A blood elf female using extremely pale skin (a death knight often works) can acquire the &lt;a href=\"Stormshroud%20Armor\"&gt;Stormshroud Armor&lt;/a&gt; (legs, hands, and shoulders), &lt;a href=\"Tombstone%20Breastplate\"&gt;Tombstone Breastplate&lt;/a&gt; (chest), &lt;a href=\"Dar%27toon%27s%20Cloak\"&gt;Dar'toon's Cloak&lt;/a&gt; (cape), and &lt;a href=\"Traveler%27s%20Boots\"&gt;Traveler's Boots&lt;/a&gt; (boots, or a similar model) can be found. The red eyes are difficult to bypass, though &lt;a href=\"Stealther%27s%20Helmet%20of%20Second%20Sight\"&gt;Stealther's Helmet of Second Sight&lt;/a&gt; or an identical model conveniently offers both a hood and cosmetic red eyes."}

{"id": "18441", "revid": "4083176", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18441", "title": "Dark troll", "text": "The dark trolls are an elusive and mysterious subgroup of dark-skinned &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s that once lived under &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; and several other scattered areas around the western and central parts of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, it was a group of dark trolls living on the borders of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; that evolved into the first &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. According to scattered reports, dark trolls have gray to black skin and lead a mostly subterranean existence. They are believed to be cannibals for the most part. Only a single dark troll tribe has been seen in the modern era: the &lt;a href=\"Shadowtooth%20clan\"&gt;Shadowtooth clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nAncient times.\nBefore their &lt;a href=\"Aqir%20and%20Troll%20War\"&gt;war with the aqir&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; tribes claimed most of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor%20%28landmass%29\"&gt;ancient Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. Many of the tribes constantly clashed with each other, but one tribe, the dark trolls, lived in a network of deep caverns stretching beneath &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;. They hated the daylight and only emerged from their caverns at night. In time, these nocturnal habits turned their blue skin into hues of gray. The dark trolls were unconcerned with the other tribes' skirmishes and cherished their independence from the rest of troll society, mostly ignoring the activity of the other tribes. Unlike the &lt;a href=\"Amani%20Empire\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Gurubashi%20Empire\"&gt;Gurubashi&lt;/a&gt;, the dark trolls sought a peaceful connection to the natural world, and their mystics sought ways to commune and live in harmony with the land.\nGradually, many dark trolls migrated towards the labyrinthine groves at the heart of Kalimdor, encountering creatures such as &lt;a href=\"dryad\"&gt;dryad&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"faerie%20dragon\"&gt;faerie dragon&lt;/a&gt;s along the way. They eventually discovered an enormous lake filled with magical energies at the very center of the continent. Calling the lake the \"&lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;\", the dark trolls settled upon its shores. Over generations, the energies of the Well transformed them, elevating their forms and transforming them into highly intelligent and virtually immortal beings.\nThese former trolls gradually abandoned their ancient heritage, and the tribe's mystics started worshipping \"&lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;\", a nocturnal moon goddess which they believed slumbered in the Well's depths during the day. They also discovered the name \"Kalimdor\" and other &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"titan%20%28language%29\"&gt;words&lt;/a&gt; from communing with Elune and investigating strange artifacts scattered around the Well. Influenced by this newfound language, they called themselves \"kaldorei\" (\"children of the stars\") or &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThird War.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, when &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hellscream\"&gt;Grommash Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; first arrived in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale Forest&lt;/a&gt;, he found and destroyed a dark troll settlement there and took a &lt;a href=\"Crystal%20Ball\"&gt;crystal ball&lt;/a&gt;. Later, small settlements of dark trolls were also destroyed by a night elf army led by &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; during their search for the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt;. However, towards the end of the war, the &lt;a href=\"Shadowtooth%20clan\"&gt;Shadowtooth clan&lt;/a&gt; joined the night elves, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in their last stand against &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Battle of Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAs of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the dark trolls are nowhere to be found on Mount Hyjal. &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; believes that they were wiped out by the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, but he hasn't had a chance to check their caves yet.\nBattle for Azeroth.\n&lt;a href=\"Speaker%20Ik%27nal\"&gt;Speaker Ik'nal&lt;/a&gt; can be found in &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;. She confirms that the Shadowtooth were wiped out by the Twilight's Hammer. However, the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari\"&gt;Zandalari&lt;/a&gt; keep one representative around as a memento of the past. Ik'nal is now nothing more than a curiosity.\nIn the RPG.\nDark trolls are the tallest and rarest known species of &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;kind. Dark trolls are muscular, wiry humanoids that stand almost 10 feet tall. They have a royal purple hue of skin and pointed features. Their choice of war paint tends to be black or a shade of purple. They have pale yellow eyes that glare as they slip out of shadows.\nDark trolls lead a mostly subterranean existence, and emerge at night to hunt. They have a tribal structure, in which physical power and cunning are held in great esteem. Tribal shamans offer spiritual guidance and divine magic when necessary. This is similar \u2014 but far more primitive \u2014 in social structure to &lt;a href=\"jungle%20troll\"&gt;jungle troll&lt;/a&gt;s, the most civilized of trollkind. They practice voodoo, ritual sacrifices, and even occasional cannibalism. Dark trolls are possibly the most violent of all troll species and are feared even among their own kind.\nDark troll culture is as primitive as their &lt;a href=\"forest%20troll\"&gt;forest troll&lt;/a&gt; cousins but they are more violent than forest trolls, and it has been theorized that dark trolls are much less intelligent than the other trolls. It is said that there are various tribes within the dark trolls. They attack with battleaxes or spears in combat, but they are by no means limited to using weapons. Even when disarmed, they can be lethal with their claws. They fight without fear, relying on their natural healing ability to keep them going. A dark troll's favored class is &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;. Though they can be found nearly anywhere, they prefer darkness to daylight. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; find the dark trolls of interest. &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s are becoming fast friends with the dark trolls as both races enjoy the stolen loot the pirates obtain."}

Others were reanimated as &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s, becoming the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s champions.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; slowly began to lose his power after &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;'s failed attempt to kill him in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, many Darkfallen dark rangers had their conscious will restored. They later joined &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, as elite agents and personal guards of the Banshee Queen.\nThe Frozen Throne.\nIn the aftermath of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; were cut off from their source of &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;. Desperate for aid, their prince &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; pledged allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; who taught them how to siphon magic, and how to wield &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;. The blood elves, or &lt;a href=\"Sunfury\"&gt;Sunfury&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to avenge their fallen brethren, participated in Illidan's attempt to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; intervened, and the two armies clashed, but the undead ultimately defeated Illidan's forces at the foot of &lt;a href=\"Icecrown\"&gt;Icecrown&lt;/a&gt;.

Under the lead of &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Darion%20Mograine\"&gt;Highlord Darion Mograine&lt;/a&gt;, they formed the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, took control of as their headquarters, and cooperated with the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Crusade\"&gt;Argent Crusade&lt;/a&gt; to defeat &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Scourgewar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; raised to undeath fallen &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, turning them into Darkfallen dark rangers.

It is summoned through the &lt;a href=\"Summon%20Darkglare\"&gt;Summon Darkglare&lt;/a&gt; ability. When summoned, the Darkglare immediately extends the duration of all of the warlock's damage over time effects on all targets by 8 seconds. It then persists for 20 seconds, striking the warlock's current target repeatedly at range with shadow damage, increased by 10% for every damage over time effect the warlock has active on any target. \nSummon Darkglare synergizes extremely strongly with the level 15 Affliction talent &lt;a href=\"Deathbolt\"&gt;Deathbolt&lt;/a&gt;. The warlock can apply their normal DoTs (&lt;a href=\"Agony\"&gt;Agony&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Corruption\"&gt;Corruption&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Siphon%20Life\"&gt;Siphon Life&lt;/a&gt; if talented), cooldown DoTs (&lt;a href=\"Phantom%20Singularity\"&gt;Phantom Singularity&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Vile%20Taint\"&gt;Vile Taint&lt;/a&gt;), and then cast up to 5 &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Affliction\"&gt;Unstable Afflictions&lt;/a&gt; on the target (depending on &lt;a href=\"Soul%20Shards\"&gt;Soul Shards&lt;/a&gt; available). If the warlock follows this immediately with Summon Darkglare, then all of the DoTs will be extended by 8 seconds (including all 5 of the short-duration Unstable Affliction DoTs, which have a normal duration of only 8 seconds but can be extended well beyond this by the Darkglare). Immediately following this with Deathbolt will cause an extremely large burst of damage, allowing it to be one of the highest damage abilities in the game when used in this manner. "}

{"id": "86839", "revid": "2124194", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=86839", "title": "Terokk", "text": "Terokk was the greatest king of the &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt;. Terokk was associated with the goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; and believed to be her incarnation, though this was not actually the case. Terokk was the arakkoa's greatest hero who was betrayed by his own allies and afflicted with the Curse of Sethe. Even in this state, however, he sought to aid his fellow refugees by building the city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; with his own claws. However the curse soon began to drive him to madness, and he was sealed away by his Talonpriests in the hopes of rejuvenating him. He now waits in the shadows to be called back into the physical world and face the enemies of his people. \nThe heretical &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss\"&gt;Talon King Ikiss&lt;/a&gt; claims he is Terokk returned. \nTerokk also has an avatar in the form of a gigantic &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt;, unleashed on Shattrath when all of his plans are thwarted by adventurers at the behest of the Skettis refugees of the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt;. \nBiography.\nOn Draenor.\nSix hundred years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Talon King Terokk was an ancient king of the arakkoa of the &lt;a href=\"spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. He was beloved by the people and would often wear a mask to walk among them in hiding. The closest individual to Terokk was his daughter &lt;a href=\"Lithic\"&gt;Lithic&lt;/a&gt;, who crafted a golden bangle for him that he always wore. He shared power with an order of priests called the Anhar.\nTerokk had many enemies, among them &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Stalker\"&gt;stalkers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Serpent\"&gt;wind serpents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colossus\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt;, and even fellow arakkoa. One enemy in particular was &lt;a href=\"Pridelord%20Karash\"&gt;Pridelord Karash&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmane%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodmane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt;, who once declared war against the arakkoa. His torment of the arakkoa caused them to wonder why their sun goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly withdrawn her favor. Rather than send his troops, Terokk arrived to the battlefield in person and slaughtered most of the saberon. Terokk's victory over &lt;a href=\"Pridelord%20Karash\"&gt;Pridelord Karash&lt;/a&gt; caused the arakkoa to celebrate Terokk as a living legend. Indeed, they even claimed him to be Rukhmar's reincarnation. The Anhari priesthood began to grow nervous, for up until this point they alone had been allowed to speak in the sun goddess's name. Terokk used his widespread support to build a new city, &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, that called back to the accomplishments of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;. He created new laws restricting the authority of the Anhar order, declaring that high arakkoan society must be guided by a thirst for knowledge and wisdom, not by fear and superstition.\nBut however much his people loved and respected Terokk, the Anhari at Skyreach were jealous of him. Hungry for control, they conspired against Terokk and tossed both him and his daughter Lithic into the pools at &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, which were formed eons ago in the death of the primal god &lt;a href=\"Sethe\"&gt;Sethe&lt;/a&gt;. While Terokk survived the fall, Lithic did not; in his despair, Terokk surrendered to the darkness as his body withered and contorted, transforming Terokk into a flightless shadow of his former self. From that day forward Skyreach would be ruled not by a king but by the Anhari, now calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. \nA presence called Terokk from the brink of despair, however. &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, the great &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt; god, urged Terokk forward. Now mutated and flightless but with powers of darkness, Terokk moved forward and rallied his fellow broken arakkoa who the Adherents had also tossed into the pools. They moved through the Sethekk Hollow until they came across &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;The Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt; and met Anzu for the first time.\nAnzu gifted Terokk and his followers &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; powers and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; sorcery. In time, they would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest\"&gt;Talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s. Together, Terokk, Anzu, and the Talonpriests would build the refuge city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; among Apexis ruins and protect the unwanted children of Rukhmar: the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. The regions of &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; near to the Spires of Arak came under their control and became known as &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen the winged arakkoa learned of the results of Terokk's exile, rumors of his cursed state swept like wildfire through the arakkoa, giving rise to superstitious charms and cures. Eschewing traditional arakkoan weaponry, Terokk carried a cudgel as a symbol of his fall from king to outcast heretic. Rumors have persisted for centuries that rather than employing traditional wing-cutting as a punishment, Terokk simply shattered the beaks of those who dared to oppose him.\nAs the years went on Terokk's health declined, grief tore at his heart, and Sethe's curse chewed at his mind. He began to hate the world, abandoning Skettis and even sacrificing the lower castes of his own people to dark powers in search of a cure. The arakkoa did not seem to know the reason for this abandonment and attributed it to them turning away from the worship of Rukhmar. Hoping to rejuvenate their king, the Talonpriests sealed Terokk away in the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Realm\"&gt;Shadow Realm&lt;/a&gt;. All that was left of Terokk were several artifacts he left behind. But Terokk was foretold to return some day.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nTerokk seemingly surrendered completely to the madness of the Curse of Sethe during his long imprisonment in the shadows, and by the time of the War in Outland his minions worked in his name to commit evils throughout Terokkar Forest. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Shienor\"&gt;Veil Shienor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Reskk\"&gt;Veil Reskk&lt;/a&gt;, the Eyes of Skettis allowed Terokk to spy on those areas. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Skith\"&gt;Veil Skith&lt;/a&gt;, the arakkoa used the &lt;a href=\"Darkstone%20of%20Terokk\"&gt;Darkstone of Terokk&lt;/a&gt; as an altar of worship. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Rhaze\"&gt;Veil Rhaze&lt;/a&gt;, the spirits of arakkoa slain in the Auchindoun explosion remained with Terokk's influence remaining on them. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Lithic\"&gt;Veil Lithic&lt;/a&gt;, his minions corrupted &lt;a href=\"kaliri\"&gt;kaliri&lt;/a&gt; into his service. At &lt;a href=\"Veil%20Shalas\"&gt;Veil Shalas&lt;/a&gt;, the closest colony to Skettis, the arakkoa &lt;a href=\"sage\"&gt;sage&lt;/a&gt;s conducted wars against the Light.\nSome arakkoa, such as &lt;a href=\"Kirrik%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Kirrik the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rilak%20the%20Redeemed\"&gt;Rilak the Redeemed&lt;/a&gt;, believe that Terokk is a false prophet who will lead them to their doom. These &lt;a href=\"Skettis%20Exiles\"&gt;Skettis Exiles&lt;/a&gt; moved to &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and face the forces of Terokk in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, the heretical &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss\"&gt;Talon King Ikiss&lt;/a&gt; believes himself to be Terokk reborn and leads the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk\"&gt;Sethekk&lt;/a&gt; cult in the &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Halls\"&gt;Sethekk Halls&lt;/a&gt;.\nBut deep inside Skettis, the arakkoa continue their battles against all who oppose them. The &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari Skyguard&lt;/a&gt;, a group of Sha'tari flyers, have a base at Blackwind Landing, just outside of the Blackwind Valley where Skettis is located. On &lt;a href=\"Terokk%27s%20Rest\"&gt;an island in the middle of Blackwind Lake&lt;/a&gt;, Terokk awaited the proper alignment of the stars to herald his return. Working with &lt;a href=\"Hazzik\"&gt;Hazzik&lt;/a&gt;, adventurers summoned the maddened husk of the Talon King before he was ready and ended the once mighty arakkoa's life.\nQuests.\n&lt;a href=\"Terokk%27s%20Rest\"&gt;Terokk's Rest&lt;/a&gt;, a massive summoning circle with an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Skull%20Pile\"&gt;Ancient Skull Pile&lt;/a&gt; in the center, is located at the center of &lt;a href=\"Blackwind%20Lake\"&gt;Blackwind Lake&lt;/a&gt; in the heart of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt;. In Patch 2.1, a questline was introduced that in the end requires the player to summon Terokk himself at this location and destroy him once and for all. The final quest is &lt;a href=\"Terokk%27s%20Downfall\"&gt;Terokk's Downfall&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerokk's ancient enemies.\nTerokk, be he &lt;a href=\"god\"&gt;god&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mortal\"&gt;mortal&lt;/a&gt;, is said to have had many enemies in the past. It is not certain if these enemies were groups led by the individuals (more likely as many were sacrificed to dark powers when Terokk sought a cure to the curse), or just the individuals, of the following races who were his enemies: an Arakkoa, a &lt;a href=\"Colossus\"&gt;Colossus&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Stalker\"&gt;Warp Stalker&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Serpent\"&gt;Wind Serpent&lt;/a&gt;. Their descendants are being held prisoner by Skettis talonpriests who are likely waiting to kill them at the right time since Terokk himself says, when defeated, \"The stars are not yet aligned...my powers fail me!\" due to being summoned prematurely. In the quest &lt;a href=\"A%20Shabby%20Disguise\"&gt;A Shabby Disguise&lt;/a&gt;, it is prophesied that their demise will be followed by Terokk's return. Apparently, when his enemies and any of their descendants are finally gone, he has the power to return.\nDefeating Terokk.\nTerokk has the following abilities:\nThe relics of Terokk.\nTerokk was once revered by the arakkoa people, but one day mysteriously vanished, leaving his three artifacts behind: His spear, his mask and his writings. All were taken by the renegades of the Sethekk, led by the &lt;a href=\"Talon%20King%20Ikiss\"&gt;Talon King Ikiss&lt;/a&gt;. All three drop as quest items, but only one can be chosen as a quest reward.\nTime-Lost Figurine.\nA must-have drop from this mob is called the &lt;a href=\"Time-Lost%20Figurine\"&gt;Time-Lost Figurine&lt;/a&gt;, used to turn their character temporarily into a Arakkoa. While in this form going into combat does not change the player back, making this a fun and near must-have for many players. The difficulty, length, and rareness of obtaining the item however make it so players with it are scarce."}

The clerics in command have\nbeen shadowy spirits that can't be seen without the elixir. The commander asks you to use\nthe elixir and slay three of these clerics.\nTerokk's Downfall.\nThis quest chain is started by &lt;a href=\"Ishaal%27s%20Almanac\"&gt;Ishaal's Almanac&lt;/a&gt;, a book you pick up off the body of &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest%20Ishaal\"&gt;Talonpriest Ishaal&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt;, most often while completing &lt;a href=\"Secrets%20of%20the%20Talonpriests\"&gt;Secrets of the Talonpriests&lt;/a&gt;.\nExamining the almanac, you decide that &lt;a href=\"Sky%20Commander%20Adaris\"&gt;Sky Commander Adaris&lt;/a&gt; should have a look at it.\nAdaris is not well enough to try translating it, but an &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;Arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; he trusts, &lt;a href=\"Rilak%20the%20Redeemed\"&gt;Rilak the Redeemed&lt;/a&gt;, can. You take the book to him in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20City\"&gt;Lower City&lt;/a&gt; section of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;.\nRilak marvels at the book. It belonged to a talonpriest, beings he thought long gone. The almanac describes how a powerful and terrible Arakkoa king from the past will return. Your only choice, Rilak says, is to summon him prematurely. Rilak urges you speak to Adaris about this.\nUpon returning, though, Adaris refuses to believe that attempting a premature summons is the best course. \"Your job is done. This is a military matter, now.\"\nA nearby &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa\"&gt;Arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; prisoner, &lt;a href=\"Hazzik\"&gt;Hazzik&lt;/a&gt;, overhears these exchanges, and offers to help. He may be imprisoned by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Sha'tari&lt;/a&gt;, but under &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;'s reign, he would be a sacrifice. He asks that you pick up a package for him from his hut. Believing Rilak, you have little choice but to trust Hazzik, at least in this.\nHazzik proves true to his word. It seems that Hazzik has been helping the Ethereal smugglers who are looking for rare books. He has a truly pitiful disguise kit, something you'd have to be almost blind to be fooled by. Fortunately, the scribe who has a book with the information you need on bloodlines \"is\" almost blind. You don the disguise, travel to the scribe's hut, and buy a copy of the book from him.\nTo make Terokk's return possible, you have to have an offering to draw him to you. The offering Hazzik makes for you will require a token from each of four of the descendants of Terokk's adversaries.\nMuch easier said than done. The talonpriests have them captive. But to summon them, you need to capture scrolls from the time-lost Arakkoa. ... for which you need the &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Elixir of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;. And your only way of getting the elixir is by having &lt;a href=\"Severin\"&gt;Severin&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tari%20Skyguard\"&gt;Skyguard&lt;/a&gt; medic, make it for you from the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Dust%20%28Outland%29\"&gt;Shadow Dust (Outland)&lt;/a&gt; held by the various Arakkoa in Skettis.\nSo, after a great deal of work, you gather the scrolls, and summon and defeat each of the descendants in turn. On returning to him, Hazzik gives you a bundle of items that symbolize each descenant you defeated, all ready to go for you to summon Terokk.\nFrom the tokens that are taken from each dead descendant, Hazzik also offers to use these items to make another bundle for you, should you need it.\nWeak as he is, Adaris gives his blessing to your venture. Bundle in hand, you return once again to the center of Skettis, with the great bone pile upon it. &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt; answers your summons, and with the help of the Skyguard, you manage to defeat him.\nAdaris assures you of the lasting gratitude of the Skyguard, and even provides some tangible expression of that gratitude. \nRewards.\nJust from the quest rewards:\nIn the process of completing these quests you will have gained a great deal more reputation from killing the Arakkoa, turning in shadow dust for more &lt;a href=\"Elixir%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Elixir of Shadows&lt;/a&gt;, and collected drops from the various mini-bosses."}

He now waits in a world of shadows to be called back into the physical world and face the enemies of &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;his people&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerokk built many &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Wayshrine\"&gt;wayshrines&lt;/a&gt; across the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nSix hundred years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, Talon King Terokk was an ancient king of the arakkoa of the &lt;a href=\"spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt;. He was beloved by the people and would often wear a mask to walk among them in hiding. The closest individual to Terokk was his daughter &lt;a href=\"Lithic\"&gt;Lithic&lt;/a&gt;, who crafted a golden bangle for him that he always wore. He shared power with an order of priests called the Anhar.\nTerokk had many enemies, among them &lt;a href=\"Warp%20Stalker\"&gt;stalkers&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wind%20Serpent\"&gt;wind serpents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Colossus\"&gt;colossi&lt;/a&gt;, and even fellow arakkoa. One enemy in particular was &lt;a href=\"Pridelord%20Karash\"&gt;Pridelord Karash&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodmane%20tribe\"&gt;Bloodmane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"saberon\"&gt;saberon&lt;/a&gt;, who once declared war against the arakkoa. His torment of the arakkoa caused them to wonder why their sun goddess &lt;a href=\"Rukhmar\"&gt;Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly withdrawn her favor. Rather than send his troops, Terokk arrived to the battlefield in person and slaughtered most of the saberon. Terokk's victory over &lt;a href=\"Pridelord%20Karash\"&gt;Pridelord Karash&lt;/a&gt; caused the arakkoa to celebrate Terokk as a living legend. Indeed, they even claimed him to be Rukhmar's reincarnation. The Anhari priesthood began to grow nervous, for up until this point they alone had been allowed to speak in the sun goddess's name. Terokk used his widespread support to build a new city, &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt;, that called back to the accomplishments of the ancient &lt;a href=\"Apexis\"&gt;Apexis&lt;/a&gt;. He created new laws restricting the authority of the Anhar order, declaring that high arakkoan society must be guided by a thirst for knowledge and wisdom, not by fear and superstition.\nBut however much his people loved and respected Terokk, the Anhari at Skyreach were jealous of him. Hungry for control, they conspired against Terokk and tossed both him and his daughter Lithic into the pools at &lt;a href=\"Sethekk%20Hollow\"&gt;Sethekk Hollow&lt;/a&gt;, which were formed eons ago in the death of the primal god . While Terokk survived the fall, Lithic did not; in his despair, Terokk surrendered to the darkness as his body withered and contorted, transforming Terokk into a flightless shadow of his former self. From that day forward Skyreach would be ruled not by a king but by the Anhari, now calling themselves the &lt;a href=\"Adherents%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Adherents of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt;. \nA presence called Terokk from the brink of despair, however. &lt;a href=\"Anzu\"&gt;Anzu&lt;/a&gt;, the great &lt;a href=\"dread%20raven\"&gt;dread raven&lt;/a&gt; god, urged Terokk forward. Now mutated and flightless but with powers of darkness, Terokk moved forward and rallied his fellow broken arakkoa who the Adherents had also tossed into the pools. They moved through the Sethekk Hollow until they came across &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Anzu\"&gt;The Eye of Anzu&lt;/a&gt; and met Anzu for the first time.\nAnzu gifted Terokk and his followers &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; powers and &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; sorcery. In time, they would come to be known as &lt;a href=\"Talonpriest\"&gt;Talonpriest&lt;/a&gt;s. Together, Terokk, Anzu, and the Talonpriests would build the refuge city of &lt;a href=\"Skettis\"&gt;Skettis&lt;/a&gt; among Apexis ruins and protect the unwanted children of Rukhmar: the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt;. The regions of &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt; near to the Spires of Arak came under their control and became known as &lt;a href=\"Terokkar%20Forest\"&gt;Terokkar Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Terokk returned from exile he was broken and flightless. Rumors of his cursed state swept like wildfire through the arakkoa, giving rise to superstitious charms and cures.\nHowever, as the years went on Terokk's health declined, grief tore at his heart, and Sethe's curse chewed at his mind. He began to hate the world, abandoning Skettis and even sacrificing the lower castes of his own people to dark powers in search of a cure. The arakkoa did not seem to know the reason for this abandonment and attributed it to them turning away from the worship of Rukhmar. Hoping to rejuvenate their king, the Talonpriests sealed Terokk away in the shadows. All that was left of Terokk were several artifacts he left behind. But Terokk was foretold to return some day.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the Talonpriests work to return Terokk to the physical world by gathering his scattered artifacts across the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; and save them from both the Adherents of Rukhmar and the of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s. After gathering the relics, Reshad tells an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; the story of Terokk. As the adventurer receives visions of Terokk's life, Terokk witnessed the adventurer's past as well.\nAlthough &lt;a href=\"Shadow-Sage%20Iskar\"&gt;Shadow-Sage Iskar&lt;/a&gt; wants to bring Terokk back physically, &lt;a href=\"Reshad\"&gt;Reshad&lt;/a&gt; is concerned that Terokk will lead the arakkoa further into darkness and does not want to repeat the mistakes of the past. Instead, Terokk imbues the adventurer with his power after a battle in order to face off against . Unfortunately, it is not enough and Kargath survives. Following his defeat at Kargath's hands, Terokk's spirit tells the arakkoa to strike their own path, lay the past to rest, and raise new champions."}

This forest was most likely named after &lt;a href=\"Terokk\"&gt;Terokk&lt;/a&gt;, the greatest king in &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; history. Formerly it was known as &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;.\nTerokkar was seen as the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt; in previous maps and lore sources, but the Bone Wastes themselves are now a sub-region within the Terokkar Forest zone.\nHistory.\nOnce known as &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, the region was a forest of red and orange leaved trees that bathed the entire area in a perpetual autumn hue. These beautiful &lt;a href=\"olemba%20tree\"&gt;olemba tree&lt;/a&gt;s, and the draenei's equally impressive gardens surrounded the draenei's greatest city on Draenor; Shattrath. A splendorous monument to the skills of the draenei artificers, even in exile, the city's greatness was matched by that of the holy mausoleum Auchindoun; the place where all draenei souls prepared for their journey into the afterlife and where many of their bodies were laid to rest. The smaller city, Tuurem, was just as noteworthy as its more magnificent neighbors as it sat at a crossroads in the area and one seeking to travel from Shattrath to Karabor would likely pass through the city. At this time, only the region closest to the &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Spires of Arak&lt;/a&gt; was known as Terokkar Forest by the &lt;a href=\"Arakkoa%20Outcasts\"&gt;Arakkoa Outcasts&lt;/a&gt; and it was under their control.\nWhen the Orcish Horde rampaged across Draenor, Talador was rendered the draenei's final stronghold. The Orcish Horde were repelled from Talador for a time, but when they imbibed the Blood of Mannoroth the demonic fury they were granted gave them the power they needed to cut through to the city of Shattrath itself. Their fel magic corrupted the region, turning the red and orange trees a pale, dusky green that transformed the forest into a dark, eerie woodland. The siege of Shattrath ultimately left the city in ruins and the draenei scattered and presumed extinct by the orcs and their Burning Legion masters.\nOnce the majority of the Orcish Horde departed for Azeroth, all of Talador came under the dominion of the Arakkoa Outcasts and it was all renamed Terokkar in honor of their lost king. At a later point, the orcs who had conquered Auchindoun performed a ritual that destroyed the building and much of the surrounding area, creating the Bone Wastes.\nGeography.\nThe flora consists of mostly dark green forest vegetation of crystal pines known as &lt;a href=\"olemba%20tree\"&gt;olemba tree&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; lies in the northwestern portion of zone. Alliance and Horde each have a town.\nThe multi-winged instance &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; can be found in this zone, containing four separate 5-man dungeons. There are no raid dungeons, micro dungeons, battlegrounds, or arenas in this zone. The spirit towers of the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;Bone Wastes&lt;/a&gt; provide a world PvP opportunity.\nEvery so often you can hear a roar while near Auchindoun - this is &lt;a href=\"Teribus%20the%20Cursed\"&gt;Teribus the Cursed&lt;/a&gt;, flying in circles around Auchindoun.\nNotable characters.\nArchmage &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt; resides in &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt; and can be found in its center."}

The mastermind behind the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion's&lt;/a&gt; invasion in &lt;a href=\"Talador\"&gt;Talador&lt;/a&gt;, Teron'gor seeks to use the powerful spirits of the Draenei to empower both himself and his forthcoming demon masters. \nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"Working alongside the &lt;a href=\"Sargerei\"&gt;Sargerei&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan%20%28alternate%20universe%29\"&gt;Gul'dan's&lt;/a&gt; agent Teron'gor plots to feast upon the bounty of souls contained within the barriers of the holy mausoleum of Auchindoun.\"\nOverview.\nTeron'gor is a powerful warlock. At 75% health, he will drain and corrupt the power of the soul of one of the ancient spirits of Auchindoun, healing to full and gaining powers of either a Demonology, Destruction, or Affliction warlock depending on which spirit he drains.\nAbilities.\nStage Two: Devoured Souls.\nAt 75% health, Teron'gor twists and devours one of the ancient souls of Auchindoun, gaining malevolent powers directly opposed to the good deeds the Draenei heroes stood for in life.\nIn Challenge Mode, Teron'gor will siphon all three spirits and gain a combination of their powers.\nMender Elum.\nTeron'gor corrupts the healing powers of Mender Elum, gaining powers of Affliction.\nArcanist Joraa.\nTeron'gor corrupts Arcanist Joraa's passion for order and creation, gaining powers of Destruction.\nVindicator Iruun.\nTeron'gor corrupts Vindicator Iruun's burning hatred of demons, gaining powers of Demonology.\nStrategy.\nTeron'gor is a challenging battle with an element of unpredictability due to which spirit he decides to absorb. Depending on which one, Teron'gor will gain additional powers corresponding to one of the three &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;Warlock&lt;/a&gt; specs. Absorbing Mender Elum will give him Affliction powers, Arcanist Joraa empowers him with Destruction, and Vindicator Iruun gives him power of Demonology. Aside from the soul powers, the boss will cast a combination of interruptable &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Bolt\"&gt;Shadow Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drain%20Life\"&gt;Drain Life&lt;/a&gt;, and a dispellable &lt;a href=\"Corruption\"&gt;Corruption&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn Heroic Mode, he will also cast an easily dodged &lt;a href=\"Rain%20of%20Fire\"&gt;Rain of Fire&lt;/a&gt;, and will summon an &lt;a href=\"Abyssal\"&gt;Abyssal&lt;/a&gt; to attack one of the DPS. Depending on how bulky said player is, she may choose to either run from it or simply take it as the healer heals off the extra damage. \nAffliction: This phase will deal large amounts of magic damage through &lt;a href=\"DoT\"&gt;DoT's&lt;/a&gt;. Both &lt;a href=\"Seed%20of%20Corruption\"&gt;Seed of Corruption&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Unstable%20Affliction\"&gt;Unstable Affliction&lt;/a&gt; will cause damage to the player hit with it and those around him, so staying spread out during this phase is important. The &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Exhaustion\"&gt;Curse of Exhaustion&lt;/a&gt; debuff should be dispelled to help those moving away from either the Rain of Fire or those with Seed of Corruption. Players should also stay away from Bloom of Malevolence, a patch of dark energy on the ground which does more damage over time and applies another Seed of Malevolence, further spreading the dark patches around the field. \nDestruction: This phase is the most affected by how well the players can interrupt Teron'gor's spells. If most of his spells are interrupted, the fight is much easier. If not, this is the most high-damage of the three possible phases. The boss hits the tank with interruptible &lt;a href=\"Incinerate\"&gt;Incinerates&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Bolt\"&gt;Chaos Bolt&lt;/a&gt; deals high single-target damage to a random target. Dispel &lt;a href=\"Immolate\"&gt;Immolate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Conflagrate\"&gt;Conflagrate&lt;/a&gt; when possible. Rain of Fire also becomes uninterruptible, so all players should be ready to move. \nDemonology: Teron'gor uses &lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Metamorphosis (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt; and melees the tank at high speed. Several of his abilities use knockback in this phase to try to send non-careful players off the cliff. In place of Rain of Fire, he casts Chaos Wave, a large, damaging knockback wave that moves similar to &lt;a href=\"Carrion%20Swarm\"&gt;Carrion Swarm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Typhoon\"&gt;Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;. Ranged should stay spread out so he only targets one with Chaos wave. Lastly, he uses a powerful &lt;a href=\"Demonic%20Leap\"&gt;Demonic Leap&lt;/a&gt; which also has a knockback."}

In death, he became the first of the necromantic terrors that became known as &lt;a href=\"Death%20knight%20%28Old%20Horde%29\"&gt;death knights&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 the warriors promised by Gul'dan to appease &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; and combat the human mages' powerful magic. Gorefiend convinced &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; to unite the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; and invade other worlds but was slain by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; as the planet tore itself apart. Years later he was resurrected once more and returned to the Black Temple where he allied with &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nDraenor.\nTeron'gor was a young but highly respected &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt;. Seven years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; met him and won him to his side by showing Teron'gor the powers of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic. Teron'gor had spent too long trying and failing to call on the elements for aid (unaware that the orcs' recent troubles with the elements was due to Gul'dan), and upon seeing fel knew he'd found the means to make a difference in the world and help his troubled race. Teron'gor was the first Shadowmoon shaman to become a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;, but he was not the last. Gul'dan slowly won others to his side, and whatever noble intentions they had were twisted by fel energy. The corruptive magic twisted their thoughts and darkened their hearts, making them loyal to Gul'dan alone. When Gul'dan formed the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; to lead the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; in secret, its initial members were the Shadowmoon warlocks, including Teron'gor.\nWhen the Horde assaulted the Temple of Karabor, many draenei clerics were taken prisoner and were told that they were being marched to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; far to the north. Outside the walls of the temple, Teron'gor took the lives of every last one of them. The spirits of the clerics of Karabor remain outside the walls to this day.\nAfter the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath%20City\"&gt;Shattrath City&lt;/a&gt;, many &lt;a href=\"Vindicator\"&gt;Vindicator&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"Rangari\"&gt;Rangari&lt;/a&gt; fled to &lt;a href=\"Auchindoun\"&gt;Auchindoun&lt;/a&gt; in hopes of defending it from the Horde. &lt;a href=\"Exarch%20Maladaar\"&gt;Exarch Maladaar&lt;/a&gt; organized the military defenses, and they fiercely defended Auchindoun from Teron'gor and the Shadow Council. They also received aid from Auchindoun's departed spirits, and slaughtered many of the Shadow Council's agents. As Maladaar and his forces closed in, Teron'gor sought out the warlocks who pooled their powers together and reached beyond the veil of reality. They sought to bring a powerful demon into the world, but in their wild desperation found something else instead: &lt;a href=\"Murmur\"&gt;Murmur&lt;/a&gt;. This otherworldly elemental creature was pulled to Draenor from a distant corner of the universe, and the shockwave on its arrival ripped the earth asunder. Many draenei were killed and Auchindoun was blasted apart. Waves of destructive energy rolled out and leveled the &lt;a href=\"Bone%20Wastes\"&gt;surrounding forest&lt;/a&gt;. Maladaar and a handful of his draenei used their magics to shield themselves from the blast. But though they survived, they no longer had the numbers to resist the Shadow Council. Teron'gor and his warlocks overwhelmed the draenei and bound them in chains, and contained Murmur deep within Auchindoun as well.\nBefore the Horde could launch its &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Teron'gor was one of the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s who helped with the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst and Second Wars.\nWhen Gul'dan was incapacitated as the result of being in &lt;a href=\"Medivh\"&gt;Medivh&lt;/a&gt;'s mind when he was killed, the Shadow Council was discovered by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Doomhammer had recently come to power through the assassination of &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, and tortured &lt;a href=\"Garona%20Halforcen\"&gt;Garona Halforcen&lt;/a&gt; to discover the Council's location. The majority of its members were killed by Doomhammer's furious surprise attack, including Teron'gor by Doomhammer himself.\nWhen Gul'dan recovered from his catatonic state and was on the verge of joining the Shadow Council in death, he \"submitted\" to Doomhammer's authority and promised to create warriors to fight for the Horde and counter the powerful magic of the humans. Doomhammer allowed him to live, to carry out this promise. Gul'dan took the corpses of the fallen &lt;a href=\"Brotherhood%20of%20the%20Horse\"&gt;Knights of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, and intended to imbue the rotting corpses with the souls of the Shadow Council. Nothing worked until he decided to sacrifice the necrolytes and cut out their hearts. He transmuted these hearts into powerful jewels, which were then affixed into truncheons. Upon making this stride, Gul'dan informed Doomhammer of his success. Placing the &lt;a href=\"Gorefiend%27s%20Truncheon\"&gt;first truncheon&lt;/a&gt; into the hand of one of the corpses, the warlock and the Warchief watched as the energies of the necrolyte's heart that powered the weapon coursed through the corpse, until its eyes finally opened. Teron'gor had returned, now known as Teron Gorefiend.\nGorefiend, &lt;a href=\"Gaz%20Soulripper\"&gt;Gaz Soulripper&lt;/a&gt;, and the other death knights swore allegiance to Doomhammer and fought for the Horde where their powerful energies aided in many battles. When Gul'dan abandoned the orcish Horde for the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, Gorefiend remained in the service of the Warchief until he was defeated. Following Doomhammer's defeat Gorefiend and his death knights led the Horde to the Dark Portal, convinced that reaching the safety of their home world was their only hope of survival. However the Alliance forces hounded their every step. \nAs the Alliance overtook the Horde before the Dark Portal, Gorefiend and his death knights called upon the fury and terror of their necromantic arts. While this did not defeat the Alliance, it did enough damage that the Horde was able to slip through the portal and return to Draenor.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nLeading the death knights beyond the Dark Portal before its destruction, Gorefiend remained on Draenor until he convinced &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan's former master, to come to the forefront and unite the remaining clans into the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. Teron already had the experience of opening the Dark Portal once, and he believed he could do it again. Ner'zhul intended to open new &lt;a href=\"dimensional%20gateway\"&gt;dimensional gateway&lt;/a&gt;s to other worlds, and Gorefiend desired to claim a world for his own, but both needed powerful items to stabilize their portals. To that end, Ner'zhul sent Gorefiend through a reconstructed Dark Portal to claim two powerful artifacts required for his spell: The &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20Medivh\"&gt;Book of Medivh&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nAt first, Gorefiend entered the &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Library\"&gt;Royal Library&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; only to find the Book gone and the guard slain with an &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alteraci&lt;/a&gt; blade. After failing to gain the support of &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, Gorefiend encountered &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, the insane and scheming &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Aspect&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, who offered aid in exchange for being allowed to travel to &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, where he could safely hide the prized eggs of his brood. Gorefiend rode on Deathwing's back as they traveled to Alterac, where Gorefiend demanded the book from its imprisoned king, &lt;a href=\"Aiden%20Perenolde\"&gt;Aiden Perenolde&lt;/a&gt;. Perenolde agreed to turn over the book in exchange for the Horde slaying their Alliance wardens. Upon securing the Book of Medivh, Gorefiend \u2014 again, with Deathwing providing transport, his dragons carrying the warriors \u2014 flew to &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; where he was able to take the Eye from its secure vault. He tossed &lt;a href=\"Teron%27s%20Gold%20Coin\"&gt;a gold coin&lt;/a&gt; into the Eventide's fountain, which he claims was not for a wish, but as 'payment' for what he took up and fled away. Gorefiend rejoined the Horde in Draenor and made the march with Ner'zhul to the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; to perform the ritual. In the end, it was all for naught; Ner'zhul escaped to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt; with his chosen followers, leaving the Horde leaderless and stranded on Draenor as it tore itself apart from the unstable rifts he had created. Gorefiend himself fell in battle against &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; on that fateful day, but his spirit rose from his broken death knight corpse and escaped into the skies.\nAfter this defeat, the remaining death knights traveled to Shadowmoon Valley. The death knights, showing their allegiance, knelt before Gorefiend or whatever was left of him after his physical demise; in response, Gorefiend beheaded them (they rose once more, as the &lt;a href=\"Ghostriders%20of%20Karabor\"&gt;Ghostriders of Karabor&lt;/a&gt;). His spirit, however, became trapped and eagerly seeks a willing host to free him...\nThe Burning Crusade.\nAt the &lt;a href=\"Altar%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Altar of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, there resides an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Shadowmoon%20Spirit\"&gt;Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit&lt;/a&gt;, a ghostly orc who appears to be an expert on the history of Teron Gorefiend. After completing the early quests with the &lt;a href=\"Spectrecles\"&gt;Spectrecles&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; (Alliance) or &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Village\"&gt;Shadowmoon Village&lt;/a&gt; (Horde), you are sent to the Altar of Shadows to speak to this orc ghost who does indeed know of Gorefiend.\nThe Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit sends you on a set of three quests to locate Gorefiend's regalia, items that he used in his \"life\", that may aid in locating him.\nThe locations of Gorefiend's Regalia.\nTwo of the three items can be found at or near the walls of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;.\nA dark secret revealed.\nThe Ancient Shadowmoon Spirit claims to be using the items to divine Gorefiend's location. Upon returning the items to the spirit, you find out the truth: the spirit IS Gorefiend, and he managed to convince you to return his gear to him.\nAfter taking back his regalia, Gorefiend possesses your body, trapping your spirit in the Altar of Shadows. Upon being possessed, &lt;a href=\"Karsius%20the%20Ancient%20Watcher\"&gt;Karsius the Ancient Watcher&lt;/a&gt;, Gorefiend's ethereal &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; jailor, spawns, and the battle begins once you attack him. While you are possessed by Gorefiend, a small bar appears with Gorefiend's spells - Unholy Armor, Death Coil, Death and Decay, and Haste, powers he is seen to wield in Warcraft II. It is recommended that in the battle with Karsius, you use Unholy Armor and Death Coil as often as you are able, and Death and Decay periodically as well; Death Coil will heal you significantly and drain Karsius' HP.\nAfter you defeat Karsius, you are freed, and Gorefiend mounts his undead steed and rides off towards the Black Temple, shouting that he has returned. With a heavy heart, you return to the quest giver in &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20Stronghold\"&gt;Wildhammer Stronghold&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Village\"&gt;Shadowmoon Village&lt;/a&gt;, and are tasked with destroying Gorefiend (seeing as it was your actions that unleashed him).\nThe Black Temple.\nSometime after his resurrection Gorefiend aligned with the &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; and served &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. From &lt;a href=\"Gorefiend%27s%20Vigil\"&gt;Gorefiend's Vigil&lt;/a&gt;, he seemed to command the &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20clan\"&gt;Shadowmoon clan&lt;/a&gt; within the citadel.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Nether%20Dragon\"&gt;Nether Dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Mordenaku\"&gt;Mordenaku&lt;/a&gt; took advantage of his allegiance to &lt;a href=\"Illidari%20Service%20Papers\"&gt;fake a letter&lt;/a&gt; from Gorefiend to &lt;a href=\"Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt; as a part of his gambit to liberate his people from the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nGorefiend was ultimately defeated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. He said the \"wheel of death\" had spun many times for him, and when struck down he remarked that the wheel was spinning again; it remains to be seen if he will return once more."}

Although the effects of this spell are abhorrent to the living, the Touch of Darkness is a but a lesser enchantment within the arsenal of these vile horsemen.\nDeath Coil is a particularly potent variation of the Touch of Darkness spell. By channeling the necromantic powers of the underworld through his ghoulish form, the Death Knight creates a field of dark energy that drains the life-force from any who come in contact with it. This life-force is then consumed - thereby replenishing the strength of one so enchanted, be he friend or foe. The icy embrace of death can be beneficial...for those who know how to control it.\nBy magically increasing the speed at which a body generates vital energy, the caster may bestow great speed to any being. All actions taken by one so enchanted are swifter than a common adversary - an advantage that is evident on the battlefield. The effects of Haste can persist for but a short time.\nThis ancient &lt;a href=\"Necromancy\"&gt;Necromantic&lt;/a&gt; spell transforms a portion of the recipient's life force into an unearthly, phantasmal suit of armor. This spectral armor then absorbs the damage from any attack directed at its wearer for a limited amount of time. As the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; that link this armor to its host cease, so will the invulnerability that it grants.\nThe aphotic, swirling clouds conjured by the Death Knights can cause anything within their path to rot and decompose. The vapor created by Decay can consume anything - flesh, bone, wood or even the strongest metal. Heavily laden with base substances, these clouds descend and quickly diffuse, leaving only suffering in their wake.\nThis focusing of the winds of the underworld causes any caught within to be cast about with great force and violence. Bones are easily shattered and mainsails are quickly snapped within the torrents of these fierce winds. The howl of these winds allow no commands to be issued to those trapped within the Whirlwind, rendering those unfortunates helpless until the &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magiks&lt;/a&gt; fade.\nThis dark &lt;a href=\"Magic\"&gt;magik&lt;/a&gt; is the final legacy of the Orc &lt;a href=\"Necrolyte\"&gt;Necrolyte&lt;/a&gt;s who were destroyed shortly after the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;. The Death Knight can animate corpses of the newly dead and then command these monstrosities to attack their enemies. This terrifying spell is the paramount power of the Death Knight as it serves to augment the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; forces with vast armies of &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20%28Warcraft%20II%29\"&gt;the Undead&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "94928", "revid": "42014766", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=94928", "title": "Teron Gorefiend (tactics)", "text": "Teron Gorefiend is a &lt;a href=\"boss\"&gt;boss&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. The fight is basically a &lt;a href=\"DPS%20race\"&gt;DPS race&lt;/a&gt;, with a twist. Killing Gorefiend is a prerequisite for opening the door leading to &lt;a href=\"Mother%20Shahraz\"&gt;Mother Shahraz&lt;/a&gt;. He's usually killed fourth when clearing BT.\nOverview.\nTeron Gorefiend periodically marks a player with Shadow of Death, killing them instantly. The slain player then returns as a Vengeful Spirit, with the unique ability to hinder and destroy Shadowy Constructs that will otherwise decimate other players.\nPreparation.\nOnly one single tank is needed, all other tanks should switch to DPS or Healing gear. The Gorefiend tank has to deal with solid melee damage. The usual mix of damage dealers and healers (6-8) is reasonable for this fight.\nThe whole raid needs the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; buff. &lt;a href=\"Cauldron%20of%20Major%20Shadow%20Protection\"&gt;Cauldron of Major Shadow Protection&lt;/a&gt; is also really useful. It's possible to wear some extra &lt;a href=\"shadow%20resistance\"&gt;shadow resistance&lt;/a&gt;, but not much - it's a DPS race, not a battle for survival. &lt;a href=\"Soulstones\"&gt;Soulstones&lt;/a&gt; should be created pre-fight, but not pre-cast. They are needed for healers getting Shadow of Death.\nTeron can be tanked right where he stands, and ranged DPS should group behind the MT opposite to the entrance. This gives the whole length of the room for the Ghost form players to kill the Shadowy Constructs.\nTeron Gorefiend.\nTeron himself has a relatively low amount of health and must be killed as quickly as possible. It's fairly standard &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt;, he's not tauntable, but a good tank can control him rather easily. As usual, melee DPS must stand behind him to avoid increasing his attack speed by parries. 3-4 healers should be able to keep the tank up, the other healers should take care of the massive damage the raid takes (this is another fight where &lt;a href=\"Chain%20Heal\"&gt;Chain Heal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Circle%20of%20Healing\"&gt;Circle of Healing&lt;/a&gt; are very effective).\nIncinerate (the fire dot) must be dispelled as soon as possible, two Priests or Paladin dispellers should be predesignated.\nAll damage enhancing, long-cooldown abilities like &lt;a href=\"Bloodlust\"&gt;Bloodlust&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href=\"Heroism\"&gt;Heroism&lt;/a&gt;) should be used as early as possbile after the tank has settled into an initial threat lead.\nShadow of Death.\nEvery 30 seconds, a random raid member (not the person with aggro) receives this debuff. After 55 seconds, the debuff turns the player into a Ghost and spawns four Shadowy Constructs. The Constructs attack the raid, and usually cause a wipe if they succeed. Therefore, the Ghost player must kill them before they reach the raid, by kiting and nuking them with the Ghost abilities.\nAfter the 60 seconds ghost phase, the player simply dies. Healers (ex. Shamans with an available Ankh) should get a Soulstone when they receive the debuff, so that they can resurrect at this point.\nAbout 15\u201320 seconds before the debuff runs out, the affected raid member must move to the south end (as far away from the raid as possible). The first action after turning into a Ghost should be to AoE damage the Constructs with Spirit Volley (key '5'), move with the group and then AoE freeze them with Spirit Chains (key '4') as soon as the &lt;a href=\"GCD\"&gt;GCD&lt;/a&gt; allows. During the 15 sec cooldown, the Constructs must be nuked with Spirit Lance (key '3'), which damages and slows a single Construct.\nThis is the most difficult phase for the Ghost player - while slowly moving backwards towards the raid, all four constructs must be hit with Spirit Lance in turn to keep them all slowed and close together. Each Spirit Lance should hit a different target (either using the Tab key or mouse for targeting in a rotation). After 15 seconds, a second combination of Volley ('5') and Chains ('4') is available, after that the Constructs should have taken enough damage to die with 2-3 more Spirit Lances.\nAfter the four Constructs are dead, it is a good idea to look for Constructs from the next player, and help kill them. If no Constructs are up, it's possible to move to the raid and buff a healer with Spirit Shield ('7'), and then get within melee range of Teron and attack him with Spirit Strike ('1').\nSince learning the Kite'n'Nuke technique required for killing the Constructs may be difficult for classes which normally do not kite, and learning it under raid conditions is rather expensive (one wipe per try), it's a good idea if all raid members practice using the &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.variuse.de/feroxtgs2/\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend's Shadowy Construct simulator&lt;/a&gt; before attempting him. The simulator is not a replacement for the real thing, but it gives players the general idea what to expect.\nDo not try to exploit this encounter by disconnecting or hearthing out. Doing so immediately spawns the constructs with no friendly ghost to kill them. That is a wipe.\nGhost controls.\nSome UI mods can lead to the Ghost form ability controls to appear at an unexpected location (or even not at all). When preparing for this encounter and using an action bar mod, it's a good idea to test whether the ghost controls are visible. The cheapest method to test this is the &lt;a href=\"Battered%20Steam%20Tonk%20Controller\"&gt;Battered Steam Tonk Controller&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href=\"Steam%20Tonk%20Controller\"&gt;Steam Tonk Controller&lt;/a&gt; crafted by an engineer.\nBartender, Bongos3, Dominoes all have an extra action bar called 'posses' bar, which is used when the player takes direct control over another entity. Players should configure their mod so that this bar is visible.\nAvoiding Shadow of Death.\nClasses which can remove themselves from combat can completely avoid Shadow of Death. By using &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; during the cast time of Shadow of Death, players avoid getting the debuff, and Teron does not cast it again until 30 seconds later.\nThe ability must be used during the 1 second cast time. Teron regularly targets random players to use one of his abilities, but Shadow of Death is his only ability with a cast time. The targeted player needs to react very quickly. It may be useful to facilitate this with the following macro:\n /stopcasting\n /cast &lt;ability name&gt;\nIf players with these abilities do manage to avoid Shadow of Death, the raid effectively saves one entire Shadowy Construct cycle, which is a big boon.\nSoloing.\nAny players with pets should dismiss them before starting the fight, and those that can call temporary pets (such as mages' Mirror Image) should avoid doing so. This will prevent Gorefiend from casting Shadow of Death and turns the fight into an ordinary DPS race, one that most classes at level 90 should win with ease."}

The area sits in front of the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Sanctum of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; and connects the &lt;a href=\"Moonbeam%20Causeway\"&gt;Moonbeam Causeway&lt;/a&gt; in the east with the &lt;a href=\"Concourse%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Concourse of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Order\"&gt;Terrace of Order&lt;/a&gt; in the west. The terrace is heavily patrolled by &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; forces and, since the arrival of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. \nA large tower containing a magical elevator stands on the terrace, and grants instant access to the upper levels of the Sanctum of Enlightenment. The canalway running through most of the city also passes underneath the Terrace of Enlightenment, continuing on through the nearby Terrace of Order. Despite its relatively central location in the city, the terrace appears to be generally off limits to ordinary citizens. The plateau also serves as the base for the Duskwatch's secret scrying efforts at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nThe Terrace of Enlightenment, along with the nearby &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Sanctum of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt;, have served as a major base of operations for the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;'s main peacekeeping force. Specifically, these locations appear to be the focus of efforts for gathering information and conducting secret research, as indicated by both their names and many of the statues and inscriptions located there. \nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; was granted access to Suramar City during their &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; was begun by those who &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;opposed&lt;/a&gt; this decision. Duskwatch security throughout the city, and particularly in areas such as the Terrace of Enlightenment, increased heavily as rebel activity erupted among the populace. \nAt some point during the rebellion, a covert scrying operation was established on the terrace, where many skilled Duskwatch &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;s and scryers began to monitor messages being transmitted magically throughout Suramar. This venture proved successful, and the disloyalty of &lt;a href=\"Ly%27leth%20Lunastre\"&gt;Lady Ly'leth Lunastre&lt;/a&gt;, an important noblewoman and recently-elected advisor to &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt;, was subsequently uncovered. Ly'leth had acted as a double-agent for the resistance during her posting in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, sending information and magically-encrypted messages to the Nightfallen leaders, which were intercepted. This in turn led to Ly'leth's arrest and detainment. \nAs the final stages of the conflict began and the rebels launched a massive assault on the Nighthold itself, the Grand Magistrix succeeded in halting almost the entire insurgent army in a complex time lock. In the hope of gaining more information on how to counteract this, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt; tried to find a way to restore contact with Ly'leth. Suspicious of the location, she and her allies subsequently raided the Terrace of Enlightenment and in doing so discovered its scrying operations. They also recovered intercepted messages from Ly'leth in which she warned them of Elisande's plans, and informed them of &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20Depths\"&gt;a hidden route&lt;/a&gt; to gain entrance to the Nighthold."}

Located near the heart of the city, it is an important meeting spot for the citizenry and a central location when travelling around Suramar. The entire promenade hosts a large contingent of &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt; security forces, with the attached Sanctum of Order serving as the entity's headquarters. \nThe plateau is connected to the &lt;a href=\"Evermoon%20Commons\"&gt;Evermoon Commons&lt;/a&gt; district and &lt;a href=\"Shimmershade%20Garden\"&gt;Shimmershade Garden&lt;/a&gt; to the south, as well as the &lt;a href=\"Concourse%20of%20Destiny\"&gt;Concourse of Destiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Terrace%20of%20Enlightenment\"&gt;Terrace of Enlightenment&lt;/a&gt; to the east. The major canal running through most of the city flows underneath, making most of the terrace a bridge. A lower level under the main one follows the canal and hosts a number of alleyways and derelict storerooms. \nAmong the terrace's numerous functions, it has historically been used as a location to display prisoners and other enemies of the regime who an example is to be made of; as such, cages and magical prisons dot the area. This would eventually cause the Terrace of Order to become a battlefield in the eventual &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt; between insurgents and loyalists. \nHistory.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; were granted access to &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20City\"&gt;Suramar City&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Magistrix%20Elisande\"&gt;Grand Magistrix Elisande&lt;/a&gt; and her allies, major unrest over the decision lead to the formation of &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;the Nightfallen&lt;/a&gt; and the outbreak of the &lt;a href=\"Nightfallen%20rebellion\"&gt;Nightfallen rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. This, in turn, led Suramar's authorities to crack down harshly on any signs of dissent among the populace. &lt;a href=\"Arcwine\"&gt;Arcwine&lt;/a&gt;, vital to the survival of a &lt;a href=\"nightborne\"&gt;nightborne&lt;/a&gt;, was rationed within the city's poorer districts, while citizens suffered harsh and arbitrary punishments at the hands of the &lt;a href=\"Duskwatch\"&gt;Duskwatch&lt;/a&gt;, Elisande's private army. \nMany of those arrested or taken on suspicion of treason were put on display in magical cages on the Terrace of Order to send a message to their fellow nightborne. Within these prisons, many of the accused began to wither from lack of arcane energy, even if they had not already. The rebels frequently raided parts of the Terrace of Order to free as many of such prisoners as possible, though the area was patrolled heavily by Duskwatch and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic forces. At the time of the civil war, the terrace was also a popular relaxing and meeting location for many of those &lt;a href=\"Suramar%20Loyalist\"&gt;fervently loyal&lt;/a&gt; to Elisande's regime. \nThe nightborne &lt;a href=\"Arluelle\"&gt;Arluelle&lt;/a&gt; made her home in the abandoned storerooms of the terrace's lower level, along with many other &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;withering&lt;/a&gt; vagrants, before being recruited to the Nightfallen rebellion and becoming one of its most prominent members.\nAs the conflict progressed and the rebels managed to achieve more successes, Elisande chose to take drastic action. The Duskwatch, accompanied by demons, carried out a slaughter was carried out in the &lt;a href=\"Starcaller%20Retreat\"&gt;Starcaller Retreat&lt;/a&gt;, an area known for its Nightfallen sympathies. &lt;a href=\"Vanthir\"&gt;Vanthir&lt;/a&gt;, the owner of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Waning%20Crescent\"&gt;Waning Crescent&lt;/a&gt; tavern and a leader of the rebellion, was captured alive during the massacre and taken to the Terrace of Order to be made an example of. Slowly, he was allowed to &lt;a href=\"Withered\"&gt;wither&lt;/a&gt; in a large cage, guarded personally by &lt;a href=\"Thoramir\"&gt;Thoramir&lt;/a&gt;, the Second Blade of Elisande herself. \nWhen the leader of the Nightfallen, &lt;a href=\"First%20Arcanist%20Thalyssra\"&gt;First Arcanist Thalyssra&lt;/a&gt;, learned of the massacre at the Waning Crescent and Vanthir's subsequent capture, she and her allies immediately took action to locate and attempt to free their fellow insurgent. Before long, Thalyssra was able to triangulate Vanthir's essence and discover his location at the Terrace of Order. A force led by &lt;a href=\"Silgryn\"&gt;Silgryn&lt;/a&gt; hurried to the terrace and confronted Thoramir and his guards. After succeeding in slaying the Second Blade, the rebels released Vanthir from his prison and gave him a fruit from the &lt;a href=\"arcan%27dor\"&gt;arcan'dor&lt;/a&gt; tree to prevent him from succumbing to his withered state.\nBefore departing the scene, the Nightfallen agents left a sigil of a Dusk Lily (a notorious symbol of Thalyssra and her rebellion) over the now-empty cage to send a message to their enemies. When the events that transpired on the Terrace of Order\u2014and particularly the Dusk Lily\u2014were discovered by Elisande and those in the &lt;a href=\"Nighthold\"&gt;Nighthold&lt;/a&gt;, it led to widespread anger, panic, and fear."}

These woods serve as a sacred site for the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, and in particular the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt;, who practice many of their rituals here. The Runewood itself is located just outside the complex of &lt;a href=\"Haustvald\"&gt;Haustvald&lt;/a&gt;, and both the village of &lt;a href=\"Akstad\"&gt;Akstad&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Stonewarden%20Quarry\"&gt;Stonewarden Quarry&lt;/a&gt; can be found within the forest. At its heart is &lt;a href=\"Vydhar\"&gt;Vydhar&lt;/a&gt;, a fabled vrykul who became transformed into a tree so that his wisdom could be made eternal.\nHistory.\nThe Runewood's name comes from the ancient rituals performed there by the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt;, powerful mystics tasked with tending to the vrykul dead, inhabit the Runewood and nearby &lt;a href=\"Haustvald\"&gt;Haustvald&lt;/a&gt;, and are responsible for these magical practices. Many ages ago, a vrykul known as &lt;a href=\"Vydhar\"&gt;Vydhar&lt;/a&gt; underwent a ritual to become one with the Runewood, to preserve his wisdom forever. With the help of the &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt;, Vydhar was turned into one of the wood's trees, and occupied the center from that time onward.\nThe village of &lt;a href=\"Akstad\"&gt;Akstad&lt;/a&gt; has been a major settlement of the Bonespeakers located in the Runewood's north, while at the &lt;a href=\"Stonewarden%20Quarry\"&gt;Stonewarden Quarry&lt;/a&gt;, mystics fashion their runes and &lt;a href=\"Agitated%20Stonewarden\"&gt;minions of stone&lt;/a&gt; from the rock of the quarry. A group of ferocious Bonespeaker &lt;a href=\"berserk\"&gt;berserk&lt;/a&gt;s known as the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeaker%20Runeaxe\"&gt;Runeaxes&lt;/a&gt; also traditionally make their home in the Rundwood, at the &lt;a href=\"Runeaxe%20Training%20Grounds\"&gt;Runeaxe Training Grounds&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Fallen%20Kings\"&gt;Field of Fallen Kings&lt;/a&gt;, at the edge of the Runewood to the north, is an ancient burial ground for legendary vrykul rulers.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Bonespeakers had become corrupt and hungry for power. They began to forsake their ancient duties, instead trying to silence the Runewood and kill the heart of the forest using their runestones. It was only with the aid of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;outsiders&lt;/a&gt; that Vydhar eventually broke free from the Bonespeakers' magic. Together, they would go on to take revenge on the mystics in the name of the Runewood itself."}

{"id": "14578", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14578", "title": "Runner", "text": "Runner(s) usually refers to a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; or mobs that are escaping from a battle engagement (usually from you and/or from your teammates) because of being either low on health points or &lt;a href=\"Fear%20Effect\"&gt;feared&lt;/a&gt;. This is most common in Humanoids and is prompted by the emote \"&lt;mob&gt; attempts to run away in fear!\" \nThe main problem with runners (especially in instances) is that if they run close enough to other mobs, they will alert them, causing the additional mobs to attack your party. This can easily result in a wipe, especially if the party is already low on health/mana or were already facing sizeable opposition. \nTo prevent runners, players try to finish the mobs with low health points as quickly as possible or to &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt; them long enough to kill them before they can run for more help.\nHowever, while runners can and often will alert other nearby mobs, as the path of the runner is relatively randomly determined, it is quite possible, especially in empty areas (or areas that have already been cleared of mobs) for runners to fail to alert any additional mobs. In this case, they will run around for a period of time, and then walk back toward their previous target and resume attacking. This is rarely of concern, as the mob by this point is usually very low on health, and is easily killed. However, players will still be considered 'in combat' until the mob has been killed, or otherwise dis-engages from combat, meaning that certain abilities (such as &lt;a href=\"Resurrection\"&gt;Resurrection&lt;/a&gt;) will not be usable. In situations where runners are not problematic, especially in critical encounters when there are other targets to deal with, it may be preferable to let the target run, rather than waste time and resources killing it immediately. In this respect fleeing can be considered a free &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear effect&lt;/a&gt;."}

Although of human construction, its current inhabitants belong to a number of races from both the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Marcus%20Johnson\"&gt;Marcus Johnson&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Baradin%27s%20Wardens\"&gt;Baradin's Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Larmash\"&gt;Commander Larmash&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Hellscream%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Hellscream's Reach&lt;/a&gt; refer to the residents as '&lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s' and 'wackos', and report that they have been picking off Alliance and Horde forces that stray too close to the village. A number of &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s remain at their &lt;a href=\"stables\"&gt;stables&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"house%20cat\"&gt;house cat&lt;/a&gt;s roam the area. Additionally, a number of &lt;a href=\"Rustberg%20Bandit\"&gt;Rustberg Bandit&lt;/a&gt;s can be found in and around the village. Their actions are highly suspicious and they will attack anyone that dares enter the village walls.\nBackground.\nThe island of Tol Barad's location on sea lanes and lack of policing due to the collapse of many of the Alliance's states during the events of the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; made it a very attractive location for &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt;s. The town of Rustberg, originally housing many of the nearby prison's staff, was abandoned when they were recalled to &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; to deal with the catastrophes back home. The town was repurposed by a band of pirates into a base from which they would strike at the wealthy trade towns along the shores of the &lt;a href=\"Baradin%20Bay\"&gt;Baradin Bay&lt;/a&gt;. Over the years, some pirates had journeyed to Kalimdor and recruited or impressed various &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; into their crews, tauren who would later call Rustberg home just as their shipmates do.\nAs of the end of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the pirates of various races remain in the Rustberg. &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; described the village as a fine place to get the latest rumors, with &lt;a href=\"Jamison%20Gray\"&gt;Jamison Gray&lt;/a&gt; of the \"&lt;a href=\"Bloody%20Dawn\"&gt;Bloody Dawn&lt;/a&gt;\" serving as a contact until he was discovered and killed.

They were first built by the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, but the forces of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; later developed ballistae of their own design.\nBased on the same mechanical principles as the &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt; but on a larger scale, ballistae are siege weapons that hurl stones or metal projectiles toward their targets. After cranking back lever arms held tight in skeins of leather or sinew, the crew loads a projectile into the ballista's central track. When the trigger is released, the stored tension in the skeins of the ballista propels the projectile downrange at incredible speed.\nBallistae were also used during the fall of &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, the assault on &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt; and during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlliance ballista.\nBallistae launched steel-tipped bolts to impale all in their path. As they required an awesome amount of force to be placed upon their tremendous bowstrings, these machines of war were reinforced with &lt;a href=\"lumber\"&gt;lumber&lt;/a&gt; from the precious &lt;a href=\"Ironwood\"&gt;Ironwood&lt;/a&gt; trees. The ballista, a product of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; design and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;elven&lt;/a&gt; craftsmanship, was a symbol of the unity between all those who have allied themselves against the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; proved to be another valuable ally, in that they could be employed to design improved missiles which made the ballista the most devastating weapon of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; the Alliance favored the &lt;a href=\"steam%20tank\"&gt;steam tank&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"siege%20engine\"&gt;siege engine&lt;/a&gt;s instead, but nowadays modern ballistae similar to the original ones can be found nearly anywhere human military forces are. Destroyed ballistae are also common to find whether on old &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; battlefields or in any of the abandoned cities of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Others can be seen defending &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Onslaught\"&gt;Onslaught&lt;/a&gt; locations in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; again saw these weapons used to great effect by both sides. During their assault on the &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; deployed a line of siege weapons including ballistae to reinforce their infantry divisions as they marched on the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; capital.\nNight elven ballista.\nCrafted from the sturdy &lt;a href=\"Lumber%23Ashwood\"&gt;ashenwood&lt;/a&gt; trees, the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves'&lt;/a&gt; ballistae are deadly siege machines built to fling heavy bolts of &lt;a href=\"ironwood\"&gt;ironwood&lt;/a&gt; at both enemy forces and structures. Ballistae are considered an invaluable asset to the night elf &lt;a href=\"Sentinels\"&gt;Sentinels&lt;/a&gt; due to their mobility and accuracy in tense combat situations.\nNight elves largely replaced the weapons with &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nHigh elven and blood elven ballista.\nThe &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; used ballistae to fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to attack their capital of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; in '. It was a siege unit that had a long range, built from the &lt;a href=\"Barracks%23High%20elven%20and%20blood%20elven%20barracks\"&gt;high elven barracks&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; did not have ballistae in their own ' campaign, although they strangely did have &lt;a href=\"glaive%20thrower\"&gt;glaive thrower&lt;/a&gt;s in the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; campaign.\nSeveral blood elven ballistae can be seen in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\", such as outside &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt;.\nTroll ballista.\nThe &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt; tribes both made ballistae of their own. They were first during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; as well as on the &lt;a href=\"alternate%20Draenor\"&gt;alternate Draenor&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"war%20in%20Draenor\"&gt;war in Draenor&lt;/a&gt;.\nOrc ballista.\nThe &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of the are known to have used ballistae in &lt;a href=\"Frostfire%20Ridge\"&gt;Frostfire Ridge&lt;/a&gt;.\nYaungol ballista.\nThe &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; have created a form of ballista also known as treelauncher or ballista spearthrower.\nDraenei ballista.\nThe &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; of were known to use ballistae in their battle. The draenei of &lt;a href=\"Azuremyst%20Isle\"&gt;Azuremyst Isle&lt;/a&gt; were eventually able to build up their own ballistae in time for the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, being worked on by &lt;a href=\"Exodar%20Artificer\"&gt;Exodar Artificer&lt;/a&gt;s. They are also used at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;; specifically they are identified as being &lt;a href=\"Auchenai\"&gt;Auchenai&lt;/a&gt; ballistae.\nNaga ballista.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Sashj%27tar\"&gt;Sashj'tar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; brought ballistae (or &lt;a href=\"harpoon%20gun\"&gt;harpoon gun&lt;/a&gt;s) to &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. These were utilized to assault various locations within that region. Weapons of this type were also utilized by naga forces during repeated encroachments into &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, as well as to defend Azshara's bastion of &lt;a href=\"Nazjatar\"&gt;Nazjatar&lt;/a&gt;.\nForsaken ballista.\nThese ballistae are employed by Forsaken forces during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;. They are defensive emplacements intended to protect Horde encroachments into areas of &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, most notably the ruins of &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;.\nShadowlands ballista.\nMultiple types of ballista appear during the campaign against &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;. One variant is utilized in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;, besieging the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;. A second variant can be seen in &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, employed by the forces of &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt; to entrap and slay the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Harika%20the%20Horrid\"&gt;Harika the Horrid&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaruuk centaur ballista.\n&lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt; used dragon-killer ballistae against the &lt;a href=\"green%20dragonflight\"&gt;green dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn \"\", a ballista was seen protecting a &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20aviary\"&gt;gryphon aviary&lt;/a&gt; alongside some &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; dwarves.\nIn the RPG.\nField ballistae.\nA ballista type used by forces after the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. A field ballista can be used by small, two-man crew and is usually directed toward less-fortified secondary targets such as mid-field entrenchments. Typically, a field ballista crew travels on two mounts, one pulling the collapsed field ballista like a travois while the other carries a supply of projectiles.\nCrew ballistae.\nA ballista type used by forces after the Third War. Crew ballistae are larger, steel-framed versions of the field ballista. The steel frame is sturdier than wood, and metal housings surrounding the skeins protect them from being damaged by the environment or enemy fire. The four men who wield a crew ballista are divided into two \"brutes\" who crank the lever arms, the \"slot\" who loads the bolts into the track, and the \"sharp\" who aims and triggers the weapon.\nSiege ballistae.\nA ballista type used by forces after the Third War. A terror of the battlefield, the siege ballista can hurl enormous bolts over tremendous distances to penetrate all but the thickest armor. Each arm of a siege ballista is eight feet in length, and the entire weapon must be mounted on a wheeled cart to be portable - and then anchored into place on the battlefield so that it isn't thrown forward when it is fired.\nTypes.\nAs &lt;a href=\"siege%20weapon\"&gt;siege weapon&lt;/a&gt;s:\nAs &lt;a href=\"crossbow\"&gt;crossbow&lt;/a&gt;s:"}

He resents &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; for taking his place as one of &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;'s two barons and works with the &lt;a href=\"Necrolord%20Covenant\"&gt;Necrolords&lt;/a&gt; to bring him down. After this goal is achieved, he moves into the library of the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, now once again known as Baron Balmedar.\nBiography.\nBalmedar served as one of &lt;a href=\"Margrave%20Sin%27dane\"&gt;Margrave Sin'dane&lt;/a&gt;'s two barons (the other being &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Ninadar\"&gt;Baroness Ninadar&lt;/a&gt;) until &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; arrived at the House of Rituals, pilfered Balmedar's (in his own words) \"rightfully earned title\", and shut him out of the house's dealings. After being unable to find any evidence that would mar Sin'dane's adoration for Kel'Thuzad, Balmedar sought out &lt;a href=\"Baroness%20Draka\"&gt;Baroness Draka&lt;/a&gt;'s forces at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Seat of the Primus&lt;/a&gt; to offer an \"arrangement\": he would give them access to the House of Rituals in return for help in bringing down his replacement. Draka disapproved of the plan and told Necrolord &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Walker\"&gt;Maw Walker&lt;/a&gt;s not to trust the lich, but conceded that his offer might be the only way to uncover the Ritualists' schemes. Balmedar instructed the Maw Walkers to seek out a &lt;a href=\"Balmedar%27s%20Supplies\"&gt;supply package&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Scaplian%20Ridge\"&gt;Scaplian Ridge&lt;/a&gt; containing a &lt;a href=\"Balmedar%27s%20Oculus\"&gt;floating oculus&lt;/a&gt; he would use to communicate with them, since he did not want to risk meeting them outside the house in person. Through the oculus, he then instructed the heroes to kill one of Kel'Thuzad's favorite acolytes, &lt;a href=\"Acolyte%20Nelesis\"&gt;Nelesis&lt;/a&gt;, and perform a ritual on her corpse to take on her appearance, allowing them to infiltrate Kel'Thuzad's inner circle and uncover his intentions. Balmedar himself remained in the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Blades\"&gt;Hall of Blades&lt;/a&gt; while the now &lt;a href=\"Illusory%20Guise\"&gt;disguised&lt;/a&gt; Maw Walkers reported to Kel'Thuzad in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20Souls\"&gt;Vault of Souls&lt;/a&gt;, though Balmedar's invisible oculus continued to accompany them so he could provide further guidance.\nKel'Thuzad revealed to his \"acolyte\" that he was planning for a ritual that would \"open the way to victory\" and sent them to collect a set of tomes from Baroness Ninadar. Balmedar inspected the books' titles through the oculus but could not ascertain what Kel'Thuzad was planning with them. The baron then told his \"acolyte\" to help &lt;a href=\"Jor%27dan%20the%20Powerful\"&gt;Jor'dan the Powerful&lt;/a&gt; gather a set of ritual reagents. Balmedar had the Maw Walkers bring the ingredients to him in the Hall of Blades instead, but not before the heroes learned from Jor'dan that Kel'Thuzad was awaiting a &lt;a href=\"broker\"&gt;broker&lt;/a&gt; shipment from &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt;. Concluding that this shipment could contain the key to figuring out Kel'Thuzad's plan, Balmedar sent the Maw Walkers to ambush the broker caravan on the Scaplian Ridge using an alchemical bomb. When they searched through the exploded debris, the Maw Walkers discovered the mystery reagent\u2014&lt;a href=\"Domination%20Blade\"&gt;a dagger&lt;/a&gt; adorned with runes of &lt;a href=\"Domination\"&gt;Domination&lt;/a&gt;\u2014and brought it to Balmedar, who realized that Kel'Thuzad's plan was to open the way into the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; itself. Since the baron was too powerful to confront directly, Balmedar told the Maw Walkers to return to the Vault of Souls with the reagents, which he had now modified so that they would cause the ritual to fail. Unexpectedly, Kel'Thuzad asked his \"acolyte\" to assist him in the ritual, and although the sabotaged reagents did cause the spell to fail, they also caused a burst of feedback that shed the heroes' disguise as well as revealing and killing Balmedar's oculus. Realizing that he had been deceived, Kel'Thuzad had both Balmedar and the heroes captured and imprisoned in the Vault of Souls. The lich and the Maw Walkers managed to escape by opening the cell doors with an animated skeletal hand and hurried to the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Sorcery\"&gt;Hall of Sorcery&lt;/a&gt; to warn Margrave Sin'dane. They arrived just in time to see Kel'Thuzad overthrow the margrave with the aid of Baroness Ninadar. After gloating at Balmedar and the heroes, Kel'Thuzad summoned the &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sapphiron\"&gt;Sapphiron&lt;/a&gt; to fight them while he departed with the captive Sin'dane to the &lt;a href=\"necropolis\"&gt;necropolis&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Exoramas\"&gt;Exoramas&lt;/a&gt;. Though the heroes managed to defeat the dragon, Kel'Thuzad's fortified position in Exoramas meant they had no choice but to retreat to the Seat of the Primus &lt;a href=\"Balmedar%27s%20Portal\"&gt;via portal&lt;/a&gt; and regroup.\nAfter mustering their forces, the Necrolords launched an attack on the House of Rituals to remove Kel'Thuzad's influence. Balmedar accompanied the Necrolords in battle and warned that attacking through the house's main entrance would allow the liches to rain down sorcery on them. However, the Maw Walkers managed to push through the defenses with the help of &lt;a href=\"Emeni\"&gt;Emeni&lt;/a&gt;'s constructs, allowing the attackers to enter the &lt;a href=\"Grimoirium\"&gt;Grimoirium&lt;/a&gt;, where Ninadar was channeling an immense amount of &lt;a href=\"anima\"&gt;anima&lt;/a&gt;. Balmedar stated that they had to stop her before she destroyed them all. The attackers began fighting the baroness and nearly defeated her, prompting her to start draining even more anima despite Balmedar's protests that it was too much for her to control. The excessive power caused Ninadar to explode and leave behind the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20the%20Primus\"&gt;Staff of the Primus&lt;/a&gt;, which she had seized from Sin'dane during Kel'Thuzad's coup. Balmedar picked up the staff, stating that the attackers might still stand a chance against Kel'Thuzad if they returned the weapon to Sin'dane. The attackers continued to the &lt;a href=\"Prime%20Arcanum\"&gt;Prime Arcanum&lt;/a&gt;, where they were unable to stop Kel'Thuzad from summoning a &lt;a href=\"Maw%20Infernous\"&gt;Maw Infernous&lt;/a&gt; but received sudden reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Venthyr%20Covenant\"&gt;Venthyr Covenant&lt;/a&gt; that allowed the Maw Walkers to deal with the creature. The attackers pressed on to Exoramas, where Kel'Thuzad was waiting with Sin'dane trapped in an ice block. Most of the attackers spread out to hold off Kel'Thuzad's &lt;a href=\"Skeleton%20Bulwark\"&gt;skeletal minions&lt;/a&gt; while the Maw Walkers focused on weakening the traitorous baron himself so that Balmedar could free Sin'dane. When he placed the Staff of the Primus in the margrave's hand, it allowed her to shatter her icy prison. However, before the attackers could detain Kel'Thuzad, he escaped to his master\u2014&lt;a href=\"the%20Jailer\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;\u2014with the help of a group of &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn\"&gt;Mawsworn&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfterward, Sin'dane agreed to join the Necrolords' cause against the Jailer and gifted them the Staff of the Primus. The Necrolord and venthyr forces went their separate ways from Exoramas, but Balmedar remained by his margrave's side. She pointed out that he had colluded with outsiders to defy her, which he replied had only been to expose Kel'Thuzad and restore her rightful rule. Sin'dane declared that Balmedar would atone for his indiscretions by once again serving as her baron and her liaison to Baroness Draka, a mission that he accepted. With his title restored, Balmedar subsequently moved into the Seat of the Primus.\nQuests.\nIntroductory portion:\nEnding portion:"}

The return of Prince &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt;, following the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;, sent the three brothers packing, but they quickly regrouped and concocted a new plan to destroy Arthas once and for all. Though they (and &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;, who attacked Arthas on her own terms) didn't destroy Arthas, the undead prince left Lordaeron, leaving Balnazzar to rule the Plaguelands. Soon after, Sylvanas (who forcibly made &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; join her) laid siege to Balnazzar's forces and ultimately forced Varimathras to execute Balnazzar. However the execution was faked and Balnazzar later came to possess the body of Saidan Dathrohan, a founder of the Scarlet Crusade.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, Balnazzar and his undead &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt; were killed by adventurers. Forced back to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, he returned years later during &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. Deciding to dismantle the newly reformed &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt;, he serves as the main antagonist of the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"class%20order\"&gt;class order&lt;/a&gt; campaign. Balnazzar was finally killed in the &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt; located in the Twisting Nether, ending the dreadlord permanently.\nBiography.\nThe breaking of Ner'zhul.\nAt &lt;a href=\"Kil%27jaeden\"&gt;Kil'jaeden&lt;/a&gt;'s command a group of dreadlords consisting of Balnazzar, &lt;a href=\"Tichondrius\"&gt;Tichondrius&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mal%27Ganis\"&gt;Mal'Ganis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; tortured the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; after he had escaped from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, Ner'zhul, his sanity cracking, would agree to serve Kil'jaeden. Kil'jaeden passed the orc's spirit through death and revived as a &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;spectral entity&lt;/a&gt;. The dreadlords bound his disembodied spirit to a specifically crafted set of armor and a mighty &lt;a href=\"runeblade\"&gt;runeblade&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;. These items were locked in a diamond-hard block of ice to imprison Ner'zhul. The Lich King and the dreadlords who had tortured him were then sent to Azeroth in order to weaken any resistance that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; would face in during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. While the Lich King gathered his strength, Balnazzar and his fellow dreadlords would serve as jailors and executors meant to hasten the Lich King's task by any means necessary. To this end, they would construct the &lt;a href=\"Icecrown%20Citadel\"&gt;Icecrown Citadel&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. Though seemingly broken by the dreadlords, Ner'zhul sought vengeance and was able to play on the dreadlord's fears of Kil'jaeden in order trick them into allowing him to hurl Frostmourne out of the &lt;a href=\"Frozen%20Throne\"&gt;Frozen Throne&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Third War.\nBalnazzar and his brothers, Varimathras and Detheroc, were not aware that the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; had been defeated at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt; until months after the fact. It was only when Arthas returned from his sabbatical to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; that he announced Archimonde's destruction. Arthas stated that their deaths would complete their folly. Balnazzar and his brothers quickly teleported away before Arthas could strike.\nThe dreadlords plotted in the safety of the &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, and began to form a plan to ruin the undead king. Knowing that &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, and Arthas, were losing their powers, they called to &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;, who was no longer locked in loyalty to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, and asked for her assistance in the coup that was sure to entail. Sylvanas, hungry for vengeance for her current form and the slaughter of her people, agreed. Balnazzar and his brothers staged an ambush for Arthas within the Capital City ruins, separating &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; from him and attacking him with their minions. Balnazzar even loosed other dreadlords on him, but Arthas, rounding up the forces he could find still loyal to him, escaped, or so he thought.\nEscorted by a cadre of &lt;a href=\"banshee\"&gt;banshee&lt;/a&gt;s, Arthas was attacked by Sylvanas, who had prepared a long, grisly death for her murderer, and was about to begin her work when Kel'Thuzad interrupted and chased her off. Though he still lived, Arthas was gone from Lordaeron, or the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; as they were now called, and Balnazzar was free to reign over it as he liked. He sent &lt;a href=\"Varimathras\"&gt;Varimathras&lt;/a&gt; to bring Sylvanas to join their new order, but things went horribly awry.\nUnfortunately for Balnazzar, Sylvanas had plans of her own and laid siege to Lordaeron. She had defeated Balnazzar's brother Varimathras, who offered to serve her in exchange for his life. Sylvanas accepted and the dreadlord fought at her side in the attack on Lordaeron. Balnazzar received word from his scouts that Sylvanas had coerced Varimathras to her side, killed &lt;a href=\"Detheroc\"&gt;Detheroc&lt;/a&gt;, and allied with his human minion, &lt;a href=\"Garithos\"&gt;Garithos&lt;/a&gt;. The banshee and her forces laid siege to Balnazzar's base, which he had fortified within the city ruins. Even armed with demons as his minions, Balnazzar found himself attacked from both ends by Sylvanas and Garithos, and despite his many threats, Balnazzar's forces were defeated.\nFollowing their victory Sylvanas, Varimathras, and Garithos approached Balnazzar. Sylvanas ordered Varimathras to kill his brother as a testament to his loyalty to her. Varimathras was reluctant as killing another &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; was forbidden, but Sylvanas was adamant. Balnazzar was sure that Varimathras would never take that final step and was apparently destroyed.\nThe Ashbringer.\nUnknown to Sylvanas, Balnazzar lived, having staged his death with his brother, and went underground within the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt;. Not content to simply sit by while the undead legions overran &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, he formed a new plan to oppose them. He also sought to establish a means to protect himself by creating a new army. While he was stuck between worlds of the living and dead, he killed the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; and possessed his body. He then helped found the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;, an order of knights focused on the singular goal of defeating the Scourge in all its forms. Recognizing that he wouldn't be able to twist &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; into his service, Balnazzar manipulated Alexandros's son &lt;a href=\"Renault%20Mograine\"&gt;Renault Mograine&lt;/a&gt; into killing his father with the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt;. While Alexandros would be raised by &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; into service of the Scourge, a schism would cause a group of paladins to form a new order known as the &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawn\"&gt;Argent Dawn&lt;/a&gt;. Left unopposed, Balnazzar established control over the Scarlet Crusade, which soon became synonymous with corruption and extremism.\nLegends: A Cleansing Fire.\nWhen fanatic members of the Scarlet Crusade raided a village, the raid leader &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; mistakenly killed his own family. Becoming mad upon this revelation he attacked his fellow crusaders and was ultimately slain, after which he became completely mad. Soon after his death, Balnazzar transformed &lt;a href=\"Sir%20Thomas\"&gt;Sir Thomas&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"Headless%20Horseman\"&gt;Headless Horseman&lt;/a&gt;.\nLight's Wrath.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; set out to create a staff of unparalleled holy might, a weapon that would rival even the legendary &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in righteous fury. Ten of the Scarlet Crusade's learned priests gathered in Hearthglen to create &lt;a href=\"Light%27s%20Wrath\"&gt;Light's Wrath&lt;/a&gt;. For weeks, they practiced a ritual that would purify the dark jewel they found in the war-torn &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; and bind it to the staff. However, &lt;a href=\"Balnazzar\"&gt;Balnazzar&lt;/a&gt; learned of their plans and feared that such a weapon could unmask his deception and shatter his hold over the Crusade. The &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; disrupted the cleansing ritual, and the crusaders lost control of their delicate spellwork. A storm of holy energy ripped through the meeting place, instantly killing the ten priests. Yet Light's Wrath was left intact. The blast had purified the jewel and affixed it to the staff. Upon close inspection, Balnazzar found that the staff trembled with unstable energies. Wielding it with any reliability would be near impossible. Rather than destroy the weapon, the demon allowed the Scarlet Crusade to keep it. He looked forward to the mayhem it would cause in the years to come.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBalnazzar was the final boss of the live side of Stratholme. He used to begin the fight as &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Crusader%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt;, but eventually shed his human disguise for his true form. Once slain, his head was delivered to &lt;a href=\"Duke%20Nicholas%20Zverenhoff\"&gt;Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the Cataclysm rocked the world, Balnazzar slaughtered the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;rs in Stratholme and transformed them into the undead creatures they once hated, using his necromantic powers to resurrect them as the &lt;a href=\"Risen\"&gt;Risen&lt;/a&gt;. He also taught the &lt;a href=\"Risen%20Hammersmith\"&gt;Risen Hammersmith&lt;/a&gt; to make demonic weapons. &lt;a href=\"Eligor%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Eligor Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt; tasked adventurers to slay him. His weapons and armor - &lt;a href=\"Demonshear\"&gt;Demonshear&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20Grand%20Crusader\"&gt;Hammer of the Grand Crusader&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Crown%20of%20Tyranny\"&gt;Crown of Tyranny&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Shroud%20of%20the%20Nathrezim\"&gt;Shroud of the Nathrezim&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Book%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Book of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; - were recovered from his body and stored in the &lt;a href=\"Sanctum%20of%20Light\"&gt;Sanctum of Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nLegion.\nBalnazzar is one of the many demons that crossed the portal inside the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; to attack the forces of Azeroth in the climactic, disastrous battle at the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Tirion was captured, Balnazzar guarded &lt;a href=\"the%20Ashbringer\"&gt;the Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; in order to ambush and take the body of the one who claimed it. Though he failed, he swore to return in time, saying to the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;new wielder of the Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; that their \"journey together has only just begun.\"\nBalnazzar later led an attack against the &lt;a href=\"Conclave\"&gt;Conclave&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Netherlight%20Temple\"&gt;Netherlight Temple&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; arrived to aid the priests in its defense. As Balnazzar began to summon in more demons, a dreadlord infused with the Light named &lt;a href=\"Lothraxion\"&gt;Lothraxion&lt;/a&gt;, High Commander of the &lt;a href=\"Army%20of%20the%20Light\"&gt;Grand Army of the Light&lt;/a&gt;, arrived, sent by &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;High Exarch Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;. Lothraxion assisted the Highlord of the Silver Hand and the High Priest of Netherlight Temple in defeating Balnazzar.\nAs Netherlight Temple is located deep in the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s can truly be killed only in the Nether, Balnazzar (along with the reinforcements he summoned during the fight) is dead for good.\nIn the RPG.\n&lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; misspelled his name as Balzannar.\nBalnazzar also uses agents to do his jobs. One day a mysterious prophet emerged from caverns underneath the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. The prophet warned that the Burning Legion was coming soon and would be ushered in by the Forsaken and sent adventurers on anti-Forsaken missions. Upon further investigation, it was found that the \"prophet\" was really an agent of Balnazzar, who had survived his \"death\". Balnazzar had plotted his revenge against Sylvanas ever since that day \u2014 and the prophet was apparently just one small part of his plan.\nPossessed soul.\nNo one in the Crusade is aware that Dathrohan is a demon \u2014 they simply believe him to be a holy knight obsessed with the destruction of the undead. Balnazzar uses this fact to his advantage as much as possible, intending not only to defeat the undead but one day secure his hold on Lordaeron once again. To maintain his charade, Balnazzar kept (and still keeps) a low profile, letting others run the Scarlet Crusade. At present, Balnazzar dwells within the Scarlet Crusade stronghold in the besieged ruins of Stratholme, in the deepest reaches of the Eastern Plaguelands. The Scourge and the Crusade remain locked in battle, at a stalemate primarily because Balnazzar depends upon his masquerade for his long-term plans. His agents actively recruit new members for the crusade, and his ranks grow steadily. Should anyone find out his true nature, however, the Scarlet Crusade could potentially fall apart overnight, and the undead would become the only power in the Plaguelands.\nBalnazzar attempts to remain in his possessed form as long as possible, not revealing his true nature until absolutely forced to do so. He avoids using spells or spell-like abilities unless they could be paladin spells or he can do so in a way that makes them look like they came from a magic item. He avoids direct combat, preferring to let his minions do the fighting for him. If cornered and sorely pressed, he reveals his true nature, abandoning his possessed body and emerging in all his glory. The hulking demon's skin is a waxy purple, save the black bat-like wings. Its eyes glow crimson as it raises its massive greatsword. At this point, he lets loose with all the firepower at his command, subduing and then destroying his enemies with demonic fury. Any allies who remain by his side are then slain in turn, so that he may preserve his secret, and he returns to his former body to maintain the masquerade. If his secret is openly revealed, he retreats, seeking vengeance on those responsible at some future time. Balnazzar can possess the body of a creature he has slain through the use of his energy drain ability. In doing so, his form turns to a misty cloud that invades and takes over the corpse, while the soul of the slain creature moves on to its final reward (or punishment). The slain creature cannot be raised from the dead through any means other than a true resurrection for as long as Balnazzar possesses it (True resurrection ejects him from the body at once). His power sustains the body so it does not decompose; in fact, it appears in all respects as if alive. Balnazzar wears paladin gear (Scarlet Crusade armor and the like) in Saidan Dathrohan's guise. Otherwise, he carries a greatsword of wounding; this sword is tied to Balnazzar's life force, and anyone else touching it or trying to wield it is corrupted as long as he contacts the weapon. If Balnazzar possesses a creature, the sword vanishes with him, returning to his side when he emerges. Balnazzar also has a ring of protection and wears bracers of armor.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

The trick is to make sure that when any raid member is affected by the debuff, they move away from the rest of the battle so as to be at least 12 yards away from any other raid member. It is especially important to have all melee back 13 yards away from the Main Tank before cleansing the debuff so as to ensure that they are not affected either. At the very least, the Tanks CANNOT be debuffed when Baltharus initiates his whirlwind attack.\nAt 50% health in 10 player (67% and 33% in 25 player (needs confirmation)), Baltharus will clone himself. The offtank(s) has to taunt the clone and keep that with him. Now each tank has a copy of Baltharus. The DPS must attack only the original one.\nBe careful around his knockback. It is possible that he might knock you back into the group behind him containing a Charscale Commander. If the commander gets off Rallying Cry, it is likely that the raid will be quickly demolished.\nIf this seems to be a problem, pull him back some to the north, closer to the entrance portal.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

The dome was empowered by the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt; through the use of &lt;a href=\"runestone\"&gt;runestone&lt;/a&gt;s anchored to &lt;a href=\"Thas%27alah\"&gt;Thas'alah&lt;/a&gt; placed across the &lt;a href=\"Eversong%20Forest\"&gt;Eversong Forest&lt;/a&gt; border, and maintained passively via an intersection of &lt;a href=\"ley%20line\"&gt;ley line&lt;/a&gt;s stemming from &lt;a href=\"Key%20of%20the%20Three%20Moons\"&gt;three ancient mooncrystals&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"An%27owyn\"&gt;An'owyn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"An%27daroth\"&gt;An'daroth&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"An%27telas\"&gt;An'telas&lt;/a&gt;. The three locations were hidden in an invisibility stasis, to keep their locations a secret from invaders. While the dome could be maintained without the crystals, it would require the &lt;a href=\"Magisters\"&gt;Magisters&lt;/a&gt; to constantly empower it themselves.\nBan'dinoriel was erected around 6,800 years &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt; to prevent others from detecting the elves' usage of arcane magic as well as to frighten away the superstitious &lt;a href=\"Amani%20tribe\"&gt;Amani&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Forest%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt;. Through the runestones the barrier also dampened magic usage for invaders and non-elven spellcasters. It proved a constant thorn for the Amani trolls, whose campaigns had never managed to overcome it, nor find the source of its power. Likewise, the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; assault could not pierce the shield, and Silvermoon remained protected throughout the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; despite &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s' best efforts to subvert the shield. This changed during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, in which the treacherous magister &lt;a href=\"Dar%27Khan%20Drathir\"&gt;Dar'Khan Drathir&lt;/a&gt;, under the guise of wanting to ensure there were no weak spots in the land's defenses, used his friendship with the ranger lord &lt;a href=\"Lor%27themar%20Theron\"&gt;Lor'themar Theron&lt;/a&gt; to learn of the mooncrystals' locations. Drathir sold this information to &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt;, who acquired them during the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; invasion and killed their defenders. Dar'Khan, knowing the magi could maintain the shield in person, murdered as many as he could find in the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell%20Plateau\"&gt;Sunwell Plateau&lt;/a&gt;, and performed a binding ritual to lock the elves out of the Sunwell's power, dispelling Ban'dinoriel in the process."}

He plays a major role in the Shado-Pan quest chain in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt; and Townlong Steppes.\nHistory.\nShado-Pan Monastery.\nBan Bearheart was with &lt;a href=\"Lao-Chin%20the%20Iron%20Belly\"&gt;Lao-Chin the Iron Belly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Suna%20Silentstrike\"&gt;Suna Silentstrike&lt;/a&gt; in the Shado-Pan defense force of the &lt;a href=\"Ox%20Gate\"&gt;Ox Gate&lt;/a&gt; when the &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; invaded &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. With aid from adventurers, they fended off the invasion, but Suna's husband, &lt;a href=\"Lin%20Silentstrike\"&gt;Lin Silentstrike&lt;/a&gt;, was captured by the enemy. Suna insisted on rescuing her husband and left for Townlong Steppes alone while Ban decided to find out why the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Monastery&lt;/a&gt; didn't send reinforcements. When he arrived at the Monastery he realized that the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Sha of Hatred&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Violence\"&gt;Sha of Violence&lt;/a&gt; had already taken control, and &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of the Shado-Pan, had been possessed.\nBan infiltrated the Monastery and organized a group of the adventurers to cleanse it from the Sha's corruption. Finally, the Sha of Violence was defeated and the Sha of Hatred fled to Townlong, leaving Taran Zhu behind.\nSha Hunt.\nWith Monastery redeemed, Ban traveled with &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Taoshi\"&gt;Taoshi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Yalia%20Sagewhisper\"&gt;Yalia Sagewhisper&lt;/a&gt; to Townlong Steppes in their Sha Hunt quest. It was in &lt;a href=\"Longying%20Outpost\"&gt;Longying Outpost&lt;/a&gt; where they met Suna Silentstrike, who urged them to mount an attack on &lt;a href=\"Fire%20Camp%20Osul\"&gt;Fire Camp Osul&lt;/a&gt; in order to save her husband.\nBan was put in charge of the mission to vanquish the yaungol and save the prisoners by Taran when he departed. However, Suna disagreed Ban's decisions as she feared his conservative tactics would cost her husband's life. But Ban as a commander, though shared Suna's desire to stop the yaungol, would have to consider every soldier and aspect of the battle. In the end, the enemy was defeated and many prisoners were rescued, yet they could not save Lin's life. Suna blamed the faults to Ban and ran off on her own to track down the source of yaungol's aggression. In search of Suna, Ban and Yalia followed her tracked to &lt;a href=\"Hatred%27s%20Vice\"&gt;Hatred's Vice&lt;/a&gt;, only to discovered every yaungol there was dead, and the place was deeply corrupted by the Sha. What's more, Suna was possessed by the Sha of Hatred. With their best efforts, Suna was finally freed from the Sha's control. Yet her wound was too grievous and before she died, she forgave Ban for everything. Ban mourned for the loss of a great friend and swore he would not rest until the Sha of Hatred is defeated. \nLater, Ban met up with Taran and joined the hunting party. They cornered and located Sha of Hatred at &lt;a href=\"Sik%27vess%20Lair\"&gt;Sik'vess Lair&lt;/a&gt;, defeating it once and for all.\nShado-Pan Garrison.\nBan Bearheart continued as the commander of Shado-Pan force in &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Garrison\"&gt;Shado-Pan Garrison&lt;/a&gt;. There, he oversaw the operations against the &lt;a href=\"mogu\"&gt;mogu&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt;, and the yaungol on daily basis. When the mogu warlord, &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt;, launched a &lt;a href=\"Surprise%20Attack%21\"&gt;surprised attack&lt;/a&gt; and besieged the &lt;a href=\"Niuzao%20Temple\"&gt;Niuzao Temple&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to kill &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao the Black Ox&lt;/a&gt;, Ban quickly organized an elite group of Shado-Pan to rescue the Celestial. Together, they defeated &lt;a href=\"Hei%20Feng\"&gt;Hei Feng&lt;/a&gt;, an abomination created by Shan Bu, sending the mogu warlord to retreat as he saw his invasion had failed.\nTimeless Isle.\nBan can be found on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; overlooking the Celestial Court and apparently speaking with &lt;a href=\"Old%20Hillpaw\"&gt;Old Hillpaw&lt;/a&gt;.\nQuests.\nBan is involved in the following quests in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;:\n...in the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;:\n...in &lt;a href=\"Townlong%20Steppes\"&gt;Townlong Steppes&lt;/a&gt;:\nQuotes.\nGossip.\nWelcome, &lt;race&gt;.\nOutside the Shado-Pan Monastery.\nSomething feels... different up here.
