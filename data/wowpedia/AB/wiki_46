The first phase of his plan was an attack on &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at gaining access to metals and fuel that could be used for building a &lt;a href=\"fleet\"&gt;fleet&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s. In response the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; had demolition teams collapse mountain tunnels leading into the region and called upon their &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; allies for assistance. The two races pooled their resources to establish defensive positions across Khaz Modan. Despite this, the defenders of Khaz Modan couldn't stop the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish army. The orcs swept through Khaz Modan, crushing a number of dwarven and gnomish small settlements, outposts, and armories before the Horde's onslaught. He then constructed a fleet of &lt;a href=\"Transport%20ship%23Horde%20transports\"&gt;transports&lt;/a&gt;, using it to sail most of his warriors to the southern coast of Lordaeron and begin a campaign against the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; were left behind to complete the conquest of Khaz Modan and consolidate the orcs' control over the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge mountains&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile the dwarves were seen as a bigger threat, &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; itself would come under assault from the Horde.\nDefending Gnomeregan.\nIn order to defend Gnomeregan, the gnomes had rigged explosives throughout the forest and hills that surrounded their capital. As such when the Horde sought to destroy Gnomeregan, many of the orcs would fall into booby traps before they even reached the gnomish capital. To further defend their home the gnomes had created an impenetrable iron gate, which successfully survived weeks of bombardment from Horde siege engines. Faced with no success in cracking Gnomeregan open &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt; would call off and order the Bleeding Hollow to keep the gnomes confined within their city, as they were doing with the dwarves in nearby &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Bleeding Hollow continued to keep the gnomes confined, batter the &lt;a href=\"gates%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;gates of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; and the rocks around it for months, as the rest of the Horde fought against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; across continental Lordaeron. Doomhammer eventually withdrew from his own &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Capital%20City\"&gt;siege against Capital City&lt;/a&gt; and retreated to Khaz Modan, hoping to regroup with Kilrogg's forces before marching north again. The &lt;a href=\"warchief\"&gt;warchief&lt;/a&gt; assumed that Khaz Modan had long been conquered, and he was surprised to learn that this was not the case.\nKilrogg advised Doomhammer that it would be imprudent to abandon the siege now, as it was keeping the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; nation contained. If the dwarves were allowed to leave Ironforge, Kilrogg argued, they would fall upon the Horde and force it to fight two armies instead of just one. Doomhammer conceded, ordering Kilrogg to keep as many warriors as he needed to hold the dwarves in Ironforge and harry the approaching humans, while the rest joined the bulk of the Horde in their march to Blackrock Spire. He hoped that Kilrogg would later be able to complete the siege and attack the Alliance from behind as they pursued the Horde.\nThe Alliance did not pass Ironforge by, however. On the recommendation of &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt;, the Supreme Commander &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Lothar\"&gt;Anduin Lothar&lt;/a&gt; led an assault against the Bleeding Hollow orcs and caught them off guard, as they were still focused on attacking the city gates. An entire row of orcs was mowed down before they could turn to face the Alliance. As the Alliance pressed their attack, Ironforge's heavy doors opened with a supporting attack from the besieged dwarves. The two armies quickly cut down the orcs between them. Gnomeregan was liberated and both the dwarves and gnomes pledged their support to the Alliance.\nLegacy.\nThe role of the Alliance in liberating Gnomeregan and Khaz Modan during the Second War strengthened relations between gnomes and humans and thus when the Alliance began to &lt;a href=\"The%20Alliance%20Splinters\"&gt;splinter&lt;/a&gt; some years later, the gnomes of Gnomeregan led at that time by &lt;a href=\"Gelbin%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;Gelbin Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt; remained with the Alliance.\nThe Bleeding Hollow being forced to watch over both Ironforge and Gnomeregan essentially kept them away from most of the Second War's campaigns. This may have contributed to them remaining a viable fighting force during the &lt;a href=\"Invasion%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Invasion of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;."}

However, they were defeated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s sent by &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; before they could accomplish their goals.\nYears after Edwin's death, at the time of the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; succeeded him as the Kingpin of the Brotherhood and intend to continue her father's plan until her defeat by adventurers and the &lt;a href=\"Westfall%20Brigade\"&gt;Westfall Brigade&lt;/a&gt;. She faked her death and reappeared to join the &lt;a href=\"Uncrowned\"&gt;Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, pledging the allegiance of the Brotherhood to the rogue order.\nIn the wake of the Legion's defeat, Vanessa struggled to keep the organization focused on aiding the people of Westfall rather than simple thieving and banditry, especially of innocents. She eventually realized that all of the principled Defias had either died, or retired after receiving the royal pardon and reparations from &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;, leaving only the thugs and bullies. After they were manipulated into attacking &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt; by a disgraced noble, Vanessa helped &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; defeat her former compatriots before determining to find her own legacy. During the battle, the bandit &lt;a href=\"Duncon%20Ratsbon\"&gt;Duncon Ratsbon&lt;/a&gt; announced that the Defias were now answering to him, and fled before being defeated, stating that the organization could not lose its new leader.\nHistory.\nFormation.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Stonemasons%20Guild\"&gt;Stonemasons Guild&lt;/a&gt; was hired to rebuild &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; after the city was occupied and devastated by the orcs. They restored Stormwind to its former majesty, but when they asked for payment for their honest work, the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt; refused to pay due to an already-existing debt and the machinations of &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Lady Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, who played both sides. Her secret meddlings in the rebuilding of Stormwind City left the nobility unsatisfied with the craftsmanship of the Stonemason Guild; notes that the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;nobles of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; ran up a huge debt by expanding the kingdom's military presence through &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn&lt;/a&gt; and into &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn&lt;/a&gt;. The massive debt crippled the kingdom's economy and stripped VanCleef and his Stonemasons of their promised rewards.\nMeanwhile, the workers were enraged that the nobility were threatening to withhold payment for honest labor. Edwin spoke out, demanding restitution for their works, which outraged the nobles. In response, the Stormwind House of Nobles ordered the Stonemasons' Guild disbanded, which, understandably, infuriated VanCleef and the other workers.\nEdwin and the Stonemasons started a riot in the streets of the newly-rebuilt Stormwind. The riot was dangerous and chaotic, and resulted in the confusion by the accidental death of Queen &lt;a href=\"Tiffin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Tiffin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; when a thrown stone hit her in the head while she was attempting to calm the rioting stonemasons. This caused the enraged and grief-stricken &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt; to deal harder with the rioters, driving the Stonemasons from the city. Knowing Varian's anger would never fade, many were forced to remain in hiding. Edwin VanCleef fled Stormwind with the Stonemasons, and hid in rural areas like &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; until the situation settled down. There, the respected guildmaster, with secret support from Lady Katrana, united the angry stonemasons and formed the Defias Brotherhood, using his training in the arts of stealth and subterfuge. The Stonemasons subsequently became &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s, collecting their promised payment by robbing travelers. Banditry and thievery quickly became a way of life for the exiles, who banded together under VanCleef's leadership.\nOver the years, the ranks of the Brotherhood grew to include the skilled, the desperate, and the outcast; allowing them to essentially become a small army.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nNeeding a secure location from which to plan their revenge against Stormwind, &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; chose the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, an abandoned mining network hidden beneath a barn in &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, as his base of operations. From there, he sent his forces out into Westfall, Elwynn Forest, and &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; to sow chaos and keep Stormwind's militia - already stretched thin - occupied while he oversaw the construction of a massive &lt;a href=\"Juggernaught\"&gt;Juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; naval vessel deep within the Deadmines. Once complete, he planned to use it to lay waste to Stormwind from the sea.\nHaving long forsaken those noble virtues on which their brotherhood was founded, the mysterious Defias faction is now composed of thieves, bandits, and vicious mercenaries. This vile group is determined to wreak havoc upon, and ultimately destroy, the House of Nobles in Stormwind City. Convinced that the nobles are corrupt and villainous, the Defias Brotherhood has waged an underground war in a quest to rid the land of their hated enemies.\nThe Defias have taken over parts of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, and have recently caused significant problems in the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Stockade\"&gt;Stormwind Stockade&lt;/a&gt; by briefly taking control of the prison in the capital. The Brotherhood is known to have also had a presence in &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Valley\"&gt;Northshire Valley&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt;, and the area around Stormwind, the Brotherhood mastered the art of ambush, and despite protection by the Stormwind City Guard, few caravans got through the woods unhindered. The Guard lacked the manpower to pursue the Brotherhood into their base of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, leading the farmers and villagers in the area to form &lt;a href=\"The%20People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;The People's Militia&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to fight back against the Brotherhood. Promising young &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knights of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; were also sent here by &lt;a href=\"Duthorian%20Rall\"&gt;Duthorian Rall&lt;/a&gt; to find and protect &lt;a href=\"Daphne%20Stilwell\"&gt;Daphne Stilwell&lt;/a&gt; from a Defias attack at her home in Westfall, located at the very ends of Westfall's &lt;a href=\"Longshore\"&gt;Longshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo accomplish their goals, the Brotherhood surrounded itself with allies, among them the &lt;a href=\"Riverpaw%20pack\"&gt;Riverpaw gnolls&lt;/a&gt; of Westfall and the kobolds of Elwynn Forest who, according to the note sent by &lt;a href=\"Wiley%20the%20Black\"&gt;Wiley the Black&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt;, were actively working for the Defias to help secure the mines they've captured. The &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt; had a deal with &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; about the construction of the Juggernaught, and possibly to navigate it as the pirates on VanCleef's ship may occasionally drop &lt;a href=\"Blackwater%20Cutlass\"&gt;Blackwater Cutlass&lt;/a&gt;es. They also had some kind of partnership with the &lt;a href=\"Strashaz\"&gt;Strashaz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Dustwallow%20Marsh\"&gt;Dustwallow Marsh&lt;/a&gt;, as the naga on &lt;a href=\"Alcaz%20Island\"&gt;Alcaz Island&lt;/a&gt; helped them by keeping the &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;missing diplomat&lt;/a&gt;. Vancleef had an ally in the House of Nobles, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Gregor%20Lescovar\"&gt;Lord Gregor Lescovar&lt;/a&gt;, a conspiring Stormwind noble had aided the Defias in plotting against the king. The Defias had also conspired with Lady &lt;a href=\"Katrana%20Prestor\"&gt;Katrana Prestor&lt;/a&gt;, and played a part in King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s kidnapping.\nWith the addition of &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s to their ranks, their armaments grew to include &lt;a href=\"harvest%20golem\"&gt;harvest golem&lt;/a&gt;s, which they used to drive the farmers of Westfall off their land and claim it for themselves. In order to further hurt the people of Westfall, they also began burning the farmers' fields and salting the earth to prevent them from growing crops.\nHowever, Alliance forces, sent by the People's Militia, rallied and stormed the Deadmines, slaying Edwin VanCleef, and taking his severed head back to Stormwind as proof. Lord Lescovar was also assassinated by agents; thus putting an end to his scheming. What they didn't know, however, was that his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa&lt;/a&gt;, had seen the slaughter of her father, and she would not forget it.\nBloodsail Buccaneer.\nAt some point, the Brotherhood cheated &lt;a href=\"Jerias%20Bloodvein\"&gt;Jerias Bloodvein&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bloodsail%20Buccaneers\"&gt;Bloodsail Buccaneers&lt;/a&gt; and killed two members of his crew. In response, Jerias captured three citizens of &lt;a href=\"Elwynn%20Forest\"&gt;Elwynn Forest&lt;/a&gt; - &lt;a href=\"James%20Blackridge\"&gt;James Blackridge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Liam\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bram%20Woodring\"&gt;Bram Woodring&lt;/a&gt; - and vowed to take revenge on Edwinn VanCleef. Taking his crew through &lt;a href=\"Moonbrook\"&gt;Moonbrook&lt;/a&gt;, Jerias invaded the tunnels of the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;, defeating Defias members and their &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; allies, ultimately arriving to the &lt;a href=\"Ironclad%20Cove\"&gt;Ironclad Cove&lt;/a&gt; with the Defias juggernaught where the Brotherhood members had captured Blackridge's parents - &lt;a href=\"Mr.%20Blackridge\"&gt;Mr. Blackridge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mrs.%20Blackridge\"&gt;Mrs. Blackridge&lt;/a&gt; - from their farm near &lt;a href=\"Goldshire\"&gt;Goldshire&lt;/a&gt;. While the pirate crew finished off the bandit Brotherhood, James sneaked up on the juggernaught and freed his parents from the grasp of the enemies.\nDark Riders.\nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, a group of the Defias Brotherhood was patrolling around &lt;a href=\"Gold%20Coast%20Quarry\"&gt;Gold Coast Quarry&lt;/a&gt;, and soon they attacked &lt;a href=\"Tannos\"&gt;Tannos&lt;/a&gt; and his guards in the Quarry. They were aided by &lt;a href=\"Karlain\"&gt;Karlain&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; who defeated the Defias.\nCataclysm.\nDespite the near-total annihilation of the brotherhood's leadership, including Edwin VanCleef, the Defias made a resurgence. This was primarily due to growing resentment of Stormwind's leadership among the people of Westfall, the cause of which was poverty among the people and a perceived indifference to this poverty by the King. Edwin's daughter, &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa&lt;/a&gt;, now an adult, arose to take the leadership of the Defias and to take vengeance on Stormwind for killing her father.\nThe investigations of Lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Horatio%20Laine\"&gt;Horatio Laine&lt;/a&gt; into a murder at &lt;a href=\"Furlbrow%27s%20Pumpkin%20Farm\"&gt;Furlbrow's Pumpkin Farm&lt;/a&gt; led to incremental revelations about Vanessa VanCleef's dealings, disguised as a \"Shadowy Figure\". Vanessa had been encouraging the anti-Stormwind sentiment among the people of Westfall, rebuilding the brotherhood's ranks and arsenal, and recruiting new allies to aid the cause. Extremely deceptive and cunning, she even managed to keep these preparations relatively secret until it was too late for anyone to stop what had been put in motion. Once her forces were sufficiently bolstered and mobilized, she revealed herself to Marshal &lt;a href=\"Gryan%20Stoutmantle\"&gt;Gryan Stoutmantle&lt;/a&gt; as the newly reconstituted Defias Brotherhood mounted a surprise attack on &lt;a href=\"Sentinel%20Hill\"&gt;Sentinel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, Stormwind's base in Westfall. Stoutmantle, Laine, and the other leaders were tied up and forced to watch as the Defias burned Sentinel Hill virtually to the ground.\nVanessa also began the re-building of her father's prized project - the &lt;a href=\"Juggernaught\"&gt;Juggernaught&lt;/a&gt; - with, like her father before her, the aim of using it to reduce Stormwind to rubble, once and for all.\nAfter a large conflict between forces of Stormwind and the Brotherhood, a force of Alliance &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; entered Vanessa's base of operations - The Deadmines - and after fighting the remaining Defias forces within, engaged in battle with &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Vanessa herself&lt;/a&gt; atop the Juggernaught. In the end, realizing defeat, Vanessa detonates a series of explosions which essentially blow up her and the upper part of the ship, shouting:\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;, it was revealed that Vanessa survived the Deadmines due to her poisons addling the adventurers' minds, letting her trick them into thinking she died. She then joins &lt;a href=\"the%20Uncrowned\"&gt;the Uncrowned&lt;/a&gt; after receiving help from &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Jorach%20Ravenholdt\"&gt;Lord Jorach Ravenholdt&lt;/a&gt;. After poisoning the Council of Shadows in an attempt to assassinate the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Last Shadow&lt;/a&gt; and take their place, Vanessa had no choice but to become the latter's agent by swearing loyalty, pledging the allegiance of the Brotherhood to the Uncrowned at the same time.\nSubsequently, the Defias joined the &lt;a href=\"Hall%20of%20Shadows\"&gt;Hall of Shadows&lt;/a&gt; beneath &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;, where &lt;a href=\"Lonika%20Stillblade\"&gt;Lonika Stillblade&lt;/a&gt; of the Rogue Academy took care of recruiting and training &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s into Brotherhood thieves, as agents of the Uncrowned. The membership of the organization has also been enlarged since now among the members were present &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Defias have officially lost the Deadmines, where only a spirit haunting the mines is all that remains of their presence.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Argus%20Campaign\"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Argus\"&gt;Argus&lt;/a&gt;, among the agents of the Uncrowned in the &lt;a href=\"Armies%20of%20Legionfall\"&gt;Armies of Legionfall&lt;/a&gt;, Defias thieves were notably present to fight the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Krokuun\"&gt;Krokuun&lt;/a&gt;.\nFourth war and aftermath.\nFollowing the Legion's defeat, Vanessa remained an occasional informant for &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; under the agreement that so long as she kept the Defias on a short leash, he and the wouldn't come after her for their crimes. Though she tried to reign in their banditry to focus on aiding the people of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;l, she began to realize that between &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;'s reforms and Stormwind's earlier offer of pardons, nearly all of the principled Defias that were still alive had departed the organization, leaving only the thieves and bullies with no qualms about targeting innocents.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"bandit\"&gt;bandit&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Avarice\"&gt;Avarice&lt;/a&gt; stole &lt;a href=\"Rare%20Hides\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Telonis\"&gt;Telonis&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; and camped in Elwynn's woods behind &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Two of the bandits wore red bandanas, hinting at their allegiance with the Defias Brotherhood. In the &lt;a href=\"Vision%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Vision of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Drowned%20Defias\"&gt;drowned Defias&lt;/a&gt; can be seen in the &lt;a href=\"Canals%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;canals&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, near the entrance of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Town\"&gt;Old Town&lt;/a&gt;.\nDragonflight.\nSome time after the discovery of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt;, a disgraced noble named &lt;a href=\"Count%20Clessington\"&gt;Count Clessington&lt;/a&gt; arranged for the Defias to steal the &lt;a href=\"%3ADrakefire%20Amulet\"&gt;:Drakefire Amulet&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Keep\"&gt;Stormwind Keep&lt;/a&gt;. Using the artifact's powers of manipulation, and the help of a cruel and brutal bandit named &lt;a href=\"Duncon%20Ratsbon\"&gt;Duncon Ratsbon&lt;/a&gt;, he convinced the Defias to turn against &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and march on &lt;a href=\"Northshire%20Abbey\"&gt;Northshire Abbey&lt;/a&gt;, with the aim of using it as a staging ground to pillage the city of Stormwind itself. Seeing how easily a noble turned the Brotherhood against her made Vanessa realize that she was no longer one of them, she then told the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Rebel\"&gt;remaining Defias loyal&lt;/a&gt; to her cause who stayed behind to return home and help the people of Westfall in other ways. With the help of a &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champion of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, the Defias were defeated, Count Clessington was slain, and the Drakefire Amulet was destroyed. In the wake of their victory, Vanessa VanCleef determined that she would find her own legacy, rather than continuing her father's. However during the battle, Duncon Ratsbon announced that the Defias were now answering to him, and when he was about to be killed, he fled and stated that the organization could not lose its new leader.\nLater at the &lt;a href=\"Saldean%27s%20Farm\"&gt;Saldean's Farm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Breadbasket%20Guild\"&gt;Breadbasket Guild&lt;/a&gt; was created by a gathering of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"farmer\"&gt;farmer&lt;/a&gt;s, former Defias members, and war &lt;a href=\"refugee\"&gt;refugee&lt;/a&gt;s, who sought to help Westfall and its inhabitants. They are good people trying to do right by each other, notably by working the farms again and to get proper homes built for folks, without falling to the greed of the Brotherhood. They are officially supported by &lt;a href=\"Cecilia%20Clessington\"&gt;Countess Cecilia Clessington&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"House%20of%20Nobles\"&gt;House of Nobles&lt;/a&gt;, and in the shadows by Vanessa VanCleef who couldn't officially join the guild because of her crimes as the former leader of the Brotherhood.\nOn a &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; ship in the &lt;a href=\"Shrouded%20Coast\"&gt;Shrouded Coast&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forbidden%20Reach\"&gt;Forbidden Reach&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"Return%20of%20the%20Nightsquall\"&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the Defias were welcomed to sail under the flag of Nightsquall's crew, who aimed to build the biggest pirate fleet Azeroth had ever known. The volunteers were invited to travel to the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; and to plunder its secrets in the name of &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Admiral%20Nightsquall\"&gt;Dread Admiral Nightsquall&lt;/a&gt;.\nFormer territories.\nIn the years since its founding, the Defias Brotherhood took advantage of the political crisis in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; to expand its territory and settle in all regions of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt;, in order to continue their preparations to accomplish their revenge. However, following the death of &lt;a href=\"Edwin%20VanCleef\"&gt;Edwin VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; and the defeat &lt;a href=\"Vanessa%20VanCleef\"&gt;Vanessa VanCleef&lt;/a&gt; at the hands of &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s, the Brotherhood lost all of its territories and the control of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt;, where was their headquarters: the &lt;a href=\"Deadmines\"&gt;Deadmines&lt;/a&gt;.\nItems.\nMasks.\nIt is known that the Defias wear red face masks. To a certain degree, the material of said face masks reveals a Defias member's rank within the Brotherhood. A popular item for &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s is the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Defias%20Mask\"&gt;Red Defias Mask&lt;/a&gt;, a mask that can drop off of any Defias mob in Westfall, Duskwood, the Deadmines, or the Stockade. It is a bind-on-pickup item and can only be worn by rogues. Because it can be equipped by low-level characters, before most other head-gear, many lower-level Rogues actively seek this item for its look, despite the fact that it provides no armor or stats. Curiously, the highest drop-rate for the mask seems to be off of the &lt;a href=\"Grave%20Robber\"&gt;grave robbers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, the only mobs who drop the mask that are not masked themselves.\nFrom lowest to currently known highest, the order of importance seemed to be &lt;a href=\"Red%20Burlap%20Bandana\"&gt;burlap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Linen%20Bandana\"&gt;linen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Leather%20Bandana\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Red%20Silk%20Bandana\"&gt;silk&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Red%20Wool%20Bandana\"&gt;wool&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Red%20Bandana\"&gt;Red Bandana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodied%20Defias%20Bandana\"&gt;Bloodied Defias Bandana&lt;/a&gt; are also used for quests.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Syndicate\"&gt;Syndicate&lt;/a&gt; is a similar organization in the sense that all members wear an orange mask.\nIn the RPG.\nRazed by the Horde in the First War, the city of Stormwind required a small army of engineers and artisans in order to begin a massive program of reconstruction. After restoring the city to its former glory, the workers gathered outside Stormwind Keep to collect payment for their services. This came as a surprise to the nobility of the city, who had assumed that the work was being done as a matter of civic pride. Whether they were unable or simply unwilling to proffer payment, they immediately ordered the workers exiled from the city. With only the tools in their hands and the clothes on their backs, the workers were forced out of Stormwind and into Elwynn Forest. The shocked and forlorn workers were rallied by engineer Edwin VanCleef and became bandits, collecting their payment one traveler at a time. Marking themselves with a tattoo of a cog on their right hand, the bandits declared that \u201cthe machine will not run smoothly if the parts go renegade\u201d to each waylaid traveler.\nBanditry and thievery quickly became a way of life for the exiles, banding together under VanCleef\u2019s leadership as the Defias Brotherhood. Over the years, the ranks of the Brotherhood have been bolstered by the skilled, the desperate and the outcast, and now those marked with the cog tattoo signifying membership number in the hundreds. In Elwynn Forest and the area around Stormwind, the Brotherhood has mastered the art of the ambush, and despite protection by the Stormwind City Guard, few caravans get through the woods unhindered. The Guard\u2019s inability and unwillingness to pursue the Brotherhood into Westfall has led the farmers and villagers in the area to form the People\u2019s Militia in an attempt to stave off the Brotherhood\u2019s constant looting.\nLacking any formal military training, the outcasts who formed the Defias Brotherhood might have been forcibly disbanded long ago were it not for the skilled craftsmen and tinkers who made up its founding membership. These founders have worked together to give members of the Brotherhood access to an array of mechanical devices and weapons ranging from climbing equipment and smoke bombs to automatic crossbows and wagon traps (clamps buried in the ground that seize heavy wheels passing overhead and stop wagons on the spot).\nWhen the Defias Brotherhood advanced into Westfall, the goblins of the area were upset both by the Brotherhood\u2019s raids on the merchant trains that supplied their shops and by the Brotherhood\u2019s refusal to sell their inventions at goblin merchant outposts. After repeated attempts by the goblins at negotiation were met by increased attacks on their suppliers by the Brotherhood, the merchants hired a group of mercenaries to hunt the bandits. This hunt resulted in the only major battle fought by the Brotherhood \u2014 and led to the capture of all goblins in Westfall by the renegade bandits. Chained together, they were marched south into the Dead Mines and put under the command of Edwin VanCleef. What has happened to them since is unknown.\nOrganization.\nAnyone with a sword and a cog tattoo can declare himself part of the Defias Brotherhood and begin robbing traveling merchants. Yet the Brotherhood hears of such activity quickly, long before even the Stormwind Guard, and new self-initiates soon find themselves visited by a member who instructs them in the ways of the Brotherhood. If the initiate agrees, he is officially allowed to join the Defias Brotherhood. If an initiate proves disagreeable, he is paid a second, quieter visit shortly thereafter by a shadowy form wielding a pneumatic crossbow. Most initiates quickly join one of the Brotherhood's many established raiding parties. These groups are generally known as \u201cbands,\u201d though they often adopt more colorful nicknames, from the \u201cSouthpath Raiders\u201d to the \u201cRoadspirits.\u201d In some cases, as with \u201cRillo's Leafwalkers,\u201d a band is named after its leader, called a \u201ccaptain\u201d in the Brotherhood. Captains lead and control their bands with force and cunning, and most experienced captains bear scars demonstrating their ability to withstand challenges by young upstarts. Captains plan the raids of their bands, and they are responsible for supplying their bands with not only food and shelter but also training in the art of the ambush and the technology that gives the Brotherhood an edge. Initiates interested in becoming full Defias renegades quickly become familiar with the requirements described for the prestige class, as their instructors put them through a grueling training regimen until they qualify.\nCaptains and their bands are given free reign by the Brotherhood's leadership to steal, pillage, harass, and harry as often as they like and as long as they can avoid open conflict with the troops of the &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Guard\"&gt;Stormwind Guard&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"People%27s%20Militia\"&gt;People's Militia&lt;/a&gt;. Occasionally, however, higher-ranking members of the Brotherhood are sent out with \u201cknife squads\u201d to warn bands who go too far; in the words of Edwin VanCleef, \u201ca dead traveler carries no treasure, and a ruined village has no plunder\u201d. The Brotherhood requires that captains bring a quarter of all loot to Moonbrook, where it helps fund the research and activities of VanCleef and the Brotherhood's leadership. In return, the Brotherhood gives captains access to the technological advances made in the labs within their hidden headquarters.\nThey are known for attacking caravans and travelers across central and western Azeroth. In Westfall, they are known for brazenly and openly looting farms and village merchants. Bands of the Defias Brotherhood are found mainly in Westfall and Elwynn Forest, though they occasionally range into Duskwood and other parts of northern Azeroth. The few who have managed to track them so far believe that the Brotherhood works out of the remote town of Moonbrook in southern Westfall. Yet its true headquarters is actually nearby in an underground fortress constructed in the labyrinthine Dead Mines.\nMembership.\nRenegades of the Defias Brotherhood tend to be exceptionally skilled, swift of foot and mind, and mechanically adept. They also tend to feel alienated from society at large and are often looking for some sort of revenge, even if they don't know how or against whom. As well, they need to be able to show enough initiative to seek out and join the Brotherhood of their own free will, though once inside they are expected to follow orders within the wide borders of freebooting and banditry. The majority of the renegades are human, with a small portion of dwarves from Khaz Modan in the south and a few high elves upset at the army of Stormwind for refusing to march north and retake all of Quel'Thalas. Half-elves, half-orcs, and others who feel outcast from their own races have also bonded with Defias bands and become renegades.\nBrann warns fellow travelers to make sure their coins are not scratched. This is due to the Defias Brotherhood taking a liking to marring the face of the king to produce what are known as \"cross-eyed coins.\" These coins have been declared illegal.\nMilitary.\nMany consider the Defias Brotherhood just a band of bullies and brigands, but they underestimate its military capabilities. While the Brotherhood employs mercenaries to bolster its ranks, it trains and fields its own forces, preparing for the day when it acts to disrupt all trade with Stormwind.\nThe Brotherhood's force serves two purposes. First, it is a highly mobile raiding force, capable of quickly attacking a caravan, seizing its most valuable goods and destroying the remainder. Second, it is a more conventional attack force that can launch attacks on Alliance garrisons and forts. To achieve these purposes, a typical Defias unit emphasizes mobility, stealth and ambush tactics, and toughness.\nThe Brotherhood is not heavy on magical support; however, within the Deadmines, magi learn to master a deadly arsenal of spells. Also, Defias tinkers, trained by some of the most fiendish goblin minds, devise automatons and steam armor suits whose raw power can provide backup for their less-armored human warriors. The next major engagement between the Brotherhood and the unsuspecting Alliance may hold a few surprises.\nThe two major units of the Defias Brotherhood are bandits (who serve as cannon fodder) and renegades (who are somewhat tougher). Stronger field units (which are given names like \u201chighwayman\u201d and \u201cpillager\u201d) tend to be more skilled as warriors than as rogues.\nThe Defias Brotherhood pretends to embody noble ideals in the service of a just cause, but it's a fa\u00e7ade; the presence of bandits among them proves the lie. The highwaymen stalk the roads of Westfall, especially at night, exacting a toll on anyone who doesn't support the Brotherhood's efforts. Bandits are the lowest of the low in the Brotherhood's ranks, and when the battle horn sounds, they take the front ranks. They group together for close support (preferring to fight back to back in a mob), and are often the first to flee the field when the tide turns against them.\nThe Defias Brotherhood rarely fields an army of regular troops, as VanCleef and the other commanders prefer its members to master a wider variety of skills than those of a pure soldier. The Defias renegade (often called a thug or brigand) is the gold standard of the Defias operatives, a decent fighter and a skilled spy wrapped in one strong, sneaky package.\nMembers of the Defias Brotherhood take pride in their affiliation. They wear red bandanas over their faces to display their allegiance and to hide their identities. They are lightly armed and armored, employing short swords or longswords, and hiding a dagger beneath the folds of their cloaks. In situations where they're expecting trouble, they command a small cadre of mercenary soldiers or Defias bandits and use them as buffers to protect themselves from the enemy.\nLocations.\nBands of the Defias Brotherhood are found mainly in Westfall and Elwynn Forest, though they occasionally range into Duskwood and other parts of northern Azeroth. The few who have managed to track them so far believe that the Brotherhood works out of the remote town of Moonbrook in southern Westfall. Yet its true headquarters is actually nearby in an underground fortress constructed in the labyrinthine Dead Mines."}

Hunters lost the need to have a melee weapon equipped (though they stil can) and had their ranged weapons equippable in their main hand slot. This left casters with one fewer statstick and eliminated them altogether for non-casters."}
{"id": "324578", "revid": "40372170", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=324578", "title": "Stat budget", "text": "Stat budget refers to how the values of stats are set for an equippable item of a given &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt;.\nStatMod.\nAll &lt;a href=\"combat%20rating%20system\"&gt;combat ratings&lt;/a&gt; have a StatMod of 1, as do Strength, Agility, Intellect or Spirit. Stamina has a StatMod of 2/3. This appears to still be the case in Cataclysm: a primary-color level-83 gem will give +60 Stamina or +40 to another stat, and a raid flask will give +450 Stamina or +300 to Strength, Agility, Intellect and Spirit. Comparing &lt;a href=\"Dragonscale%20Leg%20Armor\"&gt;Dragonscale Leg Armor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Powerful%20Ghostly%20Spellthread\"&gt;Powerful Ghostly Spellthread&lt;/a&gt; also indicates that the StatMod for attack power is still 1/2.\n&lt;a href=\"Additional%20armor\"&gt;Additional armor&lt;/a&gt; had a StatMod of 1/14 as of Patch 3.2.\nThe post referenced above doesn't give a StatMod for &lt;a href=\"spell%20penetration\"&gt;spell penetration&lt;/a&gt;, but the stats on &lt;a href=\"Stormy%20Ocean%20Sapphire\"&gt;Stormy Ocean Sapphire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vivid%20Dream%20Emerald\"&gt;Vivid Dream Emerald&lt;/a&gt; suggest its StatMod is 4/5.\nHistorical Overview.\nDuring the original reverse-engineering of the individual \"cost\" of each stat, Hyzenthelei set out assuming that +1 to Heal had a cost of 100. He then compared items of similar item level and comparable stats and thus arrived at the first version of the StatMod table (which stood the test of time very well). Later, during a presentation by Blizzard at BlizzCon, a slide revealed that 1% Melee Crit = 14 points. This confirmed Hyzentheleis table (1% melee crit was indeed 14 times as expensive as one point of a basic stat), but at the same time gave a benchmark for the proper scale \u2014 rate basic stats with one point. \nWith WoW 2.0, the table was reworked, some properties (most notable Stamina) changed their price, and others were replaced. In particular many combat-related stats were changed to &lt;a href=\"Combat%20rating%20system\"&gt;combat ratings&lt;/a&gt;. All existing items were updated to reflect this change. This simplified the table, because Combat Rating points are worth exactly one \"item point\", the same as base stats (exc. Stamina).\nWeapon DPS.\nWeapon DPS is inherent to the iLevel of the item: thus as more stats are assigned, the higher the DPS will be.\nWeapon DPS follows the following formulae for Burning Crusade items:\nWeapon spell power.\n&lt;a href=\"Spell%20power\"&gt;Spell power&lt;/a&gt; on a weapon is not part of the item's stat budget.\nIn the case of a melee weapon, the weapon gains \"free\" spell power in exchange for having less DPS than other weapons of the same slot, quality and item level. For example, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowhead.com/items%3D2%3Ffilter%3Dsl%3D17%3Bminle%3D359%3Bmaxle%3D359%230-5%2B1\"&gt;a level 359 two-handed epic weapon&lt;/a&gt; has either 623.3 DPS, or 213.2 DPS and 1955 spell power. This allows a weapon upgrade to provide the same DPS increase to a caster as to a non-caster, while ensuring that a caster weapon is rarely an upgrade for a non-caster.\nAt one point, spell power was gained by \"sacrificing\" DPS at a fixed ratio. However, in \"Cataclysm\" this is not the case: one-handed caster melee weapons have the same DPS and the same spell power as two-handed caster weapons, which means they are giving up less DPS compared to their non-caster counterparts.\nWands didn't follow this rule before &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.0.4\"&gt;Patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, when the ranged slot was deleted. Until then, wands had no spell power. They had \"more\" DPS than other ranged weapons of the same item level, but gained no extra damage from &lt;a href=\"attack%20power\"&gt;attack power&lt;/a&gt; or spell power.\nArmor Values.\nArmor value is inherent to the item and dependent upon its iLevel. Additional armor can be purchased with normal stat points: gear with additional armor will show the armor value in Green text. However, for most pieces the armor value is given without the use of any normal Item value.\nThe maximum armor for a particular iLevel piece is calculated using the formula below, and then multipied by the Armor SlotMod to calculate the armor for that particular gear slot. Blue/Superior armors have 1.1 times the armor value of a Green Item, and Epic items have 1.25 times the armor of a Blue item (1.375 times a green). Shields have a separate formula of their own and have different multipliers between gear qualities as shown below. \nArmor SlotMods.\nEach particular slot of armor receives a slightly different percentage of the maximum armor calculated above, according to this table:\nCapes are always cloth armor.\nUsing these two formulas: an iLevel 115 Blue quality Mail Bracer would have armor of:\n (115 * 4.9 + 29)Green * 1.1Blue * 7/16Wrist = 285.14\nCompared to the blue bracers, all have an armor of 285: http://www.wowhead.com/?items=4.3&amp;filter=qu=3;sl=9;minle=115\nAt one point the armor values of items seemed to decrease, but in a subsequent patch they returned to or exceeded their original values: &lt;a href=\"Dryad%27s%20Wrist%20Bindings%20%28level%2060%29\"&gt;Dryad's Wrist Bindings (level 60)&lt;/a&gt; returned to normal but &lt;a href=\"Robes%20of%20Insight\"&gt;Robes of Insight&lt;/a&gt; gained 10 armor. The reasons for these changes are not yet known.\nSockets.\nA socket is counted as the stat values of an \"expected gem\". The expected gem is believed to always be a blue-quality gem that matches the socket and, in the case of a colored socket, usually shares both a primary and a secondary stat with the item.\nA meta socket on a Cataclysm item appears to be worth 40 points in the primary stat and 20 points in each of two secondary stats, which would make it equivalent to a yellow socket plus a blue socket. For example, compare &lt;a href=\"Helm%20of%20the%20Typhonic%20Beast\"&gt;Helm of the Typhonic Beast&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=\"Stormforged%20Helm\"&gt;Stormforged Helm&lt;/a&gt;.\nFree prismatic socket on relics.\nAll &lt;a href=\"relic\"&gt;relic&lt;/a&gt;s had a prismatic socket that appeared to be free when compared to a wand (e.g. &lt;a href=\"Relic%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Relic of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; versus &lt;a href=\"Theresa%27s%20Booklight\"&gt;Theresa's Booklight&lt;/a&gt;).\nSocket bonuses.\nSocket bonuses are proportional in value to the number of sockets, don't count toward the stat budget, and may or may not be a stat already present on the item. For Cataclysm items, the socket bonus is 10 points for a colored socket and 20 points for a meta socket. Prismatic and cogwheel sockets don't grant or increase a socket bonus.\nSet bonuses.\nSet bonuses don't count toward the item budget.\nCooldowns and procs.\nCooldowns and procs that increase a stat are counted as the amount of the increase times the expected percentage uptime. On PvE trinkets, the value is the same for a cooldown as for a proc; for example, the &lt;a href=\"Core%20of%20Ripeness\"&gt;Core of Ripeness&lt;/a&gt; cooldown gives 1926 Spirit for 20 seconds every 2 minutes (1/6 uptime), while the &lt;a href=\"Fall%20of%20Mortality\"&gt;Fall of Mortality&lt;/a&gt; proc gives 1926 Spirit for 15 seconds about every 90 seconds (1/6 uptime). On PvP trinkets, however, a stat cooldown is counted as 20% more than its average amount; for example, &lt;a href=\"Bloodthirsty%20Gladiator%27s%20Insignia%20of%20Victory\"&gt;Bloodthirsty Gladiator's Insignia of Victory&lt;/a&gt;'s proc gives 912 Strength with about 1/3 uptime, while &lt;a href=\"Bloodthirsty%20Gladiator%27s%20Badge%20of%20Victory\"&gt;Bloodthirsty Gladiator's Badge of Victory&lt;/a&gt;'s cooldown gives 1520 Strength (instead of the expected 1824) with 1/6 uptime.\nThe crowd-control-breaking &lt;a href=\"PvP%20Trinket\"&gt;PvP Trinket&lt;/a&gt; cooldown replaces a stat cooldown or proc. This means that as the item level increases, its cost increases but is a decreasing percentage of the budget."}

{"id": "386550", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=386550", "title": "Stat squish", "text": "The stat squish (also known as the item squish or simply \"the squish\") saw many numbers within the game scaled down, including stats on items, player and mob health, and damaging and healing abilities. The first squish was implemented in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0.2\"&gt;Patch 6.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, and the latest squish (which was a level and stat squish) occurred in &lt;a href=\"Patch%209.0.1\"&gt;Patch 9.0.1&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"stat squish\" strictly refers only to changes made to items, but in practice the term is often used to encompass three related changes, which in combination acted to drastically alter numbers in the game. Because these changes were implemented simultaneously, for many the sum total of the combined changes is viewed as the result of the stat squish.\nThe combined result of this was to drastically reduce numbers throughout the game, while maintaining damage and health proportions between players and creatures; to make damage and healing less \"spiky\" and burst-oriented; to improve spell and ability damage scaling and tuning; and to make it easier for players to tackle lower-level content from past expansions.\nHistory.\nThe concept was first aired in a developer blog posted on November 3, 2011, regarding the numbers in the game growing larger than envisioned over the course of WoW's first decade. Blizzard is now trying to scale back the power that &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; provides to make the numbers a bit more manageable. Stat inflation began in earnest during \"&lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;\" with the development of hard modes and the insertion of a fourth raid tier sending item levels far higher than they were originally anticipated to reach by the end of the expansion.\nThe stat squish was demonstrated in action for the first time to players two years later at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202013\"&gt;BlizzCon 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and went live with the \"\" mechanics pre-patch in &lt;a href=\"Patch%206.0\"&gt;Patch 6.0&lt;/a&gt;, a few weeks before the expansion was released with the new content. \nBlizzard has stressed that the item squish will \"not\" affect the relative difficulty of killing any creature, or the ability to solo old content. As of Blizzcon 2013 they had yet to reveal how they will accomplish the latter, but an idea Ghostcrawler tweeted months earlier involved buffing high level players in low level raids to compensate for the reduced relative power. During a Q&amp;A session, a dev said \"If players could kill &lt;a href=\"Gulp%20Frog\"&gt;Gulp Frog&lt;/a&gt;s on the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; in five seconds before the squish, it will take five seconds to kill them after the squish.\"\nThe squish will however affect damage and healing ability output more than player health, in order to reduce the importance of burst in combat. For example, a tank may find their health reduced from something like 1 million to around 400k health at the start of the expansion. This is intended to make combat less concerned with burst and quick reflexes.\nThe issue.\nOver the course of five expansions, the power level jumps between tiers within an expansion have far outpaced character level. At the time, this made sense, as moving to a new tier of content should mean a jump in player power level commensurate with the creature power level in the new tier. In other words, a new tier of loot should always feel like an upgrade to the previous tier. Blizzard approves of large jumps between tiers, as they can tune raid encounters to be extremely punishing for cutting-edge raiders (still mostly geared from the previous tier) yet still accessible for other players who may not see the later fights or higher difficulty levels until they have grown much more powerful by obtaining current gear.\nThis is all well and good, but nearly a decade has passed since the release of the game. The power level jump between &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt; (tier 1) and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; (tier 2), or even between \"Wrath of the Lich King\" and \"Cataclysm\" is utterly inconsequential in the era of &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; (tier 15) and &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; (tier 16). As a result of the successive power jumps, currently near the end of \"Mists of Pandaria\", the average damage-specialized raider has more than 600,000 health (more than most bosses in Molten Core) and is individually dealing more than 240,000 damage per second (nearly as much as an entire 25-player raid attempting heroic &lt;a href=\"Al%27Akir%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Al'Akir&lt;/a&gt;).\nAdditionally, bosses have run into issues where their maximum health has grown too high. WoW stores health values in , which have a maximum value of 2^31 - 1, or 2,147,483,647. &lt;a href=\"Ra-den%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Ra-den&lt;/a&gt;, the heroic-only boss of &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Throne of Thunder&lt;/a&gt;, starts at roughly 1,500,000,000 health in 25-player mode. As part of the fight, if players make mistakes his health could increase to the point where it would . In order to avoid repeating the problem, &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; must heal (from 10% to full) several times with a smaller maximum health pool than would otherwise be necessary.\nThe table on the right provides an overview of the item level-vs-character level change over the course of the raid tiers of \"World of Warcraft\". For the sake of simplicity, the table only shows the \"normal\" item level of most armor pieces and items in a tier. The table does not show Raid Finder, Flexible, or Heroic difficulties, nor Thunderforged/Warforged random drops, nor 10-man raids which varied from 7-13 ilvls behind during Wrath, nor raid end bosses' higher ilvl drops, nor Pandaria's NPC upgrades. It should be stressed that all of these give rise to considerable variation. By the time of the Siege of Orgrimmar items drop in no fewer than six different types (RF, Flex, Normal, Normal Warforged, Heroic, Heroic Warforged) and combined with the NPC upgrades, SoO gear ranges from 528 for stock Raid Finder gear up to 580 for 2/2 upgraded Heroic Warforged. As there will still be four difficulties in \"Warlords of Draenor\" this wide variation is expected to remain as well.\nThe solution.\nPlease note: While the item squish has already been implemented in the expansion's beta, precise numbers have not yet been recorded and may still be in flux. The numbers here represent projections from earlier presentations.\nRather than having massive jumps between tiers in an older expansion, and from one expansion to the next, the plan in \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" is to flatten out the power curve. In all previous expansions' tiers, there will be a minimal jump from one tier (and one expansion) to the next, and the effective power that &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; provides will be scaled back. The current expansion will still have notable power jumps between tiers, just like before.\nFrom the \"Pruning the Garden of War\" blog post:\nNumbers.\nPrior to the expansion's alpha test, Celestalon tweeted that the \"squish [was] applied across the board (numbers about ~4% of what they were). Except player health, which is at ~8%.\"\nAs of July's beta build, many level 100 characters have around 250,000 health in epic ilvl 660 gear. Items with around 2,400 stamina in \"Mists\" will provide around 100 stamina in \"Warlords\".\nEarlier information.\nUsing the numbers seen at &lt;a href=\"BlizzCon%202013\"&gt;BlizzCon 2013&lt;/a&gt;, the table below lists stats for a random level 90 gnome frost mage wearing similar PvE-focused item level 538 gear before and after the squish. Note that the stats are not exactly the same because the gear wasn't an exact match.\nAt the same time, level 90 mobs drop from having 393,000 health to roughly 40,000 health. Main attacks (like &lt;a href=\"Frostbolt\"&gt;Frostbolt&lt;/a&gt;) also fall from doing nearly 50,000 damage to roughly 2,000."}

Three out of four of these fights show zero hunter skill (Artorius, on the other hand, is 100% skill) and rely mostly on your knowledge of the strategies and coming prepared with consumables. Once you get the EXACT strategy down, these fights are cake. \nHowever, once you kill these demons, you will probably kite better, and be more able to switch between attacks quicker. Basically, you will be able to judge specific situations faster, and act accordingly\nBest of luck! \nHelper's Role.\nThis is a more specific look at how other classes fit into these fights as helpers. The hunter can solo ALL of the demons, but taking advatage of the attributes and abilities of other classes makes the fights much easier. Everyone can help to clear and deter other players, but here are some more specific roles:"}

Depending on the fight, \"fire\" may be in fact several different kinds of effects (thus also known by the admonition \"Don't stand in the bad stuff.\"), but overall refers to any negative effect to the player that is solved simply by moving. A fight requiring this strategy is usually considered one step up from &lt;a href=\"tank%20and%20spank\"&gt;tank and spank&lt;/a&gt; as it only requires paying attention to a second aspect to the fight aside from the target itself. Many players instinctively just try to avoid any of a opponent's spell effects, regardless if they might cause a positive situation.\nAs these are even more obvious visually than simple debuffs, the phrase usually implies the victim is a complete &lt;a href=\"noob\"&gt;noob&lt;/a&gt; (especially if the effect IS fire, which is always negative) and deserves their fate. Healers waste heals and subsequently hate players who don't stay out of fire, since they can be fatal more quickly than actual bosses\nPlayers with older computers may turn down graphic settings in certain fights and raids to avoid frame rate slowdown, thus making it harder to actually see The Fire. Melee, in particular, tends to either suffer or require them to dance around an enemy to continue attacking. Ranged players are less frequently required to move. Unfortunately for this reason, melee are usually quick to react and have well trained evasion skills, while ranged don't have the habit and thus are more prone to failure. Healer tunnel vision in partiuclar can become a major problem.\nOccasionally the effect is either randomized or occurs in a pattern requiring previous knowledge of the fight, and thus is easy or hard depending on the player and their internet connection, such as the &lt;a href=\"Heigan%20the%20Unclean\"&gt;Heigan&lt;/a&gt; dance.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;'s ability Defile is a culmination of \"Don't stand in the bad stuff\". Don't do it. Really.\nThe phrase was eventually added tongue-in-cheek to the &lt;a href=\"Loading%20screen%20tips\"&gt;tips on loading screens&lt;/a&gt; in \"Cataclysm\". The achievement &lt;a href=\"Stood%20in%20the%20Fire\"&gt;Stood in the Fire&lt;/a&gt; pokes fun at this phrase, in that the desired effect is to stand \"in\" the fire, and subsequently get killed (by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;). And again with the &lt;a href=\"Still%20Standing%20in%20the%20Fire\"&gt;Still Standing in the Fire&lt;/a&gt; achievement to get killed with fire, from &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Staghelm\"&gt;Majordomo Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; kills a player, one of his lines is ."}

{"id": "179340", "revid": "565843", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=179340", "title": "Stealth (mechanic)", "text": "Stealth is an ability that allows &lt;a href=\"player\"&gt;player&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s to sneak around undetected. Most notably a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;'s ability, it is also available to a few other classes, such as &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt; (as &lt;a href=\"Prowl\"&gt;Prowl&lt;/a&gt;), as well as &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s (via &lt;a href=\"Camouflage\"&gt;Camouflage&lt;/a&gt;, since \"Legion\") and &lt;a href=\"cat\"&gt;cat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"pets\"&gt;pets&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike &lt;a href=\"invisibility\"&gt;invisibility&lt;/a&gt;, anybody has a chance to detect an enemy in stealth mode. The chance of detection increases as you get closer, but also depends on the viewing angle (stand right in front of an enemy and you can guarantee they'll see you), the relative levels, and any perception or subtlety modifiers.\nSubtlety and Detection.\nThe difference between subtlety and detection will determine the distance that a player will be seen at. The closer you are to your target, the higher the probability that you will be detected. The chance of detection is also increased if you anywhere in a 180\u00b0 arc in front of the target; it is always best to approach a target from behind. Remaining stationary \"does not\" make you harder to detect.\nSubtlety.\nSutblety, like detection, increases 5 points with each level. When maxed, &lt;a href=\"MoD\"&gt;MoD&lt;/a&gt; is equivalent to 3 extra character levels. &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;Night elf&lt;/a&gt; rogues and druids additionally get the &lt;a href=\"Racial%20trait%23Night%20elf\"&gt;Elusiveness&lt;/a&gt; trait, which is the equivalent to one character level. Using the rogue ability &lt;a href=\"Vanish\"&gt;Vanish&lt;/a&gt; brings a rogue into an improved stealth for 10 seconds, increasing subtlety by 170.\nSubtlety can be increased in the following ways:\nDetection.\nDetection is an innate skill that all players and mobs have, and this increases by 5 points per level. One of the &lt;a href=\"Racial%20Traits\"&gt;Racial Traits&lt;/a&gt; which &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s get is called &lt;a href=\"Perception\"&gt;Perception&lt;/a&gt;, as of WotLK, a passive skill which increases stealth detection by 5 points. There are also various items which grant a bonus to detection, along with certain class abilities. Additionally, various mobs (such as bloodhounds, mindslayers, and city guards) have a much higher level of detection, to dissuade characters from stealthing anywhere nearby.\nDetection can be increased in the following ways:\nStealth tips.\nStealth has a number of uses:\nPvE.\nIn PvE, monsters will normally react when you are close to being detected. Typically, they will look up and either say something or make a noise. If you have &lt;a href=\"Distract\"&gt;Distract&lt;/a&gt; (available at level 22), this can be a very useful ability to keep mobs looking the other way. Try to learn the range at which various mobs will aggro you - then move to just outside that range before using stealth. This will reduce the time you spend under Stealth's movement restriction.\nPvP.\nIn &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt;, if you enter stealth mode near an enemy player they will likely see a message on their screen. Thus, try to stealth from a distance, loop around behind them in a wide circle, and approach from behind. Make good use of any vegetation or other cover - although does not help directly, it can make you somewhat harder to spot visually if you are detected. It takes a couple of seconds for a detected person to \"phase in\" on anyone's screen, so you can normally rush the last couple of yards. You \"can\" use Distract in PvP. The target will face the other way, but it will - of course - notice that a Rogue is approaching.\nStealth detection is also important to rogues, especially in PvP, or in areas with stealthed monsters (for instance, when scouting dungeons). Stealth detection enhancements give the rogue an advantage when going up against other stealthed opponents. A good balance of stealth-enhancing and stealth-detecting skills, items, and enchantments will make your life as a rogue an easier and more effective one.\nMovement speed while stealthed can be improved with talent points spent on &lt;a href=\"Fleet%20Footed\"&gt;Fleet Footed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Camouflage%20%28rogue%20talent%29\"&gt;Camouflage (rogue talent)&lt;/a&gt; - 8%/15% and 5%/10%/15% respectively, topping at 15%. You can also use Sprint while stealthed to increase your speed, not breaking your stealth. Any other items that increase your speed will break stealth upon use, but you can re-stealth or use the item prior to activating stealth.\nWith reduced speed, getting into combat range while stealthed can be tricky. Investing in speed increasing effects can be critical to a rogue. The &lt;a href=\"Minor%20Speed\"&gt;Minor Speed&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Cat%27s%20Swiftness\"&gt;Cat's Swiftness&lt;/a&gt; boot enchantments, or the Fleet Footed talent (enchants and the talent do not stack) offer an extra 8% overall movement speed which works both in and out of stealth, and can be critical when trying to get in range of an opponent or when attempting to escape. Higher rogue talents address issues of range. Any rogue with 40 talent points in the Subtlety tree can use the &lt;a href=\"Shadowstep\"&gt;Shadowstep&lt;/a&gt; skill at a range of 20 yards to instantly teleport behind a targeted opponent and gain a buff that allows a garrote, ambush or backstab attack to have a 20% damage increase; this is very effective against &lt;a href=\"kiting\"&gt;kiters&lt;/a&gt; (like hunters or spell-casters)."}

Steam gauntlets are one of the many innovations that gnomes have invented to help them open jars, mine and crush things. \nTwo pneumatically enhanced, steam-powered gauntlets attach to a bulky portable steam engine. This engine straps to the back of the wearer. The gauntlets themselves are more like gigantic armored mitts, and are usually adjustable to fit the hands of races of different sizes.\nWearing the gauntlets and activating the steam plant grants the wearer enhanced strength. Special stabilizers in the gauntlets allow even the smallest user the ability to pick up heavy objects. The steampowered pack is often so heavy that it can hinder use for weaker beings.\nKicking the gauntlets into overdrive is possible. Doing so further enhances the wearers strength, but the fuel in the steam plant is consumed faster. While in overdrive, the steam plant burns unusually hot.\nThese gloves are difficult to be dexterous in, and performing tasks requiring fine manipulation is impossible."}

The stalwart Dwarven pilots have even been known to ram enemy structures at high speeds and reduce whole fortifications to dust under the Steam Tanks' steel treads. \nInformation.\nThe Steam Tank has a ranged attack and is used solely to kill buildings. The Steam Tank has very thick building armor which makes them very difficult to kill.\nUsually players send a few Steam Tanks with their attacking force to help finish an enemy town. Another strategy is to secretly mass a group of Steam Tanks. Players either head up the tech-tree directly to Steam Tanks or switch over to them later in the game. To do this you need around 3-4 Workshops training Steam Tanks. Keep them hidden so the enemy doesn't know what you're up to. Once you've created a group of 6-12 Steam Tanks send them in. The key is to surprise the enemy so they are not prepared. You want them to discover the Steam Tanks as they are losing their town and can't do anything about it.\nA cool trick is to get an Amulet of Recall, send your Hero into an enemy town then recall a group of Steam Tanks into the town. A more likely trick is to get an Archmage to level 6 then Teleport in with Steam Tanks. The key is surprise.\nResearch the damage upgrades for the Steam Tanks! They can make a huge difference.\nBring &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Peasants&lt;/a&gt; with your Steam Tanks to repair them during battle. If that is not possible, send them home to be repaired if they are severely damaged. \nManual description.\nThese cumbersome, heavily armored vehicles are mobile siege weapons piloted by brave and sometimes reckless dwarves. Their heavy weaponry is too cumbersome to target enemy units and can only be used on buildings."}

With the frequency of conflict in &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; it was only a matter of time before the power of &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt;-driven technology hit the battlefield, and during the last war the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s arrived with a new weapon.\nThe goblin harvester was the first insidious introduction to a new series of steam-powered armors. The suit could level forests and troops, and take an insane amount of punishment before falling to the withering hail of spells and gunfire that unfailingly targeted it when it appeared in battle. The harvester wrought incredible results \u2014 none could deny the power of such a creation. The &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; stared in the direction of the gleefully wicked goblins running rampant with their new innovation, and collectively slapped themselves in the foreheads for not thinking of it first. Within a handful of years, a group of more complex and powerful suits arose, designed by dwarven and gnomish hands. The steam armor race was on.\nEarly steam armor was built with crude plates of iron and a steam-driven inner framework of mechanical pistons and hydraulics that served as the armor's muscle. Mechanical systems and drives interlocked to provide power to weaponry or tools mounted on the extremities. In most cases, the armor was built to resemble a humanoid form, although many incorporated some element of the fantastic: aspects of gargoyles, leering faces, griffin helms, and other flourishes that made the armors more fearsome and awe inspiring.\nModern steam armor is based on modern technology and uses the refinements of dwarven and gnomish craftsmanship. Goblins rely on pell-mell construction; the older suits having proven reliable enough, goblins don't see much reason in adding to the design, and simply go on to build new devices.\nGnomish and dwarven steam armor tends to be lighter and faster, and operates with a varying degree of maneuverability. Goblin steam armor is heavier and much more powerful, but not anywhere near as fast or customizable.\nSteam armor is almost always built with some form of integrated weaponry. Buzzing saws, blades, long piercing spikes, even steam powered ballistae and cannons have been seen attached to steam armor. Whether mounted on the arms, shoulders, or even the backs of steam armor, most of suits have at least one or two weapons they can use in combat.\nThe Mechanics of Steam Armor.\nThe operating parameters of steam armor allow for an individual to turn himself from a single man into a massive engine of destruction. Yet the armor has its vulnerabilities. Such complex systems of mechanical interactions are prone to fail at some point, and the stresses of combat and conflict cause even more strain on what would otherwise be sturdy systems.\nYet the rigors of combat are exactly what steam armor is built to endure. Because of this property, those who rely on steam armor, the &lt;a href=\"steam%20warrior\"&gt;steam warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, often take to customizing and building the armor to suit their particular needs. There are a variety of devices and attachments that can be inserted into a suit of steam armor to enhance its functions and increase its capabilities. To ensure the armor lasts, most steam warriors also build redundancies, failsafe systems, and various features into their armor to ensure their survival.\nThe dangers of using steam armor are usually not visible to the novice. For one thing, the armor is a tactical magnet for attention, causing even the shrewdest of commanders to direct his troops to defeat a suit of steam armor with the utmost effort and determination. So powerful is steam armor that even a couple of suits of the stuff can easily turn the tides of battle. In some cases the steam armor and the steam warrior inside save countless lives simply by showing up and proving that their force is indeed the superior one.\nSteam Armor Equipment.\nMost steam armor is more than just a collection of furnaces, armor plates and technological gizmos. A cunning steam warrior makes the most of his steam armor, adding components to it to increase its capabilities and its potential in battle. This means a variety of mounted equipment, weapons, integrated technological systems and other inventions.\nThere are three types of steam armor equipment: weapons, shields and systems. Weapons deal damage. Shields are methods of defense. Systems are miscellaneous pieces of equipment that add to the steam armor's functions.\nSteam Armor Weapons.\nSteam armor suits have gauntlets and can wield weapons. Characters can also integrate weapons into a suit of steam armor, attaching them directly to the armor's frame. In addition to standard weapons, some steam armor suits wield weapons specifically designed for them, such as the following.\nSteam Armor Shields.\nSteam armor suits often use shields on the battlefield. Not only do these provide extra protection, but the immense size of some of these shields allows them to stopgap walls and bulwarks against enemy fire. Steam armor suits can carry shields just as creatures can.In addition to these standard shields, some steam armor suits include specialized defensive measures, such as the following.\nSteam Armor Systems.\nThe following are steam armor systems: miscellaneous devices that enhance a steam armor's power."}

It seems ready to move at a moment\u2019s notice. Its body coils with power as steam vents from its nostrils. The &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s built the steam &lt;a href=\"golem\"&gt;golem&lt;/a&gt;s to serve them as powerful foot warriors to help defend their warrens and caverns from future assault. Gnomes have always built steam-powered contraptions with the intent to use them in a peaceful manner. With the destruction of Gnomeregan, the gnomes have begun to make machines with more martial purposes. On occasion, one of these powerful, stocky constructs trundles along with a gnomish tinker or emissary working with the dwarves in Kalimdor. Undying, loyal to its charge, and powerful enough to deter even the boldest assailant, the steam golem has proven worth its weight in gold to the diminutive gnomes. The construction of the first steam golem brought in a renaissance of tactical design for the gnomes working with dwarven engineers. Ignoring their more whimsical designs, the gnomes focused on function. The gnomish steam golem is efficient and full of purpose, able to serve as a powerful porter and bodyguard in times of peace and as a deadly combatant and soldier in times of war.\nThe unique feature of the steam golem is its ability to combine with other steam golems. Four steam golems can combine to create a portable fortress on the battlefield. Five steam golems can interlock to create a larger steam golem construct capable of dealing more damage and of wreaking havoc on unsuspecting foes. In combat, the steam golem can serve a number of different roles. Typically, steam golems act as bodyguards in times of peace, but in times of war squadrons of them will deploy to hold strategic positions. Gnomes assemble a steam golem\u2019s body from brass and steel plating, the whole of which ends up weighing 600 pounds."}

All tonks also have a Nitro Boost, which increases speed at the cost of mana. In addition, each Tonk also has a special ability like Mana Shield (absorbs damage at the cost of mana), Flamethrower (consistant damage to anything in front of the tonk), Machine Gun (regular 3-6 damage to a single nearby tonk) and Tonk Mine (plants a mine that does heavy damage to any tonk that runs over it).

{"id": "69490", "revid": "3154973", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69490", "title": "Steam warrior", "text": "Steamwarriors (a.k.a. steam warriors) are &lt;a href=\"mechanic\"&gt;mechanic&lt;/a&gt;s who take their skills to the battlefield by building walking suits of &lt;a href=\"phlogiston\"&gt;phlogiston&lt;/a&gt;-powered armor. Though the armor of most steamwarriors takes on a generally humanoid form, a suit's functions are as individualized as its pilot. The only activity most steamwarriors enjoy more than using their armor in combat is &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;ing with it between battles, improving old functions and adding new ones.\nSome were born to steam, gifted with the measures of mechanics and systems, and possessed with an unquenchable thirst for invention. Among those inventors are individuals who push their creations to the limits of &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt;, testing them in battle, and relying on them for their survival. These are the steam warriors.\nSome might crudely explain that steam warriors are mechanics who trudge from place to place in phlogiston-powered armor. Ask a steam warrior what his calling is, and he'll tell you of the thrill of battle, the sound of metal clashing against monster scales, and the surge of adrenaline as a whirring blade slices through metal, flesh, or bone. To a steam warrior, life is more than just the surge of phlogiston through a steam plant, or the thrum of engines driving weapons of destruction. To a steam warrior, it's all being behind the controls of a massive monolith of powered iron, and seeking to destroy any enemy that crosses his path.\nSteam warriors are often innovative souls who customize and build their own suits of steam-powered armor. Still, many are willing to pay a &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt; his worth in coin to have the armor modified to exacting specifications. While a steam warrior might know the inner workings of his armor intimately, he doesn't need to be a skilled tinker in order to use it. Relying on the expertise of others has become more and more commonplace as gnomish and goblin &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; becomes more available to agents of both the Horde and the Alliance.\nThese gladiators of steam and steel cross the fields of warlike massive &lt;a href=\"myrmidon\"&gt;myrmidon&lt;/a&gt;s, intent on dealing out punishment with any of a variety of weapons strapped to their armor. The excitement of combat, the power at their fingertips, and the massive weapons they wield are motive enough for others to respect their capabilities, but steam warriors go beyond the simple armor they wear.\nIn battle steam warriors are fearless and resolute, capable of enduring the withering fire of musket, spell or arrow. Their skill at piloting their &lt;a href=\"steam%20armor\"&gt;steam armor&lt;/a&gt; allows them to move gracefully and with tremendous speed, reacting faster than one would think possible. While others might simply wear and operate steam armor, steam warriors are their armor, merging with it using a combination of skill and concentration - controlling it as easily as a master swordsman wields his blade.\nSteam Warriors in the World: Steam warriors in Azeroth are a rare and often mercenary sort. As could be expected, the races that are more technologically inclined are the ones most likely to become steam warriors. Among the Alliance, &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; take up the iron mantle of the steam warrior. &lt;a href=\"Gnomish\"&gt;Gnomish&lt;/a&gt; steam warriors tend to be much more involved in the construction and design of their armor, while dwarves are usually more concerned with their armor's weapons. In the end, both prove excellent steam warriors. &lt;a href=\"Human\"&gt;Human&lt;/a&gt;s have been known to become steam warriors as well, although they are quite rare. &lt;a href=\"Elven\"&gt;Elven&lt;/a&gt; steam warriors are almost unheard of.\nAmid the Horde, the few who have the knowledge and inclination to become steam warriors are mostly hired &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; mercenaries, although, oddly enough, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s also seem to take to the life of a steam warrior. &lt;a href=\"Orc\"&gt;Orc&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; rarely find themselves concerned with the mechanical, and thus rarely pursue the steam warrior's path.\nGoblins excel at the craft of steam, and they produce some of the most devastating and cunning steam warriors alive. For a goblin, steam armor is simply an extension of the desire to attain power. Becoming a steam warrior for a goblin is as much a part of attaining status as it is a decent way to make money. These goblin steam warriors hire themselves out for a price, seeking the highest bidder and working with little regard for diplomacy or future relation.\nMany steam warriors form chapters or guilds, congregating in groups and sharing their technical expertise and backing each other up in combat. These cadres often become elite mercenary units serving either the Alliance or Horde or even splitting off to form independent factions willing to serve either affiliation. &lt;a href=\"Goblin\"&gt;Goblin&lt;/a&gt;s are notorious for forming these groups, luring in outsiders, and then stealing their &lt;a href=\"technological\"&gt;technological&lt;/a&gt; expertise for their own use.\nMost of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s denizens view steam warriors with a combined sense of wonder and fear. Steam armor is an impressive and intimidating sight. The sheer strength of the armor, combined with its portable arsenal, is a source of speculation, terror, and awe to those who have never seen such things. Those who have seen steam warriors in action know that the best course is to get out of the way. Whether an ally or an enemy, steam armor has the tendency to harm anyone outside the suit who gets too close.\nMost steam warriors see themselves first as &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s and second as &lt;a href=\"tinker\"&gt;tinker&lt;/a&gt;s. Their armor is built for war, and they enjoy using it as an instrument of battle. Most see themselves as the vanguard of a new era of &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"inventor\"&gt;inventor&lt;/a&gt;s, striding into battle within their phlogiston-powered suits.\nThe steam warrior is not a common sight. Cadres often number less than a dozen, and the resources required to keep armor combat-ready can be significant drain. In the wars plaguing Azeroth, the steam warrior has yet to have made a significant impact \u2014 although many feel that their time is soon to come."}

They cloud its presence with dark magic, to keep it from the Sha'tar.\nFight your way to the Atam'al Terrace outside the Black Temple and turn your eyes to the sky. Shadowlord Deathwail will circle the terrace, beyond your reach. You will have to slay him and his warlocks before you can obtain the crystal.\nIt won't be easy, &lt;name&gt;. I wish you luck.\nProgress.\nYou've returned, &lt;Name&gt;.\nCompletion.\nThe crystal! It's power... now in my hands!\nNotes.\nThe fight will occur at coordinates 71,35. There are 3 elites who are channeling the Heart. If you attack them, they will not move but a wave of non-elites will enter the fight. Once all 3 channelers are dead, Deathwail will drop down and take the Heart. He can fear, deathcoil, and shadowbolt if you stay at range. The Heart will drop off his corpse.\nSome people report that it's possible to land on top of the building with a ranged character and attack the channelers. The wave of non-elites will not \"glitch\" themselves on top of the building to attack you. If you wait long enough, they'll eventually despawn. However, this could be considered an exploit by Blizzard and adventurers should do this at their own risk.\nEdit: This has been fixed by Blizzard, if you attempt to stay on the building, the non-elites will attack from range with bows."}

Cho'gall and his convoy will be traveling through the &lt;a href=\"badlands\"&gt;badlands&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, and an ambush by &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; warriors is expected. The &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;War Chief&lt;/a&gt; expects you to safeguard Cho'gall and his minions through this region. Should he die, your life will be forfeit as well...\"\nBackground.\nThe importance of this mission earned Utok's commander the use of a powerful army, which they assembled before setting out southward along the coastline. Cho'gall and the catapults remained in the rear; the other troops led the way for them. Occasionally Cho'gall would create &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Kilrogg\"&gt;Eyes of Kilrogg&lt;/a&gt; to inspect for them. Soon, they came to the first human defensive wall.\nThe catapults were brought to the front and trained on the enemy &lt;a href=\"ballista\"&gt;ballista&lt;/a&gt;e behind the wall. With that threat removed, the troops set about knocking down a section of wall to slaughter the other defenders. They were constantly ordering them to return to the main group, for their bloodlust kept leading them inland to alarm more enemies. Continuing south along the coast, they encountered a second group of enemies with &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; close by, so they gutted the humans before sinking the ships with their catapults.\nWith their goal in view to the east, they ripped apart a final large group of humans before they marched in and claimed the village for themselves. After Cho'gall had made contact with higher powers on the Circle, their bloodthirsty and frustrated troops were released to wreak havoc wherever they wished. Many did not return.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

May the Light protect you, &lt;name&gt;. \nCompletion.\nYour tenacity and courage are astounding, &lt;priest/priestess&gt;. You have earned the right to hold the Splinter of Nordrassil. Only one task remains: The Eye of Shadow must be recovered. Scour the world.\nNotes.\nThis quest can easily be solo'd as a level 80 priest.\nIn order to accept this quest from Eris Havenfire you will need &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Divinity\"&gt;The Eye of Divinity&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"The%20Eye%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;The Eye of Shadow&lt;/a&gt;. The Eye of Divinity can be found inside the &lt;a href=\"Cache%20of%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Cache of the Firelord&lt;/a&gt; after defeating &lt;a href=\"Majordomo%20Executus\"&gt;Majordomo Executus&lt;/a&gt;, while The Eye of shadow drops from &lt;a href=\"Elite\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Winterspring\"&gt;Winterspring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe biggest roadblock most will encounter is finding a raid capable of defeating Majordomo. All other steps of the quest can be completed solo or with a few pick-ups. \nPreparation.\nGetting all possible buffs before accepting this quest will benefit you greatly, as any help from the outside that does not include killing skeletons will help you. Stocking up on potions and elixirs will also help you, as will other consumables such as &lt;a href=\"Stratholme%20Holy%20Water\"&gt;Stratholme Holy Water&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on gear and player skill, the quest can even be done purely self-buffed (don't forget Inner Fire).\nMore important than buffs is the ability to do the required tasks fast. Custom-configuring the user interface can help a lot. In this quest only 4 spells are needed: Abolish Disease, Flash Heal, Renew and Holy Nova. A useful way to configure the action bar would be:\n Key 1: Inner Focus\n Key 2: Abolish Disease\n Key 3: Flash Heal\n Key 4: Renew\n Key 5: Holy Nova\n Key 6: Major Mana Potion\nUsing the maximum ranks of your spells is not needed as it will get you out of mana pretty fast; the peasants have only around 1500 health, the Flash Heal and Renew used should each heal around half of it.\nYou should be comfortable with this layout before starting. Practice moving while simultaneously casting Abolish Disease, Renew and Holy Nova. \nThe \"V\" key is your friend: it will activate health bars above mobs, making it significantly easier. Unfortunately the bars tend to \"jump\" around the screen a lot. This effect can be minimized by looking directly downwards from far above. Maximizing the \"Max Camera Distance\" in \"Interface Options/Advanced\" also helps. \nTo enable friendly NPC health, you might have to rebind your \"v\" keys from the Options-&gt;Key Bindings control panel. There are 3 separate togglable options that affect this feature. Make sure all 3 are bound to keys (V, Shift-V, Alt-V) and spam all 3 when the fight begins, until you see NPC health bars. \nThe three options are:\nCompleting the quest.\nThere will be 5 waves of around 10 peasants each, the number will slightly increase from wave to wave. The waves will start at the cave entrance and walk slowly down the road. After the script has started, there will be a dome of light on the road 10-20 yards after Eris. If the peasants reach that spot, they are safe. All the way they will be attacked by Skeleton Archers, they don't do much damage, but enough to kill most of the peasants without healing.\nTry to stay cool under pressure, it takes a while, and remember, 14 peasants are allowed to die, that's nearly three per wave. So don't give up early if you make mistakes.\nCaring for the peasants.\nWhile the peasants move from the cave to the light, you should move with them and perform the following, in order of priority:\nThe disease kills the peasants very quickly, thus removing it is most important. Next, peasants who are below 60% of their health should get a flash heal, and finally every peasant should have a renew on him by the time he reaches Eris.\nIt is very important to treat all peasants before they reach Eris. After that, just let them go, Renew will hopefully keep them alive for the rest of the road. Because at that time the next wave will already start, if you don't get back in time, some peasants will surely die from the disease.\nIf you fail the quest in any way, Eris will despawn and you will not be able to accept the quest for 10 minutes.\nCaring for yourself.\nEach wave of peasants is accompanied by increasing numbers (from 4 to 10) of Skeleton Warriors. Either gather up many of them and use &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Nova\"&gt;Holy Nova&lt;/a&gt; to finish them off, or use &lt;a href=\"Oil%20of%20Immolation\"&gt;Oil of Immolation&lt;/a&gt;. This will kill the skeletons allowing you to basically ignore the skeletons and concentrate on the peasants.\nYou can bring a friend to aid you. Of course, they cant see peasants without eyes, but they can help other ways, such as giving buffs and providing auras. Be careful: using friends often causes a demon named &lt;a href=\"The%20Cleaner\"&gt;The Cleaner&lt;/a&gt; to spawn. He hits for 4,000-5,000 a swing, immune to all damage and his sole purpose is to prevent people from \"cheating\", by using other player to help them.\nQuotes during the quest.\n\"Randomly said by a peasant when a new wave of peasants appears:\"\n\"Randomly said by a peasant as it walks towards redemption:\"\n\"Randomly said by a peasant when it has been safely escorted:\"\n\"Said by Eris when more than 15 peasants die (player failing the quest):\"\n\"Said by Eris when enough peasants are saved (player successfully doing the quest):\"\n\"Said by Eris when she is randomly healing the player during the quest:\""}

Much easier, and only a little bit off the road itself.\nSecond, you go to the border between Ashenvale and &lt;a href=\"Azshara%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Azshara&lt;/a&gt;, and swim down the &lt;a href=\"Southfury%20River\"&gt;Southfury River&lt;/a&gt; to the waterfall where it empties out into the ocean. (There is a flight point just inside Azshara, to the south of the road, so this may be worthwhile just to tag the flight point.)\nThird, you may be able to enter the Barrens via the entrance from &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt;. This entails some risk, as avoiding the guards there is harder than via the Rampart.\nAnd fourth, you can go to &lt;a href=\"Booty%20Bay\"&gt;Booty Bay&lt;/a&gt;, and simply take the boat to &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt;, which is where you want to be in the first place. Note that &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt; is a higher level zone, and there is some risk of aggroing critters to the sides of the road.\nNote that there is a flight point in Ratchet that you will want to tag, if you haven't before.\nAnd of course, fifth, if you've been there before and tagged the aforementioned flight point, simply fly there."}

If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the as to your reasoning.\nMany of the drop quests in the Barrens can be completed anywhere, so the progression is very non-linear.\nBarrens is a huge questing hub for the Horde, serving as the second questing zone for &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s, and a good alternative for &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; as well. In addition to being a good 10-20 questing area, it even provides some questing through level 25. There are, however, a few disadvantages to questing in this zone. One is the frequent &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; attacks on the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, the major questing hub. It is never fun to find the quest giver or wind rider dead when you need them. Another disadvantage is the famous &lt;a href=\"Barrens%20Chat\"&gt;Barrens Chat&lt;/a&gt;, which is often full of immature jokes. This can be solved by simply /leaving the chat channel.\nThe Barrens is a large zone with two distinct questing hubs. This questing guide has therefore been divided into two parts:"}

If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the as to your reasoning.\nJourney to the Crossroads.\nQuesting will begin in the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, which is located in the northern half of the Barrens. Tauren will have a bit of a hike to get here, while trolls and orcs should have less trouble coming from &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to get the pull quests for your race before setting out, for a little extra XP.\nThe journey to the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; (the main questing hub of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;) looks a bit different depending on your race and class.\nUndead and Blood Elves.\nWhile undead and blood elves don't have any pull quests into the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, it is most certainly a legitimate questing alternative to &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"The%20Ghostlands\"&gt;The Ghostlands&lt;/a&gt;. However, keep in mind that adventuring in the Barrens will not accumulate &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon%20City\"&gt;Silvermoon City&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt; reputation as quickly as adventuring in their respective zones.\nTo get to the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, these characters should take a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; from the tower outside &lt;a href=\"Undercity\"&gt;Undercity&lt;/a&gt;, arriving just south of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;. Head south along the road until you reach &lt;a href=\"Razor%20Hill\"&gt;Razor Hill&lt;/a&gt;, then turn west. Pass through &lt;a href=\"Far%20Watch%20Post\"&gt;Far Watch Post&lt;/a&gt; and into the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Continue to follow the road west until it forks, then head south. You should arrive at the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Wailing Caverns.\nNow is an excellent time to try the second instance for Horde players: The &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;. You have just completed the prerequisites for the major quest of the instance. All that is left to do is to head to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and complete the quest &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, pick up its follow up quest, &lt;a href=\"Nara%20Wildmane%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Nara Wildmane (quest)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Leaders%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Leaders of the Fang&lt;/a&gt; and also the quest &lt;a href=\"Serpentbloom%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Serpentbloom (quest)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Spirit%20Rise\"&gt;Spirit Rise&lt;/a&gt;. You may also want to complete &lt;a href=\"Raptor%20Horns\"&gt;Raptor Horns&lt;/a&gt; before going in, so as to get the follow up &lt;a href=\"Smart%20Drinks\"&gt;Smart Drinks&lt;/a&gt;. See the &lt;a href=\"Wailing_Caverns%23Quest_guide\"&gt;Wailing Caverns questing guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nWhere to go from here.\nAt this point, you are most likely around level 20. One obvious option for future questing is to continue to the southern Barrens (see the &lt;a href=\"The%20Barrens%20questing%20guide/Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens questing guide&lt;/a&gt;. The southern Barrens is good for question up to around level 27, after which players can quest in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; or move on to a level 30 zone. However, there are several other good areas for questing at this point.\nStonetalon Mountains (LVL 15-27).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; lie to the northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Quests there involve killing, looting, and otherwise interrupting &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; operations in the area; putting an end to night elf activity on the peak; and curbing the harpies of the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to pick up the quests &lt;a href=\"Deepmoss%20Spider%20Eggs\"&gt;Deepmoss Spider Eggs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ziz%20Fizziks%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Ziz Fizziks (quest)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Jin%27Zil%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Letter to Jin'Zil (quest)&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; before heading out. See the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains questing guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nAshenvale (LVL 18-30).\n&lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; forest is the ancestral home of the night elves, and lies to the north of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Quests there involve combating encroaching demons and satyrs, and &lt;a href=\"The%20Ashenvale%20Hunt\"&gt;The Ashenvale Hunt&lt;/a&gt;. Pick up the quest &lt;a href=\"Report%20to%20Kadrak%20%28Barrens%29\"&gt;Report to Kadrak (Barrens)&lt;/a&gt; from the Crossroads and trade it in for &lt;a href=\"The%20Warsong%20Reports\"&gt;The Warsong Reports&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Mor%27shan%20Rampart\"&gt;Mor'shan Rampart&lt;/a&gt; before heading to Ashenvale. See the &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Ashenvale questing guide&lt;/a&gt; for more informarion.\nHillsbrad Foothills (LVL 20-30).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; can be found across the sea in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the quests in this area involve helping the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; become the dominant force in the hills, and crush the human resistance in &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Fields\"&gt;Hillsbrad Fields&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Southshore\"&gt;Southshore&lt;/a&gt;. To that end, players will be sent on various missions which include killing the inhabitants of Hillsbrad and gathering ingredients for a &lt;a href=\"new%20plague\"&gt;new plague&lt;/a&gt;.\nYou likely also have &lt;a href=\"Mura%20Runetotem%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Mura Runetotem (quest)&lt;/a&gt; to turn in the nearby &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;."}

If you know of a better order or method to accomplish this, your input is welcome (in fact, greatly desired). For major changes, feel free to edit, but make a note in the as to your reasoning.\nJourney to Camp Taurajo.\nThe southern &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; is a good option for characters who want to continue their questing in &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, as it usually levels characters up to around the starting level for that zone. In addition, the questing hub &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Taurajo\"&gt;Camp Taurajo&lt;/a&gt; is less often attacked by &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; than the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; is (though it is still a frequent battle site). Most southern Barrens quests involve killing humanoids, so it is also a good place to farm cloth. In addition, this area is ripe with ore veins.\nThis guide assumes characters are coming from the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; and have acquired and completed quests as described in the &lt;a href=\"The%20Barrens%20questing%20guide/Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens questing guide&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhere to go from here.\nAt this point, players are most likely somewhere between level 25 and 30. The best fit for the next questing zone is &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt;, which has a range around 25-35. Other zones are mostly 20-30 or 30-40, which is awkward for characters of this level - either you pick up in the middle of the level range, or you are struggling to complete quests that are too difficult. A few possible zones will be discussed here.\nThousand Needles (LVL 25-35).\n&lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; is an area south of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Quests in this area involve quelling the &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; tribes, keeping the &lt;a href=\"Grimtotem\"&gt;Grimtotem&lt;/a&gt; tauren in check, and running errands for the racers of &lt;a href=\"Mirage%20Raceway\"&gt;Mirage Raceway&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"A%20New%20Ore%20Sample\"&gt;A New Ore Sample&lt;/a&gt; sends players directly to the Needles, while &lt;a href=\"Melor%20Sends%20Word\"&gt;Melor Sends Word&lt;/a&gt; requires a trip to &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt;. There are a few more pull quests available from other zones, so check the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Thousand Needles questing guide&lt;/a&gt; before heading out.\nStonetalon Mountains (LVL 15-27).\nThe &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; lie to the northwest of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. Quests there involve killing, looting, and otherwise interrupting &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; operations in the area; putting an end to night elf activity on the peak; and curbing the harpies of the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. Be sure to pick up the quests &lt;a href=\"Deepmoss%20Spider%20Eggs\"&gt;Deepmoss Spider Eggs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ziz%20Fizziks%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Ziz Fizziks (quest)&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Ratchet\"&gt;Ratchet&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Letter%20to%20Jin%27Zil%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Letter to Jin'Zil (quest)&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt; before heading out. In addition, if you have a group you can defeat the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Outrunners\"&gt;Alliance Outrunners&lt;/a&gt; in the southern barrens to receive a &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Scroll\"&gt;Runed Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, which provides another quest in the mountains. See the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains questing guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nDesolace (LVL 30-40).\nDesolace is a barren wasteland which lies to the northwest. You can reach this area by entering the &lt;a href=\"Stonetalon%20Mountains\"&gt;Stonetalon Mountains&lt;/a&gt; and following the path northwest until you reach &lt;a href=\"Sun%20Rock%20Retreat\"&gt;Sun Rock Retreat&lt;/a&gt;. From there head west through the mountains, and turn southwest once you enter the &lt;a href=\"Charred%20Vale\"&gt;Charred Vale&lt;/a&gt;. You will find a pass through the southern hills which will take you into &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt;. The quests in this area involve killing &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; (and in some cases, befriending them), battling orcs of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt;, and even fighting demons. Pick up &lt;a href=\"The%20Kolkar%20of%20Desolace\"&gt;The Kolkar of Desolace&lt;/a&gt; from in the burrow near the &lt;a href=\"Forgotten%20Pools\"&gt;Forgotten Pools&lt;/a&gt; before heading out. See the &lt;a href=\"Desolace%20questing%20guide\"&gt;Desolace questing guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nOther zones.\nThere are many other possible zones open to players at this point. A short list is as follows:"}

These they placed at the northern opening to impede enemy landing parties. Then their workers went to work in the &lt;a href=\"gold%20mine\"&gt;gold mine&lt;/a&gt;; the resulting flow of income went for training of even more &lt;a href=\"peasant\"&gt;peasant&lt;/a&gt;s. During this time, they gathered all of their forces safely inside the base and brought their ships close to shore with a flying machine overhead to watch for enemy &lt;a href=\"Giant%20turtle%23As%20submarines\"&gt;giant turtles&lt;/a&gt;. With this new threat in mind, they raised a &lt;a href=\"gnomish%20inventor\"&gt;gnomish inventor&lt;/a&gt; laboratory for the construction of more fliers, and eventually their own &lt;a href=\"Submarine\"&gt;submersible craft&lt;/a&gt;. Preparations for defense were completed with several towers along the northern perimeter of town.\nThe next task was to collect &lt;a href=\"oil\"&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; for a naval force. Fliers reported a barren island far to the north with a dark patch on its side, so they loaded up a transport with two ballistae and a peasant in preparation for building on it. By that time they had another flier in the air, which escorted the transport and two &lt;a href=\"oil%20tanker\"&gt;oil tanker&lt;/a&gt;s to the island, approaching it from the west side to avoid detection. After they had landed, a tower was quickly raised on a small patch of flat ground that would allow giant turtles to be spotted and sunk by the ballistae. On the north end of the island, an &lt;a href=\"oil%20refinery\"&gt;oil refinery&lt;/a&gt; was built at the same time as the tankers constructed a platform over the oil. When the task had been completed, a second shipyard went up on the west side of the island and they began constructing submarines at both.\nWhile waiting for the submarines, their ships sailed out to the northeast, escorted by a flier, to remove an enemy oil platform and stop their flow of oil. This would help ensure that the sea remained clear after their subs had their fun sinking ships and turtles. More fliers were constructed as spotters for the subs, and once their naval power had been reduced to flotsam, a &lt;a href=\"foundry\"&gt;foundry&lt;/a&gt; was built for the construction of &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt;s. These vessels were then fitted with the best &lt;a href=\"cannon\"&gt;cannon&lt;/a&gt;s and armor they could make, and a flotilla of six sailed out to pound the enemy coastline.

Their first task was to assemble all of their warships into a tight cluster; then they sent a single fast &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Elven%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyer&lt;/a&gt; south to draw out the enemy ships guarding the way to Caer Darrow. Once those had been eliminated, they decided not to risk doing the same with the traitorous elven destroyers beyond the gauntlet of &lt;a href=\"cannon%20tower\"&gt;cannon tower&lt;/a&gt;s, for they were quite a bit smarter than orcs and would perceive their trap. Instead, two more Horde &lt;a href=\"Destroyer%23Troll%20destroyer\"&gt;destroyers&lt;/a&gt; were drawn out of the other passage to Uther and were sunk, leaving the sea lanes mostly open.\nTheir four &lt;a href=\"transport%20ship\"&gt;transport ship&lt;/a&gt;s were then prepared for a dangerous mission. All unnecessary deck hands were invited to stay safely ashore with the troops. These four ships then set out unescorted toward Uther. They sent their prayers after them, knowing that not all of them would return. As they sailed quickly through the gauntlet, the cannon towers could not reload fast enough to hit them at all; all four arrived, damaged but still sea worthy. Uther boarded the strongest of the four and prepared to sail back. His transport was placed in the middle in the hope that the lead and trailing ships would draw most of the cannon fire. The plan worked, they praised the Gods, but two of the four sank below the waves.\nWith Uther safely among the warships, their entire flotilla set out directly for Caer Darrow. With so many targets, the second gauntlet could not possibly stop them at all. Even the enemy &lt;a href=\"battleship\"&gt;battleship&lt;/a&gt; near their goal was too busy with their warships to notice the transports sneaking past. As soon as Uther's craft landed, he raced for the Circle of Power and stood with upraised hands. Boiling thunderheads soon filled the sky and unleashed bolts of lightning on the traitorous elven crafts, utterly destroying them. With the forces of nature on their side, the remaining Horde forces quickly abandoned their cause and retreated. Milan believed fate had smiled on them once again, and the seed of hope had firmly taken root.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

Repeat the process for the second spire: \nDestroy the third spire to advance to the next stage.\nStage 3: Defeat the Commander.\nArganoth lands in the center of the beach. Again, let the NPCs tank him. He has the same area of effect attacks as the fel lords, so they're easy to dodge.\nAt 75%:\nAt 30%:\nDeath:\nStage 4: Find Varian.\nJaina, Genn, and their troops start running uphill to the north. Keep up.\nAs the party crests the hill, looking over a ridge to the north, the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; itself comes into view. A cutscene shows the environs, where a huge &lt;a href=\"Black%20City\"&gt;demon city&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%27s%20Might\"&gt;wreck&lt;/a&gt; of the Horde &lt;a href=\"gunship\"&gt;gunship&lt;/a&gt; that transported &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; can be seen:\nFollow Genn and Jaina down the hill, dodging the bombardment. If you die here, you will be resurrected by &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Priest%20%28Broken%20Shore%29\"&gt;Alliance Priests&lt;/a&gt; working similarly to those in &lt;a href=\"battleground\"&gt;battleground&lt;/a&gt;s. \nStage 5: Destroy the Portal.\nFinish off the &lt;a href=\"Mo%27arg%20Painbringer\"&gt;Mo'arg Painbringer&lt;/a&gt;, then rush the portal. Another painbringer will run out of the portal, but let the NPCs tank it. Focus instead on the &lt;a href=\"Eredar%20Chaos%20Guard\"&gt;Eredar Chaos Guard&lt;/a&gt;s protecting the &lt;a href=\"Shielded%20Anchor\"&gt;Shielded Anchor&lt;/a&gt;s.\nRandom yells:\nFinish off the last anchor to continue to the next stage.\nStage 6: Raze the Black City.\nFollow the group down the hill.\nAs the party is about to enter the city, many dead &lt;a href=\"Argent%20Dawnbringer\"&gt;Argent Dawnbringer&lt;/a&gt;s can be seen in a gruesome display. They come across a live but wounded one:\nMany of the crusaders are impaled on spikes or put on body piles, but some of them are still alive and can be saved. Start killing demons, freeing trapped crusaders, commandeering unattended cannons, breaking portals, destroying spires, and so on. Don't wander around alone - stick with the friendly NPCs! Freed crusaders will act as guardians to the player. &lt;a href=\"Doom%20Shroom\"&gt;Doom Shroom&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Moongrass\"&gt;Moongrass&lt;/a&gt;es, &lt;a href=\"Chaos%20Clover\"&gt;Chaos Clover&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Bleakthorn\"&gt;Bleakthorn&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Felbloom\"&gt;Felbloom&lt;/a&gt;s are local plants that can be clicked on to provide buffs.\nFill the bar to continue.\nStage 7: The Highlord.\nOn the other side of the cutscene, all players and NPCs have been teleported to Jaina's position near the chasm. She is forming an ice bridge to clear the gap.\nCross the ice bridge and follow the trail of &lt;a href=\"Dessicated%20Crusader\"&gt;Dessicated Crusader&lt;/a&gt;s to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20Approach\"&gt;Tomb Approach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tirion%20Fordring\"&gt;Tirion Fordring&lt;/a&gt;, Gul'dan, and the Horde forces will be there as well.\nStage 8: Krosus.\nKrosus runs through the lava, stopping at the edge of the pool, conveniently in range of melee attacks. As always, let the NPCs tank. The Krosus encounter is a tank-and-spank, and Krosus has a Slam attack that damages enemies within ~10 yards or so, an Orb of Destruction that drops a fireball on a ~30-yard radius area of effect, and a channeled Fel Storm that drops fel fireballs all over the arena for a few seconds. Every 25%, he will swap to face the other faction, and the Alliance gets first crack.\nAt 75%, Krosus turns to attack the Horde.\nAs the Horde were dealing with trash mobs in the first phase, so now will Alliance deal with trash mobs from 75-50%.\nAt 50%, Krosus turns back to face the Alliance.\nRinse and repeat down to 25%:\nClear out the trash mobs, then finish Krosus off.\nFinal Stage: Stop Gul'dan.\nUh-oh, when the game asks for players to have 'Survived', that's a sign things are going to go poorly.\nJaina quickly summons another ice bridge to get up to where Gul'dan was. Just on the other side, Varian and Sylvanas pause for a moment.\nFollow the path up to the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Now, if you approach Gul'dan too much you will be insta-killed by the gaze of &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; himself, with the message \"You feel a staggering presence on the other side of the portal touch you for a moment...\".\nThe two-dozen non-elites attack and are quickly cut down.\nStay alive, let the NPCs tank. After the second wave is defeated...\nThe next wave starts to attack as a cutscene plays, ending the scenario and the quest.\nFinale.\nOn the other side of the scenario, the player is back on the deck of \"&lt;a href=\"the%20Skyfire\"&gt;the Skyfire&lt;/a&gt;\" in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20Harbor\"&gt;Stormwind Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, having recovered from the battle and gotten up from the cot they were laying on. This isn't the case for all the NPCs, as many of the unnamed soldiers that followed the heroes to battle are still laying injured on deck. Something has visibly changed, though: many &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; soldiers are now on board. &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Druid\"&gt;Gilnean Druid&lt;/a&gt;s are taking care of the wounded, &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Footman%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Gilnean Footmen&lt;/a&gt; are standing ready for battle behind &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, and Genn is surrounded by two &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Royal%20Guard%20%28Stormwind%20City%29\"&gt;Gilnean Royal Guards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20Gryphon\"&gt;Gilnean Gryphon&lt;/a&gt;s stand ready to transport adventurers.\nSpeak with Genn to continue.\nCompletion.\nAh, &lt;name&gt;, you're up! I'm relieved you made it out of that bloodbath alive. We lost so many good women and men down there...\n&lt;Genn Greymane clenches his teeth.&gt;\nDamn the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; for serving us up to the Legion!"}

After 20 seconds, the NPCs start talking:\nStage 2: Storm The Beach.\nOnce the cutscene finishes, &lt;a href=\"Captain%20Russo\"&gt;Captain Russo&lt;/a&gt;'s ship is now ashore. On the beach, &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; are each leading small squads of &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Headhunter\"&gt;Darkspear Headhunter&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Witch%20Doctor\"&gt;Darkspear Witch Doctor&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring%20Shaman\"&gt;Earthen Ring Shaman&lt;/a&gt;s.

While on this stage, players gain 5% health every few seconds.\nStage 4: The Banshee Queen.\nHead southwest to where what looks to be the Winter Queen is standing out in the open, as a cutscene begins:\nOn the other side of the cutscene, Sylvanas stands idle, as a boss-level elite. With the player are Kleia, Lord Herne, Niya, and Hunt-Captain Korayn. Should players wait too long to engage her:\nUpon entering Sylvanas' aggro radius, she doesn't attack and the player is struck with the Merciful debuff.\nOne of three things will happen. Attacking Sylvanas will cause her to immediately stun the player:\nAlternatively, if the player has completed &lt;a href=\"Most%20Loyal\"&gt;Most Loyal&lt;/a&gt;:\nIf the player doesn't attack, and allows Merciful to wear off, Sylvanas will still stun the player and say:\nSylvanas jumps back and prepares to enter Banshee Form:\nStage 5: Air Reinforcements.\nHop on the flayedwing to continue.\nStage 6: A Wing and a Slime.\nNow in the vehicle interface, players have access to one ability:\nUse it to take out the &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Realmbinder\"&gt;Mawsworn Realmbinder&lt;/a&gt;s hovering in the area, while &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; casts Sleep at them:\nAfter a bit, Ysera flies in:\nTake out thirty to continue.\nStage 7: To the Top of the Falls.\nThe party lands just in time to see Soulburner Fraxin kill Glittermint.\nTake out Soulbinder Fraxin alongside Draven, Kleia, and Nadja.\nStage 8: Rebirth, in Peril.\nJaina, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris&lt;/a&gt;, and Dreamweaver join in. \nShandris has special gossip:\nAs does Jaina:\nLady Moonberry also has a new gossip response:\nHead south uphill, taking out &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Eradicator\"&gt;Mawsworn Eradicator&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Pillager\"&gt;Pillagers&lt;/a&gt; on the way to the wildseeds in the area, including &lt;a href=\"Asotera\"&gt;Asotera&lt;/a&gt;, Might of Earth; &lt;a href=\"Zoukai\"&gt;Zoukai&lt;/a&gt;, Ancient River; &lt;a href=\"Malorandar\"&gt;Malorandar&lt;/a&gt;, Herald of the Dawn; &lt;a href=\"Thynen\"&gt;Thynen&lt;/a&gt;, Wind of the East; and &lt;a href=\"Darkmute\"&gt;Darkmute&lt;/a&gt;, the Unknowable.\nAs one is saved, a covenant combatant will run up:\nSave four to continue.\nStage 9: The Forest Answers.\nJust east, near the Heart of the Forest, are ghosts of two Rally Point banners. Inside an impassable barrier, the Winter Queen and Ysera are protecting a large number of wildseeds, with the Winter Queen channeling a Cosmic Starfall to shoot winged Mawsworn out of the sky and kill any ground troops that try to flee from her. Interact with both of the banners.\nTo the north:\nTo the south:\nFinal Stage: Breakthrough.\nApproach Sylvanas and the covenant forces:\nThree Mawsworn Realmbreakers pop out of the gateway. Defeat them, then a wave of two &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Invoker\"&gt;Mawsworn Invoker&lt;/a&gt;s and three Mawsworn Eradicators pop out from Maw Portals. Defeat them as well.\nAn elite &lt;a href=\"Mawsworn%20Destroyer\"&gt;Mawsworn Destroyer&lt;/a&gt; pops out. Defeat it, and a three-minute &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20in-game%20cinematics\"&gt;cinematic&lt;/a&gt; plays:\n\"&lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; widens the Maw portal and a gigantic &lt;a href=\"charred%20behemoth\"&gt;charred behemoth&lt;/a&gt; starts walking out of it. The camera cuts to &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Herne\"&gt;Lord Herne&lt;/a&gt; for a moment as his jaw drops before cutting back to the behemoth, which dwarfs Sylvanas as it fully emerges from the portal. It roars, then grunts in pain and falls to the ground, defeated. Confused, Sylvanas narrows her eyes and looks up to spot &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in full &lt;a href=\"Night%20Warrior\"&gt;Night Warrior&lt;/a&gt; form dual-wielding warglaives \u2014 atop the behemoth's corpse. Sylvanas sighs in annoyance.\"\n\"Tyrande narrows her eyes in response.\"\n\"She leaps off the behemoth at Sylvanas.\"\n\"Drawing her warglaives, Tyrande launches a flurry of attacks at Sylvanas, who in turn dodges, ducks, dips, dives and dodges out of the way. Leaping upward, Sylvanas takes advantage of the few seconds to draw her blades and starts parrying attacks. Tyrande has the advantage, as Sylvanas keeps getting pushed back. With a big blow, Tyrande launches Sylvanas some thirty yards away. Sylvanas rights herself midair and lands on her hands and knees, immediately getting to her feet and launching chains that capture Tyrande.\"\n\"Sylvanas smirks.\"\n\"Tyrande flexes her arms, dispelling the chains and getting back into her stance.\"\n\"This wipes the smirk off Sylvanas's face, as she whispers to herself.\"\n\"The predatory grin appears on Tyrande's face this time.\"\n\"Tyrande launches another attack, firing off both warglaives at Sylvanas, which explode at her feet in a cloud of dust. Sylvanas leaps out of the cloud and fires off some arrows in response. As Tyrande backflips out of the line of fire, a horn bellows in the distance, interrupting both combatants. Lord Herne yells offscreen as Tyrande turns to look in his direction.\"\n\"The Wild Hunt take off at a sprint in the direction of the &lt;a href=\"Heart%20of%20the%20Forest\"&gt;Heart of the Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Realizing, Tyrande hardens her face.\"\n\"Behind Tyrande's back, Sylvanas rockets away in banshee form.\"\n\"Tyrande gets to one knee.\"\n\"In &lt;a href=\"Darnassian\"&gt;Darnassian&lt;/a&gt;, she continues:\"\n\"A cloud of white gathers around Tyrande as she LEAPS from the ground, instantly outpacing Sylvanas. Sylvanas turns her head back to look for a moment before Tyrande catches her, and the ensuing explosion whites out the sky for a second. Bear-hugging Sylvanas, the two of them crash into the ground, skidding to a stop. Astride Sylvanas's torso, Tyrande pours strength into her hands in an attempt to break the Banshee's neck.\"\n\"However, the cosmic tattoos on Tyrande start fading... Sylvanas strains as she lets out a choked breath, then starts smiling.\"\n\"Sylvanas's hands pull Tyrande's away from her neck.\"\n\"Tyrande's voice cracks under the strain.\"\n\"Sylvanas smirks in response until a shadow covers the area and the flaps of wings are heard. Sylvanas instantly shifts back into her smoke form to launch herself 30 yards away, just in time for &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to land and roar at her. Sylvanas, less sure of herself now:\"\n\"Sylvanas shifts into smoke form one last time and exits the area. Ysera, still in dragon form, turns around to focus her attention on Tyrande. Offscreen, Ysera shifts back into her humanoid form and grabs Tyrande by the shoulders.\"\n\"The screen cuts to black.\"\nFinale.\nOn the other side of the cinematic, outside of the scenario, the covenant combatants have gathered in a large circle around &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; and Ysera. Tyrande has the Power of the Night. Turn in to Lady Moonberry.\nShandris has gossip:\nOn complete:\nPTR version.\nAlliance/Saurfang-aligned Horde:\nCompleted &lt;a href=\"Most%20Loyal\"&gt;Most Loyal&lt;/a&gt;:\nWe have driven the invaders from Ardenweald.

It may be necessary to use multiple tanks to hold aggro consistently through Terrifying Roar and Berserker Charge. Otherwise, as long as the group has sufficient healing, the fight should be a simple one.\nIn order to free Finkle and have a chance at &lt;a href=\"Pristine%20Hide%20of%20the%20Beast\"&gt;Pristine Hide of the Beast&lt;/a&gt;, the group will need a member with 310 skinning. Since the maximum in \"\" is 300, this means that the skinner must have either &lt;a href=\"Finkle%27s%20Skinner\"&gt;Finkle's Skinner&lt;/a&gt; (from the Beast itself) or &lt;a href=\"Zulian%20Slicer\"&gt;Zulian Slicer&lt;/a&gt; (from &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt;).\nIn Hearthstone.\nThe Beast appears as in \"&lt;a href=\"Hearthstone%20%28game%29\"&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/a&gt;\".

Will the duo succeed in freeing the furbolgs from the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic that curses them? Plus, &lt;a href=\"Valeera%20Sanguinar\"&gt;Valeera&lt;/a&gt; continues tracking the mysterious figure who follows Lo'Gosh from the shadows.\nPlot.\nWhile traveling to Thistlefur Hold atop &lt;a href=\"Sharptalon\"&gt;Sharptalon&lt;/a&gt;, Broll and Lo'Gosh are attacked by a group of harpies. While trying to fight off the creatures, Broll complains that Lo'Gosh is getting in the way of being able to swing his staff. The &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Broll use some of his other weapons such as calling on wind, but the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; is angered by the suggestion of unleashing his rage when the fel emanations from the nearby &lt;a href=\"Idol%20of%20Remulos\"&gt;Idol of Remulos&lt;/a&gt; is already threatening his stability. Broll proceeds to instead leap off Sharptalon and grab a nearby harpy by her leg to drag her down to the ground and kill her. Meanwhile, a group of &lt;a href=\"Thistlefur%20tribe\"&gt;Thistlefur&lt;/a&gt; furbolgs apparently pursuing the harpies arrive to the scene and also begin fighting the harpies until the winged creatures are forced to flee.\nThe furbolgs ask Broll and Lo'Gosh what they are doing near Thistlefur Hold. Broll replies in &lt;a href=\"Furbolg%20%28language%29\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt;, explaining that he and his companion are searching for the Idol of Remulos. The furbolgs immediately become enraged and attack the pair, accusing them of being thieves out to steal the Thistlefur's treasure. Broll summons myriads of spiked roots from the ground that entangle both the furbolgs and Lo'Gosh. In response, one of the furbolg &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; begins calling upon the element of fire to free himself, while Lo'Gosh yells at Broll to not let the idol's fel corruption overtake him the way it has the furbolgs. Coming to his senses, the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; punches the furbolg shaman to interrupt him, then frees Lo'Gosh from the roots and calls on Sharptalon to carry him and the human away from the site before the furbolgs also break free.\nLo'Gosh asks why they can't simply explain the situation to the furbolgs. Broll explains that once consumed by the idol's influence, the furbolgs can only feel, not think, fueling their rage until they are overwhelmed by it. Upon approaching the entrance to Thistlefur Hold, Broll can feel the idol calling to him from deep within the cave, while Lo'Gosh is only able to notice a distant sense of wrongness. The druid explains that the artifact has been doubly attuned to him, first by &lt;a href=\"Remulos\"&gt;Remulos&lt;/a&gt; and then by &lt;a href=\"Azgalor\"&gt;Azgalor&lt;/a&gt;'s demonic magic, and that the closer he gets to it, the more its fel energies pull him toward madness.\nWhile the furbolgs are holding a feast celebrating their victory over the harpies, Broll creates a back entrance into Thistlefur by summoning roots that surge through the ground, ripping open a hole into one of the hold's tunnels. Broll makes Lo'Gosh promise to destroy the idol if anything goes wrong. When the pair jump down into the cave, they are immediately noticed by a group of furbolgs, but Broll calls on one of the huge roots to seal off that part of the tunnel. The human and night elf then approach the idol, which is sitting atop a dais. Broll senses something wrong with the artifact. Upon reaching out to touch it, he is immediately flung backwards while a new threat appears in the cave: &lt;a href=\"Eranikus\"&gt;the green dragon&lt;/a&gt; attuned to the idol, seething with fel energy.\nWhile Lo'Gosh tries to keep the dragon distracted, Broll grabs hold of the idol to enter the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. There, he becomes surrounded by fel energy and relives the horror he felt when the idol was corrupted, his despair when he watched his daughter &lt;a href=\"Anessa\"&gt;Anessa&lt;/a&gt; die, his helplessness to change the past, and finally a rage so intense it manifests as a &lt;a href=\"bear\"&gt;bear&lt;/a&gt; spirit that attacks him. He now finally understands why the bear stayed with him even as the other animal spirits abandoned him. Realizing that he has become a father that his daughter wouldn't recognize, Broll resolves to walk that path no longer. The other spirits \u2014 &lt;a href=\"panther\"&gt;panther&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"stag\"&gt;stag&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"seal\"&gt;seal&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"storm%20crow\"&gt;storm crow&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 arrive to aid Broll in his confrontation with the bear, who yells that the other spirits can do nothing for the druid and that only rage can insulate him from his pain. Broll replies that the spirit form must not control the druid and that the druid houses the spirit forms; in this he failed, but he will not fail again, and the bear rules him no longer. The bear is the embodiment of Broll's soul, despoiled by fel and sullied by pain and rage, but with the other spirits' aid, the balance in them will be restored. As the stag spirit hands Broll his staff, he declares that he rejects the rage of his past and tells his soul to be at peace. The bear roars a final time before dissipating.\nBack in the cave, Lo'Gosh's battle with the dragon ends abruptly when the creature suddenly cries out and vanishes. Meanwhile, the furbolgs manage to cut their way into the chamber and prepare to attack the intruders. Lo'Gosh raises his sword to destroy the idol, but is interrupted when the statue is suddenly purified and Broll wakes up, declaring that he has cleansed the idol and regained his true self. The furbolgs' rage dissipates as they too come to their senses. They thank the human and night elf for releasing them from the idol's corruption, and ask them to take the statue with them; the furbolgs want it among them no longer.\nThe next day, Broll and Lo'Gosh fly toward &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; atop Sharptalon, having received a request from &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; to bring the restored idol to him."}

Stay very close to the wall without touching or hugging it, as this will slow down your running speed. The wolf should be a short distance behind you at all times, but out of melee range. After running about 1.5 times around the stage, the debuff will wear off and the wolf will most likely run back to the tank as long as sufficient aggro was generated.\nQuotes.\nReturn to Karazhan.\nUgh.

However, once the player gets knocked off of the gryphon, it becomes a regular fight. The Static Flux targets a location on the ground, not the player, so move before it explodes.

Druids are able to perform each of the three group &lt;a href=\"role\"&gt;role&lt;/a&gt;s (&lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;ing, &lt;a href=\"Healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;dealing damage&lt;/a&gt;) by utilizing their &lt;a href=\"shapeshift\"&gt;shapeshift&lt;/a&gt; forms. While a druid is most effective in the role determined by their active &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt; and equipment, they can also use their shapeshifting abilities to temporarily switch to a different role in combat. In addition to combat forms, druids can shapeshift into forms that increases movement speed while &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;running&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Aquatic%20Form\"&gt;swimming&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Flight%20Form\"&gt;flying&lt;/a&gt;. The ability to switch roles out of combat - and temporarily perform a different role in combat - makes the druid class one of the most versatile in \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\".\nDruids have as many faces to them as nature itself: destruction, animal fury, transformation, healing. Everything about them is rooted in cycles and transience, and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; of what &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; would have been with nature unfettered.\n&lt;a href=\"Nature\"&gt;Nature&lt;/a&gt; magic serves as the source of power for druids, as they are guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life. It is no secret that &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; alike can call upon &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"moonlight\"&gt;moonlight&lt;/a&gt; magic, or Mu'sha as she is called in &lt;a href=\"tauren%20mythology\"&gt;tauren mythology&lt;/a&gt;. They also used &lt;a href=\"solar%20magic\"&gt;solar magic&lt;/a&gt;, a form of &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt; magic practiced through the use of solar energy, the radiant energy emitted by the &lt;a href=\"sun\"&gt;sun&lt;/a&gt;s.\nClass overview.\n\"Guardians of nature who seek to preserve balance and protect life, Druids have unmatched versatility on the field of battle. This is in part because druidism is much more than a fighting discipline\u2014it\u2019s a way of life steeped in traditions so ancient that even the origin of their kind is preserved largely in mythology passed on through millennia.\"\n\"Druids harness nature\u2019s raw energy for an incredible breadth of offensive and defensive abilities, as well as to restore life to the wounded. Through communion with nature and the demigod Cenarius, Lord of the Forest, Druids are supernaturally endowed with the gift of shapeshifting, allowing them to take the form of all manner of nature\u2019s creature and access powers as distinct as they are diverse.\"\nGame Guide.\n\"Druids harness the vast powers of nature to preserve balance and protect life. With experience, druids can unleash nature\u2019s raw energy against their enemies, raining celestial fury on them from a great distance, binding them with enchanted vines, or ensnaring them in unrelenting cyclones. Druids can also direct this power to heal wounds and restore life to fallen allies. They are deeply in tune with the animal spirits of Azeroth. As master shapeshifters, druids can take on the forms of a variety of beasts, morphing into a bear, cat, storm crow, or sea lion with ease. This flexibility allows them to fill different roles during their adventures, tearing enemies to shreds one minute and surveying the battlefield from the sky the next. These keepers of the natural order are among the most versatile heroes in Azeroth, and they must be prepared to adjust to new challenges on a moment\u2019s notice.\"\nCreation screen description.\n\"Druids live in a state of unparalleled union with nature. Tightly bound to the plant and animal kingdoms, they are natural shapeshifters, and so they know firsthand the abuse visited on their wild brethren. In consequence, despite their numbers, druids tend to be wary, reclusive, and difficult to spot. Few outsiders have plumbed the depths of their secrets.\"\nClassic guide.\n\"Druids call upon the versatility of nature to empower themselves, assuming the forms of primal beasts, summoning celestial energy, and channeling the restorative properties of the wilds to aid their allies.\"\nBackground.\nThe demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; originally gave guidance to and lived amongst the nomadic &lt;a href=\"yaungol\"&gt;yaungol&lt;/a&gt; in the grassy plains of central Kalimdor between the 12,000 and 11,900 &lt;a href=\"BDP\"&gt;BDP&lt;/a&gt;. To them he taught the secrets of the wilds and of druidic magic. This later resulted in &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20mythology\"&gt;mythology&lt;/a&gt; telling how they had been instructed themselves as the first druids by Cenarius, thought that was only a reinterpretation of what had happened to their ancestors. \nWith the rise of the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, a few of them learned in turn of Cenarius, and those left touched and changed, some even becoming so transformed by his teachings that they instead chose to join the demigod in the protection of his realm. Those were no longer elves, but woodland guardians physically altered forever. But of all these followers, none of them truly followed the path Cenarius had for them until &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;. The young prodigy revealed himself to be the first with the possible aptitude and will to truly understand how to wield the forces inherent in all nature, to become the first real mortal druid on Azeroth and to walk the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. Others such as &lt;a href=\"Valewalker%20Farodin\"&gt;Valewalker Farodin&lt;/a&gt; had dabbled in nature magic before, but without being true druids themselves.\nMalfurion would lead the night elves through the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; and the long years that followed. With the creation of the &lt;a href=\"World%20Tree\"&gt;World Tree&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;, the kaldorei druids were bound to &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and her realm, the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, in which they spent centuries of their immortal lives. The &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; was eventually formed as the governing society of druids, based in sacred &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;. \nLocked in slumber in their &lt;a href=\"barrow%20den\"&gt;barrow den&lt;/a&gt;s for generations, the druids awoke to meet the threat of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; during its recent invasion. The Legion's attack left a terrible scar on the natural order and, after &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde&lt;/a&gt;'s defeat, the druids chose to remain in the waking world and help rebuild their shattered lands. \nThe night elf druids were recently joined in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; druids. It is not clear from the current game content if the tauren learned druidism separately from the night elves or if they were taught by the night elves. Conflicting information in the &lt;a href=\"Warcraft%20universe\"&gt;Warcraft universe&lt;/a&gt; further exacerbates the confusion. Either way, the tauren and the night elf druids do not participate in the Alliance/Horde conflict, but coexist peacefully within the Cenarion Circle.\nThe Gilnean druids were called &lt;a href=\"harvest-witch\"&gt;harvest-witch&lt;/a&gt;es and &lt;a href=\"Celestine%20of%20the%20Harvest\"&gt;Celestine&lt;/a&gt; also refers to her druidic order as \"keepers of the old ways\". The harvest-witches would use their primitive druidic skills to cultivate crops, but almost \"died out\" as Gilneas developed, though, when the nation fell into famine, it was the druids who, as Celestine claims, \"called upon the earth's blessing and restored the harvest\". When &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt; was founded by Gilnean sailors, it is possible that some harvest-witches brought some of their teachings, but modern Kul Tiran druids claim only the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt; as the source of their druidry, who says some of his people became part of human society and their descendants hear the \"call of the wild\".\nDruids belong to many different &lt;a href=\"druid%20organizations\"&gt;organizations&lt;/a&gt; or sects including the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Expedition\"&gt;Cenarion Expedition&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Druids of the Claw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Talon\"&gt;Druids of the Talon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Fang\"&gt;Druids of the Fang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Grove\"&gt;Druids of the Grove&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Antler\"&gt;Druids of the Antler&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;.\nIt usually takes most druids a brief time to shapeshift, and rarely can it be done in a few seconds. Druids generally cannot speak while in their animal forms, but there are some exceptions. For example, &lt;a href=\"Gaivan%20Shadewalker\"&gt;Gaivan Shadewalker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archdruid%20Glaidalis\"&gt;Archdruid Glaidalis&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Tradewind\"&gt;Arthur Tradewind&lt;/a&gt; are all able to speak while shapeshifted. This may be possible through alternative, magical means of communication, similar to how jawless undead are capable of speech.\nWarcraft Encyclopedia.\nDruids come and go as they please, and their goals typically have little to do with the \"civilized\" world. Unaffiliated with any specific government, the primary druidic organization on Azeroth, the Cenarion Circle, answers to no one save itself. The highest rank that a druid can have is that of '&lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt;', and there are only a few archdruids on Azeroth. At the moment the Cenarion Circle's leader is Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage, also the first mortal druid on Azeroth.\nThrough their deep connection to life and nature, druids are able to take on an unusually large variety of roles. Probably a druid's best-known role is that of a healer. Druids are justly famed for their ability to restore life, cure poisonous wounds and remove curses. Indeed, restoring and protecting the planet is one of the top priorities for all druids, however, restoring life comes with a price. Even the newest druid understands that life cannot simply be created from nothing and must ask nature to sacrifice their life essence in order to transfer that life essence to the people and plants being healed. However, to regard a druid as merely a healer is a dangerously simplistic assumption that has led to the defeat of many an unwary foe.\nA druid's empathy with the creatures of the wild also allows him to shapeshift into the forms of other animals. For example, a wounded druid whose magical energies are running low might abruptly take on the form of a bear in order to better withstand further injury. Alternatively, the druid might shift into the form of some large cat, sneak up behind an enemy, then pounce and deliver a fierce flurry of melee attacks. Even the deepest oceans can be explored by a druid, who can simply shift into an aquatic creature, allowing him to stay underwater as long as needed.\nUntil the end of the Third War, druids periodically visited the Emerald Dream to monitor the ebb and flow of life on Azeroth. Today such a visit has become more difficult due to Nordrassil's poor health. Druids possess a deep understanding of the way in which all living things depend upon one another. Whenever this delicate equilibrium is disrupted, the druid works to restore the balance. To that end, a druid can use his connection with the Emerald Dream to exert a calming influence over animals, even forcing some into a temporary state of hibernation. Just as the druid can wield peace and somnolence, the druid can tap into the fury of nature itself: terrible storms have responded to a druid's call; thorns have sprouted from the druid's skin to wound his attackers; even previously harmless roots have grown up out of the soil at greatly accelerated speeds in order to entangle a foe.\nFor obvious reasons, druids thrive in the wild outdoors. Inevitably, however, they lose some of their effectiveness when they are forced to endure separation from the natural environment. What good is a cleansing rain when a druid cannot even see the sky? How are roots to capture a foe who is standing atop a high tower? Such cases clearly require a druid with the imagination to consider new strategies and the flexibility to carry them out.\nYet this flexibility, too, comes with an underlying negative corollary. The druid tends to be a jack-of-all-trades, but a master of none. An unusual mixture of priest, rogue, and warrior, the druid is therefore not equal to any of these three classes in their particular specialties. Even so, the druids' incredible adaptability serves them well in confronting the challenges that Azeroth has to offer.\nRaces.\nThe druid class can be played by the following races:\nNote about races.\nDruids utilize various forms for each specialization, and each race has a different looking skin for their forms (&lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;Moonkin&lt;/a&gt;). The Bear and Cat forms also are colored based on hair color, so if you are not interested in choosing based on min/max abilities, you may want to research the looks of each of these forms, given that you will spend a considerable amount of time in these forms, without transmogrification options.\nRacial abilities.\nThese are some of the &lt;a href=\"racial%20trait\"&gt;racial trait&lt;/a&gt;s relevant to druids:\nIn terms of max/min, Night Elves are best for tanking and PvP for the Alliance side.\nIn terms of max/min, Worgen are best for DPS and healing for the Alliance side.\nIn terms of max/min, tauren are best for tanking and PvP for the Horde side.\nIn terms of max/min, Trolls are best for DPS and healing for the Horde side.\nSpecializations.\nDruids are the only class that has four &lt;a href=\"specialization\"&gt;specialization&lt;/a&gt;s, which are:\nBalance.\n Can take on the form of a powerful Moonkin, balancing the power of Arcane and Nature magic to destroy enemies at a distance.\nBalance druids focus on dealing &lt;a href=\"Caster\"&gt;ranged magical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage&lt;/a&gt;, with an array of signature abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Starsurge\"&gt;Starsurge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sunfire\"&gt;Sunfire&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Solar%20Beam\"&gt;Solar Beam&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt;. Balance druids use &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;Moonkin Form&lt;/a&gt; to increase their damage dealt, protect them from harm and grant spell &lt;a href=\"haste\"&gt;haste&lt;/a&gt; to themselves and their party. As well as granting Balance druids a distinctive &lt;a href=\"Owlkin\"&gt;Owlkin&lt;/a&gt; appearance (although this can be changed with &lt;a href=\"Glyph%20of%20Stars\"&gt;Glyph of Stars&lt;/a&gt;), this form has also gained Balance druids nicknames such as \"Boomkin\", reflecting their potential for extremely high damage output.\nAs of the \"Legion\" expansion, Balance druids no longer primarily use mana as a resource. Instead, using their spells such as &lt;a href=\"Moonfire\"&gt;Moonfire&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Solar%20Wrath\"&gt;Solar Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, they generate &lt;a href=\"Astral%20Power\"&gt;Astral Power&lt;/a&gt;, which is used to cast the abilities &lt;a href=\"Starsurge\"&gt;Starsurge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt;.\n\"The elements that carve form into the universe are fluid forces of nature. Some beings seek to bend the power of these natural elements to their will. Druids, however, worship the protecting spirits of nature. Long ago, nature\u2019s equilibrium was thrown out of balance, leaving the world vulnerable to catastrophic events, including the first invasion of the Burning Legion.\"\n\"By leveraging the sacred powers of the moon, the sun, and the stars, balance druids access arcane and nature magics\u2014made more potent still through shapeshifting, when the spellcaster takes the form of the moonkin\u2014to aid in the fight against imbalance that threatens the natural order of all things.\"\nFeral.\n Takes on the form of a great cat to deal damage with bleeds and bites.\nFeral druids are powerful feline &lt;a href=\"melee\"&gt;melee&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Damage%20%28role%29\"&gt;damage-dealers&lt;/a&gt;, using &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt; to deal swift and savage damage to their enemies. They have much in common with &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s, using &lt;a href=\"energy\"&gt;energy&lt;/a&gt; to fuel their attacks and &lt;a href=\"combo%20point\"&gt;combo point&lt;/a&gt;s to build to deadly &lt;a href=\"finishing%20move\"&gt;finishing move&lt;/a&gt;s. Like rogues, Feral druids are extremely agile, and can use &lt;a href=\"Prowl\"&gt;Prowl&lt;/a&gt; to sneak around and &lt;a href=\"Pounce\"&gt;Pounce&lt;/a&gt; on enemies when they least expect it. Feral druids are often called \"Cat\", \"Kitten\" or \"Kitty\", these affectionate nicknames belying their formidable ferocity.\n\"Feral druids also seek to curb imbalance in nature. They observe the fantastic intricacies of the physical world and the delicate fabric in which all living creatures are given purpose. Whether on land or in the sea, in a lush jungle or an uncultivated desert, death is part of the cycle which sustains life. Nature is an eternal dance between predator and prey.\"\n\"As a shapeshifter, the feral druid endlessly pursues a greater understanding of this truth. They seek a visceral connection to the wild, and in combat take the form of a deadly feline predator. Feral druids become ferocious, agile stalkers\u2014ripping, biting, and bleeding their enemies dry. The forces of chaos are tamed by the druid\u2019s primal fury.\"\nGuardian.\n Takes on the form of a mighty bear to absorb damage and protect allies.\nGuardian druids are indomitable &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s, using the strength of &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; to become a towering, snarling wall between themselves and their allies. Similar to Protection &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, Guardian druids use &lt;a href=\"rage\"&gt;rage&lt;/a&gt; to fuel their abilities, mauling and mangling their enemies and transforming their rage into health with &lt;a href=\"Frenzied%20Regeneration\"&gt;Frenzied Regeneration&lt;/a&gt;. Guardian druids' Bear Form is improved with &lt;a href=\"Thick%20Hide%20%28druid%20talent%29\"&gt;Thick Hide (druid talent)&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to square up to the most formidable of foes. Guardian druids are often known simply as \"Bears\".\n\"Like their feral brothers and sisters, guardian druids attune themselves to nature through the animal kingdom. They commune with the wild to understand how life perseveres through adversity. They know that the creatures who survive are often those built to best protect themselves and their kin. In this, the guardian druid finds a deep and harmonious value in the steadfast\u2014all the while recognizing that sturdiness requires an aggressive stance when danger comes near.\"\n\"Taking the form of a great bear, the guardian druid becomes a massive wall of fur, claw, tooth, and rage, aided by the forces of nature, standing between allies and any opposing threats.\"\nRestoration.\n Uses heal-over-time Nature spells to keep allies alive.\nRestoration druids are capable &lt;a href=\"healer%20%28role%29\"&gt;healers&lt;/a&gt;, specializing in restoring their allies' health through &lt;a href=\"heal%20over%20time\"&gt;heal over time&lt;/a&gt; effects. Restoration druids possess a range of healing options, from direct healing to more sophisticated buffs such as &lt;a href=\"Living%20Seed\"&gt;Living Seed&lt;/a&gt;, with abilities such as &lt;a href=\"Nourish\"&gt;Nourish&lt;/a&gt; offering synergistic effects, and can also dispel with &lt;a href=\"Nature%27s%20Cure\"&gt;Nature's Cure&lt;/a&gt;. Restoration druids are capable of healing allies without the use of a special shapeshift form, but with the talent &lt;a href=\"Incarnation\"&gt;Incarnation&lt;/a&gt; can take on the form of the Tree of Life.\n\"The many gifts provided by nature must sometimes be reciprocated. Restoration druids seek order in the world by tending directly to its many life forms. Friend to flora and fauna alike, restoration druids celebrate birth and growth. Where there is decay, they bring rejuvenation. Where there is abatement, they summon regrowth. Life not only needs protection\u2014it needs nourishment.\"\n\"To foster this harmony, the restoration druid builds a bond with the things that grow, gaining inspiration from the flower\u2019s bloom, the seed\u2019s sprout, the mushroom\u2019s spores, and the tree\u2019s growth. Like nature, the restoration druid perseveres through patience and persistence, the foundation upon which all life is built and sustained. They use this power to mend wounds and provide persistent remedies that keep their allies from falling.\"\nAbilities.\nDruids have a range of magical and physical abilities. While each specialization focuses on strengthening a particular area of a druid's repertoire, all druids are capable of using &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt;, dealing physical and ranged magical damage, healing targets and using numerous other abilities.\nSome signature druid abilities:\nShapeshifting.\nThe druid's most notable ability is shapeshifting into different forms. These following forms can be obtained when reaching a certain level: &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;Moonkin Form&lt;/a&gt; (Balance specialization only), &lt;a href=\"Cat%20Form\"&gt;Cat Form&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Travel%20Form\"&gt;Travel Form&lt;/a&gt; (which increases speed in a form appropriate to the location used, whether it be land, water, or flying allowed).\nMany abilities are restricted to a certain form. Others have different forms or effects depending on the druid's form when it is used. Because Cat Form and Bear Form use energy and rage, respectively, rather than mana, druid abilities that use mana cannot be used by druids when they are in these forms. However, druids can quickly shift between forms to gain access to desired abilities.\nFor all forms, the following applies:\nIf you shapeshift while wearing any &lt;a href=\"disguise\"&gt;disguise&lt;/a&gt;, your form buff will remove the disguise buff. This is because it has a blanket effect and can cause unexpected bugs when two buffs are stacked. Items like the &lt;a href=\"Noggenfogger%20Elixir\"&gt;Noggenfogger Elixir&lt;/a&gt; were changed in 2007 to not stack with Druid forms so that it would not cause any future problems. Subsequent issues have arisen, such as the jet-pack required for &lt;a href=\"Gunship%20Battle\"&gt;Gunship Battle&lt;/a&gt;, giving the message \"Cannot use whilst shape-shifted\". This can make completing some achievements more challenging for feral and balance druids, such as &lt;a href=\"With%20a%20Little%20Helper%20from%20My%20Friends\"&gt;With a Little Helper from My Friends&lt;/a&gt;, requiring creative thinking such as spending the battles as a gunner in &lt;a href=\"Wintergrasp\"&gt;Wintergrasp&lt;/a&gt;.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"5.0.4\"&gt;5.0.4&lt;/a&gt;, druids can mount while in &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;Moonkin Form&lt;/a&gt;.\nGear.\nDruids are able to wear &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"armor\"&gt;armor&lt;/a&gt; only, and gain additional benefits from wearing completely leather. \nDruids can equip &lt;a href=\"staves\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"dagger\"&gt;dagger&lt;/a&gt;s, one-handed or two-handed &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"fist%20weapon\"&gt;fist weapon&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;s. \"Held in off-hand\" items can still be used, but they cannot &lt;a href=\"dual%20wield\"&gt;dual wield&lt;/a&gt;. \nIn the RPG.\nDruids are keepers of the world who walk the path of nature following the wisdom of the Ancients and Cenarius, healing and nurturing the world. To a druid, nature is a delicate balance of actions in which even the smallest imbalance can create storming turmoil from peaceful skies. Druids draw their power from this wild energy using it to change their shapes and command the forces of nature. Traditionally, druids chose the path of a specific animal totem, however, since the invasion of the Burning Legion, most druids have undergone a number of reforms including encouraging the study of magic from all totems. Druids who do this are known as &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;druids of the wild&lt;/a&gt;."}

{"id": "229094", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=229094", "title": "Druid of the Claw (Warcraft III)", "text": "These ancient &lt;a href=\"Druid\"&gt;Druid&lt;/a&gt;s have adopted the totem of the bear and use the powers of their totem to defend their society from any external threats. They are fond of assuming Bear Form and roaming in seclusion throughout the wildlands of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. When riled, the Druids of the Claw display ferocious power and stamina. Their magical spells augment their allies' fighting skills and bravery as well. \nInformation.\nDruids of the Claw are mixed units. In &lt;a href=\"%23Bear%20Form\"&gt;Bear Form&lt;/a&gt; they are an advanced melee unit such as an &lt;a href=\"Abomination%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Abomination&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Knight%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Knight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tauren&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;a href=\"%23Night%20Elf%20Form\"&gt;Night Elf Form&lt;/a&gt; they are a spell caster such as a &lt;a href=\"Priest%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sorceress%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Sorceress&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Shaman%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Shaman&lt;/a&gt;. Druids of the Claw are initially in Night Elf Form. You must research &lt;a href=\"%23Upgrades\"&gt;Druid of the Claw Master Training&lt;/a&gt; to turn into Bear Form. Druids of the Claw are very useful additions to your army in both forms. In Bear Form they can be up front tanking as a melee unit while Druids of the Claw in Night Elf Form take up the rear casting Rejuvenation and Roar.\nAfter you have upgraded to &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Ages%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tree of Ages&lt;/a&gt; build an &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20Lore%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ancient of Lore&lt;/a&gt; which you can use for &lt;a href=\"Dryad%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Dryads&lt;/a&gt; and Druids of the Claw. Build one Druid of the Claw and send him to your army and use &lt;a href=\"%23Roar\"&gt;Roar&lt;/a&gt;. Roar gives a 25% bonus to damage to all of the units in the area with only one cast. You may have to pack units tightly into a small area to have Roar cover them all since it has a small area of effect when cast.\nIf you plan to build a lot of Druids of the Claw it can be very difficult to transition to them. It's far more challenging to upgrade to Bears than Knights, Tauren, or Abominations. One possible option is to just create a Hero and use it to harass the enemy early on while you upgrade straight up to Bears. To do this build a &lt;a href=\"Hunter%27s%20Hall%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Hunter's Hall&lt;/a&gt; and no &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20War%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ancient of War&lt;/a&gt; and then lay down two &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20Lore%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Ancients of Lore&lt;/a&gt; once you reach &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Ages\"&gt;Tree of Ages&lt;/a&gt;. Then continue to upgrade to &lt;a href=\"Tree%20of%20Eternity%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Tree of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; and research &lt;a href=\"%23Upgrades\"&gt;Adept&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"%23Upgrades\"&gt;Mastery&lt;/a&gt; upgrades. This can work if you can confuse and harass the enemy until you get upgraded while keeping them away from your town. Another option is to make a bunch of &lt;a href=\"Archer%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Archers&lt;/a&gt; without upgrades and use them until you can convert to Bears. Another option is to play normally but go get an expansion pretty early. Build lots of &lt;a href=\"Moon%20Well%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Moon Wells&lt;/a&gt; and two Ancients of Lore and two Hunter's Halls to research both upgrades at once.\nIt's very important to prevent Druids of the Claw from dying using &lt;a href=\"%23Rejuvenation\"&gt;Rejuvenation&lt;/a&gt;. It's very expensive and time consuming to replace lost Druids of the Claw. The best way to do this is using subgroups. Watch the portraits of the Bears while having the Rejuvenation icon active. Select Rejuvenation and click on the portrait of the damaged Bear to heal him. You can also use the \"Alt\" key to watch for low hit point bars.\nSome players like building a lot of Druids of the Claw but leave them in Night Elf Form. While they don't do as much damage as they would do in Bear form they can cast Rejuvenation on themselves and Roar. Usually when focusing on Druids of the Claw it's best to mix them up having most in Bear Form and some in Druid Form to cast Rejuvenation and Roar on the Bears. Research Mark of the Claw so that you can use Roar while in Bear Form.\nDruids of the Claw cannot attack air units so be aware of this weakness. Druids of the Claw and Archers with range upgrades are a good combination.\nUse Moon Wells to build up the Druid of the Claw's mana so he can cast his most powerful spells right away. Then send him off into battle.\nUse &lt;a href=\"%23Roar\"&gt;Roar&lt;/a&gt; to waste mana so that the Spell Breakers cannot use their &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Feedback%20%28Passive%29\"&gt;Feedback&lt;/a&gt; against you. While it may seem against your best interest to use Roar because of the &lt;a href=\"Spell%20Breaker%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Spell%20Steal%20%28Autocast%29\"&gt;Spell Steal&lt;/a&gt;, in reality it will work in your favor if you keep spamming it.\nSpells and abilities.\noar.\nRoar is a great bonus to give to your troops, especially in large team games where Roar can help a large army. Use Roar during battle whenever possible.\nResearch &lt;a href=\"%23Mark%20of%20the%20Claw\"&gt;Mark of the Claw&lt;/a&gt; so that you can use Roar while in Bear Form.\nUse Dispel abilities to remove roar or you can run away until it wears off.\nRjuvenation.\nRejuvenation is great for casting on Heroes or even allied Heroes. If your partner has a damaged Hero cast Rejuvenation on their Hero to help them out. Cast Rejuvenation on nearly dead units and especially on powerful units you do not wish to lose.\nCast Rejuvenation on the &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Priestess of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; when she &lt;a href=\"Priestess%20of%20the%20Moon%20%28Warcraft%20III%29%23Starfall%20%28Ultimate%29\"&gt;Starfall&lt;/a&gt;s. This can allow her to cast it much longer even under attack.\nYou can cast Rejuvenation on units with full health. You can cast Rejuvenation on magic immune units.\nUse Dispel abilities.\nBear orm.\nIf you no longer need the Druid of the Claw as a spellcaster, turn him into a Bear and use him as a melee unit."}

Their primary role in society is information gathering and intelligence. They have the ability to transform into Storm Crows and fly over the field of battle to scout and deliver orders to distant troops. Their magical spell-like abilities are capable of channeling even the winds to fight against the enemies of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;.\nInformation.\nA supporting spellcaster unit, the Talon druids are seldom used by Night Elf players. However, they can be quite feared when put in the hands of a skilled player.\nThe druids start off in their humanoid form and come with Faerie Fire. This spell reduces the armor of the targeted unit by 4 and also grants them vision of that unit as if they were their own. The spell works extremely well with high-damage units like &lt;a href=\"Chimaera%20%28Warcraft%20III%29\"&gt;Chimaera&lt;/a&gt;s, as the reduced armor means their attacks deal even more damage against the enemy. They use a weak auto-attack and being spellcasters, only benefit from magic upgrades.\nIn their aerial form, the Talon druid transforms into a crow, where he transforms from a supporting spellcaster to a ranged anti-air unit, dealing higher damage, though limited to air units. Despite this, it is very powerful against most air units due to the high damage and the fact that many heavy air units have light armor, making them take more damage from their attacks. The druid also loses access to his spells unless Mark of the Talon is researched, which allows them to retain Faerie Fire in their crow form.\nCyclone is by far the most strongest skill - though it makes the targeted unit invulnerable and can only be cast on ground units, it disables them for 20 seconds and cannot be dispelled. When facing a powerful ground army, the druids help lower the amount of potential targets for you or your allies to pick off the remaining units easily. When the affected units return to solid ground, they'll then be greeted with a large number of hostile faces and be killed before they even knew what happened.\nUpgrades.\nBackpack is unavailable in Storm Crow form.\nAny items in the inventory will be dropped when transforming."}

Some still call themselves druids of the wild to represent their breadth, but as this approach is now standard, mostly they are called just druids. They are tied to the living aspects of nature \u2014 flora and fauna. They do not dabble in elemental forces; such powers are the purview of shamans. A druid of the wild grows such a strong affinity with nature that she may assume the form of animals and even super-natural beasts.\nDruids of the wild are &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraditionally, druids chose the path of a specific animal totem, becoming either &lt;a href=\"druid%20of%20the%20claw\"&gt;druids of the claw&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"druid%20of%20the%20talon\"&gt;druids of the talon&lt;/a&gt;. Indeed, legends suggest that there were even more orders of druid than these two. After the &lt;a href=\"Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s invasion, the druids began to use the powers of all forms, combining their strengths against their enemies and becoming the druids of the wild.\n&lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; is the absolute ruler of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. As such, most druids of the wild venerate her; and even if some do not treat her as a deity, she is at least acknowledged as one of the greatest paragons of nature in existence. Druids of the wild also visit the Emerald Dream using their &lt;a href=\"hibernation\"&gt;hibernation&lt;/a&gt; ability and with certain spells. Generally, these travels happen unimpeded, since they are almost always peaceful and can cause no lasting damage.\n&lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; is rarely venerated by any particular group, although the druids of the wild appreciate her serene presence, considering her second in importance only to Ysera.\n&lt;a href=\"Therazane%20the%20Stonemother\"&gt;Therazane the Stonemother&lt;/a&gt; is ruler over the earth, dirt, rock, and mountains. She is revered by all &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s and creatures that dwell underneath the ground. Some druids of the wild see her as the embodiment of all that is peaceful and calm about the world.\nThe most experienced druids of the wild become &lt;a href=\"epic%20druid%20of%20the%20wild\"&gt;epic druids of the wild&lt;/a&gt;.\nEpic druid of the wild.\nThe epic druid of the wild is an epic class druid of the wild. This druid shapes and alters &lt;a href=\"nature\"&gt;nature&lt;/a&gt;. They wield their most terrifying aspects and take the forms of their mightiest creatures. To witness them in combat is to suffer the fury of a raging hurricane, while to observe them in meditation is to feel serenity of rustling grasses. They must divide their attention between combat ability and magical prowess. Both are useful, so they follow their natural instincts."}

{"id": "130541", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=130541", "title": "Druid races", "text": "This article lists the &lt;a href=\"race\"&gt;race&lt;/a&gt;s that are able to become &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, along with the lore behind each.\nAlliance.\nNight elf druids.\nNight elven druidic traditions extend back further than most races have existed. The demigod &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; taught the druidic arts to the kaldorei early in their history, and the most devout of night elf druids honor and pass on his original teachings. A few were there when Cenarius provided his tutelage and learned directly from the demigod. \nWorgen druids.\nIn the early days of humanity and its civilization, many tribes of &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s had primitive belief systems that incorporated simple nature magic. However, the rise of organized religion such as the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; and the potent &lt;a href=\"arcane\"&gt;arcane&lt;/a&gt; magics introduced by the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; quickly supplanted such traditions. &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, due to its relative isolation, has retained a degree of their ancient culture in the contemporary era. The religious leaders of what was in Gilneas referred to as the \"old ways\" eventually became \"&lt;a href=\"Harvest-witch\"&gt;harvest-witches&lt;/a&gt;\"; those who used their nature powers to augment Gilneas\u2019 agricultural output during and following its period of industrialization. Due to the presence of harvest-witches in their culture, when Gilneans learned about night elf druids they became fascinated by them and their exotic connotations, to the point where many started referring to harvest witches as \"druids\", though this was quite far from the truth, as few Gilneans had any idea what a druid actually was. Harvest-witches have a limited control over nature, especially plant life, and the powers of harvest witches bear a coincidental resemblance to the low-level abilities of actual druids. Harvest witches who contracted the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; (which was druidic in origin) found that their powers were somewhat amplified, and after making first contact with the night elves cursed harvest witches were offered induction into the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; for both study and training.\nStarvation's first solutions are most of the time cutting down forests. It is likely that the human druids intervened here and promised to save the crops of Gilneas to have their forests spared. It is possible that because of the reappearance of druidism, Gilneas in general was drawn closer to the beauty of nature. This is a nice analogy to romanticism and paganism in the real world 18th century, so it is a likely theory.\nKul Tiran druids.\nThe original race of &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Drust\"&gt;Drust&lt;/a&gt;, began practicing druidism in ancient times. Unlike tauren and night elves, the Drust embrace death as an equally important part of the natural world, leading to their shapeshifted forms looking more skeletal and emaciated, though no less powerful. When &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt; broke away from &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;War against the Drust&lt;/a&gt;, he took his druids with him and established the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt;, an order of peaceful druids who would take in any who wished to learn. Similar to other &lt;a href=\"archdruid\"&gt;archdruid&lt;/a&gt;s, Ulfar endured over the centuries, with many Kul Tirans coming to join the order and learn under him as well. Many of these Kul Tiran druids now fight for the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde.\nTauren druids.\nAccording to the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; lore, &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt; instructed them first in druidism, as recounted in their &lt;a href=\"Tauren%20mythology\"&gt;myth&lt;/a&gt; \"&lt;a href=\"Forestlord%20and%20the%20First%20Druids\"&gt;Forestlord and the First Druids&lt;/a&gt;\". It was in fact &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; who was the first mortal druid, and Cenarius' greatest student. It is likely though that Cenarius may have met and befriended the tauren.\nThe night elf druids were recently joined in the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt;. During the war, Malfurion had befriended &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; and taught him of druidism. Hamuul later became the first tauren to join the Cenarion Circle and later the archdruid of the tauren race.\nTroll druids.\nUnknown to the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; priests, &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; was slowly cutting them off from the spirits. When they were powerless to stop &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; he started to take control of the Isles. &lt;a href=\"Vol%27jin\"&gt;Vol'jin&lt;/a&gt;, wanting to prevent more of his people from being controlled, gave the order to flee the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Many &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s, including the loa priests, witch doctors, felt they had failed their people and took towards the untamed jungles of the southern islands. It was here that &lt;a href=\"Zen%27tabra\"&gt;Zen'tabra&lt;/a&gt; had a vision. In this vision, Zen'tabra saw the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; and spoke to the ancient &lt;a href=\"raptor\"&gt;raptor&lt;/a&gt; loa, &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;. Able to reach across and bring Zen'tabra's spirit to him, he tasked her and her people to save the life on the isles and revealed a new way to connect with \"all\" the spirits of nature, instead of serving just one at a time. Since then the once witch doctors were taught directly from the Emerald Dream and the spirits themselves. And although the spirits are not keen on teaching more of her kind, they will help so long as the Echo Isles continue to flourish with life.\nIt was rumored that, long ago, a tribe of troll druids once called the Echo Isles home. However, this was later said by Zen'tabra to be a myth made up to confuse &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt;.\nHighmountain tauren druids.\nVery little is known about the origin of &lt;a href=\"Highmountain%20tauren\"&gt;Highmountain tauren&lt;/a&gt; druids. &lt;a href=\"Vydhar\"&gt;Vydhar&lt;/a&gt; was turned into a tree by ancient Highmountain tauren. It would imply that druidic magics were used in this transformation.\nZandalari druids.\nSince the trolls of &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt; have regular face-to-face contact with their &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt;, druids are relatively common among the Zandalari. Similar to the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe\"&gt;Darkspear&lt;/a&gt;, their power of nature and shapeshifting comes from &lt;a href=\"Gonk\"&gt;Gonk&lt;/a&gt;, the Loa of Shapes, though he allows them to follow the teachings of other loa as well, such as &lt;a href=\"Pa%27ku\"&gt;Pa'ku&lt;/a&gt;, while still retaining their power. There is also a sect of Zandalari druids who worship a being who is not a loa (heavily implied to be &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;) named the &lt;a href=\"Lun%27alai\"&gt;Lun'alai&lt;/a&gt; who never leave their &lt;a href=\"Moonkin%20Form\"&gt;Moonkin Form&lt;/a&gt;. Two powerful Zandalari druids, &lt;a href=\"Hexlord%20Raal\"&gt;Hexlord Raal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wardruid%20Loti\"&gt;Wardruid Loti&lt;/a&gt;, hold great influence as members of the &lt;a href=\"Zanchuli%20Council\"&gt;Zanchuli Council&lt;/a&gt;. Those who channel the loa's divine power without shapeshifting are typically &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s instead.\nOther druidic races.\nHigh elven and blood elven druids.\n&lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;High elves&lt;/a&gt; have also practiced druidism; they had &lt;a href=\"elven%20ranger\"&gt;elven ranger&lt;/a&gt;s who practiced it. The now-&lt;a href=\"retcon\"&gt;retcon&lt;/a&gt;ned \"\" manual mentioned &lt;a href=\"elven%20druid\"&gt;elven druid&lt;/a&gt;s. It is assumed that the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elven&lt;/a&gt; rangers have also been trained in the art of the druid.\nLost One druids.\nSome tribes of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Lost%20Ones\"&gt;Lost Ones&lt;/a&gt; are known to practice druidism. For example, the &lt;a href=\"Feralfen\"&gt;Feralfen&lt;/a&gt; tribe. It is probably something that happened after the separation from the draenei, as neither draenei nor Broken draenei are known to practice druidism.\nArakkoa druids.\nIn the \"&lt;a href=\"Warlords%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Warlords of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;\" expansion, the high &lt;a href=\"arakkoa\"&gt;arakkoa&lt;/a&gt; sun-sages use solar magic similar to that of balance druid. Even though &lt;a href=\"Dawnseeker%20Rukaryx\"&gt;Dawnseeker Rukaryx&lt;/a&gt; is considered a balance druid, it's possible that because followers must be a playable class and specialization that they chose balance druid because it was the closest class to sun-sage. But, Dawnseeker Rukaryx is a part of the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20the%20Awakened\"&gt;Order of the Awakened&lt;/a&gt; who are trying to redeem arakkoa society by means of the &lt;a href=\"apexis\"&gt;apexis&lt;/a&gt;, and it is said that the apexis believed in a balance of light and shadow, day and night.\nIn the RPG.\nNight elf druids.\nThe iconic night elf druid is a spiritual creature with powers that tap into worlds beyond most mortal knowledge. Green energy plays around his feet, and he moves unhindered through secret forest paths. Night elf druids have always guarded their people against the Burning Legion, and over the ages they developed methods to strike past the demons\u2019 defenses.\nNight elf druids claim that they can still hear the voice of Cenarius, warning them when danger is imminent and giving them gentle urgings as to the best way to avoid attacks. Perhaps this voice is nature itself, protecting those who protect it. The night elf druid can drop into a deep slumber. While hibernating, he does not need to eat or drink, and he barely needs to breathe \u2014 others must be careful to determine that he still lives. When the druid enters hibernation, any poisons working within him are suspended, and he does not bleed. His breathing is so shallow that he does not suffer effects from inhaled toxins or other dangers, and he can survive for a year on the amount of air he would normally need in a day. He heals at twice the normal rate. When the night elf druid enters hibernation, he sets the conditions to awaken. He can choose a specific amount of time (\u201ctwenty-four hours\u201d) or some other event, such as, \u201cWhen the sun strikes my eyes\u201d or \u201cWhen I hear the call of the horn of Cenarius.\u201d\nTroll druids.\nAfter joining the Horde, the Darkspear trolls (or at least some) began to &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20tribe%23Philosophies\"&gt;live in the future&lt;/a&gt;. As such they starting to pursue the path of druid, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"witch%20doctor\"&gt;witch doctor&lt;/a&gt;.\nFurbolg druids.\n&lt;a href=\"Furbolg\"&gt;Furbolg&lt;/a&gt; leaders are &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; or druids \u2014 which furbolgs usually also call shaman, making little distinction between the two practices.\nCentaur druids.\nLike all of Cenarius's children, &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; favor druidism over other divine arts. However, centaur druids are not in the least respectable. Rather than striving for a balance with nature, centaur druids control nature, using it to further their own ambitions. If an animal or plant refuses to subject itself to the centaur's rule, then the creature finds itself either enslaved or, more commonly, destroyed. It takes weeks for night elf or tauren druids to correct the damage a centaur druid inflicts on any territory it comes across.\nHuman druids.\nDruidism is more difficult for &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, because it involves quiet contemplation and a sense of one\u2019s own inferiority compared to the needs of the whole; but some humans have the necessary concentration,\nconsideration and calm and have become exemplary wardens of the wild."}

Once part of an order of noble druids, the group, led by &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, sought to use the Caverns' underground springs to restore the Barrens to the lush and fertile land that it once was, using the power of the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Hamuul%20Runetotem\"&gt;Hamuul Runetotem&lt;/a&gt; referred to them as a &lt;a href=\"cult\"&gt;cult&lt;/a&gt;.\nHowever, once connected to the Dream, the druid's vision somehow became a &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, and began to corrupt and transform the Caverns and its denizens. Naralex and his druids were transformed into the Druids of the Fang, and began seeking to remake that land to match their own, twisted dreams. They were eventually defeated by a group of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s.\nIn World of Warcraft.\nAfter the awakening of &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, the caverns that they have once inhabited have grown silent.

They seek to remake the land to mirror their own twisted dream.\nIn the RPG.\nThe Druids of the Fang, now infamous for a catastrophe in the &lt;a href=\"Wailing%20Caverns\"&gt;Wailing Caverns&lt;/a&gt;, is the largest druidic group that retains a totem. The Druids of the Fang were previously a &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elf&lt;/a&gt; faction devoted to healing the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt; and returning it to its former lush glory. After their leader became trapped in an attempt to connect to the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, those close to him became corrupted and now keep others from attempting to save him. These druids work to spread the chaos and corruption in the caverns and throughout the Barrens. Turning independent to entreat the tauren druids for help, the remaining druids now struggle to free their leader, defeat their evil brethren, and complete the goal of restoring the Barrens from the further taint. Their biggest rivals are their own kind, the druids that carry corrupted souls and prevent the rescue of &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;, the fallen Druid of the Fang leader. An organization beset by tragedy, these druids accept any and all help to achieve their goals. It is one of the few organizations supported by both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They try to heal the Barrens. Some unequivocally tainted the Barrens. Others work to save their leader from the nightmare realm where he exists. Since the tragedy, the druids have scattered around &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; to look for a key to saving their leader, but they gather mostly in &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and the Barrens.\"\nOrganization.\nThe leader of this shattered shell of a group was &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt;. The night elf druids paint him into a savior figure, one to deliver the Barrens from its desert existence and deliver us all from the demons. The tauren druids have a slightly more realistic view of this man: He thought the cavern complex underneath the Barrens would be the ideal place to try to siphon in some of the magic of the Emerald Dream. Bring in the dream magic, he thought, and the Barrens will flower again. This druid took a wrong turn and ended up not in the Emerald Dream, but stuck in some nightmare place. Now he is in a coma, and is the conduit through which this nightmare stuff is coming to warp and twist everything in the Wailing Caverns. \nHis seconds, four extremely powerful druids, were corrupted and still remain down there, guarding his body from anyone who tries to help. So no one reports to Naralex, although he is the leader. The remaining Druids of the Fang are so distraught that there is little organization among them. If a druid discovers a band of strong adventurers who seem decent enough, he entreats them for help. The tauren took pity on the disorganized druids and invited them into their fold. Now &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; druids, while they do not directly order the night elves, guide them in druidic spells to try to cleanse the caverns, and give them places to train to increase their skills. The night elf druids are focused on restoring their master to his former state and have since put off the small matter of fixing the Barrens. Yet it is likely that the Barrens can\u2019t be fixed until Naralex is released from his sleep, so it probably all points to the same goal.\nThe Druids of the Fang have no central gathering place, unless one counts the horrors of the Wailing Caverns. Both kinds of druids can be found there \u2014 the mad, powerful, corrupted druids, and the confused and disorganized good ones. The latter are not as deep in the caverns. Tauren druids are keenly aware of the horrors of the Wailing Caverns, and druids of both races often travel between the Wailing Caverns, &lt;a href=\"Crossroads\"&gt;Crossroads&lt;/a&gt;, and Thunder Bluff, working to get more information and make plans. These druids often travel to &lt;a href=\"Moonglade\"&gt;Moonglade&lt;/a&gt;, as well, but they don\u2019t spend too much time there.\"\nMembership.\nThe Druids of the Fang were once a proud and powerful group. Druids who wished to connect to the potent power of the snake would study nature and live long lives of hardship and training. The existing Druids of the Fang would go through years of initiation and live in nature away from towns, communing with nature and those massive ancient trees. Now, their numbers have dwindled. Many druids lost their lives in the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;; and after Naralex fell into his half-living, half-dead state, most figured the Druids of the Fang were a lost organization, dishonored by their destruction of the nature of the caves. Yet some night elves, and some tauren, believe the caverns can be cleansed. These optimistic youths either attempt to find druids in Thunder Bluff or Crossroads (or even the caverns, although some of those youths don\u2019t survive that journey) who can help them.\nApart from a cursory check to see if the student has promise, a good heart, and a willingness to do hard work and possibly lose her soul in the corrupting magic of the caverns, the Druids of the Fang accept any new &lt;a href=\"acolyte\"&gt;acolyte&lt;/a&gt;. Their numbers are low, and they are desperate to increase them. Even though the druids don\u2019t seem to care too much who they take in, their new acolytes are eager and strong. There isn't a new initiate who isn\u2019t determined to heal the caverns and the Barrens. Night elves and tauren in the organization do not quarrel, night elves in Thunder Bluff (who are always escorted by tauren, of course) and tauren in Moonglade (where druids sometimes go to meditate). The new ones are focused, and give some life to the old druids in their miserable states.\nDruids of the fang (class).\nDruid of the fang is a class of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;. They are members of the organization known as the Druids of the Fang. Druids of the fang accept the &lt;a href=\"snake\"&gt;snake&lt;/a&gt; as their totem. Due to recent events, many believe the druids of the fang are an evil organization. This belief is unfounded; the druids of the fang are loyal to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and the Alliance (or &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and The Horde in the case of Tauren druids). However, recently, the order's head, Naralex, became trapped in a nightmare in the Wailing Caverns while attempting to restore the natural balance of the Barrens; he now spreads corruption through the complex. Many druids of the fang also became infected, and many of the order are now indeed corrupted and evil. The uncorrupted druids of the fang seek to cure their brethren and restore their leader.\nDruids of the fang have a natural affinity for snakes of all kinds, and are able to transform into various serpent shapes instead of the other animal forms other druids use, such as &lt;a href=\"Cobra\"&gt;dire cobras&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"viper\"&gt;viper&lt;/a&gt;s. They utilize most of the abilities and powers of other druids, but have a few special perks: druids of the fang have access to very powerful sleep magic, able to draw entire groups into slumber, as well as utilize lightning and electricity-based spells.\nOften, Druids of the Serpent totem can be found with animal companions that are snakes of some kind, from tiny grass snakes to large pythons."}

The &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;'s meddling had unified the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; against him, and thus the Destroyer called on a new weapon to end him: the Druids of the Flame. They were led by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;, the disgraced former leader of the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt;, who had been locked in a &lt;a href=\"barrow%20den\"&gt;barrow den&lt;/a&gt; for his attempted murder of &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; and his dealings with the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. As the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; had unfolded, agents of the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; had helped him escape his bonds, and presented him with an offer: if he served Deathwing, he would be granted the power to take revenge on the world for the death of his son, &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;Valstann Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. After his defeat during the &lt;a href=\"War%20Against%20the%20Nightmare\"&gt;War Against the Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, Fandral knew that resurrecting Valstann was impossible, and his only desire was now to bring ruin to Azeroth.\nRagnaros himself remade Fandral in flames, disfiguring the night elf but also granting him command over the element of fire. He became the Firelord's foremost lieutenant and the first Druid of the Flame. Fandral then recruited others to his side, mainly &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s who were disillusioned with the Cenarion Circle. Like their new leader, these druids were reborn in fire. Near &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Fandral and his druids ambushed Thrall, and used the orc's own shamanic power to shatter his spirit and hurl the pieces across the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Plane\"&gt;Elemental Plane&lt;/a&gt;. Each sundered portion of his essence embodied one of his raw emotions. \nAmong other things, they also attempted to use a vessel of Firelands energy known as a \"Solar Core\" to annihilate Azeroth.\nMeanwhile, Malfurion Stormrage rallied Hyjal's defenders in a massive counterattack against the fire elementals. They drove Ragnaros's army back into the Firelands, and with reinforcements from the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, the Cenarion Circle stormed into the stronghold known as the &lt;a href=\"Molten%20Front\"&gt;Molten Front&lt;/a&gt;. Slowly, they pushed deeper into the Firelands until they reached &lt;a href=\"Sulfuron%20Keep\"&gt;Sulfuron Keep&lt;/a&gt;, where Ragnaros fell before the onslaught of Azeroth's defenders. His greatest lieutenants, including Fandral Staghelm and most of the Druids of the Flame, suffered the same fate. With the Firelord's destruction, Hyjal was at last spared from his all-consuming flames.\nDragonflight.\nThought to have been destroyed with the deaths of &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt;, the Druids of the Flame were able to escape into the &lt;a href=\"Firelands\"&gt;Firelands&lt;/a&gt; and gained recruits in the wake of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, as a lot of night elves felt devastated and demoralized by those events. They later allied with &lt;a href=\"Fyrakk\"&gt;Fyrakk&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Primalists\"&gt;Primalists&lt;/a&gt; under the promise of reclaiming their immortality, and struck against the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; during fire &lt;a href=\"Dreamsurge\"&gt;Dreamsurge&lt;/a&gt;s, coming from Waking Dream portals. Their alliance was later discovered by &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; in the assaulted &lt;a href=\"Lunedane\"&gt;Lunedane&lt;/a&gt;.\nLed by &lt;a href=\"Tindral%20Sageswift\"&gt;Tindral Sageswift&lt;/a&gt;, who empowered some of his followers with the Embers of Ragnaros and spreaded propaganda denouncing Tyrande Whisperwind, the Druids of the Flame took part in Fyrakk's assault on Amirdrassil, mainly using their power to breach past the barrier blocking the entrance into the Temple leading to the World Tree's core. However, the barrier proved difficult to break, frustrating the Primal Incarnate, leading him to punish a druid who was foolish enough to voice their impatience to Fyrakk. Unfortunately for the Druids, Tindral would fall to the Dream's defenders and the majority of their forces would be either routed or incinerated by Fyrakk for their failure to breach the barrier, leading the Primal Incarnate to break the barrier himself. It is unknown if there were any other surviving Druids of the Flame following Fyrakk's death.\nAbilities and equipment.\nTo the untrained eye, a flame druid's &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Druid%20Staff\"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; would be indistinguishable from any druid's staff. Their &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Druid%20Idol\"&gt;idols&lt;/a&gt; signify their tie to the element of fire, and they carry &lt;a href=\"Flame%20Druid%20Spellbook\"&gt;spellbooks&lt;/a&gt; which detail their strange spells.\nFlame druids mostly use fire-oriented spells. Much like normal &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s, they are capable of shapeshifting into animal forms, but their forms are always fiery versions of the animal in question.\nSpeculation.\nSince &lt;a href=\"Leyara\"&gt;Leyara&lt;/a&gt; was inducted into the organization due to being highly disillusioned with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;'s passive stance in regards to the Horde, it is possible that other members of the Druids of the Flame joined for similar reasons. It is also possible the Druids of the Flame are holdout loyalists of Fandral Staghelm after the events of \"&lt;a href=\"Stormrage\"&gt;Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;\", and that their emergence is an escalation of the schism that existed between &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; and Fandral during Malfurion's absence."}

They called this form the Pack Form, a form that turned them into wolves. Although powerful, the Pack Form tended to turn the druids feral. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; prohibited the use of this form because it couldn't be controlled. However, the Druids of the Pack continued to practice the form in secret but eventually lost themselves to the form's feral rage. They were eventually brought under the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt;, who promised them a way to tame the Pack Form.\nTaught by &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt;, these Druids of the Pack sought to temper the uncontrollable rage inherent in their chosen form. To do so, they willingly submitted to the energies of the &lt;a href=\"%3AScythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;:Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, a mystical artifact created from a &lt;a href=\"%3AFang%20of%20Goldrinn\"&gt;:Fang of Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Staff of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nRather than abate the druids' fury, however, the weapon transformed Ralaar and his followers into &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;: bestial humanoids enslaved by their own primal instincts.\nWhile in the worgen form, the druids eventually lost their minds to its violent nature. Blinded by all-consuming rage, Ralaar\u2019s druids tore through friend and foe alike during battle with the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s. Night elves wounded by the unruly beasts contracted &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;a virulent curse&lt;/a&gt; that turned them into worgen as well. Desperate to stanch the affliction\u2019s spread, &lt;a href=\"Archdruid\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; mournfully banished the worgen beneath &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, where they would be in peaceful slumber for all eternity.\nFor millennia, the worgen threat was contained until the day &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; tampered with summoning worgen after looking into &lt;a href=\"Ur\"&gt;Ur&lt;/a&gt;'s research, calling them into the world to combat the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; but accidentally unleashing the worgen curse on &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;. Some of the worgen were also released from their slumber by &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; using the Scythe of Elune. Some of the worgen at &lt;a href=\"Talonbranch%20Glade\"&gt;Talonbranch Glade&lt;/a&gt; have been there since Velinde summoned the worgen. Likewise, the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane pack&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; are also night elven worgen.\nSome of the Druids of the Scythe traveled as a pack in the Emerald Dream until they found their way to &lt;a href=\"Val%27sharah\"&gt;Val'sharah&lt;/a&gt; and went their separate ways. An &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Archdruid&lt;/a&gt; wielding the &lt;a href=\"%3AScythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;:Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; is able to return these feral worgen to their original night elf forms."}

{"id": "18728", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=18728", "title": "Drunk", "text": " \nDrunk is a character condition comparable to &lt;a href=\"tipsy\"&gt;tipsy&lt;/a&gt;, though more extreme. If you continue to drink you will become \"totally smashed\". You become drunk by drinking multiple alcoholic beverages (available in some &lt;a href=\"Inn\"&gt;Inn&lt;/a&gt;s, or during special events like &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt;) in quick succession, without allowing the effects of earlier &lt;a href=\"drink\"&gt;drink&lt;/a&gt;s to wear off.\nYour ability to function in-game is severely impaired, including random changes of direction while walking/running. Additionally, your typed messages will be altered to have a drunken effect; your \"S\"s often become \"SH\"s and \"...hic!\" is added to the end of your lines on occasion (Example: What you shay might come out like thish ...hic!).\nGameplay effects.\nGetting a character drunk lowers the displayed level of enemies as they appear to the drunken player. The apparent level of all hostile targets (both NPCs and other players) goes down by up to 5 levels while \"completely smashed\", and slowly returns to its actual level as the character sobers up. It is important to note that while the level \"appears\" lower, it is actually unchanged; if you are not careful, you may find yourself fighting enemies much higher level than intended!\nMovement is also impaired, as you veer sideways quite a lot when moving forwards. When flying, drunken players may veer to the left or right, and pitch up or down. Drunk-flying players will often find themselves flying directly upwards into the air or diving down into the ground. Swimming is definitely a bad idea; if you try to swim to the surface to get more air, you may find yourself swimming down instead, increasing the odds of drowning.\nIf a character consumes too much alcohol they will be afflicted with &lt;a href=\"Drunken%20Vomit\"&gt;Drunken Vomit&lt;/a&gt;, stunning them for a few seconds while green vomit spews from their mouth.\nSobering up.\nDrunken players will slowly become sober over a period of time, with automatic emotes expressing their increasing sobriety. As with getting drunk, drunken players will sober up by degrees; the effects of their intoxication will wear off step by step, with visual and movement disruptions becoming less pronounced.\nGenerally, the only way for players to become sober is to wait for the effects of the alcohol to expire. However, there are some exceptions. Players can drink certain beverages such as &lt;a href=\"Starfire%20Espresso\"&gt;Starfire Espresso&lt;/a&gt; to sober up faster, with each cup reducing the player's inebriation by a reasonable amount; it may therefore take several cups to remove the effects of serious intoxication. Players can also cause their characters to sober up by allowing them to die; while not an ideal solution, it can be preferable to simply waiting when sobering beverages are not available.\nSobering beverages include:\nGraphics effects.\nFor supported graphics cards, the more drunk you become the more your screen will blur around the edges until it becomes nearly impossible to see. Players who desire to disable the blurriness can run the following command in their chat input, excluding the quote marks: \"/console ffxGlow 0\". (To re-enable, simply change the command to \"/console ffxGlow 1\".)\nThe glow effect requires the use of video card shaders to be enabled (&lt;a href=\"CVar%20fixedFunction\"&gt;fixedFunction&lt;/a&gt; = 0). If the graphic effect is missing, try typing these in your chat window first:\n /console ffx 1 \n /console &lt;a href=\"CVar%20ffxGlow\"&gt;ffxglow&lt;/a&gt; 1 \n /console &lt;a href=\"CVar%20fixedFunction\"&gt;fixedfunction&lt;/a&gt; 0 \n /console gxrestart"}

They wielded powerful &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; magic and mainly lived in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;, but also resided in several areas of &lt;a href=\"Tiragarde%20Sound\"&gt;Tiragarde Sound&lt;/a&gt; and to lesser extent &lt;a href=\"Stormsong%20Valley\"&gt;Stormsong Valley&lt;/a&gt;; to this day, their ruins and ancient roads can be seen throughout the island. When human &lt;a href=\"sailor\"&gt;sailor&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; arrived in Kul Tiras around 2,700 years ago, the Drust king &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; led his people into &lt;a href=\"War%20against%20the%20Drust\"&gt;war against the human settlers&lt;/a&gt;. However, not all Drust agreed with the war, and the &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; left Drust society to side with the humans.\nGorak Tul eventually lost the conflict, and his Drust were almost all slain by the human invaders. However, Gorak Tul called upon the dark powers of &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros, the Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, where the Drust's spirits found refuge. Since then, they have slowly been trying to make their way back to the mortal world. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, they made a pact with &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Meredith%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, helping her save her &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;dying husband&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for assisting them. On the Drust's part, all they desired was vengeance against her people. Following this pact, Waycrest began wielding Drust magic and formed the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;, an order of witches who began terrorizing the people of Drustvar and worked to summon Gorak Tul back into the realm of the living.\nGorak Tul's efforts on Kul Tiras were eventually thwarted, but the Drust have reappeared in large numbers in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, where they are attempting to invade the realm of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt; from Thros, led by &lt;a href=\"Matron\"&gt;nightscreamer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt;.\nBackground.\nSome &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; settlements were scattered prior to the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Sundering\"&gt;Great Sundering&lt;/a&gt;. After the Sundering, various vrykul &lt;a href=\"tribe\"&gt;tribe&lt;/a&gt;s set out for the seas, and one such population of seafaring vrykul settled on &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the reign of &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, the Drust practiced &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;ism. In the opinion of the druids, Gorak Tul's twisted ways brought disgrace to the Drust. Gorak Tul, their sorcerer king, was the one who perverted the druidic rituals of the Drust and set their people upon the path of death and domination. The Drust fought many enemies over their history, including beings that looked like themselves or great beasts, smaller beings that resembled &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s in stature, and &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;.\nAround 2,700 years ago, &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s from &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; arrived on the island, which they would later call Kul Tiras. The humans tried for peace with the Drust, but the latter went to war immediately, aggressively launching raids against the humans' fledgling hamlets from &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;. The Drust &lt;a href=\"barbarian\"&gt;barbarian&lt;/a&gt;s glorified the slaughter, attacking unarmed civilians. It was during this war that the Drust tapped into &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros, the Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt;.\nOnly a few of the Drust tolerated new neighbors. A member of the druidic &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; by the name of &lt;a href=\"Sef%20Iwen\"&gt;Sef Iwen&lt;/a&gt; protested the brutality of Gorak Tul, stating that the Drust could live in harmony with the humans if they tried. Tul gave Iwen the choice to either submit or \"hide in the woods forever\". Iwen chose the latter, believing Tul meant exile, but instead the king tore her soul from her body, cursing her to forever haunt the woods later called the &lt;a href=\"Glenbrook%20Hunting%20Grounds\"&gt;Glenbrook Hunting Grounds&lt;/a&gt; and using her death as an example to scare other dissidents into submission. This act of brutality alongside the others that Tul continued to enact upon the humans ultimately led to the Thornspeakers leaving the Drust to join Kul Tiran society. Some of the humans' Kul Tiran descendants heard the call of the wilds and sought to learn the ancient ways, and so the Drust Thornspeakers taught them the ways of druidism.\nThe Drust assaults carried on for many years until the ancestors of &lt;a href=\"House%20Waycrest\"&gt;House Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; decided something had to be done and began a war against the Drust. But though the Waycrests were hearty folk, the Drust's &lt;a href=\"death\"&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; magic was strong and the humans began to lose the war. The Waycrests researched their magic and created the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; to fight them. To counter the Drust magic, the Order of Embers used weapons of &lt;a href=\"silver\"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; and rowan wood, the latter of which is not found in Drustvar. A complex alchemical solution called Liquid Fire was a weapon used to \"burn away the Drust\".\nIn time the Drust would be forced to withdraw as they lost numbers to the human settlers. As the war went on, the desperate Drust called onto dark powers. Unbeknownst to them, they had reached the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;Emerald Nightmare&lt;/a&gt;. Their fallen warriors would find refuge in Thros, an offshoot of the Nightmare which they named differently as they were not aware of what the Nightmare was. When their great leader Gorak Tul ran out of living warriors, he conducted a ritual to create &lt;a href=\"Drust%20construct\"&gt;stone constructs&lt;/a&gt; to fight for him as part of his desperation to win. The Drust settlement of &lt;a href=\"Gol%20Osigr\"&gt;Gol Osigr&lt;/a&gt; would become the place of their final defeat. Colonel &lt;a href=\"Arom%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arom Waycrest&lt;/a&gt;, who later became the first Lord of Drustvar, led the humans' final assault on the Drust and stabbed Gorak Tul himself. As he was stabbed Gorak Tul's power was broken and, with it, his connection to his stone constructs which shattered. But though wounded and broken, Gorak Tul did not die.\nIn modern times, the story has been warped. The modern Kul Tirans believe that the stone constructs were used for a longer period than just near the end of the war, that Arom had killed Gorak Tul, and that Gorak Tul's living army fell soon after his death instead of earlier on.\nThe Drust would live on as spirits, trying to return to the physical world. The Waycrests had wiped out the Drust, but could not destroy Gorak Tul. For countless years he waited to enact his vengeance from within &lt;a href=\"Thros\"&gt;Thros&lt;/a&gt;, until &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Waycrest\"&gt;Lady Waycrest&lt;/a&gt; provided the means.\nAs for the Drust Thornspeakers, they apparently died out one by one until only &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt; remained, who now leads the Kul Tiran druids as the last, truly living Drust.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nStricken with grief due to her ailing husband &lt;a href=\"Arthur%20Waycrest\"&gt;Arthur&lt;/a&gt;, Lady Waycrest called out to any power that could save him. &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; answered her cry and promised that death would never part the couple, for a price. Gorak Tul taught the Drust's ancient death magic to Lady Waycrest, who in turn formed the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt;. The coven's magic awakened the remaining stone constructs and stirred the Drust's spirits, drawing them back to fight once more as &lt;a href=\"skeleton\"&gt;skeleton&lt;/a&gt;s. Other Drust spirits were put into &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker construct&lt;/a&gt;s. During the events of the &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiran%20civil%20war\"&gt;Kul Tiran civil war&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"witch\"&gt;witch&lt;/a&gt;es had started to go beyond constructing dark constructs, by conjuring the Drust physically through nightmarish rituals. They were stopped by the &lt;a href=\"Order%20of%20Embers\"&gt;Order of Embers&lt;/a&gt; before they could be unleashed upon Drustvar. Gorak Tul himself summoned many twisted Drust fiends during his confrontation with mortals at &lt;a href=\"Waycrest%20Manor\"&gt;Waycrest Manor&lt;/a&gt;, and while the Order of Embers had stopped them from being unleashed upon Drustvar, several could still be found stalking the area.\nBut Lady Waycrest was merely a vessel for Gorak Tul's power, and her death opened the &lt;a href=\"Rupture%20%28Waycrest%20Manor%29\"&gt;Rupture&lt;/a&gt;, the doorway for the Drust to enter Azeroth. At the Rupture Gorak Tul was able to raise his people from the dead, but he was slain nonetheless. However, upon his death Gorak Tul revealed that it was only a vessel and he still existed in the Blighted Lands. Even so, the Heartsbane Coven was broken and Drustvar was released from Gorak Tul's power.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Jaina%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Jaina Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt; was exiled to &lt;a href=\"Fate%27s%20End\"&gt;Fate's End&lt;/a&gt; by her own mother &lt;a href=\"Katherine%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Katherine&lt;/a&gt;, Gorak Tul captured her and dragged her into Thros. When the people of Kul Tiras sought to rescue Jaina and turned to the Drust &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; Ulfar for help, Gorak Tul attacked him and the &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; to whom he had taught the Drust's ways. Gorak Tul was not happy that Ulfar had shared their gifts with the humans, but Ulfar himself saw Gorak Tul's twisted ways as bringing disgrace to the Drust. Later, the &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Herald of Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; announced the return of the Drust's master to Katherine Proudmoore on her quest to find Jaina. Within Thros, Jaina was being tormented by memories of her past. After she was saved by her mother, Jaina and the adventurer slew Gorak Tul in his own domain.\nShadowlands.\nWith the drought weakening the guardians of &lt;a href=\"Ardenweald\"&gt;Ardenweald&lt;/a&gt;, the ancient Drust have seized the opportunity to invade from their nightmarish realm of Thros. The decaying groves of Ardenweald are what drew the Drust there. Using their twisted form of druidism to feed upon the dying groves, the Drust grow stronger with every &lt;a href=\"wildseed\"&gt;wildseed&lt;/a&gt; that perishes. Though relatively few in number, the Drust are using dark rituals to pull the native fae into their forces. Cursed to exist outside the cycle of life and death, the Drust now seek to circumvent their fate using Ardenweald's mechanisms of Rebirth. According to &lt;a href=\"Marasmius\"&gt;Marasmius&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"vorkai\"&gt;vorkai&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Janda\"&gt;Janda&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Zarkin\"&gt;Zarkin&lt;/a&gt;, the Drust had invaded Ardenweald before, long ago such that almost everyone has either forgotten or the story has become a myth to the &lt;a href=\"night%20fae\"&gt;night fae&lt;/a&gt;.\nTo save the &lt;a href=\"sylvar\"&gt;sylvar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gweyir\"&gt;Gweyir&lt;/a&gt; from a Drust curse, the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; is told by &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; to work with Ulfar, who she once knew. Ulfar directs the adventurer to his long-dead former teacher &lt;a href=\"Kivarr\"&gt;Kivarr&lt;/a&gt; with a fetish that contains Gorak Tul's power, who after saving her agrees to help but requires additional reagents, including a plant called &lt;a href=\"nox%20root\"&gt;nox root&lt;/a&gt; that only grows in Drust corrupted soil, and some other reagents from Ardenweald. Reagents from the Shadowlands are necessary in attempting to break a Drust curse. However, this was rendered moot as &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Zhar\"&gt;Gorak Zhar&lt;/a&gt;'s power was too great, thereby ensuring that there was no way to save those possessed by the Drust.\nAs part of the Drust gambit to attack the &lt;a href=\"Grove%20of%20Awakening\"&gt;Grove of Awakening&lt;/a&gt;, the captured &lt;a href=\"Ara%27lon\"&gt;Ara'lon&lt;/a&gt; was bent to Gorak Zhar's will. The Drust used their magic to make it seem as if Ara'lon was Gorak Zhar, which caused the Wild Hunt to focus their attention on the &lt;a href=\"Darkreach\"&gt;Darkreach&lt;/a&gt;. While the Wild Hunt battled Drust in the Darkreach, Gorak Zhar led her forces claiming the Grove of Awakening. Unbeknownst to the Drust, when Ara'lon was mortally wounded it broke their hold over him, and he revealed their ruse. The &lt;a href=\"Winter%20Queen\"&gt;Winter Queen&lt;/a&gt; subsequently led a counter-attack to reclaim the grove, which ended with Gorak Zhar's death, and the Drust pushed out of Ardenweald.\nVariants.\nThe Drust are originally vrykul. The &lt;a href=\"Thornspeakers\"&gt;Thornspeakers&lt;/a&gt; were the only remaining source of uncorrupted Drust; with the last surviving one being &lt;a href=\"Ulfar\"&gt;Ulfar&lt;/a&gt; (who does not leave his bear form). &lt;a href=\"Sef%20Iwen\"&gt;Sef Iwen&lt;/a&gt;'s ghost can be interacted with, and she resembles a vrykul.\nTheir leader &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt; called upon the power of &lt;a href=\"Thros%2C%20the%20Blighted%20Lands\"&gt;Thros, the Blighted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, which transformed Gorak Tul and his followers. Their appearance can vary but they all usually have tree-like growths and bark-like skin.\nFew Drust, such as &lt;a href=\"Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;, have a hulking bodytype, although Gorak Tul also had unique mutations such as his additional eyes and a sprawling mouth.\nMany Drust have a slender physique, like &lt;a href=\"Lorkron%20the%20Hunter\"&gt;Lorkron the Hunter&lt;/a&gt;, and their entire body and face is covered with the wood-like material. Their hair is flowing with Thros' energy. When night fae are possessed with a Drust mask for too long, they also turn into this type of Drust.\nMost Drust resemble fiends that crawl along the ground, such as the &lt;a href=\"Herald%20of%20Gorak%20Tul\"&gt;Herald of Gorak Tul&lt;/a&gt;. The magic of Thros seems to have warped them to the point that they hold little resemblance to their original vrykul forms, and to have seriously twisted their limbs and overtaken their head completely, replacing their mouth with a gaping maw. They are one of the few Drust seen on Azeroth, other than Gorak Tul and the Thornspeakers.\nDrust behemoths are giant monsters covered with the wood material who walk with all four limbs, such as &lt;a href=\"Drust%20Boughbreaker\"&gt;Drust Boughbreaker&lt;/a&gt;s.\nFemale Drust can also appear as &lt;a href=\"Matron\"&gt;Matron&lt;/a&gt;-like, floating women stained with the energy of Thros, though they don't have the tree-like qualities that most Drust possess.\nDrust skeletons, such as the &lt;a href=\"Vengeful%20Bones\"&gt;Vengeful Bones&lt;/a&gt;, can be seen around their former lands in &lt;a href=\"Drustvar\"&gt;Drustvar&lt;/a&gt;.\nDrust spirits summoned by the &lt;a href=\"Heartsbane%20Coven\"&gt;Heartsbane Coven&lt;/a&gt; have also been imbued into &lt;a href=\"wicker%20construct\"&gt;wicker construct&lt;/a&gt;s."}

He argued that since life had taken root in the cosmos once before, perhaps it would do so again. Horrified by this idea, Eonar reminded Sargeras that the Pantheon had sworn to protect all life when possible, and that nothing could be so dire that it would require systemic extinction of all living things.\nSome time later, &lt;a href=\"Aggramar\"&gt;Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken Sargeras' place as defender of the Pantheon, discovered an extremely powerful world-soul slumbering in a distant corner of the Great Dark. Unfortunately, it was being corrupted by the Old Gods. When he returned to the Pantheon with this information, he urged his fellow titans to save the world-soul, which would later become known as &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Eonar was quick to side with Aggramar, and she managed to convince the other titans that were this new titan to grow to maturity, it would be strong enough to neutralize the void lords once and for all; but more than that, Azeroth was their sibling, and they could not let a member of their own family fall into the clutches of the &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt;. The Pantheon were moved by the Life-Binder's words, and agreed to take the fight to the Old Gods.\nAs the titans' colossal forms made it nearly impossible to take action directly without severely harming the nascent world-soul, instead the Pantheon decided to craft an army of servants \u2014 the &lt;a href=\"titan-forged\"&gt;titan-forged&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 to do battle in their stead. Each member of the Pantheon imbued a number of these servants with their specific powers and likenesses; Eonar gave &lt;a href=\"Freya\"&gt;Keeper Freya&lt;/a&gt; command over Azeroth's flora and fauna. After the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, Eonar channeled her power through Freya and into &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt;, gifting them respectively with powers over life and the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, transforming them into the noble &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;; Alexstrasza herself would be known as the greatest of the dragons, as well as the Life-Binder, and her &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; would fight to protect and safeguard all life just as Eonar had.\nLike the rest of the Pantheon, Eonar's spirit was launched into the &lt;a href=\"Great%20Dark\"&gt;Great Dark&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Norgannon\"&gt;Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; during their confrontation with &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, as their physical form was obliterated by the Dark Titan, near the world of &lt;a href=\"Nihilam\"&gt;Nihilam&lt;/a&gt;. The spirits slammed into the Keepers of Azeroth.\nLegion.\nEonar's spirit apparently traveled to &lt;a href=\"Elunaria\"&gt;Elunaria&lt;/a&gt;, where she remained hidden from Sargeras and the Burning Legion for millennia. After the Burning Legion finally discovered and invaded her refuge, the &lt;a href=\"Elarian%20Sanctuary\"&gt;Elarian Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;, Sargeras seeking to use Eonar's gifts of nature and growth to make his Legion unstoppable, she reached out to &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the Speaker of Azeroth's world-soul, asking him to save her from their overwhelming forces.\nAfter the Legion is successfully repelled, and the other Pantheon members liberated from the Legion's clutches, Eonar reunited with her long-lost brethren at the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20the%20Pantheon\"&gt;Seat of the Pantheon&lt;/a&gt;, and assisted Azeroth's heroes against &lt;a href=\"Argus%20%28titan%29\"&gt;Argus the Unmaker&lt;/a&gt;. When Argus killed the heroes near the end of the fight, she managed to revive them by summoning a massive tree called the &lt;a href=\"Gift%20of%20the%20Lifebinder\"&gt;Gift of the Lifebinder&lt;/a&gt;. After Argus is finally defeated, Sargeras struck out at Azeroth and wounded her heavily in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. Immediately thereafter, the Pantheon combined their powers with the last remnant of Argus's essence, and imprisoned him within the Seat of the Pantheon, Eonar personally helping end his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Crusade\"&gt;Burning Crusade&lt;/a&gt; against all &lt;a href=\"life\"&gt;life&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, who stayed behind while his comrades left, serves as Sargeras's jailer.\nIn the RPG.\nEonar is a female &lt;a href=\"Vanir\"&gt;Vanir&lt;/a&gt; titan. Her classes are &lt;a href=\"Healer\"&gt;Healer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Druid%20of%20the%20Wild\"&gt;Druid of the Wild&lt;/a&gt;. She wields a staff named &lt;a href=\"Seschenal\"&gt;Seschenal&lt;/a&gt;.\nEonar is the physical representation of life, nature and healing in the universe; she revels in the joy and bliss in all worlds. She is &lt;a href=\"Aman%27Thul\"&gt;Aman'Thul&lt;/a&gt;'s consort, and had a long, bitter feud with his brother &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; before the latter's fall from grace; her presence and personal strength exacerbated the conflict between Aman'Thul and his dark brother. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; first assaulted &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, Eonar combated the demons by infusing the world's native &lt;a href=\"dragons\"&gt;dragons&lt;/a&gt; with the power to battle the Legion.

Epic quality items can be found in end-game instances, from various professions, world drops, and reputation purchases. \nAlthough Legendary is one step higher, Epic may often be considered the best in the game. This is due to three reasons: first of all, given how most players will hardly ever see, much less wield a item, Epic items will comprise the \"normal\" &lt;a href=\"BiS\"&gt;BiS&lt;/a&gt;-items a player may acquire. Secondly, due to the rare frequency of implementation of Legendary items, many Epic items will often be better than the game's current best Legendary. Third, it is impossible to dress up a character in only Legendary items. This is partly because of the low number of Legendary items in the game, and partly because most of them are weapons. For example, the boots and gloves of a &lt;a href=\"end-game\"&gt;end-game&lt;/a&gt; character will always be Epic, no matter how hardcore the player may be, because there never has and likely will never be any Legendary gloves and boots.\nMany Epics are part of the &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Sets\"&gt;Armor Sets&lt;/a&gt;, which are coordinated sets of class-specific armor that provide excellent bonuses. These are frequently referred to as &lt;a href=\"Tier%200\"&gt;Tier 0&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tier%201\"&gt;Tier 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tier%203\"&gt;Tier 3&lt;/a&gt;, etc. "}

Epoch Hunter appears after you have escorted Thrall to &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; and found &lt;a href=\"Taretha%20Foxton\"&gt;Taretha&lt;/a&gt; inside the inn.\nEpoch Hunter is voiced by &lt;a href=\"Michael%20McConnohie\"&gt;Michael McConnohie&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The mysteriously-named Epoch Hunter is an assassin from the infinite dragonflight sent to alter the course of history by killing Thrall before he can escape from &lt;a href=\"Durnholde\"&gt;Durnholde&lt;/a&gt;. The shadowy drake has slain countless beings in service of his cause, but this will be his most important kill. He will summon every ounce of his strength, power, subtlety, and cunning to bring about the end of this timeline.\"\nAttacks and Abilities.\nThis fight starts with Epoch Hunter swooping in from above. He keeps flying over Tarren Mill, but he is not attackable at first. He will send 3 waves of &lt;a href=\"add\"&gt;add&lt;/a&gt;s.\nWave 1: trash, west\nWave 2: trash, south\nWave 3: trash, west\nIntermission\nWave 4: Epoch Hunter, west\nStrategies.\nThis is a longer fight than any of the other bosses in this encounter, so healing and mana users be ready. (Be sure Evocation, Innervate, and Shadowfiend are off cooldown.)\nDefeat the three waves of adds as you did in the barn, church, and inn. They are affected by all forms of CC that work on Dragonkin. The Defilers, which love to hang back and spam Shadowbolt, are an excellent target for &lt;a href=\"Hibernate\"&gt;Hibernate&lt;/a&gt;.\nBoss\nSeeing as he has a nasty knockback, he is best tanked near the northwestern small house of Tarren Mill, under the outside roof of it. This way, the tank can grab aggro quickly again. Watch out for his breath, and healers should watch out for his DoT. After he is dead, Old Hillsbrad Foothills will do its last little cinematic. \nFor the entire instance, Thrall can die nineteen times and the encounter can be reset from the Keep, outside Tarren Mill, or beside Taretha ,depending on how far through you are. (Prior to &lt;a href=\"Patch%202.2.0\"&gt;Patch 2.2.0&lt;/a&gt;, Thrall could only die twice.)\nImportant note! If Thrall does die the last time and you have reached the last boss, the boss will be found hovering in the center of town. Thrall is dead. You can engage the boss and fight as normal, but since Thrall must strike the killing blow, the boss will persist indefinitely at 1% health. He will also taunt you by saying that Thrall is dead and \"you lose\". Save your strength (and your repair bill) and reset the instance after your twentieth failure. (This is unconfirmed since Patch 2.2.0.)\nWhen Thrall dies, you must walk back into the inn and find him upstairs. Talk to him to start the boss fight again.\nQuotes.\nEpoch Hunter, like others of the infinite brood, has a deep voice that echoes and rasps."}

Typically this is done by either dragging the item from the &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; to the paper doll window or (assuming no &lt;a href=\"vendor\"&gt;vendor&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; window is open) right-clicking on the item in the inventory.\n&lt;a href=\"Bag\"&gt;Bag&lt;/a&gt;s are equipped by placing them in a bag slot, including in a &lt;a href=\"bank\"&gt;bank&lt;/a&gt; bag slot.\nThe phrase &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Equip\"&gt;Bind on Equip&lt;/a&gt; refers to items that &lt;a href=\"Soulbound\"&gt;bind&lt;/a&gt; when used in the manner above.\nAvailable Equip Slots.\nThe following slots are available on the Player character's paper doll:\nEquip Slot Limitations.\nThe equip slots have various limitations:\nArmor Limitations.\n&lt;a href=\"Item\"&gt;Item&lt;/a&gt;s intended for the Head, Shoulder, Chest, Hands, Wrists, Legs, Waist and Feet slots are considered &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt;. You can equip items from your &lt;a href=\"inventory\"&gt;inventory&lt;/a&gt; in these slots if your &lt;a href=\"class\"&gt;class&lt;/a&gt; is allowed to wear that kind of armor:\nSee the &lt;a href=\"Armor\"&gt;Armor&lt;/a&gt; entry for more information.\nThe Neck, Back, Finger and Trinket slots are not considered armor and aren't limited to certain classes because of their material. However, Back items are always considered to be made of Cloth by the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, which considers Neck, Finger and Trinket items to be Miscellaneous.\nWeapon Limitations.\nThe Main Hand, Off Hand, Ranged Weapon and Ammunition slots are collectively considered the weapon slots, although the Off Hand slot may be used for weapons, shields, or other miscellaneous items.\nThere are several types of &lt;a href=\"weapon\"&gt;weapon&lt;/a&gt;s in World of Warcraft, and each one has a weapon &lt;a href=\"Skills\"&gt;skill&lt;/a&gt; associated with it. You can only equip a weapon if you have the weapon skill for its weapon type. Some weapon skills your class will start with; others can be learned from &lt;a href=\"Class%20Trainer\"&gt;class trainer&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Weapon%20Masters\"&gt;weapon trainer&lt;/a&gt;s (possibly requiring you to reach a minimum level before you can learn them); some classes may not be able to learn some weapon skills at all. See &lt;a href=\"Per%20Class%20Proficiencies\"&gt;Per Class Proficiencies&lt;/a&gt; for more information.\nSome one-handed weapons' tooltips will say \"Main Hand,\" meaning that you won't be able to equip them in your Off Hand slot, only the Main Hand one. Some weapons (and other miscellaneous items) will actually say \"Off Hand,\" meaning they can't be equipped in the Main Hand slot (although this is rare). Most often, one-handed weapons will allow you to equip them in either the Main Hand or Off Hand slot as you wish, although you must have the &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Wield\"&gt;Dual Wield&lt;/a&gt; skill (available only to hunters, rogues, enhancement shamans, and warriors) to equip two weapons at once.\nTwo-handed weapons such as &lt;a href=\"Staff\"&gt;staves&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"polearm\"&gt;polearm&lt;/a&gt;s, two-handed &lt;a href=\"mace\"&gt;mace&lt;/a&gt;s and two-handed &lt;a href=\"sword\"&gt;sword&lt;/a&gt;s can be equipped (given the appropriate weapon skill) in the Main Hand slot. If you do this, any items you had in either your Main Hand or Off Hand slot will be moved to your bags, because you cannot equip a two-handed weapon and an off-hand item.\nYou may equip a &lt;a href=\"Ranged\"&gt;ranged weapon&lt;/a&gt; in the Ranged slot if you have the necessary weapon skill -- hunters, rogues, and warriors can learn to use &lt;a href=\"bow\"&gt;bow&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"gun\"&gt;gun&lt;/a&gt;s, while mages, priests and warlocks start out with the ability to use &lt;a href=\"wand\"&gt;wand&lt;/a&gt;s. If you equip a bow or gun, you must also equip a type of &lt;a href=\"ammunition\"&gt;ammunition&lt;/a&gt; in the Ammunition slot next to the Ranged Weapon slot, or you will be unable to shoot. Wands do not require ammunition. Note that druids, paladins and shamans can never learn to use ranged weapons; in &lt;a href=\"Patch%201.10%20%28Release%20Notes%29\"&gt;Patch 1.10&lt;/a&gt; these classes will have a &lt;a href=\"Relic\"&gt;Relic&lt;/a&gt; slot instead.\nShield Limitations.\nIf you have the &lt;a href=\"shield\"&gt;shield&lt;/a&gt; proficiency, you can equip a shield in the Off Hand slot. Equipping a shield is just like equipping any other Off Hand item -- if you equip one, you cannot have a two-handed weapon equipped at the same time, and you will be reminded of this if you attempt to equip a shield when you have a two-handed weapon already equipped.\nClass Limitations.\nOver and above any other limitations, some items are explicitly limited to certain classes. For example, items of each class's &lt;a href=\"Tier%200.5\"&gt;Tier 0.5&lt;/a&gt; armor set &lt;a href=\"Tiers%23Armor\"&gt;and higher&lt;/a&gt; cannot be equipped by anyone not of the class for which the item is intended. There are a few other class-limited items as well.\nSkill Limitations.\nSome items require one of your &lt;a href=\"Profession\"&gt;trade skill&lt;/a&gt;s to be greater than or equal to a certain level in order to equip an item. The most common examples of this are the various trinkets produced by &lt;a href=\"Engineering\"&gt;Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, which almost always require some level of Engineering to equip.\nRank Limitations.\nThe &lt;a href=\"PvP\"&gt;PvP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Honor%20System\"&gt;Honor System&lt;/a&gt; has a number of items that can be purchased if you reach a certain &lt;a href=\"Ranking\"&gt;Rank&lt;/a&gt;. Once purchased, you may equip these items if your maximum rank matches or exceeds the rank requirement on the item, even if your rank decays and your current rank is lower than the requirement.\nReputation Limitations.\nCertain items require you to have a minimum &lt;a href=\"Reputation\"&gt;Reputation&lt;/a&gt; with one of the world's many &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;s in order for you to equip them.\nCombat.\nIf you are in &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;, you cannot equip or unequip armor. Weapons, however, can be equipped or unequipped, causing a &lt;a href=\"global%20cooldown\"&gt;global cooldown&lt;/a&gt;.\nCooldowns.\nSome equippable items with active effects, especially &lt;a href=\"trinket\"&gt;trinket&lt;/a&gt;s, cannot be used immediately after you equip them -- instead, there will be a &lt;a href=\"cooldown\"&gt;cooldown&lt;/a&gt; (typically 30 seconds) before they can be activated."}

However, a change in &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.2.0\"&gt;Patch 3.2.0&lt;/a&gt; allows you to view item level on equipment by changing the &lt;a href=\"Interface\"&gt;Interface&lt;/a&gt; settings, making add-ons for such a purpose redundant.
