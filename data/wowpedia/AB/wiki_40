The term podcast, like \"radio,\" can mean both the content and the method of delivery. The host or author of a podcast is often called a podcaster. Though podcasters' web sites may also offer direct download or streaming of their files, a podcast is distinguished by its ability to be downloaded automatically using software capable of reading RSS or Atom feeds. \nUsually a podcast features one type of \u201cshow,\u201d with new episodes released either sporadically or at planned intervals such as daily or weekly. In addition, there are podcast networks that feature multiple shows on the same feed. \nEven before the World of Warcraft was live, &lt;a href=\"WoW%20Radio\"&gt;WoW Radio&lt;/a&gt; was on the air talking about the game. In time, other early podcasts started up like &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcast\"&gt;World of Warcast&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.taverncast.com/\"&gt;Taverncast&lt;/a&gt;, and World of Podcast. Some of these early podcasts are still updating, some have changed subject matter, and others have &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/02/70171\"&gt;podfaded&lt;/a&gt;. Today, Warcraft has over seventy active podcasts produced mostly in English but also French, Russian, Swedish, etc. \nPopular WoW podcasts of note are: All Things Azeroth, Auction House Junkies, Blizzard Watch, Convert To Raid, Lore Watch, Outlandish, The Instance, The Rawrcast Show, Twisted Nether Blogcast, and World of Warcast. These podcasts as well as the others on the list cover a variety of topics such as gold making, raiding, lore, news of the week, guilds, and much more. \nList.\nNon-English podcasts.\nThese podcasts are all currently being updated and in the language under which they are listed."}

They are members of the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primal&lt;/a&gt; faction.\nBackground.\nIn the aftermath of &lt;a href=\"Botaan\"&gt;Botaan&lt;/a&gt;'s destruction, spores from the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt;'s corpse settled in the wilds, giving sentience to existing forms of plants. The jungles stirred as new beings took shape and walked the land, among which were the small and simpleminded podlings and &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;s.\nA number of 's indigenous species blur the line between plant and animal, and the so-called podlings are the most vicious and chaotic of their ilk. Small and seemingly harmless, they work together to capture their prey, attacking only when they have numerical superiority. Explorers who pay attention to the color of podlings' flowering buds can ascertain whether they favor poison, ensnaring, or physical attacks to incapacitate their victims. Once podlings have overwhelmed their quarry, they will drag the unlucky creature down into the weeds to fertilize a new generation. The clear lesson for adventurers: looks can be deceiving!\nPodlings appear in a wide range of bright and eye-catching colours. Lively creatures with an aggressive demeanour, podlings often use simple spear-like weapons \u2014 crudely adorned with thorns and twigs \u2014 to attack enemies. Usually found in groups, these tiny warriors do not seem afraid of taking on prey several times larger than themselves. Podlings are capable of overwhelming and devouring &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and other larger &lt;a href=\"humanoid\"&gt;humanoid&lt;/a&gt;s. Podlings also lay traps for prey such as &lt;a href=\"squirrel\"&gt;squirrel&lt;/a&gt;s, rooting them in place until the podlings return.\nPodlings are able to communicate with the other races, including those from Azeroth, but speak in slightly broken language. Some podlings such as &lt;a href=\"Phlox\"&gt;Phlox&lt;/a&gt; have been known to speak exclusively in rhyme.\nSome say the podlings of &lt;a href=\"Gloomshade%20Grove\"&gt;Gloomshade Grove&lt;/a&gt; bow to the mad king of the east, &lt;a href=\"Mad%20%22King%22%20Sporeon\"&gt;Mad \"King\" Sporeon&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe \"&lt;a href=\"Star%20Root%20Sniffer\"&gt;Star Root Sniffer&lt;/a&gt;\" podlings of &lt;a href=\"Ashran\"&gt;Ashran&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Gorian%20Falls\"&gt;Gorian Falls&lt;/a&gt; seem to be drawn to the &lt;a href=\"Star%20Root%20Tuber\"&gt;Star Root Tuber&lt;/a&gt; that grows there.\nA group of podlings, driven mad by &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt; energy, is found attacking the &lt;a href=\"Gardens%20of%20Unity\"&gt;Gardens of Unity&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Thaldraszus\"&gt;Thaldraszus&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Isles\"&gt;Dragon Isles&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nSporelings.\nWhile fungi are not actually a type of plant (despite common misconception), the podlings of can be seen dancing around an image of a &lt;a href=\"sporeling\"&gt;sporeling&lt;/a&gt;, projected by , hinting at some sort of connection. Kurri exclaims, hinting that podlings may have become sporelings, likely due to being infected by the &lt;a href=\"Zangar%20encroachment\"&gt;Zangar encroachment&lt;/a&gt; (seemingly despite their apparent allergy to spores). This seems to be supported by Blizzard's statement that the sporelings were not always mushroom creatures."}

You'll notice that faster weapons will give you a benefit here.\nFormulae for % chance to apply poison every second, based on your main / off hand weapon speed / talents / sword spec and equipment.\nAlso see: &lt;a href=\"Attack%20speed\"&gt;Attack speed&lt;/a&gt; &amp; &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt;\nApplication improvement modifiers.\nExtra attacks.\nThere are several extra attack modifiers in the game, some affect both your main and off hand. All extra attacks granted (even from offhand swing procs) are main hand swings, thus greatly increasing the main hand's chance to apply a poison. Also, all instant attacks (Riposte, Sinister Strike, Hemmorage) swing your main hand weapon.\nNote: The weapon effects ( Thrash + Sword spec + HoJ, etc ) do not stack, instead they are each calculated seperately. Meaning you have a 5% chance to get an extra attack from sword spec, and also a 2% chance to get an extra attack from HoJ, and also a 20% chance to get an extra attack from Windfury. Overall, the chance of getting at least one extra attack on a swing is 1 - (95% * 98% * 80%) = 25.52%. The good thing about this is that they can also all happen at the same time (5% * 2% * 20% = 0.02% chance of this), thus resulting in 3 extra attacks. \nIncreased poison application chance.\nTalents and gear bonuses to improve the success rate of applying a poison all stack together. So, if your base chance is 20%, you can get +10-15% from talents, +5% from the bloodfang set and +30% from the Venomous totem found in Blackwing Lair. Making a total of (20+(10-15)+5+30) 65% for instant poison, and 70% for deadly poison.\nIf you make a rough estimate that (at 100 energy) you can do 5 attacks in the first 2 seconds, then that would amount to 3-4 applications of poison. Instant poison rank 6 (112 to 148) would cause 336-592 damage during that time.\nFormulae.\nPoison_Proc% = Base% + Talent_Improve% + Gear_Improved%\nOff Hand Weapon.\nOff hand poison procs are a linear calculation so this part should be pretty straightforward.\nFormulae.\nOffhand_Modified_Attack_Speed = Offhand_Base_Weapon_Speed * Speed_Increments\nOffhand_Attacks_Per_Second = 1 / Offhand_Modified_Attack_Speed\nTable.\nOffhand Speed (Top row)\n1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\nNormal Proc % (Left column)\n20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\nProc % ( in center of table )\nMain Hand Weapon.\nFormulae.\nOffhand_Extra_Attack_Chance = (( Sword_Spec% * HoJ% * Windfury%) * 100% )-1\nOffhand_Triggered_Attacks_Per_Second = Offhand_Attacks_Per_Second * Offhand_Extra_Attack_Chance\nMainhand_Extra_Attack_Chance = (((Thrash or IronFoe) * Sword_Spec% * HoJ% * Windfury%) * 100% )-1\nMainhand_Modified_Attack_Speed = Mainhand_Base_Weapon_Speed / &lt;a href=\"Haste\"&gt;Haste&lt;/a&gt; (x%) / Slice_n_Dice (30%) / Blade_Flurry (20%) / Troll Berserking (10-30%) / Anything else\nMainhand_Attacks_Per_Second = 1 / Mainhand_Modified_Attack_Speed\nMainhand_Extra_Attacks_Per_Second = ( Mainhand_Attacks_Per_Second * Mainhand_Extra_Attack_Chance ) + Offhand_Triggered_Attacks_Per_Second\nMainhand_Modified_Attacks_Per_Second = (Mainhand_Attacks_Per_Second + Mainhand_Extra_Attacks_Per_Second ) \nMainhand_Procs_Per_second = Poison_Proc% * Mainhand_Modified_Attacks_Per_Second\nTable.\nMainhand Speed (Left column)\n1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\nOffhand Speed (Top row)\n1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7 2.8 2.9\nProc % ( in center of table )"}

{"id": "12921", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=12921", "title": "Poisons", "text": "Poisons are abilities that enable Assassination &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;s to coat their weapons with poisons. When a poisoned weapon strikes an enemy it has a chance of applying a &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt; that damages, slows, or otherwise hinders the enemy, depending on the poison applied. First available at level 2, poisons are a core part of the Assassination rogue and their use is required to maximize effectiveness in most situations.\nPoisons are considered a temporary (1-hour) weapon &lt;a href=\"enhancement\"&gt;enhancement&lt;/a&gt;. Poisons do not stack with other temporary weapon effects such as a &lt;a href=\"Blacksmithing\"&gt;Blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"sharpening%20stone\"&gt;sharpening stone&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"weightstone\"&gt;weightstone&lt;/a&gt;s or &lt;a href=\"Alchemist\"&gt;Alchemist&lt;/a&gt;'s oils. Only one such temporary weapon enchantment can be active on a weapon at a time.\nSome rogue abilities and specializations increase the effectiveness of poisons.\nPoisons.\nPoisons are learned by the rogue as they level, either automatically or via talents. A rogue can only have one Non-Lethal and one Lethal type of poison at the same time.\nImprovements.\nThe following abilities, talents, and items directly relate to Rogue poisons:\nWeapon speed.\nFaster weapons do not always increase the rate at which you apply a poison: unlike the other poisons (which have a fixed chance per hit), &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison\"&gt;Wound Poison&lt;/a&gt; use PPM (proc-per-minute) mechanics. This means that even on a very slow weapon your Wound Poisons will add the same amount of DPS (damage per second) as on a fast weapon.\nThe argument for using slower weapons is this: based on your weapon speed and your poison's PPM, an average proc chance is calculated that will be used every melee swing. However, your special attacks (Sinister Strikes, Mutilates, etc.) can also deliver your poisons, and they use this very same calculated proc chance. So equipping a slow weapon results in an increased chance of applying poison with your special attacks, which, of course, are not restricted by your weapon speed. The difference in damage is rather minimal though, so people often just follow the \"slow MH, fast OH\" because they could always put Crippling/Deadly/Mind-Numbing on their OH without much-reduced effect.\nHistorical.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%203.0.2\"&gt;patch 3.0.2&lt;/a&gt;, Rogues made their own poisons using a Poisons skill. &lt;a href=\"Poison%20reagents\"&gt;Poison ingredients&lt;/a&gt; were purchased at Shady Dealers or reagent vendors, found in junkboxes obtained through &lt;a href=\"Pickpocket\"&gt;Pickpocket&lt;/a&gt;ing, or gathered with &lt;a href=\"Herbalism\"&gt;Herbalism&lt;/a&gt;. Once you had the Poisons skill, you had to level it like a profession. You had a skill level that you could increase by making poisons that still gave skill. Unlike professions, you did not need to purchase the ability to skill up beyond the 75, 150, 225, and 300 limits. Instead, your current skill limit was simply five times your current level. There was no poisons trainer; instead you learned new poisons from the Rogue trainer, subject to meeting the level and skill prerequisites. Poisons did not count towards your two-profession limit, despite its similarities to other professions. As of the time of their removal, there were seven ingredients and six poison recipes: &lt;a href=\"Crippling%20Poison%20%28item%29\"&gt;Crippling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mind-numbing%20Poison%20%28item%29\"&gt;Mind-Numbing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Instant%20Poison%20%28item%29\"&gt;Instant&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deadly%20Poison%20%28item%29\"&gt;Deadly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wound%20Poison%20%28item%29\"&gt;Wound&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Anesthetic%20Poison\"&gt;Anesthetic&lt;/a&gt;. Most of these types would continue to exist in some form in later expansions but sold ready to use directly from the vendor.\nPreviously Rogues could buy &lt;a href=\"Anesthetic%20Poison\"&gt;Anesthetic Poison&lt;/a&gt;, which was used to dispel &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; effects. In &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; the ability to dispel enrage effects was built into &lt;a href=\"Shiv\"&gt;Shiv&lt;/a&gt;, making this poison obsolete. It is no longer sold by common vendors, although you can still buy a non-functional version from Jeeves (likely a bug).\nAfter &lt;a href=\"patch%205.0.4\"&gt;patch 5.0.4&lt;/a&gt; the items were completely removed from &lt;a href=\"poison%20vendor\"&gt;poison vendor&lt;/a&gt;s and made into an ability.\nQuests.\nFormerly, the quest chains detailed below were required for all rogues to access Poisons\u2014this is no longer the case and the ability becomes available for purchase upon reaching level 10. The quests remain, however, as Rogue-only quests.\nGo to the Old Town in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. Master Mathias Shaw at headquarters offers the first quest in the chain, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20and%20the%20Defias\"&gt;Mathias and the Defias&lt;/a&gt;. The quest takes you to a tower on the southern border of &lt;a href=\"Westfall\"&gt;Westfall&lt;/a&gt; near &lt;a href=\"Stranglethorn%20Vale\"&gt;Stranglethorn Vale&lt;/a&gt;, along the river, and requires a skill level of 70 in &lt;a href=\"Lockpicking\"&gt;Lockpicking&lt;/a&gt; to complete. After completing &lt;a href=\"Klaven%27s%20Tower%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Klaven's Tower (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, the second quest in the chain, you will gain the ability to buy poisons.\nGo to the &lt;a href=\"Cleft%20of%20Shadow\"&gt;Cleft of Shadow&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; and complete &lt;a href=\"The%20Shattered%20Salute\"&gt;The Shattered Salute&lt;/a&gt;. The Horde quest chain is difficult to solo at level 20, but two level-20 characters or a solo Rogue around level 23 should be able to complete it. The two main quests (including which requires a skill level of 70 in Lockpicking to complete) in the chain take you to a tower in the northeast corner of the &lt;a href=\"Barrens\"&gt;Barrens&lt;/a&gt;. When the quest objectives are completed, the Rogue will be poisoned with a very slow-acting poison &lt;a href=\"debuff\"&gt;debuff&lt;/a&gt;. After turning in the quest at the Cleft of Shadow, the Rogue travels to &lt;a href=\"Tarren%20Mill\"&gt;Tarren Mill&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt;, where s/he will be cured of the poison debuff (though the poison is easily curable through a variety of other means as well) and gain the right to buy poisons."}

It is also a center for training loyal peasants in their particular vocations, whether it be lumber harvesting, building construction, or gold mining. In time the town hall can be upgraded to stronger fortifications.\nHigh elven and blood elven town hall.\nThe Town Hall helped the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; to fend off &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; as he tried to attack their capital city of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; in ' by serving as a returning point for gold and training units. However, the Town Hall couldn't be built by the &lt;a href=\"Peasant%20%28high%20elf%29\"&gt;High elf worker&lt;/a&gt; unit likely due to the limited ability of the map editor prior to the ' expansion. With the addition of \"The Frozen Throne\" expansion's map editor, it is possible to make additional groups with building orders.\nThe town hall also helped the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20the%20Blood%20Elves\"&gt;Curse of the Blood Elves&lt;/a&gt; campaign in The Frozen Throne.

Some &lt;a href=\"Mag%27har%20orc\"&gt;Mag'har orc&lt;/a&gt;s town halls are also still standing, and the Azerothian orcs are back at using a Town Hall in &lt;a href=\"Frostwall\"&gt;Frostwall&lt;/a&gt;, even though &lt;a href=\"Serka\"&gt;Serka&lt;/a&gt; refers to it as a &lt;a href=\"Great%20hall\"&gt;Great hall&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt; has a &lt;a href=\"City%20Hall\"&gt;City Hall&lt;/a&gt;.

Located in the Townlong Steppes, they devour everything in their path in order to build their own crystalline empire of ruthless warriors and scheming feudal lords. The &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; are left reeling when the mantid's hundred-year cycle of aggression kicks off ten years too early and their greatest warriors burst through the great wall. The beleaguered pandaren must now face the worst swarm in recorded history while trying to isolate the cause of the mantid's erratic behavior.\"\nThe events in Townlong directly follow up on what happened in &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. There, &lt;a href=\"Taran%20Zhu\"&gt;Taran Zhu&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt;, had become overwhelmed by the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Hatred\"&gt;Sha of Hatred&lt;/a&gt;. The rescue at the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt; is an important moment for Taran-Zhu; he'll finally see the value that the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; bring to &lt;a href=\"Pandaria\"&gt;Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;, and players will have earned a staunch ally.\nThe story picks up from there. In Townlong Steppes, Taran-Zhu is tracking down his nemesis, the elusive Sha of Hatred that's blasted its way across the zone. You'll get to ride with the vanguard with the Shado-Pan vanguard, but they've got a lot of ground to cover. The Steppes are home to the &lt;a href=\"Yaungol\"&gt;Yaungol&lt;/a&gt;, who are still on the warpath. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href=\"mantid\"&gt;mantid&lt;/a&gt; are encroaching from the south. The sacred &lt;a href=\"Niuzao%20Temple\"&gt;Niuzao Temple&lt;/a&gt; is under siege, and a splinter sect of &lt;a href=\"Mogu\"&gt;Mogu&lt;/a&gt; are trying to create their own dark demigod on an island off the coast.\nEventually, the mantid assault on Niuzao Temple and Townlong was discontinued with the death of &lt;a href=\"Grand%20Empress%20Shek%27zeer\"&gt;Grand Empress Shek'zeer&lt;/a&gt;. Next, the Shan'ze Mogu led by the dreaded &lt;a href=\"Shan%20Bu\"&gt;Shan Bu&lt;/a&gt; besieged Niuzao Temple. Mogu siege engines managed to break through the Pandaren defenders, nearly annihilating them in the process. After the Shan'ze occupied the inner courtyards, Shan Bu himself entered the temple and put Niuzao under a spell. After Niuzao refused to give up, Shan Bu ordered the watching Mogu and cloud serpents to launch a final assault on the defenders. However, the mogu failed in their assault, and were driven off of Niuzao Island. Shan Bu and the Shan'ze simply returned to the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; and formed up with &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;'s enormous legions. Shan Bu left some Mogu behind to secure Shan'ze Dao for the Thunder King.\nGetting there.\nTownlong Steppes is accessed on foot via the &lt;a href=\"Ox%20Gate\"&gt;Ox Gate&lt;/a&gt; in western &lt;a href=\"Kun-Lai%20Summit\"&gt;Kun-Lai Summit&lt;/a&gt;. From there, travel south across the zone to cross in to the &lt;a href=\"Dread%20Wastes\"&gt;Dread Wastes&lt;/a&gt; either via the &lt;a href=\"Shallowstep%20Pass\"&gt;Shallowstep Pass&lt;/a&gt; next to the &lt;a href=\"Serpent%27s%20Spine\"&gt;Serpent's Spine&lt;/a&gt; in the east, or the &lt;a href=\"Dusklight%20Bridge\"&gt;Dusklight Bridge&lt;/a&gt; far to the west.\nGeography.\nThe contiguous areas of the steppes consist of grass-covered hills sprinkled with red-leafed trees. The northeastern areas are more sparse, with great rocky crags, mostly taken by the yaungol. A deep divide separates the bulk of the steppes from the Dread Wastes, and within this divide is a marsh and river that leads out to the sea. There is also a small pocket of bog or marsh situated in the eastern side of the steppes, south of Longying Outpost.\nThere are a handful of islands that make up the western half of the steppes. The southwestern-most and western island are both taken by the mantid, with their great central trees and pod-like architecture. The Niuzao Temple island is indicative of the grassy hills of the greater steppes, though the mantid have infiltrated here, as well as the sha in the catacombs beneath the temple. The northern-most island has the most caves and is home to sprites and cloud serpents, dotted with ancient ruins. More steep hills can be found here, as well as a heavy mogu presence.\nQuests.\nThe four &lt;a href=\"August%20Celestials\"&gt;August Celestials&lt;/a&gt; of Pandaria need your help, but never all at once. Here in Townlong, the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Ox\"&gt;Black Ox&lt;/a&gt; will need a hand as well. On some days he'll rest quietly at the temple while you complete missions in the surrounding terrain. But on alternate days &lt;a href=\"Niuzao\"&gt;Niuzao&lt;/a&gt; will be on the warpath, actively defending his temple from a mantid assault. If you're clever, you'll lure the mantid into his rampage and he'll help you slaughter them in big groups. "}

Be sure to take precautions to avoid this, such as only trading with reputable players and taking steps to verify that the player is actually capable of performing the desired enhancement.

Goblin captains command vessels for the Trade Fleets or for private merchants.\nAbout 200 years before the First War, the beginnings of Trade Fleets sailed out of Kezan and into the world. Goblins, always the opportunists, chose war as the perfect opportunity to cash in some gold and began building their trade empire during the First War.\nA captain runs a single ship, and some run entire Trade Fleets under a trade prince. Admirals are assigned to run more than one Trade Fleet. Occasionally a captain runs his own private merchant vessel, though he still pays taxes to the trade princes.\nThe Trade Fleets are outfitted with the most fanatical and destructive creatures on Azeroth. The average person wonders why the trade princes require such powerful armies, if they are holding to their neutrality stance. It certainly seems excessive. The simple truth is, the forces are not excessive. The life of those living on the South Seas is harsh, due to attacks from everything from pirates to rogue magical beasts.\nThe Trade Fleets require extreme guards. Undermine's goods sail everywhere, especially into hostile or desolate territories to make a coin. Simply put, goblins go to dangerous places. Without strong guards, there would be no trade, because there would be only dead traders."}

Zanagan describes Donais as a \"loudmouth\" and also suggests that he wasn't a real trade prince. Donais used his massive wealth to fund his funeral and personally picked out the musicians and refreshments that would be present. His coffin was ferried to the burial site by dancing pallbearers. Laborers had some difficulty obtaining the mountain of gold he had saved for his burial trove, which was intentionally bigger than the capacity of his coffin.

There is now a facebook group of over 400 members and an official RP guild called &lt;For Her Tallest&gt; on . It is the oldest and most likely largest movement to overthrow &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt;, with the movement pre-dating him altogether, as well as any widespread knowledge of &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Maldy\"&gt;Trade Prince Maldy&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe movement culminated with the creation of the NPC &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt; &lt;Her Tallness&gt;, effectively implementing the Trade Princess within the game, albeit in the reduced capacity of liaison to the Warchief.\nThe first 100 pages of the original thread are now available for download &lt;a href=\"https%3A//docs.google.com/leaf%3Fid%3D0ByElkqoCJYQkYjMxNzdlZTMtN2Q1OS00MmRlLWExZDgtOTQ1MTZlNWJiNGZk%26amp%3Bhl%3Den\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. \nThe Trade Princess.\nOriginally intended to be a vague concept with the hopes that Blizzard would run with the idea, the fans went wild with playful ideas, jokes, and definitions for the once nameless female Trade Prince. There have been limitless ideas put forth, but these are the most well known to the character players have already come to know and love. A quote from the original post says:\nMany other character ideas developed out of this thread. The first was Her Tallest\u2019s administrative assistant and secretary. Taken from the original post:\nHer office is also one of the primary running gags fans had with Mida\u2019s character, as seen in the original post:\nOther minor pieces of her character people came up with include:\nWhat about Gallywix?\nThe Trade Princess Movement began, and Mida Silvertongue was created, long before &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Prince%20Gallywix\"&gt;Trade Prince Gallywix&lt;/a&gt; had even been created by Blizzard Entertainment. We within the movement are well aware of the fact that Gallywix has been appointed Trade Prince by former Warchief &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;. As Thrall himself says, however, he only made Gallywix Trade Prince \u201cfor now.\u201d An overwhelming majority of players that have experienced the goblin starting zone, and many who haven\u2019t, now agree with what members of our movement have been saying for over a year and a half (though Gallywix was named Maldy when we first began objecting to him), which is the simple fact that Gallywix is a terrible, unfit leader. A larger list of offenses and grievances has been written (see &lt;a href=\"http%3A//deneb-vir.deviantart.com/gallery/%23/d37d4a9\"&gt;By Decree of the Bilgewater&lt;/a&gt;), but in the goblin starting zone alone, Gallywix:\nBut perhaps most importantly, yet often overlooked, is the fact that Gallywix is only Trade Prince by the orders of FORMER Warchief Thrall. Warchief Hellscream has made no official appointment to Trade Prince or leader for the Bilgewater Cartel.\nThese things together, along with a growing distaste for him by characters and players, all seem to foreshadow his downfall as Trade Prince sometime in the future. This is now further indicated by the fact that he does not exist in game beyond the goblin starting zone, and further more by the fact that among his voice set is a quote that implies Gallywix is supposed to be inside the &lt;a href=\"Gallywix%20Pleasure%20Palace\"&gt;Gallywix Pleasure Palace&lt;/a&gt;, but for some reason Blizzard decided not to put him there.\nOn June 23rd, 2011, Blizzard posted its second \u201cAsk Creative Development\u201d answers. Among many was this question:\nBased on this answer, it would seem Blizzard Entertainment has plans for the story regarding Trade Prince Gallywix, and even talking about him could \u201cspoil the plot.\u201d Given everything we\u2019ve seen thus far, and then this response directly from Blizzard, his removal from power seems virtually inevitable.\nHer Tallest and feminism.\nA large portion of the support for this idea comes from those players that wish to see more females in positions of power and portrayed in more positive lights. Right now, many of the in-game female leaders either aren\u2019t independent leaders (Jaina and Tyrande), are emotionally unstable and more resemble foils to their male partners (Tyrande and Malfurion, Jaina and Arthas, Sylvanas and Arthas) or play very much to sex appeal at the expense of characterization and involvement in the game. For more of the arguments of feminism, please visit our guild website or facebook group. We have had many in-depth conversations about proper female portrayal in-game and the consensus is that it could and needs to be drastically improved. Because of this, support has been overwhelming for a woman who is neither a stereotype nor sex symbol; but rather powerful, independent, very intelligent, witty, physically strong and an overall complex, fully-involved character with a highly active role in the storyline.\nIn Cataclysm.\nMida has been put into the game as &lt;a href=\"Boss%20Mida\"&gt;Boss Mida&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;Her Tallness&gt;, and is located in the &lt;a href=\"Goblin%20Slums\"&gt;Goblin Slums&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;. Bowie, it seems, has been renamed &lt;a href=\"Kazit\"&gt;Kazit&lt;/a&gt;. Three other goblins accompany Her Tallness in the slums; Kazit, &lt;a href=\"Bruiser%20Janx\"&gt;Bruiser Janx&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Engineer%20Niff\"&gt;Engineer Niff&lt;/a&gt;.\nInfluential contributors.\nFanart gallery.\nPlease visit the official guild website to view the fan art gallery, located &lt;a href=\"http%3A//forhertallest.shivtr.com/gallery_categories/17610\"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;."}

Although the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; has been called a cartel, its president &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; is not a trade prince.\nIn the RPG.\nTrade princes are the five (more or less) rulers of the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; world, each of whom run their own private army (or armies), hold lands around &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and collectively control the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhile goblins answer to no king or other such titular head, a collection of trade princes rules their merchant empire, which is called the &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Coalition\"&gt;Trade Coalition&lt;/a&gt;. Officially, five trade princes exist, though there may be one or two more lurking about in the shadows. The goblins certainly don't elect their trade princes, nor are the positions hereditary; the trade princes killed, blackmailed and schemed their way to the top. Together, these five goblins make the mercantile machine run, organizing the extensive and complex &lt;a href=\"Trade%20Fleets\"&gt;Trade Fleets&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne trade prince thought the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; was destined to win the war, and aligned with them.

From that point on, the goblins decided to remain completely neutral, if only to better exploit both sides.\nA &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;-made chalice held by the goblin trade princes in Undermine is one of the items &lt;a href=\"Alexstrasza\"&gt;Alexstrasza&lt;/a&gt; believes could have rejuvenated the &lt;a href=\"Sunwell\"&gt;Sunwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nSubordinates.\nTheir hands are the &lt;a href=\"mogul\"&gt;mogul&lt;/a&gt;s. &lt;a href=\"Baron\"&gt;Baron&lt;/a&gt;s serve as magistrates for their land and holdings.

Admirals run more than one fleet. Traders and merchants work for the moguls and barons.\nAt the bottom are civilians and workers, and finally slaves.\nSpeculation.\nDue to his high standing, &lt;a href=\"Krix%20Wiklish\"&gt;Krix Wiklish&lt;/a&gt; could have been a trade prince."}

{"id": "370804", "revid": "49723770", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=370804", "title": "Bonus roll", "text": "The bonus roll system, introduced in patch 5.0, allows a player to receive an additional roll against a boss's loot table, giving the player an extra chance to receive an item.\nUpon completing a raid encounter for the first time in the week, if the player has the appropriate token for that raid, a window will appear where the player has the option to use a token for a bonus roll or pass. The result is either gold or an item off the boss's loot table that is appropriate for their loot specialization.\nWhile the odds of receiving an item on the first bonus roll are the same as the kill, whenever the player receives gold the odds of receiving an item on subsequent bonus rolls are slightly increased until the player receives an item, at which point it resets to the normal rate.\nThe use of a bonus roll token is strictly a personal endeavor and will not interfere with any other player's loot roll. It creates a completely separate roll against the boss's loot table.\nAs of patch 5.2, a player with &lt;a href=\"Dual%20Talent%20Specialization\"&gt;dual talent specialization&lt;/a&gt; may switch to the other spec before rolling to get gear appropriate to their other spec; also, the addition of loot specializations in patch 5.3 made it even easier to control what spec they will get loot for. Players who want items for an off-spec may choose in the UI which spec they would like to receive loot for from bonus rolls or quest rewards, regardless of the player's current specialization.\nLoot rolls are not available for \"Shadowlands\"-era content.\nTokens.\nThe following contemporary dungeons, raids and world bosses support bonus rolls with the following tokens.\nShadowlands.\nThere is no current plan to add a bonus roll token for this expansion.\nStrategy.\nDeciding when to spend bonus roll tokens can take some thought.\nYou certainly want to save the tokens for use on a boss that has a chance to drop loot you need. If you already have all the gear from a boss (or better gear) then spending a charm will either give you gold or a redundant piece of gear to vendor. If you expect to defeat another boss who can drop an item you \"do\" need, then you usually want to save the charms for that other boss.\nIf you are raiding normal level content regularly, you probably don't want to spend tokens in LFR. The exception is if you defeat fewer than 3 normal-mode bosses per week, then your tokens will accumulate and it is reasonable to spend the excess tokens on LFR bosses.\nIf you are raiding normal content (as opposed to LFR) and the boss actually drops an item that is an upgrade for you such that you would choose the need option you are faced with a small dilemma: should you spend a charm for an extra independent roll or not? If you spend a token there is a small chance you will win the item from the regular roll and the exact same item from the bonus roll. If you were rolling against a teammate you can trade the normal mode loot to them. If you were the only one who needed that loot now you have two and will probably sell the redundant one. If you do not have excess charms it is probably best to skip the bonus roll and hope to win the roll on the normal loot.\nThe bonus roll timer is 3 minutes, so as long as your group decides loot quickly, you can afford to delay your bonus roll until loot is assigned. Additionally, you will still get your chance to make a bonus roll even if you are disconnected at the end of the fight, as long as you log back in within the timer.\nIf you don't do enough daily quests to complete the conversion quest every week you probably want to spend them sparingly and only on bosses that drop best-in-slot upgrades.\nSummary: \nLimitations.\nAll Pandarian and Draenic world bosses may only have a bonus roll used against their loot table once each week. The same applies for end-of-instance bosses in Raid Finder mode, such as &lt;a href=\"Lei%20Shen%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href=\"Sha%20of%20Fear\"&gt;Sha of Fear&lt;/a&gt;. Other bosses in Raid Finder mode may have a bonus roll used against them as many times as the player has enough tokens to do so.\nBad luck streak protection.\nPatch 5.3.0 added bad luck streak protection to bonus rolls.\nWhenever you use a bonus roll and you don\u2019t get any loot, your chance of getting loot on the next roll will increase. This increased probability won\u2019t be reset until some loot is awarded, and this is independent of the boss that is being killed.\nThe bad luck streak protection will carry over and continue to increase the probability from boss to boss and instance to instance and won't reset until you get some loot. Basically, this feature treats all bonus rolls as if they were actually the same, no matter where they originate from."}

The &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt; needed the artifact because it matched with a &lt;a href=\"constellation\"&gt;constellation&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;their world&lt;/a&gt; known as \"the Tome\". &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt; needed it along with the &lt;a href=\"Jeweled%20Scepter%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Jeweled Scepter of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;Eye of Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to await a special celestial event, which would give off enough energy to &lt;a href=\"Spell%20of%20Conjuration\"&gt;create a multitude of ultimately unstable portals&lt;/a&gt; across the planet simultaneously, which tore &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; apart. &lt;a href=\"Obris\"&gt;Obris&lt;/a&gt; held the book on the verge of death, and handed it to &lt;a href=\"Khadgar\"&gt;Khadgar&lt;/a&gt;. Khadgar and his magi used its knowledge to destroy the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; from Draenor's side, thus protecting &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt; from the destruction of Draenor.\nHowever, as the gateway buckled under the weight of their spellwork, Khadgar dispatched a &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;Skull of Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; and the Book back to Azeroth, with orders to give them to the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt;, where he belived they would be safe. The messenger only narrowly succeeded, escaping through the gateway just as it slammed shut and severed the way between Azeroth and Draenor.\nThird War.\nThe gryphon rider was successful in his mission as both the Book of Medivh and the Skull of Gul'dan were delivered into the custody of the &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; and were placed in a secure vault within &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. The Book of Medivh was noted to have contained an extraordinary amount of power and knowledge. During the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, the Kirin Tor's possession of the Book of Medivh would lead the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; led by the &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"lich\"&gt;lich&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; to launch a &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Dalaran\"&gt;siege against Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the siege, the Kirin Tor's leader Archmage &lt;a href=\"Antonidas\"&gt;Antonidas&lt;/a&gt; was killed by &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, while Kel'Thuzad shattered the enchanted vault holding the Book of Medivh and retrieved the artifact. As he prepared to open the way for the Legion, the lich marveled at Medivh's spellbook. In life, he had never seen the tome, which was one of the most closely guarded artifacts in Dalaran, and never had permission to touch it. He now understood why as the book contained an extraordinary amount of power and knowledge, and drawing on all its powers allowed him to create a rift that linked Azeroth and the &lt;a href=\"Twisting%20Nether\"&gt;Twisting Nether&lt;/a&gt;. From this rift, the Burning Legion led by &lt;a href=\"Archimonde\"&gt;Archimonde the Defiler&lt;/a&gt; were able to enter Azeroth.\nAfter Archimonde and the Legion left for Kalimdor, the book remained in the hands of Kel'Thuzad.\nLegion.\nAt some point, &lt;a href=\"Kel%27Thuzad\"&gt;Kel'Thuzad&lt;/a&gt; apparently gave the book to his &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;, and it was stored inside &lt;a href=\"Scholomance\"&gt;Scholomance&lt;/a&gt;.

However, during the mission Jergosh was killed and the Book taken from him by a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Council of the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;.

Booms commands the powers of a shadow priest and is hostile to players of both factions.\nTrivia.\nThe inspiration for this character may come from a notorious player who became well-known on the US-Stonemaul server in the early days of WoW. The forsaken Shadow priest, also named 'Booms', was known for terrorizing Alliance players passing through &lt;a href=\"Menethil%20Harbor\"&gt;Menethil Harbor&lt;/a&gt; by using his &lt;a href=\"Mind%20Control\"&gt;Mind Control&lt;/a&gt; to extort gold from them. At that time, Mind Control had a 1-minute duration, and &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt; had yet to be added to the game. Booms would use this to hold Alliance players to ransom, demanding that they pay a toll to his Alliance alt Boomsbot before he would release them. In 2011, the original player of Booms passed away from heart complications, so this NPC was created as an in-game memorial for him."}

The \"Father Flame\" event can be trouble for the unprepared and many groups choose to skip it. The event that spawns him begins by looting the pillar in the left side of the Rookery, surrounded by eggs and elite dragonkin.\nDungeon Journal.\n\"Gaining favor within the black dragonflight is a mixed blessing. Solakar Flamewreath is entrusted with the care of &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;'s dragonspawn, but he has been warned he will pay a terrible price for any whelp that dies under his supervision--or simply fails to live up to expectations.\"\nStrategy.\nThe Rookery is full of &lt;a href=\"whelp\"&gt;whelp&lt;/a&gt; eggs that hatch if a player gets too close. While the whelps are easily defeated in smaller numbers, they can quickly overwhelm a group if not attended to promptly. Great care should be taken at all times to avoid hatching the eggs. Note that trying to clear the eggs beforehand is futile, as they have a fast respawn timer.\nBegin by clearing out the few &lt;a href=\"dragonspawn\"&gt;dragonspawn&lt;/a&gt; that occupy the Rookery as you enter. For this event the raid should be positioned as one large group inside the Rookery. This is to minimize &lt;a href=\"LoS\"&gt;LoS&lt;/a&gt; problems and to maximize the effectiveness of &lt;a href=\"AoE\"&gt;AoE&lt;/a&gt; attacks.\nOne character must activate the pillar in the far end of the room. It is practically impossible to approach the pillar without going near a few eggs and they will hatch. You can either kill these whelps or use a character capable of &lt;a href=\"stealth\"&gt;stealth&lt;/a&gt;. Even though stealth won't prevent the eggs from hatching, the stealthed character won't get &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; from the hatched whelps and after a short while they will despawn.\nWhen the room is clear and the group positioned, the character at the pillar can loot it and start the event proper. The event spawns five waves of 2 dragonkin &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt;s ending with Solakar Flamewreath. The waves of dragonkin are combinations of &lt;a href=\"Rookery%20Guardian\"&gt;Rookery Guardian&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Rookery%20Hatcher\"&gt;Rookery Hatcher&lt;/a&gt;s. It is very important that all &lt;a href=\"DPS\"&gt;DPS&lt;/a&gt; is focused on the Rookery Hatchers as soon as possible. The hatchers move from egg to egg hatching them and adding whelps to the battle. The sooner they are killed the easier the encounter.\nSolakar Flamewreath himself is a straightforward encounter and is relatively easy."}

The &lt;a href=\"Breath%20of%20Rukhmar\"&gt;Breath of Rukhmar&lt;/a&gt; was notably a weapon used two thousand years before the opening of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"Primals\"&gt;Primals&lt;/a&gt; led by &lt;a href=\"Gnarlgar\"&gt;Gnarlgar&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Sporemound\"&gt;Sporemound&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Taala\"&gt;Taala&lt;/a&gt; as they marched on &lt;a href=\"Spires%20of%20Arak\"&gt;Arak&lt;/a&gt;.

As the high arakkoa of &lt;a href=\"Skyreach\"&gt;Skyreach&lt;/a&gt; closely observed the civilization of the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;, they took a keen interest in the towering &lt;a href=\"Vigilant\"&gt;Vigilant&lt;/a&gt;s that guard their cities and temples.

Previously, he was summoned in &lt;a href=\"Silithus%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt; for an epic quest for &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;s. He was in a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;-form called Nelson the Nice. He was amongst the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; that returned in \"\".\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDisguising himself as a &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; hunter called Nelson the Nice, Solenor based himself in &lt;a href=\"Silithus\"&gt;Silithus&lt;/a&gt;. In time a &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; was sent by &lt;a href=\"Vartrus%20the%20Ancient\"&gt;Vartrus the Ancient&lt;/a&gt; to expose, kill, and deliver Solenor's head to the spirit of the &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20of%20Lore\"&gt;Ancient of Lore&lt;/a&gt;.\nHe was amongst the many demons within the &lt;a href=\"Black%20City\"&gt;Black City&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;The Battle for Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;. At some point after the Legion's victory, he departed from the island.\nHaving infiltrated &lt;a href=\"Revendreth\"&gt;Revendreth&lt;/a&gt;, Solenor disguised himself as the &lt;a href=\"venthyr\"&gt;venthyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Tavian\"&gt;Tavian&lt;/a&gt;. As Tavian, he joined &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Renathal\"&gt;Prince Renathal&lt;/a&gt;'s rebellion against &lt;a href=\"Sire%20Denathrius\"&gt;Sire Denathrius&lt;/a&gt;, and became &lt;a href=\"Sinfall\"&gt;Sinfall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"innkeeper\"&gt;innkeeper&lt;/a&gt;. While hiding amongst the Venthyr, he was tasked with completing detailed logs of all the people who entered or left Sinfall, their frequency, and guard rotation. He was further instructed to watch the &lt;a href=\"dredger\"&gt;dredger&lt;/a&gt;s as they would be needed for the final stages of the plan to rescue the imprisoned Denathrius.\nHe was eventually exposed by the Maw Walker and killed.\nStrategy.\nAddendum to strategy (Added by Niknak):\nAlternative strategy (post-TBC patch) added by Bastun:\nI defeated Solenor on my third try the other night (December '06) and noticed some changes from my previous attempts. On previous attempts, I had buffed with Greater Shadow Protection Potion, Elixir of the Mongoose, Elixir of Demonslaying, etc. We noticed that this night in the first two attempts, the buffs were disappearing - the only one to persist through the fight was Mana Oil. This 'buff eating' may be a bug, or a change introduced with the TBC (2.0) patch. My main problem with this fight has always been the bugs and I didn't see how I could beat it without any buffs. Then I remembered the TBC patch had given me the ability to lay traps during combat.\nNew strategy: pretty much as above for the pull.\nHunter's Mark him, lay Frost Trap, pull him into the trap, Feign Death. Drink up quickly and get to inside max range. Have a warlock duel for Curse of Recklessness. Lay Explosive Trap. Move back to max range and pull as normal - (I used Aimed, concussive, serpent, multi). The frost/concussive means the bugs will hit the explosive trap first. When he gets close, Wingclip or Scattershot/Wingclip. Run sideways, shoot. Every so often, when he has a lot of bugs after you, drop another Explosive Trap. The Bugs are no longer a problem with this method.\nNo warlock or shaman strategy.\nStrategy\nBefore the fight clear the area and take your potions and elixirs. Start off by pulling Solenor through a &lt;a href=\"Frost%20Trap\"&gt;Frost Trap&lt;/a&gt; to debuff him and &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt; to reset him, this will not reset the buff he had. Make sure you are full mana and health and start pulling Solenor through a &lt;a href=\"Freezing%20Trap\"&gt;Freezing Trap&lt;/a&gt;. Walk back to gain maximum range and then open fire again, by now he should have spawned some &lt;a href=\"Creeping%20Doom\"&gt;Creeping Doom&lt;/a&gt;s so wait for Solenor to come close and &lt;a href=\"Wing%20Clip\"&gt;Wing Clip&lt;/a&gt; him. Take distance again and start shooting if the Creeping Dooms get close use the explosive to kill them and continue shooting. Solenor will most likely fear you once but the protection potion will cushion the blow. If Solenor breaks lose Wing Clip him again and taken distance, the second wave of Creeping Dooms is best killed with a &lt;a href=\"Volley\"&gt;Volley&lt;/a&gt; and the third wave with a &lt;a href=\"Explosive%20Trap\"&gt;Explosive Trap&lt;/a&gt; you shouldn't need to kill the adds more than three time. Use the &lt;a href=\"Super%20Mana%20Potion\"&gt;Super Mana Potion&lt;/a&gt; early on in the fight.\nQuote.\nI come to Silithus every year around this time. The weather is phenomenal for my bunions.\nYou should take a stroll with me, friend. Enjoy the sights and what not."}

It &lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;, soloing is a mandatory process at early levels (usually below 10), designed to accustom the player to WoW gaming experience. Quests above that level are somewhat suggestive of grouping (which is especially true for those marked as \"&lt;a href=\"Group%23Group_quests\"&gt;Group&lt;/a&gt;\" or \"&lt;a href=\"Quest%23Quest_types\"&gt;Elite&lt;/a&gt;\", or many quests above level 45-50), however are also designed so that solo players could also achieve them.\nIn fact, the only WoW content that discourages solo adventuring is &lt;a href=\"Instances\"&gt;instanced dungeons&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the feat of soloing difficult instances is often an exiting and interesting challenge, often considered the proof that a player is good at playing the game (if the player succeeds).\nPros &amp; cons of soloing.\nThere are several pros and cons of soloing. Here are a few of them.\nPros:\nCons:\nUsually, it's up to the player to decide whether they want to go solo or group, but as with everything, a little of each is required for the better gaming experience.\nOvergearing in solo.\nOccasionally, players at much higher levels or are &lt;a href=\"overgear\"&gt;overgear&lt;/a&gt;ed may solo such content for achievements points (common for Death Knights and Paladins) bragging rights, or unique gear as a \"trophy\" or roleplay wear. At exactly what level group content becomes soloable can be difficult to determine, depending on player class, behavior of mobs, and associated gimmicks a player may or may not be able to outgear."}

{"id": "290968", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=290968", "title": "Soloing classic content", "text": "Because stats grow exponentially every expansion, most end-game raid content from previous expansions becomes soloable by players at max level of the current expansion. There are many incentives to solo old content, like obtaining old &lt;a href=\"legendary%20items\"&gt;legendary items&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"mount\"&gt;mount&lt;/a&gt;s, and completing old &lt;a href=\"achievement\"&gt;achievement&lt;/a&gt;s.\n&lt;a href=\"Cataclysm\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, in particular, was notable in the extreme stat scaling compared to previous expansions. In particular, &lt;a href=\"Razorgore%20the%20Untamed\"&gt;Razorgore the Untamed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; have been soloed although such a feat was previously thought to be impossible. In addition, encounters such as &lt;a href=\"Gehennas\"&gt;Gehennas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz%20the%20Corrupt\"&gt;Vaelastrasz the Corrupt&lt;/a&gt; that have been difficult in the past have become almost trivial.\nBlood &lt;a href=\"Death%20Knights\"&gt;Death Knights&lt;/a&gt; are by far and away currently the best, and simplest class to solo large amounts of content with for the most part; as tanks, they have the ability to mitigate large amounts of damage, and their self-healing design allows them to sustain incoming damage without a healer. Other classes that are able to solo, albeit with more limitations and difficulty, include &lt;a href=\"Hunters\"&gt;Hunters&lt;/a&gt;, feral and balance &lt;a href=\"Druids\"&gt;Druids&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Warlocks\"&gt;Warlocks&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Molten%20Core\"&gt;Molten Core&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the advent of Cataclysm, Molten Core has become almost trivial to solo for most level 85 classes.\n&lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Ahn%27Qiraj\"&gt;Temple of Ahn'Qiraj&lt;/a&gt;.\nMost of AQ40 is relatively easy to solo. &lt;a href=\"Viscidus\"&gt;Viscidus&lt;/a&gt; will prove impossible for many classes to solo due to reliance on heavy frost damage. The &lt;a href=\"Twin%20Emps\"&gt;Twin Emps&lt;/a&gt; requires heavy DPS, as only with the advent of Cataclysm have players been able to single-handedly burn through 30,000 HPS done by the brothers. Lastly, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thun\"&gt;C'Thun&lt;/a&gt;, previously thought unsoloable, is soloable only by kiting &lt;a href=\"Ouro\"&gt;Ouro&lt;/a&gt; into the boss' room; this will allow him to pull the player out of C'Thun's stomach before he is instantly killed and the encounter reset.\nClass-specific tips.\nDeath Knight.\nWith the 4-piece T10 tank set bonus, 3/3 &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Rune%20Tap\"&gt;Improved Rune Tap&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vampiric%20Blood\"&gt;Vampiric Blood&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Anti-Magic%20Shell\"&gt;Anti-Magic Shell&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Icebound%20Fortitude\"&gt;Icebound Fortitude&lt;/a&gt; and , you will have a long string of defensive cooldowns. &lt;a href=\"Raise%20Dead\"&gt;Raise Dead&lt;/a&gt; followed by &lt;a href=\"Death%20Pact\"&gt;Death Pact&lt;/a&gt; should only be used as a last resort; it's too good to waste before you really need it. &lt;a href=\"Empower%20Rune%20Weapon\"&gt;Empower Rune Weapon&lt;/a&gt; is also a defensive cooldown for emergency situations; immediately allowing use of at least two Death Strikes at once.\nDon't forget that you can also spec into situational talents like &lt;a href=\"Lichborne\"&gt;Lichborne&lt;/a&gt;, which will allow you to heal yourself with &lt;a href=\"Death%20Coil\"&gt;Death Coil&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=\"Bloodworms\"&gt;Bloodworms&lt;/a&gt; for a minor HPS gain, but these talents are not normally part of current raid tanking specs; you would only use them for PvP, DPS, or \"solo old content\" specs.\nAs of Patch 4.0.1, Death Strike no longer requires diseases on its target to heal. You don't need to keep diseases up to solo old fights anymore.\nHunter.\nBecause the majority of damage intake will be to your pet, a &lt;a href=\"Pet_talents%23Tenacity\"&gt;Tenacity&lt;/a&gt; pet is preferred. Give it a defensive spec, like &lt;a href=\"http%3A//www.wowarmory.com/talent-calc.xml%3Fpid%3D4%26amp%3Btal%3D00320022020121111002%26amp%3Bbm\"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; (note that a &lt;a href=\"Exotic%20Beasts\"&gt;Exotic Beasts&lt;/a&gt; spec is required), and use &lt;a href=\"Aspect%20of%20the%20Viper\"&gt;Aspect of the Viper&lt;/a&gt; and cast &lt;a href=\"Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Mend Pet&lt;/a&gt; as necessary (spec into &lt;a href=\"Improved%20Mend%20Pet\"&gt;Improved Mend Pet&lt;/a&gt;; especially important for bosses that apply debuffs, like most in Molten Core), and .\nOn bosses with &lt;a href=\"Enrage%20%28mechanic%29\"&gt;enrage&lt;/a&gt; timers, this tactic may not work so well; help DPS if you must, &lt;a href=\"Roar%20of%20Sacrifice\"&gt;Roar of Sacrifice&lt;/a&gt; will help if you do pull aggro, and be sure to carry an so that you don't run out of mana for Mend Pet.\nPaladin.\nYou're in luck - if you're the only person in an encounter, you can use &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; as much as you like without worrying about mobs ignoring you. Make sure to take necessary &lt;a href=\"Paladin%20talents%23Protection\"&gt;Protection&lt;/a&gt; talents to reduce the cooldown of Divine Shield and &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Justice\"&gt;Hammer of Justice&lt;/a&gt; - the latter is extremely useful in some fights. Use &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Light\"&gt;Seal of Light&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Seal%20of%20Wisdom\"&gt;Seal of Wisdom&lt;/a&gt; depending on the encounter - but usually, SoW will suffice.\nWarlock.\n&lt;a href=\"Metamorphosis%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Metamorphosis (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt; will make you immune to critical hits from level ?? raid bosses and make your armor and stamina as high as a moderately geared tank for 30 seconds. In addition, you retain all your DPS abilities, allowing you to effectively tank the boss as well as deal massive amounts of damage. You may defeat the boss before Metamorphosis lifts, but if not, rely on your &lt;a href=\"Voidwalker\"&gt;Voidwalker&lt;/a&gt; to resume tanking. For longer boss fights, careful threat management with &lt;a href=\"Suffering\"&gt;Suffering&lt;/a&gt; (Voidwalker pet taunt) and &lt;a href=\"Soulshatter%20%28warlock%20ability%29\"&gt;Soulshatter (warlock ability)&lt;/a&gt; (Warlock aggro drop) may be required. There may be times when, a la Classic, you may be required to slow down or even hold back your fire to allow your pet to build the required amount of threat.\nClassic fights that cannot be soloed.\nThe following Classic fights have mechanics which specifically require more than one person to overcome:"}

Usually identified by a small crown icon () near their portrait. Their purpose is to command the other players and often distribute &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; through &lt;a href=\"Master%20looter\"&gt;master loot&lt;/a&gt;. \nMany players in the role of a leader will however not care to act like one. This is especially the case in &lt;a href=\"PuG\"&gt;PuG&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"BG\"&gt;BG&lt;/a&gt;s, where players are placed in groups or raids by the game system rather than manually creating them. As groups or raids will always automatically promote a player as leader, many leaders become so purely by random. Given how PuGs and BGs often don't require any leaders, the promoted leader will act just like a \"normal player\". It is however fairly common that a player, whether the system has promoted him/her to a leader, possess some experience to guide other players in difficult situations and thus becomes a \"real\" leader. As such, the role of a leader (by game mechanics) is often completely disregarded."}

Change modes with the 4 (AA), 5 (bombing), and 6 (engineering) buttons.\nRate of fire for the AA gun is quite high. The shield charges to a maximum of 100 charges, gaining 30-40 per charge up action in engineering mode. Your shield is a buff on your plane, so if your UI doesn't display it properly, it may help to click your plane (the 3D model in the middle of the screen, not some UI element) to target it so you can track your remaining shield charges.\nSwap between modes as necessary, with a focus on not getting shot down (dead plane drops no bombs). When gargoyles start attacking the plane, switch to AA and take them out, then go back to bombing mode. Every now and then go to engineering mode to replenish the shield to prevent it from wearing off. If the plane catches on fire, immediately go to engineering mode and hit 2 to put out the fire.\nEnemy players can also shoot down your plane with their AA guns, so be conscious of enemy presence. Likewise, you can shoot down enemy planes. Enemy planes are far more deadly than gargoyles, since their rate of fire is so much higher. Bombs to not hit planes; only AA guns. Every enemy player you successfully shoot down will earn you a buff called \"Confirmed Kill Reported\", which records every enemy player you shot down during your sortie.\nIt is recommended to do these quests in first person view so that the plane does not obstruct your view of fire, especially in AA mode. \nThe plane is on rails, so the player's focus is on killing enemies and preventing their own plane's untimely demise."}

In addition, the leaps caused by the buff were far larger than the current version, and players were able to use subsequent jumps to change direction entirely mid-leap. The combination of these differences allowed players with the buff to leap very long distances in a single bound, including directly over large structures such as towers and hills.

{"id": "19417", "revid": "35163311", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=19417", "title": "Leash", "text": "As a verb, this is what it's called when a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; suddenly clears its &lt;a href=\"Aggro%20List\"&gt;aggro list&lt;/a&gt;, switches to &lt;a href=\"Evade\"&gt;Evade&lt;/a&gt; mode and runs quickly back to its &lt;a href=\"Spawn%20Point\"&gt;spawn point&lt;/a&gt;, where it resets. \nOverland.\nLeashing is the primary means for players escaping &lt;a href=\"combat\"&gt;combat&lt;/a&gt;. From an early level, all players learn that if you run from a mob in one direction for long enough, the mob will break off combat and reset. However, hitting a mob seems to reset the leash range. One way to &lt;a href=\"pull\"&gt;pull&lt;/a&gt; a mob to a far off location is to periodically attack it (for example, walking backwards while meleeing it) to keep its attention. \nLeashing is also one way to prevent &lt;a href=\"Train\"&gt;training&lt;/a&gt;, in the sense of &lt;a href=\"Grief\"&gt;griefing&lt;/a&gt; somebody by luring mobs onto them. (Since the mob will be in evade mode while returning to its spawn, and will not aggro on anyone it runs past.)\nBosses.\nFor boss mobs, particularly raid encounters, leashing is triggered in a slightly different way. Some boss mobs are intended to be fought in a certain area. If the boss is pulled outside of that area, it will automatically leash (clearing aggro and returning to its spawn in evade mode as above), \"regardless\" of how recently it has been hit. Note that there are many bosses who either do not leash or are fought in an area where escape is impossible.\nEXAMPLES:\nMost of the priests in &lt;a href=\"Zul%27Gurub\"&gt;Zul'Gurub&lt;/a&gt; (with the exception of &lt;a href=\"High%20Priestess%20Arlokk\"&gt;Arlokk the Panther&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bloodlord%20Mandokir\"&gt;Bloodlord Mandokir&lt;/a&gt;) can be leashed. If a pull is bad or the fight goes awry, it is a common strategy to simply have the remaining people run out of the area. &lt;a href=\"Hakkar%20the%20Soulflayer\"&gt;Hakkar&lt;/a&gt; will then tell the priest to \"not be lured into the mortals' trap,\" and the boss will reset. This strategy has been known to glitch however. &lt;a href=\"High%20Priest%20Thekal\"&gt;Thekal&lt;/a&gt; once continued chasing raid members around the entire instance despite being told to go back home four times by Hakkar. He was persistent enough to swim through rivers, cross bridges, dash up hills, and even go into Arlokk's temple seeking out every last raid member and cutting them down.\nAnother example of the leashing mechanic that works in a different way is &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Juggernaut\"&gt;Iron Juggernaut&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;; if the Iron Juggernaut is pulled outside of the fenced off area towards the friendly NPCs the boss will instantly despawn and the encounter will be reset, causing the boss to respawn about 30 seconds later. This behavior is common across multiple encounters in different raids in the game world.\nInstances.\nNon-boss mobs in &lt;a href=\"Instance\"&gt;instances&lt;/a&gt; generally do not leash. The only way to escape them is to exit the instance, or to use an aggro-clearing ability like the hunter's &lt;a href=\"Feign%20Death\"&gt;Feign Death&lt;/a&gt;. Some instances however have spots that cannot be pathed to by NPCs. You can identify such a location by attempting to attack an NPC while standing at it; if the NPC faces you but evades, the NPC cannot get to the location. Most of these spots are accessed by jumping onto objects or different elevations that cannot be reached by walking. This is to prevent players from being able to kill NPCs without being attacked themselves. (Note that the new &lt;a href=\"knockback\"&gt;knockback&lt;/a&gt; effects being added in &lt;a href=\"Wrath%20of%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;Wrath of the Lich King&lt;/a&gt; would create many problems with evading mobs, and thus it is reasonable to infer that there will be some game mechanic to prevent such evade locations from appearing.) At these evade-locations, a player need merely to stand there long enough. The mobs will give chase as far as they are able, then stand and stare at you for a while, probably wondering why it is nobody ever taught them to jump, then they will remove you from their aggro list. If the evade-location is within aggro range of their normal patrol route or spawn point though, the leashed NPCs may immediately attempt to re-engage you; although they will be unsuccessful, it will make you unable to leave combat for more than a second or less."}

Your character can only have 2 primary professions at any time.\nThe leatherworking profession allows players to utilize the &lt;a href=\"leather\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; gathered through the &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt; profession to create a variety of items, including &lt;a href=\"cloak\"&gt;cloak&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"Leather%20Armor\"&gt;leather&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mail%20Armor\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; armor, and &lt;a href=\"Armor%20Kit\"&gt;armor kits&lt;/a&gt;. The armor produced by leatherworking is chiefly of use to the leather and mail wearing classes: &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;. \nWhile Leatherworking used to offer specializations at later levels, most recipes that used to require those can now be trained by all leatherworkers and many of the items made are now &lt;a href=\"bind%20on%20equip\"&gt;bind on equip&lt;/a&gt;. \nFrom the official site.\n\"Leatherworkers take the rough, spiny or sturdy hides of beasts everywhere and turn them into useful products. First and foremost among these creations are lighter armors - leather and mail - as well as cloaks, bags, and unique patches and stitching that improve the defensive values of armor. The craft of Leatherworking is useful to those who want to outfit themselves and others with suitable armors, as well as those who want to proft from selling their rare creations.\n\"Most Leatherworking can be done anywhere, provided you've got the necessary materials. It's not uncommon for Leatherworkers to also specialize in Skinning - the most efficient way to ensure that they have all the leather they need for their creations.\"\nTraining as a Leatherworker.\nLeatherworking is taught by various leatherworking trainers located throughout the world. Prospective leatherworkers must be at least level 5. Initial training costs , granting the Apprentice level with a potential skill of 75 and access to a few starting leatherworking patterns. More patterns can be learned from trainers or found throughout the world as the leatherworker raises their skill level. \nThe following are the required levels and potential skill of each stage of the profession:\n\u2020 &lt;a href=\"Draenor%20Master\"&gt;Draenor Master&lt;/a&gt; is only available completing the faction specific quest &lt;a href=\"Cut%20%27Em%20Out%21\"&gt;Cut 'Em Out!&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"Fair%20Trade\"&gt;Fair Trade&lt;/a&gt;\n\u2021 &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands%20Mastery\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; proficiency is only available after purchasing the &lt;a href=\"expansion\"&gt;expansion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nAdvancing as a Leatherworker.\nUnlike some professions, such as &lt;a href=\"blacksmithing\"&gt;blacksmithing&lt;/a&gt;, which requires both a purchased item and a world location for creation of items, leatherworkers do not require any special equipment or locations to process their materials into finished products. As long as the leatherworker has all of the required materials for the creation of an item, patterns can be crafted anywhere in the world at any time.\nCrafting items is the only way to progress through the stages. Patterns will appear as one of four colors in the profession window, with a certain chance for a skill up (gaining a point):\nAs leatherworking skill increases, patterns will eventually change from orange to yellow, yellow to green and green to grey. Only by finding higher skill patterns can one continue to progress through the profession. Approximately every 5-10 points, new patterns will become available to learn from the trainers. Alternatively, patterns can be looted from corpses or purchased either from vendors or from the &lt;a href=\"auction%20house\"&gt;auction house&lt;/a&gt;. All patterns have a requisite leatherworking skill to be able to be learned and crafted. Additionally, some patterns cannot be gotten until you have a certain &lt;a href=\"reputation\"&gt;reputation&lt;/a&gt; standing with a particular &lt;a href=\"faction\"&gt;faction&lt;/a&gt;. These are listed at the &lt;a href=\"Faction%20recipes/Leatherworking\"&gt;faction recipes&lt;/a&gt; entry.\nSuggested 2nd profession.\nSince leatherworking is almost exclusively dependent upon materials gathered from skinning creatures around the world, &lt;a href=\"skinning\"&gt;skinning&lt;/a&gt; is the most recommended profession to pair with it. Attempting to level leatherworking to max level exclusively through purchasing leather through the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; is not recommended unless you are on a high population server and have a lot of extra gold, as some materials are not usually available in great quantity and it can be prohibitively expensive. An alternative is to use a second character to farm leather for your leatherworker. If you do choose to level through the AH, be prepared to spend thousands of gold doing it. Also, leatherworking is unique in a few ways that makes skinning almost invaluable that most people don't see:\nLeather conversions.\nLeatherworkers are also able to take lower quality leather materials gathered through skinning and convert them into higher quality items. As the quality increases, for example, from light to medium, the number of lower quality materials required to make one higher quality material increases. The table below shows the conversions between all types of leather. Conversions taught by trainers are shown in bold green text. (The fractions are for comparison only. Leather cannot be split into lower grades.) Leathers cannot be converted across expansions; no amount of Knothide Leather, for example, can be converted to Borean Leather.\nSpecialized leatherworking.\nIn &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.1\"&gt;patch 4.0.1&lt;/a&gt; leatherworking specializations were removed from the game. There were previously three specializations: Elemental Leatherworking for Agility leather gear, Tribal Leatherworking for Intellect leather gear, and Dragonscale Leatherworking for Intellect mail gear. Patterns that required a specialization were either made craftable by anyone or removed from the game. An article preserving information on the now-removed specializations can be found at the &lt;a href=\"Leatherworking%20proficiencies\"&gt;Leatherworking proficiencies&lt;/a&gt; page.\nLeatherworker-only Benefits.\nFur Lining and Leg Reinforcements.\nAt higher skill level, leatherworkers can apply &lt;a href=\"Fur%20Lining\"&gt;Fur Lining&lt;/a&gt; to their own bracers and &lt;a href=\"Leg%20Reinforcement\"&gt;Leg Reinforcement&lt;/a&gt;s to their own leg armor. Since these augments are meant for the leatherworker's personal use only, applying them causes the equipment to become soulbound. The resulting enchants are generally better than any enchant you can buy or otherwise acquire.\nFur Lining and Leg Reinforcements require at least 400 leatherworking to remain active. Leg Reinforcements also have a minimum character level requirement."}

{"id": "14121", "revid": "26060681", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=14121", "title": "Stun", "text": "Stun effects are a form of &lt;a href=\"Crowd%20Control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; that cause the victim to be unable to move or perform most actions for a period of time. Stuns are significantly more effective than &lt;a href=\"snare\"&gt;snare&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"root\"&gt;root&lt;/a&gt; effects, since they prevent the victim from taking any action, and unlike &lt;a href=\"disorient\"&gt;disorient&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"incapacitate\"&gt;incapacitate&lt;/a&gt; effects, do not break when the victim is damaged. Consequently, stuns are almost always very short duration effects.\nStuns are one of the most effective and powerful types of crowd control, preventing targets from moving or taking any actions for the duration. Unlike &lt;a href=\"fear%20effect\"&gt;fear effect&lt;/a&gt;s, they do not cause targets to wander, and do not break on damage. However, a number of abilities are designed to specifically counter stuns, removing, preventing or reducing the duration of stun effects. Additionally, certain abilities are designed to be usable by players even when stunned, reducing the significance of the effect.\nAll raid bosses, most or all dungeon bosses and many elite mobs are permanently immune to stuns. Certain abilities with stun components, such as &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Bolt\"&gt;Storm Bolt&lt;/a&gt;, are for this reason designed to deal additional damage to targets that are permanently immune to stuns, maintaining their usefulness in PvE.\nStun effects are similar to &lt;a href=\"sleep%20effect\"&gt;sleep effect&lt;/a&gt;s in that they also prevent a victim from taking action. However, the &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; racial ability &lt;a href=\"Will%20of%20the%20Forsaken\"&gt;Will of the Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; (which removes &lt;a href=\"Sleep%20effect\"&gt;sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"charm\"&gt;charm&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Fear%20effect\"&gt;fear&lt;/a&gt; effects) will not remove a stun.\nDiminishing returns.\nStuns cast by players will trigger &lt;a href=\"diminishing%20returns\"&gt;diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt;. Consequently, after three stuns (not to be confused with &lt;a href=\"disorient\"&gt;disorient&lt;/a&gt;s) within a short period of time, the target will become temporarily immune. There are however several diminishing returns categories, one for activated stuns, which include most stun effects, and one for proc stuns, which include the stuns from procs, as well as one specifically for &lt;a href=\"Cheap%20Shot\"&gt;Cheap Shot&lt;/a&gt;. Using stuns in one category will not affect the duration of stuns in the another category. Also, unlike many crowd control effects, most stuns suffer diminishing returns even in PvE encounters."}

{"id": "47698", "revid": "22514", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=47698", "title": "Stun lock", "text": "A stun lock (also called stunlocking) is the act of using multiple &lt;a href=\"stun\"&gt;stun&lt;/a&gt;s and immobilizing effects in succession to prevent an enemy from fighting back or escaping. As a result, a stunlock sacrifices a large amount of DPS in exchange for keeping the opponent \"locked down\", but that doesn't matter because it is extremely annoying and in the act of stunlocking provides other players to freely attack the enemy as he stands there unable to do anything. Although typically and most easily accomplished by a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, it can also be achieved to lesser degrees by &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s. Some refer to this ability as a full kill of an enemy player in PvP without allowing them to react, whereas others consider a small sequence of stuns a stun lock.\nStunlocking was a significant tool in a skilled rogue's arsenal, until Blizzard intoduced &lt;a href=\"Diminishing%20returns\"&gt;Diminishing returns&lt;/a&gt; to the game. This greatly reduced the effectiveness of stunlock, and later on rendered it next to useless when they moved &lt;a href=\"Kidney%20Shot\"&gt;Kidney Shot&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Cheap%20Shot\"&gt;Cheap Shot&lt;/a&gt; to the same Diminishing Returns category. The term is still widely used.\nRelated talents and abilities.\n\"For a list of abilities that can cause, counter and prevent stuns, see &lt;a href=\"Stun\"&gt;Stun&lt;/a&gt;.\"\nMany items and abilities such as &lt;a href=\"PvP%20trinket\"&gt;PvP trinket&lt;/a&gt;s or a paladin's &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; will free the user from stuns. Additionally, there are talents that grant stun resistance. Finally, orcs have a &lt;a href=\"racial\"&gt;racial&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;a href=\"Hardiness\"&gt;Hardiness&lt;/a&gt; that reduces the duration of stuns by 15%.\nRogue stun locking.\nA rogue can perform a stunlock in a variety of ways, some of which include &lt;a href=\"Thistle%20Tea\"&gt;Thistle Tea&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Renataki%27s%20Charm%20of%20Trickery\"&gt;Renataki's Charm of Trickery&lt;/a&gt;, means by which to gain extra energy. A rogue's effectiveness at performing a stunlock is dependent on his or her build. For example, a full combat build or a &lt;a href=\"Seal%20Fate\"&gt;Seal Fate&lt;/a&gt; build without &lt;a href=\"Vigor%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Vigor (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; would be least effective for stunlocking while a &lt;a href=\"Cold%20Blood\"&gt;Cold Blood&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Hemorrhage\"&gt;Hemorrhage&lt;/a&gt; build would be most effective.\nIt should be noted that, for the most part, stunlocks are confined to the realm of 1v1 PvP and dueling. Any interference by other players during a stunlock may prevent the rogue from executing his or her next stun, which in turn allows the target a chance to break out of stunlock. Furthermore, the stunlocks listed require precise timing to avoid diminished returns. Each ensuing stun must be timed to land just as the previous stun is about to fade.\nHemorrhage\nCold Blood/&lt;a href=\"Preparation\"&gt;Preparation&lt;/a&gt;/Hemorrhage\n&lt;a href=\"Seal%20Fate\"&gt;Seal Fate&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=\"Vigor%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Vigor (Classic)&lt;/a&gt; using daggers\nNote: If you possess 5 pieces of &lt;a href=\"Nightslayer%20Armor\"&gt;Nightslayer Armor&lt;/a&gt; you can complete the second half using: Cheap Shot -&gt; Backstab -&gt; Cold Blood -&gt; Eviscerate.\n&lt;a href=\"Adrenaline%20Rush\"&gt;Adrenaline Rush&lt;/a&gt;\nSubtlety stunlocking\nBlows as few long cooldowns as possible. It works best when specced the appropriate talents to reduce energy costs/increase chance of adding extra combo points. Blind is saved here for trinket breakouts/other breakouts such as a mage's blink.\nMutilate with Improved Gouge\nDruid stun locking.\nDruids have some limited stunlock capabilities, especially if a druid mixes &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt; into his stun rotation.\nferal stunlock\n&lt;a href=\"Pounce\"&gt;Pounce&lt;/a&gt;, 2x&lt;a href=\"Claw\"&gt;Claw&lt;/a&gt;(add in a &lt;a href=\"Rake\"&gt;Rake&lt;/a&gt; if you desire), &lt;a href=\"Maim\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, \nThis is a shot but effective stunlock, which will allow the druid to do a good amount of damage to the oppenent before he has an oppertunity to fight back. Against undergeared cloth opponents it may be possible to kill the opponent before the stun wears off.\n&lt;a href=\"Feral%20Charge\"&gt;Feral Charge&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Bash%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Bash (druid ability)&lt;/a&gt; can be added to the end of this rotation for maximum stun length, but due to the lower damage potential of &lt;a href=\"bear%20form\"&gt;bear form&lt;/a&gt; using them to extend a stunlock does not add much damage compared to staying in &lt;a href=\"cat%20form\"&gt;cat form&lt;/a&gt; for the duration of the maim. These abilities are usually saved for interrupting the cast of an attack spell (or heal).\nmaximum stunlock\n&lt;a href=\"Pounce\"&gt;Pounce&lt;/a&gt;, 2x&lt;a href=\"Claw\"&gt;Claw&lt;/a&gt;(add in a &lt;a href=\"Rake\"&gt;Rake&lt;/a&gt; if you desire), &lt;a href=\"Maim\"&gt;Maim&lt;/a&gt;, (Go bear form, wait for maim to end use &lt;a href=\"Enrage\"&gt;Enrage&lt;/a&gt; if you don't have &lt;a href=\"Furor\"&gt;Furor&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=\"Bash%20%28druid%20ability%29\"&gt;Bash (druid ability)&lt;/a&gt;, (Wait for bash to end) &lt;a href=\"Cyclone\"&gt;Cyclone&lt;/a&gt;x3. If talented for the ability, &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Charge\"&gt;Feral Charge&lt;/a&gt; can be used after the Maim and after Cyclone. \nThis tactic gives the maximum stunlock potential, but at the expense of rendering the opponent invincible to damage during the Cyclone phase. Cyclone also has a higher mana cost and so may not be viable for a feral druid due to their lower mana reserves. This stunlock is very useful against healers in group PVP settings if your unable to out DPS their heals; this allows the druid to incapacitate the enemy healer long enough for his teammates to kill their targets and focus on the healer. \nThis is also very useful for a restro druid in BG if forced into a 1v1 fight. Since many restro druids can't do enough dps to out damage an enemies self healing abilities he may need to incapacitate him long enough for support to arrive. Especially useful when trying to single handedly defend a location in AB or stop a flag runner in WG. For similar reasons an under geared druid in BG may choice this method to contribute to a strategic battle by incapacitating a foe he knows would quickly defeat him in a direct battle."}
