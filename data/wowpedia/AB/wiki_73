Ruthlessly dedicated to her own sense of justice, she has been a part of many important events spanning the past 10,000 years.\nMaiev grew up in the ancient &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Empire\"&gt;Kaldorei Empire&lt;/a&gt;, eventually joining the esteemed &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt; and rising through its ranks to become a senior priestess. When the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; threw the world into chaos, Maiev, along with her younger brother &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, played a major role in the fight against the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;ic &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; as part of the &lt;a href=\"Kaldorei%20Resistance\"&gt;Kaldorei Resistance&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev's most defining role would come after the war, when she volunteered to become the leader of a newly-formed elite force known as the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. These night elves were charged with watching over the prison of the infamous &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;, and Maiev would make this duty her life's work.\nAfter millennia, Illidan would eventually be freed from captivity during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. In response, Maiev began a desperate and all-consuming hunt to find the Betrayer and return him to his cell. This chase took her across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually even to the ruined world of &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. There she launched a guerrilla war against Illidan and &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;his allies&lt;/a&gt;, though she was ultimately captured. Her revenge would finally come when she and a group of &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;heroes&lt;/a&gt; stormed the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; and killed its master.\nFollowing Illidan's death, Maiev returned home, but her sense of duty brought her into conflict with even the highest levels of night elf society. Despite this tension, Maiev remains dedicated to protecting the world and her people. She would marshal and lead her faction of wardens on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, reuniting with her brother Jarod and later taking part in the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Assault on Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt; and after the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Teldrassil\"&gt;Burning of Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev Shadowsong, along with with most of her &lt;a href=\"warden\"&gt;warden&lt;/a&gt;s, returned to &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; and participated in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, where she personally served as the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; commander and ultimately led the night elves to successfully reclaim &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; from the Horde.\nBiography.\nThe fortunes of war.\nWhen Maiev Shadowsong was young, she would hunt with her mother in the woods. She had an interest in blades even before joining the &lt;a href=\"Sisterhood%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Sisterhood of Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaiev belonged to the Sisters of Elune as a senior priestess by the time the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt; broke out, and her brother, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod&lt;/a&gt;, had become a captain in the &lt;a href=\"Guard%20of%20Suramar\"&gt;Guard of Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. The Shadowsong family was not of noble blood, and so both siblings had earned their positions through skill and hard work. Maiev was stationed at the &lt;a href=\"Hajiri\"&gt;Hajiri&lt;/a&gt; temple in northwestern &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; just before the War of the Ancients. Like the rest of the sisterhood, Maiev took up arms against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; at the start of the invasion, joining the resistance under &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt;. When &lt;a href=\"Tyrande%20Whisperwind\"&gt;Tyrande Whisperwind&lt;/a&gt; was declared the new High Priestess, a disgruntled Maiev raised an opposition, though she knew better than to deny Tyrande's power. Following her disappearance and the death of &lt;a href=\"Marinda\"&gt;Marinda&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev was elected High Priestess by default. This reunited her with her estranged brother Jarod.\nMaiev was an opponent of the leadership of &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt;, but took no action for fear of dividing the troops. She urged Jarod to do something, but her brother wouldn't listen. After Stareye fell in \"combat\", and Jarod was recognized commander of the host, Maiev neglected to say, \"I told you so\". Maiev continued to serve with distinction, and grudgingly relinquished the office of High Priestess back to Tyrande. She also helped in the healing of the injured Rhonin and helped Jarod with killing demons. After the Sundering, she was furious when she discovered that &lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; had attacked and injured her brother. Jarod had been leading a scouting party on &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, and they had caught Illidan in the process of creating a second &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity%20%28Hyjal%29\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt;. Outraged, the night elves hastened to apprehend the traitor. During Illidan's capture, he unleashed an arcane attempt to resist arrest that killed &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Blackforest\"&gt;Lord Blackforest&lt;/a&gt; and many of the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt;, and rendered the others (among which &lt;a href=\"Dath%27Remar%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Dath'Remar Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt; and Jarod) comatose. Illidan was captured immediately after this by Malfurion, while only the efforts of Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev herself and other priestesses ensured the heroes survival. Enraged, Maiev drew her weapon and went to kill the captive Illidan, but Tyrande stopped her and reminded her that Jarod still lived. Jarod gave &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt; the right to decide Illidan's fate. Knowing full well where Illidan's ruthless schemes would eventually lead, Malfurion decided to deal with his power-crazed brother once and for all. With &lt;a href=\"Cenarius\"&gt;Cenarius&lt;/a&gt;'s help, Malfurion sealed Illidan within a vast underground barrow prison, where he would remain chained and powerless until the end of time.\nFormation of the Watchers.\nAlthough she deeply respected Malfurion, his merciful decision hardly satisfied Maiev. She offered to watch over Illidan, whose attack on his fellow night elves had been the last straw. Most night elves now recognized him as both reckless and powerful. They had not forgotten that he had chosen to serve &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and they did not believe him when he swore he had done so only to gain sufficient power to defeat the Legion. Malfurion agreed that the night elves dared not leave Illidan unguarded in the long term, and so he asked Maiev to gather additional volunteers from the Sisterhood of Elune. Together, Maiev and the other priestesses would guard Illidan and prevent him from escape. Maiev obeyed and established a new organization that became known as the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt;. As the group's leader, Maiev was given the rank of &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt;, which she later awarded to a select few who had proven their exceptional fighting abilities, tracking skills, and tenacity. When Jarod disappeared one night, Maiev was surprised and grieved that he had not spoken to her of his impending departure. In his absence, the Watchers became Maiev's sole companionship. As the years stretched into centuries and then millennia, she came to see the Watchers as her family.\nIllidan's escape.\nSince Illidan's incarceration, the Watchers' primary mission remained their vigil over him. However, the Watchers' duties widened somewhat over time and began to include the capture, imprisonment, and - where necessary - the recapture of all dangerous criminals. These new tasks occasionally took a Watcher far abroad, where she would remain until she tracked down and captured the criminal. Shortly before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt; broke out, Maiev departed the barrow prisons in order to accomplish one such mission. She returned to find Illidan missing and a number of Watchers slain. Subsequent investigation led to a shocking conclusion: Tyrande and her Sentinels had attacked the Watchers and freed Illidan. Even worse, Illidan had turned into a demon, confirming Maiev's worst fears. Filled with fury, Maiev gathered what she could of the remaining Watchers and began to track Illidan down.\nWith her lieutenant &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt; at her side, Maiev pursued Illidan throughout &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;. With his impromptu force of &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s and other corrupt creatures, Illidan managed to keep her at bay, but to her credit, Maiev stayed close to him as he fled. Finally, Maiev closed in on him in &lt;a href=\"Queen%20Azshara\"&gt;Queen Azshara&lt;/a&gt;'s former &lt;a href=\"Azshara\"&gt;provincial holdings&lt;/a&gt;, now on the coast of Kalimdor, where he had destroyed many fishing villages and left nothing but mutilated bodies and flaming footprints in his wake. But Maiev found some tracks which she could not identify. They identified themselves as the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt;, and professed servitude to Illidan. Maiev defeated them, but was troubled that they were burning boats, and thought that perhaps Illidan meant to flee across the ocean. Maiev took to the port of &lt;a href=\"Nendis\"&gt;Nendis&lt;/a&gt;, where she found Illidan stealing away in a transport. The naga began to destroy the ships, but Maiev killed them before they completed their task. Maiev quickly found some transport ships, and took the Watchers across the sea.\nThey stopped unexpectedly soon when they came across some islands which were not on their maps, but Maiev knew where they were, as she had once spent a great deal of time there. The &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt; were the remains of &lt;a href=\"Suramar\"&gt;Suramar&lt;/a&gt;. As she established a base camp, Maiev found landmarks she recognized from the ancient, ruined city, such as the library of &lt;a href=\"Izal-Shurah\"&gt;Izal-Shurah&lt;/a&gt;, and the Boughs of Azshara. &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt; realized that the city must have been raised from the seafloor for some sinister purpose, and Maiev commented that few powers were capable of such a thing.\nMaiev found the answer when she came across &lt;a href=\"Drak%27thul\"&gt;Drak'thul&lt;/a&gt;, a former &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20Clan\"&gt;Stormreaver Clan&lt;/a&gt;. Drak'thul told Maiev that if she destroyed the battling apparitions of his former brethren, he would tell her his story. Maiev destroyed the skeletal &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and the summoning pits from which they spawned. After returning to Drak'thul, he recounted how he had been a disciple of &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, the warlock who raised the islands twenty years before to search for the powers of the &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Dark Titan&lt;/a&gt;. Gul'dan hoped to gain power, but instead he and the rest of his Stormreaver clan unleashed crazed demons who slaughtered all but a handful of the warlocks, Drak'thul among the survivors. He had lived on the island since, haunted by the ghosts of his dead comrades. Maiev told him that he deserved a far worse punishment than that for what he and the Stormreavers had unleashed. Troubled by the news, Maiev suspected that the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; was Illidan's goal here, as well. After &lt;a href=\"The%20Broken%20Isles%20%28WC3%20NightElf%29\"&gt;battling&lt;/a&gt; through his ample forces of naga, Maiev and Naisha chased Illidan into the Tomb itself.\nWhile there, Maiev read magical orcish runes Gul'dan had created to relate his tale. It continually referenced an \"Eye,\" which seemed to be an artifact, and Maiev guessed that this was what Illidan sought. Maiev and Naisha realized that the Eye must have been tremendously powerful for Gul'dan to have been lured by it so potently. Maiev soon had a run-in with the leader of the naga, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Vashj\"&gt;Lady Vashj&lt;/a&gt;, who told her that the night elves' justice had no place in the Broken Isles. Maiev asked Vashj what she knew of their justice, and Vashj replied that she was once a night elf herself, and that the explosion of the &lt;a href=\"Well%20of%20Eternity\"&gt;Well of Eternity&lt;/a&gt; had transformed them into the naga. Maiev, however, displayed a simple revulsion for the Naga, and chased Illidan into the central chamber, where he had already found the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Since Illidan had been confined by Maiev for ten thousand years, he felt that trapping her in the tomb (alive or otherwise) was the least he could do to repay her, caving in the Eye Chamber before teleporting himself out. Maiev, using her abilities, teleported through the temple and reluctantly left her dear friend, &lt;a href=\"Naisha\"&gt;Naisha&lt;/a&gt;, and the rest of the &lt;a href=\"Watchers\"&gt;Watchers&lt;/a&gt; to die stranded in the dark tomb.\nMaiev battled an army of naga as she sent a &lt;a href=\"Night%20Elf%20Runner\"&gt;runner&lt;/a&gt; out to sea to get a message to Malfurion Stormrage to plea for assistance. She was being attacked by a large naga force led by &lt;a href=\"Serena%20Scarscale\"&gt;Serena Scarscale&lt;/a&gt;. After a desperate battle, the runner was away, and Maiev quickly returned to her base to defend her Watchers.\nForced cooperation.\nAfter taking heavy damage on the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, south of &lt;a href=\"Izal-Shurah\"&gt;Izal-Shurah&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev was finally reinforced by Malfurion, but was displeased to find that Tyrande had come along as well. She snidely proclaimed that Tyrande deserved to be locked in a cage just as Illidan was, to which Tyrande fired back that she was doing what was right at the time. Before they could come to blows, Malfurion told them to let it be for now and focus on the matters at hand, namely winning the battle against the naga forces led by &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Serpentra\"&gt;Lady Serpentra&lt;/a&gt;. After they defeated the naga, however, Illidan took to the sea and fled once again. The three heroes were quick to follow.\nThey arrived upon the shores of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;. After Malfurion left them to commune with the forests, Maiev bowed to Tyrande's greater knowledge of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and Tyrande met &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas\"&gt;Kael'thas&lt;/a&gt;, the prince of the &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt;. When told of Illidan, Kael thought that perhaps that was the reason that the undead were so agitated in &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev wanted to get back on the hunt as soon as possible, but &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; wished to help Kael; Maiev's objections were silenced when Kael agreed to help them fight Illidan. The two warriors escorted Kael's caravan to &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt;, where they were suddenly ambushed. Kael and Maiev saw his caravan across the river while Tyrande held the line on the bridge. When she called down the &lt;a href=\"Starfall\"&gt;stars&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; to destroy the undead, Elune's fury was unleashed. The bridge, unable to stand the weight of a fully armored night elf on tigerback, crumbled beneath Tyrande, and she was swept down the river.\nKael was about to attempt to save her when Maiev stopped him. She knew that time was growing short, and that Illidan had to be stopped, and insisted that Tyrande had been prepared to make the sacrifice if needed. She demanded that Kael help her find the demon in return for her assistance protecting his caravan. Kael helped her track Illidan to Dalaran's ruins, where they met up with &lt;a href=\"Malfurion\"&gt;Malfurion&lt;/a&gt;, who had felt the land being torn apart and seen a vision that it was Illidan's doing. He suspected the worst and feared for the fate of the world itself. Maiev told Malfurion that Tyrande had been \"torn apart\", and that his only recourse was to gain revenge on Illidan. Maiev reminded Malfurion that Tyrande would never have come to Lordaeron and met her alleged death if not for Illidan's actions, and thus he was to blame. Malfurion's grief and anger made him completely focused on stopping and punishing his brother, just as Maiev had hoped.\nWith the help of Kael'thas and a &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 &lt;a href=\"Magroth%20the%20Defender\"&gt;Magroth the Defender&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 Maiev and Malfurion pushed back &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20naga\"&gt;Illidan's naga&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran ruins&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed the &lt;a href=\"Naga%20Summoner\"&gt;Naga Summoner&lt;/a&gt;s casting spells around the Eye. Cornering Illidan with the night elf and Alliance forces, Malfurion grimly told his brother that for what he had done this time confinement would not be sufficient and that he was to be put to death. Maiev enthusiastically volunteered to execute him personally then and there. Illidan explained that his spell had not been meant to harm anybody but the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt; and his undead servants, whom the Night Elves surely had no love for. His spell had been specifically targeting the area where the Frozen Throne was based. Not placated, Malfurion raged that Illidan had given no thought to the cost of his actions and that Tyrande had died because of him. Illidan was shattered by this statement, since he had never wanted anything to happen to the woman he loved and had even tried to dissuade her from following him to Lordaeron since he was concerned for her safety. Then Kael spoke up, much to Maiev's chagrin, saying it was premature to pronounce her dead. The blood elven prince explained the bridge's collapse and the noted absence of tearing apart. Malfurion, understandably furious with Maiev for her lies, entangled her. He asked her bitterly who the \"betrayer\" was now.\nFreeing herself from the grasping plants and gathering her few remaining soldiers took Maiev long enough that Illidan succeeded in saving the high priestess. By the time Maiev caught up with the demon, Malfurion and Tyrande were bidding him a farewell that sounded almost fond. They were letting him go. He was a demon who had murdered countless innocents, spread corruption and madness among the beasts of the forest, and nearly caused irreparable harm to Azeroth. Jarod had given Malfurion the responsibility to determine Illidan's fate, but Malfurion was letting the demon go because Illidan had saved Tyrande's life. Evidently Malfurion felt that Illidan had been washed clean of all the blood he had spilled. Maiev disagreed. The Watchers were gone, betrayed by their own government. If that government would not at least avenge their deaths, then by Elune, Maiev would see it done herself. Thus, when Illidan suddenly opened a portal and stepped through it, Maiev and her soldiers followed him without a second thought. She knew that Illidan placed great value on his life and would never deliberately endanger it. Malfurion alone knew what Maiev had become: she was now vengeance itself.\nCurse of the blood elves.\nWhen she arrived on the other side, she found herself in the ruins of the orcish homeworld, &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt;. They soon discovered that Illidan had come alone, leaving his naga servants on Azeroth. Greatly outnumbered, Illidan discovered that his evil powers were of little use against cold steel, and his recapture proved to be fairly easy. She caught him and imprisoned him into an enchanted cage under a magical sedative. Although she had captured Illidan, Maiev was unable to find a way to return home. The gateway Maiev followed Illidan through had vanished, and none of the many other portals in Outland led to Azeroth. The geography of the shattered world was unknown to her, and she did not know what dangers they would face. Maiev and the Watchers explored cautiously until they were surprised to discover &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; soldiers. These soldiers were part of the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Lothar\"&gt;Sons of Lothar&lt;/a&gt; and had been established in a base called &lt;a href=\"Honor%20Hold\"&gt;Honor Hold&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev was hopeful they could help her find a way to leave Outland. However, before the Watchers could reach it, Illidan's allies attacked. The naga had arrived on Outland, and they had brought new allies: the same blood elves that Maiev had helped escape the Scourge earlier. Maiev and her soldiers fought the naga and their traitorous elven friends, but the new army outnumbered hers, and eventually she was defeated. The naga and blood elves recaptured Illidan and freed him.\nOutland.\nWith Illidan freed and bolstered by new allies, Maiev and her remaining followers were forced to retreat. Sometime after Illidan's failure to destroy the Frozen Throne, Maiev was contacted by &lt;a href=\"Akama\"&gt;Akama&lt;/a&gt; (himself unsatisfied by not being given the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt; as promised, and the further defiling the temple underwent while in Illidan's control) and the wary Maiev agreed to enter a partnership. Before they departed, Akama handed her a stone that would allow him to contact her. With Akama spying on Illidan's movements, Maiev sought more allies to her cause, and gained many of the young draenei and Broken of Outland as recruits for her army. At the suggestion of &lt;a href=\"Arechron\"&gt;Arechron&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev sought his cousin &lt;a href=\"Alexius\"&gt;Alexius&lt;/a&gt;, within &lt;a href=\"Shattrath\"&gt;Shattrath&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arriving, Alexius was able to inform the Warden of the various factions within Shattrath. Using this knowledge, Maiev decided to seek out the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Sha%27tar\"&gt;Sha'tar&lt;/a&gt;, while having no intention of contacting the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;. However both factions ultimately rejected aiding her due to dealing with other matters, and though the &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt; sought to speak with her, Maiev found herself unable to trust the blood elves and refused to even meet with &lt;a href=\"Voren%27thal%20the%20Seer\"&gt;Voren'thal the Seer&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter leaving Shattrath, Maiev trained her new recruits, and spent the next few years making hit and run strikes against &lt;a href=\"Illidan%27s%20forces\"&gt;Illidan's forces&lt;/a&gt;, while being informed by Akama of what the Broken gleaned of Illidan's plans. Following Illidan's discovery of Akama's treason, the Lord of Outland &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Akama\"&gt;bound a portion&lt;/a&gt; of the Broken's soul to his will. Under Illidan's command, Akama ultimately tricked Maiev into leading her forces into an ambush in Shadowmoon Valley, with Maiev being the only survivor. The Warden was then captured by Illidan and placed within a &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Cage\"&gt;cell&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev spent the following days trying to crush the guilt that resided within her due to getting her army killed, while trying to discover why Akama would betray her. It was during this time that Akama appeared before her, and a bitter Maiev lashed out at him. Despite this, Akama was able to convince the Warden to hear him out, and revealed that both Illidan and himself had plans for her. Even as Akama departed, Maiev found herself wondering if she could trust him and spent time plotting the composition of a spell that would help her trap Illidan.\nThe Burning Crusade.\nFor many years, Maiev's fate remained a mystery, and many believed she had died on Outland. After the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; was opened, however, she was discovered to have been imprisoned within the &lt;a href=\"Warden%27s%20Cage\"&gt;Warden's Cage&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt;, guarded by Akama and his &lt;a href=\"Ashtongue%20Deathsworn\"&gt;Ashtongue Deathsworn&lt;/a&gt;. She was indignant that Akama seemed to be merely sitting there, scheming, while Illidan's grasp over Outland tightened.\nHowever, Akama was secretly biding his time until he could strike at Illidan, and when the time came, he joined forces with Maiev to overthrow Illidan and, aided by the &lt;a href=\"Aldor\"&gt;Aldor&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Scryers\"&gt;Scryers&lt;/a&gt;, entered the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Temple\"&gt;Black Temple&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev quickly split off from the rest of the forces to go after Illidan alone, eventually finding him at the top of the temple with a band of adventurers at his mercy. Freeing them, she joined the battle against him, laying traps to incapacitate him and decrying the pain he had caused her, from forcing her to guard his prison for ten thousand years by committing his crimes, to causing the death of Naisha. In the end, as Illidan lay dying, Maiev told him he was beaten, but Illidan retorted that the huntress is nothing without the hunt. With her quarry slain, Maiev realized that Illidan was right, and that she was indeed nothing without him. Feeling hollow and distressed, she briefly considered attacking Azeroth's heroes, but purged the thought soon after and left the summit.\nMaiev returned to the summit right after, now accompanied by several wardens, and took the Betrayer's corpse and encased it in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; so that his dark, lingering soul could suffer the rest of eternal sentence, as justice to be forever served. She also imprisoned his surviving &lt;a href=\"Illidari\"&gt;Illidari&lt;/a&gt; along with the body in the Vault, vowing never to allow the &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;-touched &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s to roam free ever again.\nWolfheart.\nSearching for something to live for following Illidan's death, Maiev left &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt; and journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; to rejoin &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;her people&lt;/a&gt;. Despite her role in leaving &lt;a href=\"Tyrande\"&gt;Tyrande&lt;/a&gt; for dead during their venture into the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt;, she was permitted to return to Darnassus to begin training a new generation of &lt;a href=\"Watcher\"&gt;Watcher&lt;/a&gt;s, some of whom were fanatically loyal to Maiev and her cause, such as &lt;a href=\"Neva\"&gt;Neva&lt;/a&gt;, her new second-in-command. When Malfurion and Tyrande allowed for the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; to live in Darnassus, Maiev was secretly outraged \u2014 despising the Highborne for their part in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, and the other races of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; for bringing the night elves into their affairs.\nAround this time her brother, &lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt;, returned to night elf society after ten thousand years of self-imposed exile. Seeing her little brother's desire for a simple life while he could have been the leader of the night elves, was shameful in her opinion. To her, his seclusion was an abandonment of his duty to his people. Though the reunion between the Shadowsong siblings started off bitter, Maiev eventually softened her demeanor towards her brother when he sympathized with the hard choices she had to make in order to fulfill her duties. She still felt proud of Jarod, and even thought she could manipulate him as a puppet for her own ends.\nWhen the &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; mage &lt;a href=\"Thera%27brin\"&gt;Thera'brin&lt;/a&gt; was assassinated and his corpse was found near the Watchers' training grounds, it seemed to be intended to impute the Watchers. Maiev offered her services to investigate the matter and bring the murderer to justice, to which Malfurion and Tyrande consented. In truth however, she was secretly the one responsible for the Highborne killings. Maiev had planned to slaughter the Highborne and their leaders first, and then give Malfurion a slow rotting death. In her opinion, Malfurion was guilty of the same arrogance that his twin, &lt;a href=\"Illidan\"&gt;Illidan&lt;/a&gt;, displayed. By believing that he knew what was best for the night elf people, she felt Malfurion condemned them by not having &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; properly blessed, thus taking away their immortality (although Teldrassil was not his idea, and only the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspect\"&gt;Dragon Aspect&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt; could do so). She also despised him for forgiving the Highborne and accepting them back into night elf society. It is suspected that the trauma caused by years of dedication to her duty, combined with the torture inflicted upon her when she was Illidan's prisoner had finally driven her insane. Now she has become a megalomaniac who deludes herself into believing that only she can exact \"justice\" on those she deems guilty. Her ability to mask such madness, though, is a credit to her skills as a survivor.\n&lt;a href=\"Jarod%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Jarod Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; later freed Malfurion and joined him in confronting Maiev and her Watchers. Jarod distracted Maiev while Malfurion was rescuing the Highborne, whom Maiev had captured in a deadly trap. Jarod subsequently drove Maiev off, unable to kill his own sister. The Highborne were safe, and most of the new Watchers were dead, though their mistress had vanished into the night. Maiev has vowed that she will be the one to restore the night elves to greatness.\nThe Tomb of Sargeras.\nSeeking to locate , Khadgar eventually tracked his magical signature to the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;. Upon arrival, he met with Maiev Shadowsong. Recognizing the Warden's abilities, he sought her help. Initially, the Warden refused to help Khadgar, as she held him responsible for Cordana's betrayal and disapproved of his rashness. Disappointed, Khadgar departed to continue his search for Gul'dan. However, Maiev eventually had a change of heart and pursued the Archmage. She joined up with Khadgar while he and Gul'dan clashed in a magical duel.\nWorking together, the pair breached the chamber and assaulted Gul'dan, who, with little effort and fueled by Kil'jaeden's might, brushed their attacks away again and again. Yet, the pair was unrelenting. Recognizing his need for assistance, Gul'dan let his power slip away from him and down towards the portal, at last allowing the Burning Legion's third invasion of Azeroth to commence. Khadgar and Maiev were forced to the floor, and Kil'jaeden commended Gul'dan for his choice. Gul'dan now had something he never before had from the Legion: their trust. \nAs demons began pouring out of the portal, Khadgar and Maiev ran for their lives. Maiev veered North to fortify the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; and Khadgar transforming into a raven, flying east.\nLegion.\n\"If the Watchers are infamous among the night elves, Maiev Shadowsong is a legend. Famed for her uncanny ability to capture any enemy, Maiev tracked Illidan Stormrage, the Betrayer, all the way to the Black Temple in Outland. After his demise, she &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;imprisoned&lt;/a&gt; his surviving followers, the Illidari, vowing never to allow the fel-touched demon hunters to roam free ever again.\"\nHowever, Maiev would have little choice. When the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; began their largest invasion of Azeroth ever, they attacked the Vault of the Wardens in search of Illidan's imprisoned corpse. With no other choice, Maiev freed the &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s who had languished in her prison for years. Together, Maiev, the demon hunters, and Wardens still loyal to Maiev fought off the demons from the Vault of the Wardens, but it was too late to stop what the Legion had come there to do. and &lt;a href=\"Cordana%20Felsong\"&gt;Cordana Felsong&lt;/a&gt; succeeded in retrieving Illidan's body and left the battlefield.\nWhen Illidan's corpse was stolen from the Vault of the Wardens, Maiev pursued them and subsequently went missing. Once Maiev was captured, &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; stepped up as the leader of the Wardens. Wardens loyal to Maiev began to search for her across the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, and Jarod volunteered to help them. Jarod feels he has been a poor brother to Maiev, for he knows Maiev would never have committed the murders during the events of \"Wolfheart\" unless she was under some foul influence, but he did not investigate and simply assumed the worst.\nMaiev is freed from &lt;a href=\"Black%20Rook%20Hold\"&gt;Black Rook Hold&lt;/a&gt;, where she reveals that Gul'dan raised &lt;a href=\"Kur%27talos%20Ravencrest\"&gt;Kur'talos Ravencrest&lt;/a&gt; and his soldiers to protect the secrets within the tower, with the ghost of &lt;a href=\"Desdel%20Stareye\"&gt;Desdel Stareye&lt;/a&gt; protecting the dungeons. In her reunion with Jarod she is surprised that he came for her even after she tried to kill him, but Jarod says to forget about it, that he heard what happened in the Vault of the Wardens, and jokes that luckily his hair cannot get any grayer. He thanks &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; that his sister is still alive, and together the Shadowsong siblings defeat Stareye, who, like all the undead in Black Rook Hold, believes them to be &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegionfall.\nIllidan arrives late to the &lt;a href=\"Assault%20on%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;second battle at the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, prompting Maiev to snark that her wardens are doing all the work while his demon hunters play with their &lt;a href=\"felbat\"&gt;felbat&lt;/a&gt;s, before &lt;a href=\"Prophet%20Velen\"&gt;Prophet Velen&lt;/a&gt; tells both of them to stop arguing.\nIllidan and Maiev work together to travel to the top of the &lt;a href=\"Cathedral%20of%20Eternal%20Night\"&gt;Cathedral of Eternal Night&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt; there. They bicker throughout the dungeon. After Mephistroth's defeat and the activation of the Aegis, an echo of &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Guardian%20of%20Tirisfal\"&gt;Guardian of Tirisfal&lt;/a&gt; who created the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, appears and reveals that said echo was placed there by Aegwynn in case the wards on the tomb failed. She explains that the Pillars of Creation can restore her wards and that the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Aman%27thul\"&gt;Eye of Aman'thul&lt;/a&gt; can destroy the felstorm.\nAfter the Cathedral was reclaimed by Azeroth's heroes, Maiev appointed her Wardens to guard its upper halls.\nShe also participates in &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Assaults\"&gt;Legion Assaults&lt;/a&gt;, directing the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;class order leaders&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaiev later aided in breaching the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nSome time after the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt; which resulted in the burning of &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; spoke to &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; to try and convince him to assault &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and retake it from the Horde, but with the war focused on &lt;a href=\"Zandalar\"&gt;Zandalar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Arathi\"&gt;Arathi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Kul%20Tiras\"&gt;Kul Tiras&lt;/a&gt;; Anduin did not have the troops to do so. As the three night elves spoke to Anduin, Tyrande went on ahead of the army to try and retake Darkshore herself. Maiev, Shandris, Sira, and an adventurer located Tyrande's ruined ship at the &lt;a href=\"Zoram%20Strand\"&gt;Zoram Strand&lt;/a&gt;, which contained a book about the ancient ritual of the Night Warrior. The Night Warrior was the incarnation of Elune's wrath. The ritual to become the avatar of the Night Warrior was extremely dangerous, and even witnessing it would put you in danger. Legend said that long ago, the Night Warrior was used by the night elves to secure Kalimdor. None who have attempted the ritual since then have survived, for Elune's raw power tore them apart.\nUpon journeying to Darkshore, Maiev tasked Sira with scouting the coast while she, Shandris, and the adventurer searched the &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Auberdine\"&gt;Ruins of Auberdine&lt;/a&gt; for the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Eye of Elune&lt;/a&gt; that Tyrande would need for the ritual. Though the Eye had already been taken, they were cornered by &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Commander%20Belmont\"&gt;Deathstalker Commander Belmont&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev easily slew his forces, blinking past their &lt;a href=\"New%20Plague\"&gt;Blight&lt;/a&gt;, and drove him off. After leaving Auberdine and saving Tyrande's mount &lt;a href=\"Ash%27alah\"&gt;Ash'alah&lt;/a&gt; from the Horde, they met with the High Priestess at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; where she underwent and survived the ritual to become the Night Warrior, instantly slaying all the Horde forces present. Tyrande told Shandris and Maiev to prepare for war while she left to confront &lt;a href=\"Nathanos%20Blightcaller\"&gt;Nathanos Blightcaller&lt;/a&gt;. The confrontation ended with Nathanos raising both &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;Delaryn Summermoon&lt;/a&gt; and Sira who had just died minutes before, but Tyrande slaying one of the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt;. Afterward, Tyrande put Maiev in charge of the night elves' efforts in Darkshore as despite their checkered history with each other the future of their race was on the line. When Maiev asked Tyrande what had happened to Sira, Tyrande wished to speak to her alone.\nAs Tyrande ordered, Maiev commanded the Alliance forces in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; and faced off against the Horde force led by Sira. She ultimately led them to victory over the Horde, though Sira and &lt;a href=\"Delaryn%20Summermoon\"&gt;other&lt;/a&gt; Horde forces were able to escape and flee the battlefield.\nShadows Rising.\nFollowing the fall of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, Tyrande, and the night elven people made their new home in &lt;a href=\"Nordrassil\"&gt;Nordrassil&lt;/a&gt;. Malfurion and Tyrande had taken to ignoring any and all missives sent to them by the young &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Anduin Wrynn&lt;/a&gt;. In light of both the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Earthen%20Ring\"&gt;Earthen Ring&lt;/a&gt; sensing something horrible within the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;spirit world&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion and Tyrande agreed for &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt; to meet with them under the condition that the Earthen Ring &lt;a href=\"Yukha\"&gt;Yukha&lt;/a&gt; was to be present and for Thrall to bring what was owed.\nAfter Thrall and his companions &lt;a href=\"Baine%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Baine Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Calia%20Menethil\"&gt;Calia Menethil&lt;/a&gt; arrived at &lt;a href=\"Mount%20Hyjal\"&gt;Mount Hyjal&lt;/a&gt;, Malfurion, Tyrande, &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt;, and Maiev Shadowsong greeted them with frosty, rigid silence. Thrall formally apologized to the night elves and explained how the Horde sought to change. While Shandris was willing to listen, Maiev refused to entertain the notion, declaring that she wouldn't be content with just &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; dead as she wasn't alone when the Horde burned &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;, and further accusing the Horde of hiding behind cowardly revisions of history. Baine subsequently asked Maiev what justice was to her and asked her if &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt; must burn, if the death of their innocents would appease her, and if she thought pain does not simply bring more pain. After Tyrande stated that she saw their words as empty pledges of justice, Maiev witnessed Thrall promising to give Tyrande the head of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome time later, the night elven leadership received another missive from Anduin revealing that the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; had sent them a gift, a start to what was owed. In response, Tyrande, Shandris, and Maiev journeyed to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; where they encountered the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Sira%20Moonwarden\"&gt;Sira Moonwarden&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Stockades\"&gt;Stockades&lt;/a&gt;. Maiev mentioned to Tyrande that she had lived a life consumed by vengeance and though there was no great love between them, she had no desire to see Tyrande become what she was. After Tyrande cut a shallow cut into Sira's neck, Shandris took her blade, and Maiev encouraged her to have mercy towards Sira, who Maiev saw as a sad defeated thing. Tyrande subsequently departed while Maiev and Shandris remained to interrogate her.\nShadowlands.\nMaiev was present in &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt; and witnessed Tyrande's speech about Horde's defeat in &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;. She stated that while she disagreed with Tyrande's methods, she acknowledged her as the night elf leader and noted that they would not have succeeded without her assistance, remarking that their victory was \"the first step\" towards the kaldorei's retribution.\nFollowing the defeat of &lt;a href=\"Zovaal\"&gt;the Jailer&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev accompanied Tyrande and Shandris to &lt;a href=\"Oribos\"&gt;Oribos&lt;/a&gt; to attend the trial of a remorseful Sylvanas Windrunner. Sylvanas willingly submitted to Tyrande's judgment, and the high priestess had Shandris and Maiev escort her to the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Transference\"&gt;Ring of Transference&lt;/a&gt;. Tyrande sentenced Sylvanas to begin her penance by scouring the &lt;a href=\"Maw\"&gt;Maw&lt;/a&gt; and freeing all of the souls trapped therein. Maiev reflected that her own life should've been forfeit after her actions during the Cataclysm, and yet she was given a chance to mend the damage she'd caused for the sake of those she'd wronged, something she hoped would be true for Sira as well. She did not know if Sylvanas' fate was justice, but she believed that it was right.\nPersonality.\nMaiev is a driven and ruthless individual, utterly dedicated to her mission to see Illidan either recaptured or killed. Almost every thought she has is poisoned by her obsession with the demon hunter; even wistful memories of her youth inevitably come back to Illidan. She feels entirely justified in her actions and considers her cause to be a righteous one, accepting personal responsibility for the many losses and setbacks she's suffered only under very specific circumstances; more commonly, she lays blame for her defeats at the feet of others, either for not adequately supporting her or finding fault with her methods. Maiev believes that there is little wrong with utilizing questionable methods for the sake of destroying a greater evil. She is quick to anger and not above risking rash and destructive actions, exerting control over her thirst for vengeance and remaining civil in the face of opposition with considerable effort.\nNevertheless, she is unusually resourceful and extremely effective at trapping and countering powerful magic-wielding opponents, easily killing several members of the Highborne as well as nearly killing Malfurion Stormrage. She was also able to easily capture several highly trained &lt;a href=\"demon%20hunter\"&gt;demon hunter&lt;/a&gt;s within seconds and locked them within enchanted crystals within the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Wardens\"&gt;Vault of the Wardens&lt;/a&gt; for years. Her powers as a &lt;a href=\"Warden\"&gt;Warden&lt;/a&gt; appear to be substantially enhanced by her thirst for vengeance, even summoning several &lt;a href=\"Avatar%20of%20Smoldering%20Vengeance\"&gt;Avatars of Smoldering Vengeance&lt;/a&gt; against the Horde, and as a former high priestess of the moon goddess, she retains ancient knowledge that even &lt;a href=\"Shandris%20Feathermoon\"&gt;Shandris Feathermoon&lt;/a&gt; was unaware of, such as the darker and forbidden aspects of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nMaiev's love for the night elf people is undeniable, but the way in which she seeks to see her race restored to greatness has, in the past, put her at odds with the night elves' leaders. She is fairly xenophobic, believing her people have been weakened by their association with the \"lesser races\" of the Alliance and their problems. Despite briefly cooperating with &lt;a href=\"Kael%27thas%20Sunstrider\"&gt;Kael'thas Sunstrider&lt;/a&gt;, Maiev generally had a special hatred for her &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; kin and their descendants, viewing magic in general as a vile and untrustworthy thing, and was a strong supporter of the kaldorei's magic ban. She even once referred to the &lt;a href=\"naga\"&gt;naga&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Blood%20elf\"&gt;blood elves&lt;/a&gt; as \"bastard races\" and an affront to everything her people stood for after they allied themselves with Illidan. For a long while, she believed that Tyrande Whisperwind was a traitor to the night elves for her part in freeing Illidan, and should be locked in a cell alongside the Betrayer; she also apparently came to consider Malfurion little better than his brother. Her own brother, Jarod, believed that this was not the result of madness on Maiev's part, but due to outside corruption, although it remains somewhat ambiguous as to whether Maiev truly was influenced or not by some outside force during her time at Teldrassil.\nHowever, Maiev's relationships with Malfurion, Tyrande, Jarod, and even &lt;a href=\"Mordent%20Evenshade\"&gt;Mordent Evenshade&lt;/a&gt; and the worgen appear to have improved significantly as of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, bringing her &lt;a href=\"Wardens\"&gt;Wardens&lt;/a&gt; to successfully defend Tyrande against Horde forces during her Night Warrior ritual at &lt;a href=\"Bashal%27Aran\"&gt;Bashal'Aran&lt;/a&gt;, and openly cooperating with them in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;, Mordent even acknowledging her as his \"commander\" and Maiev sarcastically remarking that they did not need his hyperbolic account of his contributions.\nMaiev fervently rejects any comparison between her and Illidan, but several characters who have dealt with both on a personal level have reflected on the striking similarities of their attitudes and methods, Akama and Malfurion most prominently among them. Although she appears to retain mistrust for Illidan and his demon hunters, she is nevertheless pragmatic enough to release and fight alongside them in the face of an existential threat, and she played a major role in breaching the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nWhen the War of the Ancients broke out, she could do little but observe the destruction, and witnessed demons slaughtering her family and friends. She was horrified. When she miraculously survived the War of the Ancients, she was certain that arcane magic was a horrid, filthy power that had brought doom to the world.\nPersonal traits.\nMaiev is a driven, austere individual. She both fears and despises arcane magic, and shows her derision openly to its practitioners. Aloof and silent, Maiev is always concerned with her duties or latest assignment. She does not care for the company of others; she refuses to let interpersonal relationships interfere with her cause. Maiev moves with fluid, deadly grace. Her voice is velvet-covered steel. Maiev is cold; her only warmth comes from her rage when she thinks of the Legion's destruction and Illidan\u2019s horrible treason. Hers is an achingly lonely existence.\nMaiev sees things very much in black and white, and in recent years, lost belief in the concepts of rehabilitation or redemption that she was trained to uphold in Elune's name. She is unwilling to forgive any association that is tied to the Legion or brings harm to others, whether a large one such as Illidan's ultimately siding with Azshara and causing the deaths of millions of life-forms or a comparatively small one such as Drak'thul's presence during the raising of the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, leading to the deaths of many orcs.\nMaiev is loyal to her comrades and determined to ensure they come to no harm. Her fury at Illidan was originally motivated by her disapproval of his actions with Azshara and the fact that he nearly killed Jarod. Later, she is driven to blind hatred after his murder of Naisha and the other Watchers. \nBy tracing her personality first as a priestess, then as a warden, and finally as vengeance, we can see how she came to hate Illidan in particular. Her election as Illidan's jailor really meant that she became as much a prisoner as he; they merely occupied opposite sides of the bars. Given that, her resentment and rage towards Illidan is easy to understand.\nHer first motivation was to punish Illidan for his transgression (which a Kaldorei tribunal sentenced him to, not she), then to stop him from killing anyone else, and finally, pure vengeance.\nCombat.\nMaiev prefers to strike vulnerable targets from surprise, often sending her forces to distract the enemy while she uses her blink ability to appear behind them. She throws a slicing torrent against lesser opponents, or uses her \"Fan of Knives\" if surrounded. If facing her quarry, she uses the umbra crescents \"greater shadow strike\" ability before moving in to attack. After one strike, she blinks away and casts \"hold person\". If the target succumbs to the spell, she moves forward quickly to finish him off or secure the captive. If he resists \"hold person\", Maiev activates her weapon's \"quickened shadow strike\" abilities to assail her target at range. If the enemy still stands, she uses her own \"lesser shadow strike\" ability and charges into melee, where she wields her umbra crescent with two hands.

Prior to &lt;a href=\"patch%202.1.3\"&gt;patch 2.1.3&lt;/a&gt;, any piece of mail you read would only last for 3 days from being read.\nAfter the expiry period, the mail is returned to the sender. If the mail comes from the &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt;, a quest NPC, or anything similar, it is simply discarded and any item or money attached to it is lost.\nMailbox size.\nThe maximum number of messages that a Mailbox can hold is unknown, but the Mailbox will only display the first 100 messages. Any messages over 100 will still exist within the Mailbox, but will not be displayed. To view the messages beyond the first 100, some of the messages will have to be removed (by reading and taking the attachment or by deleting). Once a message has been removed (making a spot available for one of the non-displayed messages), simply close the mail window and reopen the mailbox.\nMail from the Auction House is always displayed last and is not lost even when other players can no longer send you mail. This suggests that instead of being sent right away and stored with other mail, mail from the Auction House is loaded from the auction database (in in-universe terms, conjured from the AH's vaults) when opened.\nNon-player senders of mail.\nSometimes &lt;a href=\"NPC\"&gt;NPC&lt;/a&gt;s send mail with &lt;a href=\"money\"&gt;money&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"item\"&gt;item&lt;/a&gt;s, or just messages to player characters, usually related to completion of a &lt;a href=\"quest\"&gt;quest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Auction%20House\"&gt;Auction House&lt;/a&gt; will send the following by mail:\nBlizzard &lt;a href=\"Game%20Master\"&gt;GMs&lt;/a&gt; may send you in-game mail in response to &lt;a href=\"open%20ticket\"&gt;open ticket&lt;/a&gt;s or general notification. These may include &lt;a href=\"Bind%20on%20Pickup\"&gt;Bind on Pickup&lt;/a&gt; items or &lt;a href=\"Currency\"&gt;Currency&lt;/a&gt;.\n will send you your if your inventory was full when you \"spoke with him\".\nThe WoW Dev Team may send you in-game mail, such as &lt;a href=\"Perky%20Pug\"&gt;Perky Pug&lt;/a&gt; once the &lt;a href=\"Looking%20For%20Multitudes\"&gt;Looking For Multitudes&lt;/a&gt; is achieved.\nPortable Mailboxes.\nA few items may be used as portable mailboxes; players can bring them with them as items or abilities to access the mail-system anywhere in the game. This is very useful as it saves a lot of time to not have to return to a stationary mailbox every time you have to send something. Examples of portable mailboxes are:\nWhen you place MOLL-E or GUMM-E, any number of players can use it, and they don't have to be in your party or raid.\nNotice that both these items have long cooldowns (first has 2 hours and second 4 hours), meaning they cannot be used by the players possessing them at all times. Portable mailboxes reduce a player's need to see stationary mailboxes, but does not completely remove it unless a player hardly ever sends or receives any mail."}

Along with Dal'rend, Maim served as the co-leader of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt; until his death in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiography.\nRise of the Horde.\n6 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; sought to convince &lt;a href=\"Blackhand\"&gt;Chieftain Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; to take up the mantle of &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. To help convince the chieftain, Gul'dan taught some of the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"shaman\"&gt;shaman&lt;/a&gt; in the ways of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt; magic and how to rapidly grow adolescent orcs to adulthood by imbuing them with fel power. Blackhand was astounded by the results and ordered the shaman to transform his young sons Dal'rend and Maim into \"proper soldiers\". After coming of age Maim served as a member of the Horde, participating in the &lt;a href=\"Genocide%20of%20the%20draenei\"&gt;savage war&lt;/a&gt; against the &lt;a href=\"draenei\"&gt;draenei&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the siege of &lt;a href=\"Telmor\"&gt;Telmor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20clan\"&gt;Frostwolf clan&lt;/a&gt; was offered the city as a reward for leading the raid on it. When Durotan turned it down, Blackhand and his family were more than happy to take Telmor as their own, even going so far as wearing the clothes and sleeping in the beds of the draenei they had killed. This ended when the whole of the Orcish Horde was moved to &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Citadel\"&gt;Hellfire Citadel&lt;/a&gt; to better carry out the orders of Blackhand. After this, Maim alongside Dal'rend accompanied Blackhand into &lt;a href=\"Blade%27s%20Edge%20Mountains\"&gt;Blade's Edge&lt;/a&gt;, where an alliance of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and orcs was made. Eventually, both sons drank the &lt;a href=\"Blood-curse\"&gt;blood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nFirst War.\nDal'rend and Maim ultimately became leaders of the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;, an offshoot of the Blackrock, and accompanied their father through the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. After Warchief Blackhand was killed by &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend and Maim continued ruling over the Black Tooth Grin.\nTides of Darkness.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, Maim served the new Warchief &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;. He and his brother &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend&lt;/a&gt; often questioned Doomhammer's orders, as Orgrim killed Blackhand the Destroyer and took his place as Warchief, but they never disobeyed any of his orders. However, Orgrim allowed the insubordination both because he knew any explanations he gave would filter back to the rest of the Horde and because the two brothers were leaders of the powerful &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;. Later Maim and his brother were amongst the army who &lt;a href=\"Burning%20of%20Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;attacked&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring the siege of the &lt;a href=\"Capital%20City\"&gt;Capital City&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend was ordered by Doomhammer to have his clan break off and chase after the traitorous &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt;, who had taken to the sea in search of the &lt;a href=\"Eye%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Eye of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;. Maim followed his brother as their army battled against &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt;, but once they learned that Gul'dan had perished within the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20Sargeras\"&gt;Tomb of Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; they retrieved his &lt;a href=\"Skull%20of%20Gul%27dan\"&gt;skull&lt;/a&gt; from one of the &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Stormreaver%20clan\"&gt;followers&lt;/a&gt; before sailing back east and returning to Doomhammer.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"dragon%20rider\"&gt;dragon rider&lt;/a&gt;s dispatched by &lt;a href=\"Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt; found the Black Tooth Grin's vessels and delivered word of the Horde's retreat to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend and Maim ordered the Black Tooth Grin to alter course and sail to &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;. That region was still under Horde control, and from there they could reach Blackrock Spire by land. However, near the island of &lt;a href=\"Crestfall\"&gt;Crestfall&lt;/a&gt;, the Horde fleet was attacked by &lt;a href=\"Daelin%20Proudmoore\"&gt;Admiral Proudmoore&lt;/a&gt;'s Alliance navy, which was accompanied by &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"gryphon%20rider\"&gt;gryphon rider&lt;/a&gt;s. Dal'rend and Maim's ship and a few other vessels survived intact, but most of the Horde fleet was sunk by Proudmoore's superior forces and the dragon riders scattered in all directions.\nMaim and Dal'rend later personally fought &lt;a href=\"Turalyon\"&gt;Turalyon&lt;/a&gt; at the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;, only to flee when it became evident that the &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt; had the upper hand.\nWhile most of the rest of the Horde was defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the Second War, Dal'rend and Maim evaded capture and took control of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; along with other Horde survivors, with Dal'rend declaring himself Warchief of the weakened Blackrock clan. Dal'rend and Maim despised Orgrim for having killed their father and blamed him for the Horde's defeat, and the brothers now planned to &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;reforge the Horde&lt;/a&gt; as they saw fit. They gradually reached out to other large groups of survivors, trying to rally them under their new banner. While the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; ignored them, the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; pledged their support and offered to give some of their enslaved &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragons&lt;/a&gt; to Dal'rend and Maim's forces if they were ever needed.\nBeyond the Dark Portal.\nAbout two years later, the Dark Portal reopened and emissaries from &lt;a href=\"Ner%27zhul\"&gt;Ner'zhul&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Teron%20Gorefiend\"&gt;Teron Gorefiend&lt;/a&gt;, were immediately sent to Dal'rend and Maim asking them to rejoin the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, and to ask to borrow the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragon\"&gt;red dragon&lt;/a&gt;s held captive by the allied &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt;. Dal'rend only laughed and refused. Not only did he call Ner'zhul a coward for staying safe in &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; while he fought the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, but that Ner'zhul would fail in time. Unable to enter an agreement, Teron left the warchief to his bidding.\nNot long after, &lt;a href=\"Nefarian\"&gt;Nefarian&lt;/a&gt;, sent by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;, came to Blackrock Spire. He quickly took command of the Blackhand brothers and the forces under their control. \nWorld of Warcraft.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Eitrigg\"&gt;Eitrigg&lt;/a&gt;, Dal'rend and Maim continued ruling over Blackrock Spire, in constant conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;. They eventually managed to displace the dwarves in the upper portion of the city, but only after the dragons came and only after the death of Maim.\nWarcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans.\nIn the canceled \"\", Maim and his brother Rend were the two who killed &lt;a href=\"Thrall\"&gt;Thrall&lt;/a&gt;'s father &lt;a href=\"Durotan\"&gt;Durotan&lt;/a&gt;. They were traitors to their race, as they collaborated with the &lt;a href=\"internment%20camps\"&gt;internment camps&lt;/a&gt; system for gold and favors. They paid a fortune for the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt;s to create the &lt;a href=\"black%20ale\"&gt;black ale&lt;/a&gt; which would keep the orcs pacified, and were about to make a blood pact in agreement to aid &lt;a href=\"Aedelas%20Blackmoore\"&gt;Lieutenant Blackmoore&lt;/a&gt; with the forces of their &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin%20clan\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin clan&lt;/a&gt;. Thrall interrupted the meeting by setting the room ablaze, and Rend and Maim were trapped between the fires, confronted by the orc whose family they had murdered. Rend, reduced to begging, tried to claim he was forced to by his father, but Thrall failed to fall for Rend's lie, and used their blood mixed together to kill them with the \"Eternal Damnation\" spell, causing their flesh to melt and their souls being sent to hell for all eternity.\nIn the RPG.\nAfter their father\u2019s assassination, Maim and his brother Rend took what followers they could and splintered off from the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Clan\"&gt;Blackrock Clan&lt;/a&gt;, founding the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Tooth%20Grin\"&gt;Black Tooth Grin&lt;/a&gt; clan. They did this to retain some of the power which they believed was their birthright, without directly opposing &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;'s accession to power, so he would take no action against them. During the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, they were given control of the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt;. Some rumors say that Maim retreated with Kilrogg Deadeye to Draenor, only to die there, either to human blades or as a victim of betrayal. However, this was not the case.\nEventually, Dark Iron dwarves from Blackrock Depths tried to destroy the Dark Horde. The Dark Horde fought back, and Maim was killed in savage battle, however his sacrifice, plus Rend's \"alliance\" with the black dragonflight, allowed his brother to drive back the Dark Irons and maintain his hold on Blackrock Spire."}

The main assist's job is to have one specific mob targeted at all times until it's dead, and then to switch to the next target to be killed, whereas the main tank must switch targets frequently to keep &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt; up. In many cases, the MA will sometimes also serve as &lt;a href=\"off%20tank\"&gt;off tank&lt;/a&gt; which means he will peel the mob he is DPSing off from the tank (by taunt or pulling DPS aggro). In five-man groups having a non-tanking warrior, this is common but not universal.\nIntroduction.\nAny party with more than one attacker should have a main assist (MA). This is important to reduce the damage being dealt to the party. Concentrating on one mob at a time reduces the inbound damage faster than every one killing their own mob.\nIdeally the MA will be familiar with the instance and must be able to prioritize the targets at hand. Prioritizing targets is very hard to quantify and depends almost always on the specific circumstances. However, as a general rule of thumb, you must ensure your &lt;a href=\"squishies\"&gt;squishies&lt;/a&gt; are ok, and then take down the &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"summon\"&gt;summoner&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"nuker\"&gt;nuker&lt;/a&gt;s, and then the rest. This is where knowledge of the instance comes in.\nNaturally, the ordering depends on the instance and case in hand. Also, some of the more dangerous and/or annoying mobs can be &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;led, or some simply &lt;a href=\"off%20tank\"&gt;off tank&lt;/a&gt;ed somewhere out of range where they can't cause much trouble. The party &lt;a href=\"leader\"&gt;leader&lt;/a&gt; will usually call these shots ahead of the fight.\nHaving a main assist makes both &lt;a href=\"tanking\"&gt;tanking&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt; easier. Since most &lt;a href=\"mobs\"&gt;mobs&lt;/a&gt; will not have too much aggro, the Main &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt; just has to keep an eye on managing aggro, and mainly concentrate on the MA's target, and it obviously helps the &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt; since they don't have to heal everyone who accidentally gets &lt;a href=\"aggro\"&gt;aggro&lt;/a&gt;.\nClasses that should not be main assist.\nClasses who change their target often due to other party duties are not particularly useful MAs. Classes dealing ranged damage usually have more oversight. &lt;a href=\"Mage\"&gt;Mage&lt;/a&gt;s sometimes have their sheep targeted, all healing classes also tend to target something else from time to time. Tanking &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;s must keep switching targets around them to make sure they don't run off and go kill a &lt;a href=\"squishy\"&gt;squishy&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhat the Main Assist wants You to do.\nIf a party has a main assist, then other members of that party should be helping the MA to take that target down. Obviously this should not get in the way of other roles such as &lt;a href=\"healing\"&gt;healing&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt;, etc.\nIt is \"invaluable\" to have a macro set up such as the &lt;a href=\"Most_used_macros%23Assist_Main_Tank.2FMain_Assist\"&gt;Assist Main Tank/Main Assist&lt;/a&gt; macro. Being able to target the MA's target with the press of a key is much quicker and less error-prone than having to first target the MA and then press a key to target \"his\" target. An alternative is to use a target-frame &lt;a href=\"AddOn\"&gt;AddOn&lt;/a&gt; which continually shows the target of the MA, and that you can quickly click on."}

{"id": "28036", "revid": "41591544", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28036", "title": "Main tank", "text": "Generally, a main tank is first of all a &lt;a href=\"tank\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, the term usually carries a few different meanings, depending on context:\nThe reason why you need a main tank is that when fighting strong mobs, often the healers and damage dealers will be killed with only a few hit from the mobs. Even if they can keep themselves alive with &lt;a href=\"crowd%20control\"&gt;crowd control&lt;/a&gt; abilities or healing spam from the healers, their own healing or damage dealing job will be affected. Therefore, the most effective way when fighting those mobs is to have a high armor and stamina main tank to keep the aggro of the mobs on him, so that the healers and damage dealers can concentrate on their own job.\nThere are currently five combinations of spec and class which can fulfill the MT role: Protection &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, guardian &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;, protection &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;, brewmaster &lt;a href=\"monk\"&gt;monk&lt;/a&gt;, and blood &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;. There are many other combinations of class and spec which can serve as a tank, but none of them deserve the label \"main tank\".\nPrior to the release of the Burning Crusade, only warriors were truly able to main tank, leveling a warrior was tedious and learning the tanking skills was (and is) difficult. In consequence, there were only a few outstanding players who reached the status of main tank. Since at the same time a tanks job is extremely important, highly skilled and well equipped and warriors were highly valued. The importance of a main tank was such that some raiding groups simply dissolved after their main tank quit.\nWith the later patches, four other specs have become viable main tanks, and as a role tanking has been made far more engaging. Hence main tanks aren't as scarce as they used to be, but the main tank is still an extremely important member of any raid or group.\nSomeone who tanks less or weaker mobs to take pressure off the main tank is known as the &lt;a href=\"off%20tank\"&gt;off tank&lt;/a&gt;."}

They have been seen as a danger to both the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; in the forest, and &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s are often sent to combat the menace. These gnolls can be found in northeastern and southeastern &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey were led by their alphas as well as a matriarch.\nHistory.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nDue to their coordinated attacks, they posed a threat to the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; as they began spreading and became more savage very likely because of the &lt;a href=\"Zukk%27ash\"&gt;Zukk'ash&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"silithid\"&gt;silithid&lt;/a&gt;, who they also fought against. When &lt;a href=\"Raschal%20the%20Courier\"&gt;Raschal the Courier&lt;/a&gt; was in the &lt;a href=\"Feralas\"&gt;Feralas&lt;/a&gt; forests, he ran into the Woodpaw gnolls. They took his backpacks, and they also got hold of &lt;a href=\"Raschal%20the%20Courier\"&gt;Raschal&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Undelivered%20Parcel\"&gt;undelivered parcel&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Hadoken%20Swiftstrider\"&gt;Hadoken Swiftstrider&lt;/a&gt; asked Horde &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to take down the alphas of the Woodpaws, hoping it would cause chaos in their ranks and send a message that the Horde can and would destroy them.\nCataclysm.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; entered their lands and built a &lt;a href=\"Shadebough\"&gt;camp&lt;/a&gt; there. The first of Shandris's direct orders in the area was to deal with the gnolls. They've been spreading too far, too fast, and were becoming a threat to both the forest and the Sentinels' war effort. After taking the camp, the Sentinels have been leading covert strikes against them.\nTo Hadoken's disbelief, the brutish gnolls have proven resilient, and he had to drive them back time after time from the camp. It was only his chieftain's mercy that prevented them from being wiped out entirely. Both he and &lt;a href=\"Adella\"&gt;Adella&lt;/a&gt; asked adventurers to once again strike at the alphas and thin their numbers.\nThere's a camp deep in the &lt;a href=\"Lower%20Wilds\"&gt;Lower Wilds&lt;/a&gt;, but it was destroyed, and its Woodpaw inhabitants killed, by &lt;a href=\"the%20Razza\"&gt;the Razza&lt;/a&gt;.\nTraveler.\nAt some point after the Cataclysm, the Woodpaw gnolls drove &lt;a href=\"Hackle\"&gt;Hackle&lt;/a&gt; away because he was too small to be a brute. After that, he was captured by the &lt;a href=\"Gordunni\"&gt;Gordunni&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s and brought to &lt;a href=\"Dire%20Maul\"&gt;Dire Maul&lt;/a&gt; to fight as a &lt;a href=\"gladiator\"&gt;gladiator&lt;/a&gt;. It's also implied that the gnolls were being enslaved before that. The Woodpaw were driven east to the area near the &lt;a href=\"Thousand%20Needles\"&gt;Thousand Needles&lt;/a&gt; border by the Gordunni, who cut down the trees and drove out their hyenas and game in their old territory. There, they set up a new Woodpaw village. The ogres' actions also drove the Woodpaw into conflict with the &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Scar\"&gt;Feral Scar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"yeti\"&gt;yeti&lt;/a&gt;s, who had also been driven east by the deforestation. The conflicts resulted in the deaths of their two previous matriarchs and brutes. As such, they no longer have a matriarch to lead them, so &lt;a href=\"Jaggal\"&gt;Jaggal&lt;/a&gt; the brute proclaimed himself to decide for the Woodpaw. He hopes that his daughter &lt;a href=\"Sivet\"&gt;Sivet&lt;/a&gt; would become the new matriarch.\nEventually, the yetis allied with the gnolls to battle the ogres together. To celebrate the new alliance made possible by Aram and his group, the Woodpaw village hosted a feast for them.\nThe Woodpaw clan responded to &lt;a href=\"Makasa%20Flintwill\"&gt;Makasa Flintwill&lt;/a&gt;'s letters asking them to assist in Aram's rescue from the &lt;a href=\"Hidden%20citadel\"&gt;Hidden citadel&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Hellfire%20Peninsula\"&gt;Hellfire Peninsula&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Outland\"&gt;Outland&lt;/a&gt;. After Feral Scar secured &lt;a href=\"pirate\"&gt;pirate&lt;/a&gt; ships, Jaggal, Sivet, and other gnolls and the yetis were transported into the &lt;a href=\"Eastern%20Kingdoms\"&gt;Eastern Kingdoms&lt;/a&gt; and reunited with their friends in the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Portal\"&gt;Dark Portal&lt;/a&gt; valley in the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;. After entering Hellfire Peninsula, a few of their fastest gnolls were chosen to scout ahead to &lt;a href=\"Falcon%20Watch\"&gt;Falcon Watch&lt;/a&gt;. Upon marching the army, the yetis and gnolls fought together in front of the citadel against the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. Ultimately, the Azerothian army was triumphant, defeating the majority of enemies. The Woodpaws and Feral Scars then returned home.\nExploring Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, they were raiding &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Mojache\"&gt;Camp Mojache&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Camp%20Ataya\"&gt;Camp Ataya&lt;/a&gt;, both of which needed help. As a response, the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20Council\"&gt;Horde Council&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Belgrom%20Rockmaul\"&gt;Belgrom Rockmaul&lt;/a&gt; to answer their calls for help. Belgrom reported that adventurers had aided him in thinning the enemy forces, but it wasn't enough. According to &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt;'s report, there is a tug-of-war between gnolls, yetis, silithid, and Horde going on in Feralas."}

They are also known as saber worgs. These can mostly be found in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Borean%20Tundra\"&gt;Borean Tundra&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the RPG.\nThey grow 10 feet long and weigh over 1000 pounds. Like normal wolves, their pelts range in color from pitch black to gray, brown, and even snowy white. Worgs live for the hunt, both for the sheer joy of it and because their larger bodies require large amounts of meat. Some humanoid races value worgs as steeds due to their increased intellect, but a worg's foul disposition turns away many trainers. Instinctive pack hunters, worgs prefer to attack in tandem. They enjoy surrounding an opponent, tripping him up, and then attacking relentlessly as he tries to rise. A badly wounded worg usually flees.\nSpeculation.\n&lt;a href=\"Worgen\"&gt;Worgen&lt;/a&gt; seem to be named after worgs, as such the wolf demigod &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt; could be a worg."}

{"id": "15771", "revid": "5695922", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=15771", "title": "Worgen", "text": "Worgen are large, &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;lupine&lt;/a&gt; humanoids that walk upright, but hunt and howl as wolves, and lope on all fours to run. They primarily inhabit forests and are natural hunters. Being bitten by or drinking the blood of a worgen transmits the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; and causes &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; to be transformed into one. After the transformation, those that are overcome by rage and guilt gradually lose all vestiges of their former lives and turn &lt;a href=\"Mindless%20state\"&gt;mindless&lt;/a&gt;. By controlling their emotions via medication, magic, and self-discipline, worgen may resist being overcome by their feral instincts.\nThose that become so by choice, like the members of the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt;, embrace their new lives as neither man nor beast and form tribal societies known as \"packs\", such as the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Bloodmoon%20pack\"&gt;Bloodmoon pack&lt;/a&gt;. Other groups are more disciplined, like the Gilnean worgen, but still run and hunt on all fours.\nThe worgen were created during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt; by the grieving priestess &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; and the rebel druid &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt;. They sought a solution to the wolf &lt;a href=\"Pack%20form\"&gt;pack form&lt;/a&gt;, which embodied the full fury of the wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, something the druids had never been able to command, and believed that the magic of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; could tame its uncontrollable rage. She thus created the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, which mixed the power of the moon goddess with the wolf form, turning Ralaar and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; into the first worgen. They turned the tide in the war, but when &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; called Ralaar (now known as Alpha Prime) a monstrosity, the worgen attacked the night elves as well. Malfurion was forced to seal them within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; after it was discovered that their bite turned other night elves into more worgen, through what is now called the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;.\nCenturies later, Alpha Prime and his followers were freed from the Dream by the human archmage &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; to defend &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; from the undead &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;. While extremely effective against the undead army, the worgen then turned on the Gilneans, prompting them to close the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt;. While no worgen managed to enter the city, humans who had been bitten by them did. They would turn into worgen themselves and were hunted by the nobility of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20peninsula\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, including King &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;. Led by Alpha Prime, the worgen outside grew in number, used tunnels under the Greymane Wall, and mounted an invasion to bite as many as possible. After being taught how to control their inner beast by the night elves, through the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Ritual of Balance&lt;/a&gt;, many worgen are now members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nLong ago, amid a brutal &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;war&lt;/a&gt; between the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; and the demonic &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, a group of &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s practiced a &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;powerful yet unwieldy form&lt;/a&gt; that embodied the fury of the wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;. Led by &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Ralaar Fangfire&lt;/a&gt;, these Druids of the Pack sought to temper the uncontrollable rage inherent in their chosen form. To do so, they willingly submitted to the energies of the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, a mystical artifact created from Goldrinn's fang and the staff of &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;.\nRather than abate the druids' fury, however, the weapon transformed Ralaar and his followers into worgen: bestial humanoids enslaved by their own primal instincts. Blinded by all-consuming rage, Ralaar's druids tore through friend and foe alike during battle with the satyrs. Night elves wounded by the unruly beasts contracted a virulent &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20curse\"&gt;curse&lt;/a&gt; that turned them into worgen as well. Desperate to stanch the affliction's spread, Archdruid &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; mournfully banished the worgen beneath &lt;a href=\"Daral%27nir\"&gt;Daral'nir&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt;, where they would be in peaceful slumber for all eternity.\nRelease.\nOver the years, the Scythe of Elune was hidden in Ashenvale, and the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt; - the original worgen - were forgotten. The only proof that remained was a journal written by &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt;. Before their release, wolf-men were known in human folklore as worgen. They were known in only in the timid whispers or the fanciful embellishments of the old, and a farmer's child was likely to hear myths of beastly wolf-men stalking the fields and marshes outside the village. In his studies, the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ur\"&gt;Ur&lt;/a&gt; saw the worgen in a &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;homeworld&lt;/a&gt; he described as a dark place of &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Nightmare\"&gt;nightmare&lt;/a&gt;, and although he wished to prove worgen were real, he warned that they should not be summoned. While many remained in the resting state, &lt;a href=\"Feral%20Worgen%20%28Val%27sharah%29\"&gt;some kaldorei worgen&lt;/a&gt; awoke and traveled the dream some time after their banishment, while others practiced shadow magic some time before their release.\nArugal and the Bloodfang.\nWhile &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas Menethil&lt;/a&gt; marched on the elven kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt;, the undead roamed the ruins of Lordaeron, gathering in hordes. One of these hordes spilled into Silverpine Forest, ravaging the area until eventually arriving at the Greymane Wall. While a small gathering at first that battered at the mighty wall, the group grew in number overtime until it was clear that an army had amassed. Gilneas had constructed the wall to separate from the Alliance of Lordaeron; and Greymane at first had felt vindicated in his choice as Lordaeron fell. However, as the Scourge numbers grew, he knew they could not remain idle.\nArchmage Arugal told Genn of his findings, about bestial creatures imbued with preternatural strength and ferocity. He sensed that they were in some sort of resting state and wished to be freed, and suggested he could do so with Genn's blessing. The archmage's only hesitation was the ferocity of the worgen, that they may not be capable of being controlled, but as the &lt;a href=\"Gilnean%20military\"&gt;Gilnean military&lt;/a&gt; was being decimated below, there were few other options. The king agreed, on the condition that Arugal summon one first to be inspected. He did so, and with Genn's permission, summoned more, including &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;, and put them against the Scourge outside the wall. As the battle between the Gilneans and Scourge raged outside the wall, Arugal performed his summoning. He opened a rift connecting the physical world with the Emerald Dream, drawing the worgen into Silverpine Forest. The wolf-men wasted no time in turning their fury on the Scourge. They tore through the undead in a storm of fang and claw, and the creatures were even more powerful than Arugal had expected.\nAt first this plan worked, and the Scourge were forced to fall back. However, with the undead army in retreat, Alpha Prime and the summoned worgen turned on the Gilnean soldiers as well. After the retreat of the Scourge, Archmage Arugal betrayed his nation and swore loyalty to Alpha Prime and developed a loyalty to the worgen. Gilnean soldiers bitten by the worgen were taken inside the wall, and when they became worgen themselves, were hunted and killed, but could not be exterminated. Alpha Prime was the master of the worgen in Silverpine forest, and held the maddened Arugal under his sway.\nLed by Alpha Prime, and aided by the Archmage Arugal, the worgen of Silverpine sieged the keep of the noble &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Silverlaine\"&gt;Baron Silverlaine&lt;/a&gt;. Situated above the tiny hamlet of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt;, the keep quickly fell into shadow and ruin, now known as &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;. There, Alpha Prime and Arugal Arugal created the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt; to search for the missing Scythe of Elune. The Wolf Cult recruited humans willing to become worgen. The curse rapidly spread among the &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; population, transforming ordinary men and women into ravenous, feral creatures immune to undeath. Arugal also used his magic to curse the village people of &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood\"&gt;Pyrewood&lt;/a&gt; to turn into worgen whenever the sun went down. Those that followed Alpha Prime would become the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;, those that served Arugal became the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20pack\"&gt;Shadowfang Pack&lt;/a&gt;, and those cursed to appear as worgen only at night became the &lt;a href=\"Moonrage%20pack\"&gt;Moonrage Pack&lt;/a&gt;.\nVelinde and the Terrowulf.\nAt approximately the same time, the &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;Night Elf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Sentinel\"&gt;Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; was given the task of clearing &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s. While the Scourge ravaged the Eastern Kingdoms, Felwood was under siege by demonic forces, left over from the second invasion of the Burning Legion. The wounded and the dying were transported back to Darnassus, and Velinde Starsong was tasked with finding a means to defeat the demons. She prayed to Elune for a sign, and spent long hours in Darnassian libraries searching for an answer. As her time to return to her post drew near, her prayers were answered. Velinde had never heard of the Druids of the Scythe, and while searching for an answer to the demon problem, discovered the journal of &lt;a href=\"Fandral%20Staghelm\"&gt;Fandral Staghelm&lt;/a&gt; written after the death of &lt;a href=\"Valstann%20Staghelm\"&gt;his son&lt;/a&gt;, describing Scythe of Elune and wolf-men who had turned the tide in the War of the Satyr. She recalled as well that her &lt;a href=\"Mel%27Thandris%20Starsong\"&gt;aunt&lt;/a&gt; had spoken of an ancient artifact secretly entrusted to her before her death, and went to investigate &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;her tomb&lt;/a&gt;. There, she prayed once again to Elune and was granted the Scythe of Elune, the very artifact the journal spoke of.\nShe prayed to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; and was granted the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, which had been the tool for the creation of the original worgen, and which could also summon worgen. Velinde received a vision after touching the scythe, in which the worgen battled an unflinching enemy, &lt;a href=\"Lords%20of%20the%20Emerald%20Flame\"&gt;Lords of the Emerald Flame&lt;/a&gt;, in a vicious war. In reality, the Lords were the &lt;a href=\"satyr\"&gt;satyr&lt;/a&gt; that had fought against the night elves and worgen in the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;.\nUsing the Scythe of Elune, Velinde was able to summon thirty worgen to fight at her side against the demons. Later Velinde began to notice that some of her force were unaccounted for. It was as though the Scythe of Elune no longer required her presence to perform the summoning process. Perplexed by this development, she ordered the remaining worgen to remain at the &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Mel%27Thandris\"&gt;Shrine of Mel'Thandris&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt; and began to search for &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt;, whom she had heard also summoned worgen. From that point on her fate became a mystery to her comrades, but it was rumored that she was killed in &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt; and lost the Scythe of Elune. The &lt;a href=\"Terrowulf\"&gt;Terrowulf&lt;/a&gt; worgen stayed at the Shrine in Ashenvale for a while, and eventually left, though it is not known where they went.\nJitters and the Nightbane.\nVelinde believed Archmage Arugal could be of help and set out to visit Shadowfang Keep, taking with her the Scythe of Elune. Upon her arrival in Booty Bay, she sent word to Shadowfang Keep of her intention to visit. Unbeknownst to her, Arugal had sworn loyalty to Alpha Prime, and Shadowfang Keep had been made a base for the newly forming Wolf Cult. Her missive never reached either of the pack's leaders, however, and instead fell into the hands of Varkas, a follower of Alpha Prime who sought the scythe to overthrow the pack leader. He and two others set out from Shadowfang Keep, determined to intercept Velinde and take the scythe for their own. Velinde traveled from Booty Bay northward, and as her caravan reached Duskwood - a land cursed to eternal darkness several years prior - she felt as if she were being watched, and retreated to an abandoned mine called Roland's Doom for shelter. There, Varkas and his two followers attacked. In the chaos, Velinde dropped her torch, inadvertently lighting old explosives, and all four died in the resulting cave-in.\nNot long after, the Defias Brotherhood began to excavate mines to fund their own nefarious schemes against Stormwind. While excavating Roland's Doom, a paranoid member - named Jitters - found the Scythe of Elune amidst the rubble. Once he touched it, the very shadows erupted with worgen from the Emerald Dream, killing his comrades as they fled. Jitters lost the Scythe in the chaos, and hid in a barn in a nearby &lt;a href=\"Yorgen%20Farmstead\"&gt;farmstead&lt;/a&gt; owned by &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt;. A few days later, Sven left for Darkshire, and the Dark Riders arrived, driven by the need to collect artifacts and demanding information on the Scythe of Elune from Sven's wife. When she attempted to lead them away, they killed her and her children. It is also known that the dark mage &lt;a href=\"Morganth\"&gt;Morganth&lt;/a&gt; was searching for the Scythe of Elune, and stole &lt;a href=\"Ur%27s%20Treatise%20on%20Shadow%20Magic\"&gt;Ur's Treatise on Shadow Magic&lt;/a&gt; as well.\nThe worgen in Duskwood grew in number, and took over the &lt;a href=\"Rotting%20Orchard\"&gt;Rotting Orchard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Roland%27s%20Doom\"&gt;Roland's Doom&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt;. There, the newly forming Nightbane Pack initiated humans to grow their numbers, constructed huts, practiced shadowmagic, warred amongst themselves, and thrived. The Duskwood and Silverpine worgen made contact, and served Alpha Prime as well as a Duskwood sect of the Wolf Cult, practicing the same rituals and initiations, and searching for the Scythe of Elune for their master. They used &lt;a href=\"Manor%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Manor Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt; and Roland's Doom as sites for rituals and initiation respectively.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nTwenty five years after the Dark Portal, the worgen in &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; turned to live in the wilds of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. During this time, Alpha Prime and his Bloodfang Pack had entered Gilneas using tunnels under the Greymane wall, and had been growing in number inside the nation for years. It is discovered that humans can become worgen, such as &lt;a href=\"Landen%20Stilwell\"&gt;Landen Stilwell&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Kirin%20Tor\"&gt;Kirin Tor&lt;/a&gt; sent &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer%20Ashcrombe\"&gt;Sorcerer Ashcrombe&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Dalaran\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; to investigate Arugal's progress with the undead here in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;. Little did the know that Ashcrombe had lost grasp on sanity. Once freed, he rushed to report to the Kirin Tor. In preparation for an assault on Shadowfang Keep, two &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Deathstalkers\"&gt;Deathstalkers&lt;/a&gt; were sent to the keep to gather intelligence. Days passed, and they did not return. Without their information, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; could not do a successful attack. While scouting the &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Adamant\"&gt;Deathstalker Adamant&lt;/a&gt; was captured and thrown into a cell guarded by a worgen named &lt;a href=\"Rethilgore\"&gt;Rethilgore&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Deathstalker%20Vincent\"&gt;Deathstalker Vincent&lt;/a&gt; was later slain and left lying on the floor. &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; resolved that if the investigating agents of the Forsaken and Kirin Tor would not serve &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;his master&lt;/a&gt; with their sword and knowledge of his enemies, their moldering remains would serve him as a testament to what happens when one is foolish enough to trespass in his domain. Eventually, Arugal was decapitated by the Forsaken and buried in an unmarked grave.\nIn Ashenvale, the Sentinels began to search for Velinde Starsong, finding the Terrowulf pack occupying the Howling Vale. Though the sentinels did not know what the worgen were, it is discovered that they are in some way related to the Scythe of Elune.\nIn Duskwood, the &lt;a href=\"Carevin\"&gt;Carevin family&lt;/a&gt; hired adventurers to hunt the Nightbane Pack, hoping and failing to keep their numbers down.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nTwenty seven years after the Dark Portal opened, the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arthas%20Menethil\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; had heard of Arugal's activities and &lt;a href=\"Shade%20of%20Arugal\"&gt;brought him back&lt;/a&gt; from the dead to work for him. This also meant that several worgen under Arugal's command, the &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt;, allied with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, staying in particular in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt;.\nSome worgen that served under Arugal have been forced into the service of the Lich King, turning them into &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. When worgen were pressed into the service of the Lich King, their minds were flooded with his indomitable will. The instincts of the curse were shattered by his power, leaving the logical, human mind in the service of the Scourge. Worgen death knights are entirely of their own minds once freed, the bestial instincts having been shattered by the Lich King's will, and their self-control having been restored. The result is similar to a worgen who completed the Ritual of Balance. When the Knights of the Ebon Blade were freed from the Lich King after the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Light%27s%20Hope%20Chapel\"&gt;Battle for Light's Hope Chapel&lt;/a&gt;, only the human portions of the mind remained, giving the now free, undead worgen control over its destiny, aside from their new &lt;a href=\"Eternal%20hunger\"&gt;Eternal Hunger&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nIn \"\", it is revealed that the worgen curse has spread into the secluded kingdom of Gilneas, transforming many of its inhabitants into &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. However, with the help of their night elf allies, they have developed a partial treatment to the curse which allows them to retain their sanity even while transformed. The Gilneans, many of which are now infected with the worgen curse, are now found across the world, fighting for the Alliance in the &lt;a href=\"Southern%20Barrens\"&gt;Southern Barrens&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ashenvale\"&gt;Ashenvale&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, and many other areas.\nGilneas.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the gate to the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed, allowing the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; to attack and invade Gilneas unhindered. Where once they attacked Gilneas city, the Bloodfang Pack fought to defend it from the Forsaken in the northern headlands. Within the city, Hiram Creed - a black drakonid in disguise - created the &lt;a href=\"Blackhowl\"&gt;Blackhowl pack&lt;/a&gt;, including worgen and humans strengthened and poisoned by his dragon blood.\nTeldrassil.\nWhile the Gilneas Liberation Front and Bloodfang Pack fought the Forsaken in Gilneas and &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;, most of their non-worgen citizens fled Gilneas to the safety of &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who created the curse in the first place, felt obliged to help the Gilneans. They created a dwelling in Darnassus for them to seek refuge in as the war for their home rages on. Afterwards, Gilneas was re-inducted into the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;.\nSilverpine Forest.\nIn Silverpine, former rebel leader &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; led the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Liberation%20Front\"&gt;Worgen offensive&lt;/a&gt; to defend Gilneas, with the help of &lt;a href=\"Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt;. However, agents of &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; kidnapped his daughter &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt; and held her ransom in exchange for Crowley's surrender. Darius ultimately chose to surrender and fled into Gilneas. However, Bloodfang continued to fight against the Forsaken in the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Foothills\"&gt;Hillsbrad Foothills&lt;/a&gt; and has even recruited the aid of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt;. Gilnean harvest-witches afflicted with the curse were trained as druids, some posing as &lt;a href=\"Inconspicuous%20Bear\"&gt;inconspicuous bears&lt;/a&gt; and launching organized bear attacks on Forsaken battalions.\nMany worgen have taken up the druidic arts as a way to cope with their transformation, to help control their animalistic side or even to learn more about themselves and the powers that helped their race begin.\nFelwood.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Denmother%20Ulrica\"&gt;Denmother Ulrica&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Talonbranch%20Glade\"&gt;Talonbranch Glade&lt;/a&gt;, with the bringing of the Gilnean worgen into the Alliance, it appears that even the feral worgen of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt; have joined the fold. These worgen would be the original night elves of the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Pack\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt;, who caused the worgen to come into existence, to begin with. Together, the night elf worgen, the Gilnean worgen, and the night elves formed the &lt;a href=\"Talonbranch%20pack\"&gt;Talonbranch Pack&lt;/a&gt;, seeking to heal the forest and defeat both the demons and the goblins in the area.\nDuskwood.\nThe Carevin family continues to seek those willing to hunt the Nightbane pack and cull their numbers. Tobias Mistmantle had received a letter from his brother Stalvan but arrived in Darkshire to hear that he was dead. As the town would not tell him, he was forced to investigate his brother's fate on his own. Meanwhile, Oliver Harris has hired Jitters as hired help, as he catches, tests treatments on, and decapitates mindless Nightbane worgen using a guillotine. One subject turns out to be Sven Yorgen, who was bitten some time after his family was murdered by the Dark Riders.\nBlasted Lands.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Refugee\"&gt;refugees&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ruins%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; came to the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Blasted%20Lands\"&gt;Blasted Lands&lt;/a&gt;, following the dream of an idealistic worgen &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Marl%20Wormthorn\"&gt;Marl Wormthorn&lt;/a&gt;. Upon their arrival, Wormthorn believed that the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Scar\"&gt;Tainted Scar&lt;/a&gt; could be healed, and grow it back by creating the great tree &lt;a href=\"Maldraz\"&gt;Maldraz&lt;/a&gt; with his power, allowing the refugees to build &lt;a href=\"Surwich\"&gt;Surwich&lt;/a&gt; where the Tainted Scar was once present.\nHowever, the &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;residual demonic powers&lt;/a&gt; left on the land began to take their toll, and while Wormthorn's attention was drawn to fighting back the demonic taint, the &lt;a href=\"nathrezim\"&gt;nathrezim&lt;/a&gt; who had formerly resided there took the opportunity to infiltrate Maldraz. Once inside, they corrupted Wormthorn's trance and used his body as a weapon to corrupt the great tree, leading to the birth and growing of the &lt;a href=\"Tainted%20Forest\"&gt;Tainted Forest&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn order to halt the corruption, &lt;a href=\"Mayor%20Charlton%20Connisport\"&gt;Mayor Charlton Connisport&lt;/a&gt; sent Alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to kill Marl Wormthorn.\nAt some point, a large number of Gilnean &lt;a href=\"ship\"&gt;ship&lt;/a&gt;s sailed towards Surwich, with only worgen and human civilians aboard. However, the inhabitants of &lt;a href=\"Nethergarde%20Keep\"&gt;Nethergarde Keep&lt;/a&gt; reported that after a few days a storm brought some ships back to the &lt;a href=\"Shattershore\"&gt;Shattershore&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that they had sunk for unknown reasons and that their drowned occupants now haunt the coast.\nMount Hyjal.\nSome Gilnean worgen joined the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; and became &lt;a href=\"Lycanthoth%20Vandal\"&gt;Lycanthoth Vandals&lt;/a&gt;. Others joined the Cenarion Circle and became guardians of &lt;a href=\"Shrine%20of%20Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn's shrine&lt;/a&gt;. The Lycanthoth vandals attempted to usurp Goldrinn with their own dark wolf god, Lycanthoth, but were defeated by those loyal to Goldrinn, including worgen, orcs, tauren, and night elves. Upon Lycanthoth's defeat, Goldrinn was able to return to the mortal world for the first time since his death ten thousand years ago in the War of the Ancients.\nWarlords of Draenor.\nA pack of Gilnean worgen led by &lt;a href=\"Packleader%20Vitale\"&gt;Packleader Vitale&lt;/a&gt; appears in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; wearing Bloodfang Pack warpaint and serving as &lt;a href=\"Lunarfall%20Guard\"&gt;Lunarfall Guard&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegion.\nAfter participating in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20Brigade\"&gt;Gilneas Brigade&lt;/a&gt; engaged with the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;'s fleet in &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;, and established the outpost of &lt;a href=\"Greywatch\"&gt;Greywatch&lt;/a&gt;. They fought with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Queensguard\"&gt;Queensguard&lt;/a&gt; for both the &lt;a href=\"Aegis%20of%20Aggramar\"&gt;Aegis of Aggramar&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Warden%20Towers\"&gt;Warden Towers&lt;/a&gt; spread around the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Battle for Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang Pack&lt;/a&gt; continued to hunt the Forsaken in Silverpine and aided the Gilneans and elves in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Darkshore\"&gt;Battle for Darkshore&lt;/a&gt;.\nWhen Tess Greymane wished to become a worgen, her father refused to give her the bite. \nIn Duskwood, Vassandra Stormclaw began working with Oliver Harris to find treatments to the worgen curse, and have been catching Nightbane worgen as test subjects. The residents of Duskwood had been plagued by Bloodeyes, a particularly ferocious member of the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane pack&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Harris\"&gt;Master Harris&lt;/a&gt;'s sedative was used to bring the worgen back to &lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra Stormclaw&lt;/a&gt; alive, who deemed her a perfect subject to test cures on.\nBiology.\nAppearance.\nWorgen are &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt;-like creatures who possess coarse hair, pointed ears, and long snouts. However, one will also immediately notice their differences from wolves, namely their powerful, two-legged bodies which sport long fangs and dagger-like claws. When worgen shapeshift, their bodies swell, growing a third in girth and height, originally loose-fitting jerkins ripping loudly. A male worgen is at least as tall as a male kaldorei, but nearly twice as wide and far more muscled. Females are on average around 8 feet tall, as are males when hunched over. Unlike the original wolf pack form, the worgen transformation does not cause the individual to grow a tail.\nWorgen are faster and stronger than &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s, with better eyesight and an animal instinct inside them that courses through their veins. Due to their ties with the wilds, worgen can travel great distances by &lt;a href=\"Running%20Wild\"&gt;sprinting on four limbs&lt;/a&gt; at speeds rivaling even the swiftest &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mechanostrider\"&gt;mechanostrider&lt;/a&gt;s. Worgen can leap great distances, across rooftops, between ships at sea, and over battlements.\nDiet.\nWorgen possess a strong preference to meat. Worgen are omnivorous in human form, and are called carnivores and predators in worgen form.\nSome worgen like their meat raw and fresh from the hunt, and Gilnean worgen hunt boar and deer in packs and on all fours. A worgen's feral side will never be fully at rest, and some fantasize about the hunt even in human form. Livestock went missing months prior to the attack on Gilneas, and worgen without morals or those struggling for control have been tempted by &lt;a href=\"Cannibalism\"&gt;human flesh&lt;/a&gt;. Worgen in the Alliance hunt for food in a way that the rest of the Alliance cannot, and can feed upon things others could not, but Genn Greymane still relishes the taste of summer's first fruits.\nSenses.\nWorgen have heightened senses, including sight, smell, and hearing. The worgen curse does more than heighten physical senses, and worgen can see things that no normal human can, such as auras. Eyesight increases in worgen form. Even those that once needed glasses can see as never before and more clearly than ever dreamed possible, though may still need glasses in human form. Genn can see better in his worgen form, even through intense rain.\nWorgen have a great sense of smell. Worgen can detect the smell of the earth, the flora, the lingering scents of foraging animals and their waste, and every odor is unique and immediately perceptible and identifiable. Worgen can smell blood, meat, and prey from a great distance, and may be able to smell fear, the scent of &lt;a href=\"fel\"&gt;fel&lt;/a&gt;, and more. &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Thibeau\"&gt;Eric Thibeau&lt;/a&gt; claims to smell undeath, hatred, violence, and doubt. &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt; fought a man who sought a potion to mask his scent from worgen.\nWorgen have more sensitive hearing. &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; could not help but overhear conversations under Tal'doren, thanks to his heightened hearing. Being a worgen, hairs on the back of Genn's neck stood on end to alert him of someone behind him. &lt;a href=\"Odo%20the%20Blindwatcher\"&gt;Odo the Blindwatcher&lt;/a&gt; lost his eyesight long ago and adapted to using his other senses, similar to bats.\nReproduction.\nThe &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; is just a curse. Its origins are rooted in the druidic &lt;a href=\"Pack%20Form\"&gt;pack form&lt;/a&gt; that was later altered by the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;. The end result is worgen we see today, beings that can transmit their affliction to others via a single bite. In theory, if two worgen were to mate and produce an offspring, that offspring would not be a worgen. The child would merely possess the genetic material of his or her parents, like any other child sans the curse. An &lt;a href=\"Spiky%20Collar\"&gt;oft-forgotten offspring&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"The%20Big%20Bad%20Wolf\"&gt;Big Bad Wolf&lt;/a&gt; exists, though it is unknown how.\nIn addition to bites, the curse can also be transferred through the consumption of worgen blood, or cursed directly from the Scythe of Elune.\nAging, death, and undeath.\nAs with many worgen, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; more often than not remained in his lupine form. He felt stronger, younger that way. When in human form, however, he felt the aches of age. There is no healing factor, however, and many worgen are seen with eye patches, several scars, and damaged ears, and bullets must be removed.\nEven in death, worgen still retain their lupine form, something Jarod Shadowsong had not expected. The worgen curse is beyond druidism, and worgen return to worgen form upon death. The worgen curse persists through death into the afterlife, and worgen can return during the &lt;a href=\"Day%20of%20the%20Dead\"&gt;Day of the Dead&lt;/a&gt; and other cases as . Worgen appear in the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Neena\"&gt;Neena&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Maldraxxus\"&gt;Maldraxxus&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorgen cannot become Forsaken, but can become death knights. The worgen curse makes raising them into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; far more difficult than it is for normal humans. The worgen curse has roots in both the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; (through the wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20Guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;) and the holy power of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, those worgen who imbibe the waters of &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 during the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Ritual of Balance&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 have a further resistance to the corruption of undeath. &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas&lt;/a&gt;' &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; are less powerful than the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt; and are unable to overcome this resistance and turn worgen into &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, but the powers of the Lich King himself are sufficient enough to raise worgen as &lt;a href=\"death%20knight\"&gt;death knight&lt;/a&gt;s. Worgen death knights can shapeshift, such as &lt;a href=\"Grant%20Lazarby\"&gt;Grant Lazarby&lt;/a&gt;. Forsaken can be cursed to appear as worgen, like &lt;a href=\"Apothecary%20Berard\"&gt;Apothecary Berard&lt;/a&gt;.\nWeaknesses.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Wolfsbane\"&gt;Wolfsbane&lt;/a&gt; plant is deadly to worgen, a weakness that persists in either form. It is known to grow in the &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Gilneas\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, and can be found near trees and rocks in the forest. In the Grizzly Hills, &lt;a href=\"trappers\"&gt;trappers&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Silverbrook\"&gt;Silverbrook&lt;/a&gt; claimed to be allergic to wolfsbane root and asked the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to remove it for them, only to discover the trappers were actually &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Bloodmoon worgen&lt;/a&gt;. In Gilneas, wolfsbane was gathered by the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, and later made into oil and applied to weapons, becoming deadly to worgen.\nWorgen are said to hate fire, which can be used to get their attention, and can be extremely effective when caught in their fur and is a much more painful end than the sword. &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt; used to burn the worgen when he killed them, to make sure that they were dead. Worgen do not fear fire, however, and can navigate through actively burning structures to rescue others. Feral worgen use candles, as well as campfires, bonfires, and torches, as seen in &lt;a href=\"Brightwood%20Grove\"&gt;Brightwood Grove&lt;/a&gt;.\nPsychology.\nInstinct.\nWorgen are driven by a hunter's instinct in their veins. Many tend to prefer more natural habitats, and are natural hunters with a propensity to hunt. Their feral side will never truly be at rest. As though it satisfies some deep primal urge, worgen tend to prefer running on all fours over using mounts like Azeroth's other races. Worgen can smell blood, and are excited by it.\nEven among non-feral worgen, respect can be earned within their group by the number of prey hunted or by hunting an incredibly elusive or dangerous prey. &lt;a href=\"Alpha%20Prime\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; describes being unable to hunt as excruciating torture for his kind.\nEmotion.\nWorgen must always control their emotions lest they lose themselves to their form's feral instincts. Rage and guilt are two known emotions that elicit a worgen's transformation. When a worgen is driven to anger, or concentrates with a force of will, the beast within will come forward. Rage is natural to the worgen form.\nWorgen may begin to or even fully shift against their will when taunted, such as Genn Greymane or Tobias Mistmantle. Rage can cause one to take worgen form, such as &lt;a href=\"Grandma%20Wahl\"&gt;Grandma Wahl&lt;/a&gt;.\nLoss, despair, rage, and guilt can cause someone to remain in their worgen form, such as &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; who feared rejection from his daughter, &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt; who found his family butchered, or &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Thorn\"&gt;Lieutenant Thorn&lt;/a&gt; who saw her &lt;a href=\"Baros%20Alexston\"&gt;love&lt;/a&gt; sacrifice himself for her.\nIntelligence.\nMost worgen are sentient and present various levels of intelligence depending on sanity and control. Both disciplined and feral worgen have been shown to communicate with words, growls, and howls as well as through nonverbal communication that is often imperceptible to humans, while mindless worgen have been likened repeatedly to having intelligence akin to a wolf. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Arugal\"&gt;Archmage Arugal&lt;/a&gt; had access to enchantments that allowed his favored worgen servants to retain a fair deal of their human intelligence as well. The source of these enchantments remains a mystery to this day, as Arugal took these secrets with him to his grave.\n&lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Disciplined worgen&lt;/a&gt; are those that struggle to remain civilized, such as &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Tobias%20Mistmantle\"&gt;Tobias Mistmantle&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt;. Some self-disciplined worgen have rejoined the Alliance as powerful allies, prepared to fight to keep their humanity and their place in society. The Gilnean worgen in the Alliance strive to control their feral nature and use the curse as a force to benefit the Alliance and reclaim their homeland. Gilnean worgen can remain still when needed, although there is an evident urge to run, to hunt. Genn Greymane hunts on all fours, accompanied by other worgen members of surviving Gilnean nobility. A well-disciplined worgen may display the same amount of intelligence they had prior to becoming a worgen.\n&lt;a href=\"Feral%20Worgen\"&gt;Feral worgen&lt;/a&gt; are those who embrace the curse and live in the wild full time, such as &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Packleader%20Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Ivar Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, and including the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Terrowulf%20pack\"&gt;Terrowulf&lt;/a&gt; packs. Feral worgen attacked Gilneas under orders from Alpha Prime, including the &lt;a href=\"Bloodfang%20pack\"&gt;Bloodfang pack&lt;/a&gt;. Despite living in the wild, feral worgen are capable of speech, magic, diplomacy and ultimately reasoning despite holding some otherwise primal tendencies. Nightbane worgen steal reading material. The feral worgen of Silverpine and Duskwood are members of the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Mindless%20state\"&gt;Mindless worgen&lt;/a&gt; are those entirely overcome by the curse, such as &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven Yorgen&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Afflicted%20Gilnean\"&gt;some Gilneans&lt;/a&gt;. The rage and instinct of the worgen curse is so strong that, sometimes, reason is lost. The curse's effects on the mind are capable of completely destroying the person that a worgen once was. The condition itself cannot be lifted, but sanity can be restored to those not too far gone. Some worgen go through stages of a mindless state, eventually losing their last vestiges of their former lives, a process that can be irreversible. If panicked, distraught, or enraged, worgen may be vulnerable to the mindless state.\nTreatments.\nOne way worgen can temporarily keep their sanity is by injecting themselves with a serum created by Gilnean chemist, &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;. Another method is undertaking the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Ritual of Balance&lt;/a&gt;, a night elven ritual that makes peace with traumatic events, thus bringing the worgen balance between the human and wolf sides. This ritual involves eating a piece of &lt;a href=\"moonleaf\"&gt;moonleaf&lt;/a&gt; (to help the mind prepare for the ritual) and drinking holy water from &lt;a href=\"moon%20wells\"&gt;moon wells&lt;/a&gt; that recalls traumatic and peaceful events so that a person may gain understanding and balance of one's self.\nCulture.\nFaith.\nWorgen are naturally drawn to and revere the wolf &lt;a href=\"Ancient%20guardian\"&gt;Ancient&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, who in a way, is the progenitor of their race. Some worgen, having had a natural connection to nature, have also taken up &lt;a href=\"druidism\"&gt;druidism&lt;/a&gt;. Typically, those whose minds have been brought back from wildness will continue to revere the same concepts they did prior to their turning into a worgen (such as the Gilneans, many of whom still believe in the Light). It is seen though that some of those who have been turned also embrace and revere the nature-related spirits that resulted in their current status, such as &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and his newly found reverence for Goldrinn.\nMagic.\nSome of the worgen described by &lt;a href=\"Ur\"&gt;Ur&lt;/a&gt; were skilled in the mystic arts. According to Ur, \"their magic is of darkness and corruption\", and curses and supernatural poisons are common. In &lt;a href=\"Duskwood\"&gt;Duskwood&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20Shadow%20Weaver\"&gt;Shadow Weavers&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Nightbane%20pack\"&gt;Nightbane pack&lt;/a&gt; conjure foul shadows to tear their enemies apart from a distance.\n&lt;a href=\"Harvest-witch\"&gt;Harvest witches&lt;/a&gt; who contracted the worgen curse (which was druidic in origin) found that their powers were somewhat amplified, and after making first contact with the night elves cursed harvest witches were offered induction into the &lt;a href=\"Cenarion%20Circle\"&gt;Cenarion Circle&lt;/a&gt; for both study and training as &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druid&lt;/a&gt;s.\nThe worgen curse does more than heighten physical senses, and worgen can see things that no normal human can, such as auras. Worgen have also been shown to have high regeneration capabilities due to their cursed blood.\nNaming conventions.\nOnce turned into a worgen, many keep their human or elven names from before. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gabriel%20Bybee\"&gt;Gabriel Bybee&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sabina%20Pilgrim\"&gt;Sabina Pilgrim&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gryphon-Master%20Clifford\"&gt;Clifford&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eric%20Davidson\"&gt;Eric Davidson&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Desmond\"&gt;Desmond&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Phin%20Odelic\"&gt;Phin Odelic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Envoy%20Ducal\"&gt;Ducal&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ian%20Duran\"&gt;Ian Duran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eadrik\"&gt;Eadrik&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ed\"&gt;Ed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Fiona\"&gt;Fiona&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Grant%20Lazarby\"&gt;Grant Lazarby&lt;/a&gt;, and more.\nSome keep their given name, but have surnames with lupine themes. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Packleader%20Ivar%20Bloodfang\"&gt;Bloodfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bodrin%20Bloodhowl\"&gt;Bloodhowl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sylva%20Darkhowl\"&gt;Darkhowl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Vulric%20Fangborne\"&gt;Fangborne&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Sergeant%20Growlblade\"&gt;Growlblade&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Riley%20Iceclaw\"&gt;Iceclaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Jephet%20Nighthowler\"&gt;Nighthowler&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Rundalf%20Moonstalker\"&gt;Moonstalker&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ellington%20Moonheart\"&gt;Moonheart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Edgard%20Shadeclaw\"&gt;Shadeclaw&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Alexi%20Silenthowl\"&gt;Silenthowl&lt;/a&gt;, and more. Once he turns, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Geoffery%20Tulvan\"&gt;Lord Geoffery Tulvan&lt;/a&gt; is known as Lord Geoffery Wildwolf.\nOnce turned into a worgen, some take a new name altogether. Examples include &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Blackmange\"&gt;Blackmange&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Bloodeyes\"&gt;Bloodeyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Eviscerator\"&gt;Eviscerator&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gorfang\"&gt;Gorfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Gutspill\"&gt;Gutspill&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Smuggler%20Nightfang\"&gt;Nightfang&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Ripsnarl\"&gt;Ripsnarl&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Razorclaw%20the%20Butcher\"&gt;Razorclaw&lt;/a&gt;, and more. \nHunter pet.\n was a tamable pet during &lt;a href=\"Patch%203.1.0\"&gt;3.1&lt;/a&gt; until a &lt;a href=\"Hotfixes/2009%20Archive%23Tuesday%2C%20July%207th\"&gt;hotfix&lt;/a&gt; was deployed on 7 July, shortly after the discovery was widely known on the internet. During this time, the tamed Garwal pets were no longer an effective pet as they were stripped of their abilities and could not even be fed. \n&lt;a href=\"Community%20Manager\"&gt;Community Manager&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Zarhym\"&gt;Zarhym&lt;/a&gt; responded on the forums shortly after the hotfix with this statement:\nOn 21 July, the Garwal skin (appearance) was changed to a normal white &lt;a href=\"worg\"&gt;worg&lt;/a&gt; for all players who had tamed him, and normal pet abilities were restored for those players.\nIn the RPG.\nResembling a cross between &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"dire%20wolf\"&gt;dire wolf&lt;/a&gt;, the hunched over creature is roughly humanoid. Its body is covered in coarse, grayish-black fur with twitching claws and snarling teeth. The creature's eyes are mottled yellow in color, unblinking and devoid of any discernible emotion other than hunger.\nThe worgen are thoroughly evil, delighting in torturing and devouring intelligent creatures. They enjoy hearing the screams of their victims as they tear them apart piece by piece. Worgen never show mercy or remorse. They may seem savage, but they are fairly intelligent and possess a cruel bestial cunning that can come as a surprise to the unprepared. Worgen society is patriarchal, with the strongest of the eldest males leading the pack. Worgen never challenge leadership; the patriarch leads until he is physically incapable of doing so any longer, at which point his younger kin devour him. The worgen see this not as cruelty, but a great honor \u2014 they consume the bodies of their fallen unlike that of their victim's bodies. They believe the flesh and blood of their own kind improves their strength and cunning. Worgen look like humanoid wolves. They dwell in simple huts and usually wear cured leather scraps as rudimentary armor. Worgen do not use weapons, preferring to tear foes apart with their claws. They stand 6 feet tall, except when loping along on all fours, and weigh around 250 pounds. They speak their own &lt;a href=\"Worgen%20%28language%29\"&gt;language&lt;/a&gt;, made up of a variety of growls, barks, and howls.\nMost worgen keep their wolf-like forms at all times, but experiments by the &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; have resulted in human/worgen \"hybrids\" who only appear as worgen under the light of the moon. They carry with them a dark, corrupting malaise that grows wherever they infest, making the surrounding area dark and gloomy. Fiercely territorial creatures, they rarely stray from the general vicinity of the place in which they first appeared. Fearless beasts, they brazenly prowl near both villages and monster lairs. Although worgen display an apparent fondness for nighttime and its darkness, they can perform equally well in the daytime.\nPure killing beasts, worgen tend to attack any creatures that they encounter, regardless of whether animal, humanoid, Scourge or something even more fearsome. Strangely, however, worgen refuse to feed on the remains of their victims, preferring to shred and tear the corpses and then to return immediately to prowling. Rumors suggest that worgen somehow receive sustenance continually from their native dimension... as well as guidance from a distant force. Worgen are usually encountered in small packs near sites of recent intense magical activity. A pack may contain four to twelve individuals. A worgen tribe may contain between twenty and two hundred individuals. The reason for the worgen refusing to devour most of their victims\" may\" be some lingering vestige of sanity in the worgen's minds.\nCombat.\nWorgen prefer to hide in shadows before leaping great distances upon their foes. They attack with feral tenacity, slashing with their deadly claws and biting with sharp, infectious fangs. Worgen are nearly fearless and typically fight to the death, relying on their regeneration to save them. Worgen love nothing more than to pounce on an opponent and tear him to ribbons. If a foe is helpless, the worgen delivers a coup de grace before moving on to another target, unless the fight is well in hand. Then it turns to torture (or \"playtime\") \u2014 and the unfortunate victim is almost certain to wish he had died. The saliva of a worgen carries a dangerous infection that can prove deadly against those who are bitten.\nInspiration.\nThe worgen bear a strong resemblance to the \"Myrkridia\" from Bungie's \"Myth II: Soulblighter\" (a contemporary of Starcraft), especially the idea of them being from another dimension. Besides that, the worgen obviously resemble a werewolf as it is known in popular fiction, particularly the part where they managed to get the curse under control and only changed when the moon was up."}

{"id": "241468", "revid": "38791128", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=241468", "title": "Worgen (playable)", "text": "The worgen of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; are one of the playable &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; races in \"World of Warcraft\", introduced in . It was only recently that worgen were considered anything more than mindless, savage beasts, and even then, many still are to this day. In the hearts of any who have faced their wrath, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilnean&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise, their very name inspires fear. &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt; managed to concoct a partial treatment for the worgen curse. Upon experimenting on captured Gilnean feral worgen, it allowed them to regain their sanity (giving them control of their minds), thus allowing them to retain the semblance of their past human selves. The night elves later offered a more effective treatment: the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Ritual of Balance&lt;/a&gt; would allow them to transform back into their human selves at will. There is, however, no full cure, and even the noblest of worgen hunt in the wilds, run on all fours as if it satisfies some primal urge deep within, and struggle with their own bristling rage.\nUntil level 6 worgen characters are humans located in &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20City%20%28starting%20zone%29\"&gt;Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt; where they get affected by the &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt;. They then quest through the kingdom of Gilneas until around level 10, where they leave to join the wider world. The Gilneans still fight to truly reclaim their home, and as a result, have no capital city to call their own for the time being. &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; rules as the king of a refugee nation from &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and prior to the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Thorns\"&gt;War of the Thorns&lt;/a&gt;, many worgen called the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; their home. As former humans, all worgen speak &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt; as their main language.\nBackground.\nOpening cutscene.\n\"Led by their indomitable king, Genn Greymane, the proud citizens of Gilneas once stood with the Alliance against the vile orcish Horde that sought to conquer all of Lordaeron. Gilneas survived but, in the years following the Second War, the kingdom drew ever inward. Distrustful of their former allies, the Gilneans erected a mighty wall at the borders of their land, closing off their nation - and their hearts - from an ever-darkening world. Now, many years later, as the seemingly unstoppable undead Scourge marches across Lordaeron, human civilization once again teeters on the edge of destruction. As war and terror close in all around them, the citizens of Gilneas are faced with one, terrible truth: their mighty wall cannot hold back the dead for much longer and, worse, rumors of a new threat have risen within the kingdom's borders of feral, nightmare creatures that walk upright as men but hunt and howl as wolves.\"\nHistory.\nThe &lt;a href=\"worgen%20curse\"&gt;worgen curse&lt;/a&gt; originated from a &lt;a href=\"druid\"&gt;druidic&lt;/a&gt; sect who followed &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;, known as Druids of the Scythe. They shapeshifted into the feral worgen and eventually lost their minds to its violent nature. The other druids agreed that they must be locked away, and thus put them into eternal slumber deep beneath a tree... until the day &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Velinde%20Starsong\"&gt;Velinde Starsong&lt;/a&gt; tampered with the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt;, releasing them. \nThe curse could not be contained, persisting in the lands of &lt;a href=\"Silverpine\"&gt;Silverpine&lt;/a&gt; and extending into the walled nation of &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, where the curse rapidly reached epidemic levels. The citizens of Gilneas found themselves trapped, with no hope of escape. They retreated deeper within the isolated domain, and there they survived, fearful of the savage presence that lurked just outside the barricades.\nTensions among the displaced citizens escalated over time, resulting in a civil war that now threatened to destabilize the embattled nation even more. There were those among the Gilneans, however, who clung to hope. Many believed that a cure for the worgen curse may exist, although others had nearly given up, fearful that if the barricades should fall, their humanity would be lost forever.\nAfter the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Greymane%20Wall\"&gt;Greymane Wall&lt;/a&gt; was destroyed. Setting their sights on the vulnerable country of Gilneas, the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have started an invasion of the kingdom. In their hour of greatest need, the worgen of Gilneas called out for their old allies' aid. As it was the &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; who created the curse in the first place, they felt obliged to help their newfound allies. The Gilneans are now back in the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, and with their new allies by their side they aren't giving up their home without a fight.\nCharacter.\nWhen starting a worgen character, the first 5-6 levels are played as a human, shortly after the &lt;a href=\"Northgate%20rebellion\"&gt;Northgate rebellion&lt;/a&gt;. You start off within Gilneas City as it is being evacuated, only for the worgen to attack before the evacuation can be finished. Following the initial few levels, in which players go about performing various important tasks such as reuniting the Gilnean people, your character is bitten and transformed into a worgen. After finishing the questline in Gilneas City, the player is moved to &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt;, prior to the Forsaken invasion of Gilneas.\nWorgen characters can appear in &lt;a href=\"Two%20Forms\"&gt;Two Forms&lt;/a&gt;, either their human form or their worgen form. However, they will immediately turn into their worgen form should they enter combat or activate their &lt;a href=\"Darkflight\"&gt;Darkflight&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Running%20Wild\"&gt;Running Wild&lt;/a&gt; racial abilities.\nWhen creating a worgen character, a human stands in the background displaying the worgen's human form.\nMounts.\nWorgen have &lt;a href=\"Running%20Wild\"&gt;Running Wild&lt;/a&gt;, in which they take to all fours and travel at mount speed. Running Wild is automatically learned at level 10, allowing worgen players to travel 60% faster, but they'll have to purchace Apprentice Riding skill to make it usable, and they'll also have to purchase &lt;a href=\"Journeyman\"&gt;Journeyman&lt;/a&gt; Riding skill at Level 20 to upgrade the ability to go 100% faster.\nRunning Wild is a different mechanic than the removed &lt;a href=\"tauren\"&gt;tauren&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Plainsrunning\"&gt;Plainsrunning&lt;/a&gt; ability. \nLore reasons for classes.\nDruid.\nThe worgen curse is a creation of kaldorei druids. As such, the night elves feel somewhat responsible for Gilneas's plight and help the worgen whenever they can. During their time together, the former have taught the latter the way of the druid.\nHowever, the presence of harvest-witches like &lt;a href=\"Celestine%20of%20the%20Harvest\"&gt;Celestine&lt;/a&gt; suggests that Gilneans are no strangers to druidism. She talks about \"the old ways\" and recounts a time when their powers supplied food during a famine, pointing to druidic roots as a base, even before night elf contact. This is agreed with in \"Lord of the Pack\" short story when &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; stated \"He had heard that druidism was practiced among some of Gilneas's agrarian folk, but he hadn't been exposed to it until recently\". It seems many worgen have at least tried to embrace the druidic heritage of their new race after their transformation. This can be seen as a coping mechanism, or the fact that the natural powers can help them keep control of their animalistic rage.\nThere is sufficient proof and reason to believe that the practices of primitive druidism or \"the old ways\" were once alive and well within or around Gilnean society before the sealing of the Wall. It is likely that the people of Gilneas would have once practiced or acknowledged (in varying degrees) the traditions and reverences of nature worship.\nIn time though (before the Greymane Wall was erected) the followers of the Holy Light must have spread their teachings to Gilneas and succeeded in converting many of its people, causing druidism to slowly fade into the past and become mostly forgotten.\nWhen starting a worgen druid, the quest text from Celestine of the Harvest does seem to support these assumptions. During Hallow's End, the faction commoners and Celestine of the Harvest also have quest text supporting these assumptions, connecting Gilneas, druidism, and the traditions of Hallow's End.\nThat said, the Night Elves have taken great interest in the worgen and are readily teaching them more about druidism, helping them to understand other areas of the path. It seems that this is the kaldorei's attempt at redemption in the eyes of their allies as they are partially responsible for the worgen curse reaching them... They feel they owe it to the worgen to explain and teach the magic that can lead to their salvation, druidism.\nDeath knights.\nWorgen death knights are former slaves of &lt;a href=\"Arugal\"&gt;Arugal&lt;/a&gt;. These former Gilnean citizens of Pyrewood Village managed to escape the wizard's control only to fall prey to the &lt;a href=\"Lich%20King\"&gt;Lich King&lt;/a&gt;. During the Death Knight starting quests, you learn how worgen death knights came to be.\nWhile the worgen curse makes raising them into &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undeath&lt;/a&gt; far more difficult than it is for normal humans, the powers of the Lich King himself are sufficient enough to raise worgen as death knights. Even though those worgen did not imbibe the waters of &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; to control the curse, the Lich King's power shattered their animal instincts, leaving the logical, human mind under his control. After the Lich King lost control over the &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Ebon%20Blade\"&gt;Knights of the Ebon Blade&lt;/a&gt;, their intact human minds became free again, without the animal side, while still retaining their worgen forms.\nGallery.\nOriginal models.\nThe original worgen models used in the Alpha and Beta of \"Cataclysm\"\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer /&gt;"}

{"id": "324051", "revid": "54797084", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=324051", "title": "Worgen curse", "text": "The worgen curse, also known as the curse of the worgen or simply the Curse, transforms people into ferocious creatures known as &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;. It can be transmitted to humans or night elves through the Scythe of Elune, the bite of a worgen, or drinking the blood of a worgen. The worgen curse has been referred to as an affliction, sickness, curse, gift, and a blessing, and is a topic of debate between worgen. There is no currently known full cure, though current treatments are available to regain sanity and control.\nWorgen shapeshifting is gradual, and muscle and bone can be heard growing and shifting as the worgen grows a third in height and girth, often tearing out of human-sized shirts. Unlike a druid form, the worgen curse persists through death, and worgen druids return to worgen form when slain. Cenarius says the worgen curse is beyond druidism.\nBackground.\nThe Wolf Cult had been secretly afflicting Gilneans with the worgen curse; bolstering the worgen population and using their numbers to build a feral worgen army that would be used to launch an attack on Gilneas City. The devastating attack weakened the nation's defenses and paved the way for the Forsaken invasion.\nThe worgen curse reached pandemic levels when it spread into the secluded human &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;, transforming almost all of its inhabitants into worgen. After the curse rippled through Gilneas, &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt; managed to concoct a partial treatment for it. Upon testing it on captured Gilnean &lt;a href=\"Mindless%20state\"&gt;mindless&lt;/a&gt; worgen, it allowed them to regain their sanity (giving them control of their minds), thus allowing them to retain the semblance of their past human selves. The night elves later offered a more effective treatment: Drinking from the wells of Tal'doren would allow them to transform back into their human-selves at will. There is, however, no full cure, and the animal within will never truly be at rest.\nEffects.\nTransmission.\nThe curse has so far only been passed to &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;, who may become a worgen by three possible means. The first were the &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, who took &lt;a href=\"pack%20form\"&gt;pack form&lt;/a&gt;, and allowed the Scythe of Elune to change them into worgen. Those bitten by these unruly beasts contract the virulent curse and will turn into worgen. Drinking the blood of a worgen will also turn the drinker into one. In theory, if two worgen were to mate and produce an offspring, that offspring would not be a worgen, though &lt;a href=\"Spiky%20Collar\"&gt;worgen offspring&lt;/a&gt; exist. \nSymptoms.\nReceiving the curse from the Scythe of Elune or by drinking worgen blood will cause an immediate transformation. Upon its creation, the bite changed its victim much faster than today's diluted version. Today, the bite can take a few hours or up to a few days to turn its victim. Speed of infection appears to vary on emotion, situation, and willpower. \nOver time, the wound will progress through three stages. First, it will appear as a minor &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D72870/worgen-bite\"&gt;Worgen Bite&lt;/a&gt;, then an &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D72872/infected-bite\"&gt;Infected Bite&lt;/a&gt; with side effects. Near the end, the bite will appear as a &lt;a href=\"https%3A//www.wowhead.com/spell%3D76642/hideous-bite-wound\"&gt;Hideous Bite Wound&lt;/a&gt;, with skin appearing black and blue around the wound, and thick hair growing around the edge of it.\nThe more one fights against the transformation, the more difficult it will be. On day one, the victim may feel peculiar, with scattered thoughts, a burning sensation from the bite wound, and severe migraines during moments of strong emotion. By day three, hours of pain may exact a heavy toll, with numbness to the core, crumbling intellect, dwindling willpower to resist, and an overall wild appearance, but still well enough to run in panic. Ultimately, once the curse has run its course, the transformation begins. In mere moments, the victim's form grows into that of a worgen, human-sized clothes often destroyed as a result. Some go mindless after turning, like &lt;a href=\"Sven%20Yorgen\"&gt;Sven&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;, while others retain some control, like &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn&lt;/a&gt;.\nBiology.\nIn worgen form, they are faster and stronger; with better eyesight and an animal instinct inside them that courses through their veins. With the aid of all four limbs, a worgen &lt;a href=\"Running%20Wild\"&gt;can sprint&lt;/a&gt; at speeds rivaling the swiftest &lt;a href=\"horse\"&gt;horse&lt;/a&gt;s, &lt;a href=\"nightsaber\"&gt;nightsaber&lt;/a&gt;s, and &lt;a href=\"mechanostrider\"&gt;mechanostrider&lt;/a&gt;s. With the curse comes also a resistance to other curses and diseases as well as immunity to the depravity of the Forsaken. The worgen curse makes raising them into undeath far more difficult than it is for normal humans. The worgen curse has roots in both the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; (through the wolf Ancient, &lt;a href=\"Goldrinn\"&gt;Goldrinn&lt;/a&gt;) and the &lt;a href=\"Moonlight\"&gt;holy power&lt;/a&gt; of the goddess &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, those worgen who imbibe the waters of &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 through the ritual they undergo to maintain the balance between the worgen curse and their humanity\u2014have a further resistance to the corruption of undeath.\nControl.\nSome worgen are able to shapeshift without treatments. Those of the Wolfcult in Northrend were able to use human and worgen form at will. Genn Greymane was bitten while hunting worgen, and was able to use human form to keep this a secret, and had not yet done the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Ritual of Balance&lt;/a&gt;. When driven to anger, Genn would begin to shift, and would require the help of Belysra Starbreeze to keep from shifting. Though difficult, he managed to keep his affliction a secret from his family, friends, and nation through the worgen attack and forsaken invasion, revealing it later on in Tal'doren and during a speech outside Gilneas. Members of the Wolf Cult in Gilneas used human form to recruit more cultists for Alpha Prime, and used worgen form for combat.\nMany worgen are in control without needing treatments, but may not be able to shapeshift, because they have not found balance. Alpha Prime became the first worgen, and maintained his sentience, cunning, and leadership, and orchestrated the worgen attack on Gilneas from the Greymane Court, but did not shapeshift. Halford Ramsey turned, and was able to use logic and debate philosophy. Darius Crowley had not yet done the Ritual of Balance and could debate strategy, but could not use human form because he held on to regret.\nSome are bitten while panicking and are at risk of the mindless state. Those of great rage, like &lt;a href=\"Mardigan\"&gt;Mardigan&lt;/a&gt;, will find their emotions amplified to the point of a ravenous beast. When &lt;a href=\"Admiral%20Ripsnarl\"&gt;James Harrington&lt;/a&gt; became afflicted by the worgen curse, he destroyed his loving family and maritime career in one chilling night of bloodlust, and later joined the &lt;a href=\"Defias%20Brotherhood\"&gt;Defias Brotherhood&lt;/a&gt;. Sven Yorgen saw his family had been brutally murdered by the Dark Riders and was bitten shortly after, losing himself to rage and hate, particularly against Jitters. In Gilneas, many &lt;a href=\"Panicked%20Citizen\"&gt;citizens&lt;/a&gt; were bitten while panicking, and became crazed &lt;a href=\"Afflicted%20Gilnean\"&gt;afflicted Gilneans&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href=\"Josiah%20Avery\"&gt;Josiah Avery&lt;/a&gt;, prone to attacking others.\nTreatments.\nAlchemy.\nAlchemy does not offer a cure, but can be helpful to treat the mind, if enough is left intact. &lt;a href=\"Archmage%20Karlain\"&gt;Archmage Karlain&lt;/a&gt; used a rage-suppressing potion he had already intended to administer to his son Mardigan to help calm his rage. While he had not finished it, the raw version better complimented the primal creature Mardigan became, and gave the boy some semblance of control unless driven to anger. &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt; collaborated to create a serum to help Genn keep his affliction controlled and secret. It was later used on bitten Gilneans as well, and included &lt;a href=\"moonleaf\"&gt;moonleaf&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Crate%20of%20Mandrake%20Essence\"&gt;mandrake essence&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Oliver%20Harris\"&gt;Oliver Harris&lt;/a&gt; used serums including reagents such as bear brains, &lt;a href=\"corpseweed\"&gt;corpseweed&lt;/a&gt;, and spider venom, and beheads worgen if the alchemy does not take.\nRitual of Balance.\nA night elf ceremony referred to as the &lt;a href=\"Ritual%20of%20Balance\"&gt;Ritual of Balance&lt;/a&gt; can be performed to bring harmony to many of the worgen. It does not purge the curse from their veins, but it tempers the fury in their hearts and eases their bloodlust. Genn led &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; through the same Ritual of Balance that he and other worgen had used to control their rage. The ritual is still fraught with danger. Now and then, there are those who do not survive it and are put down.\nScythe of Elune.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, the Scythe of Elune was used to turn four night elf worgen in Val'sharah back into night elves.\nPerspectives.\nAs a gift.\nUpon its creation during the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Satyr\"&gt;War of the Satyr&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Pack%20form\"&gt;Druids of the Pack&lt;/a&gt; prayed to &lt;a href=\"Elune\"&gt;Elune&lt;/a&gt; for help and became worgen. Seeing it as the ideal form, the followers of Ralaar Fangfire were eager to become worgen as well. They called themselves &lt;a href=\"Druids%20of%20the%20Scythe\"&gt;Druids of the Scythe&lt;/a&gt;, and many other night elves joined them over the course of seven days. They were banished by Malfurion, and upon their escape in Silverpine and Duskwood, began to recruit wiling and unwilling humans as worgen, forming a following called the &lt;a href=\"Wolf%20Cult\"&gt;Wolf Cult&lt;/a&gt;, following &lt;a href=\"Ralaar%20Fangfire\"&gt;Alpha Prime&lt;/a&gt;, with the &lt;a href=\"Purity%20of%20Essence\"&gt;Purity of Essence&lt;/a&gt; as their code, calling the curse a blessing. Another group named the &lt;a href=\"Wolfcult\"&gt;Wolfcult&lt;/a&gt; began in &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;, accept the worgen curse as a gift, convinced &lt;a href=\"Envoy%20Ducal\"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt; to join them, and wished to spread the curse to the alliance &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond kaldorei and humans, &lt;a href=\"Salsbury%20the%20%22Help%22\"&gt;one gnome&lt;/a&gt; wishes to become a worgen as well.\nAs a curse.\nShortly after their creation, Malfurion Stormrage first saw worgen as monstrosities and considered it a misuse of druidism. Ralaar attacked him, and he considered his former disciples as poisoned, misguided, flawed, and consumed by rage. After the worgen began biting and turning others into worgen against their will, he founded the Cenarion Circle to establish a tradition of druidism and banished the worgen to the Emerald Dream. &lt;a href=\"Naralex\"&gt;Naralex&lt;/a&gt; believed the worgen to be abominations and the most savage of evils that must be destroyed. &lt;a href=\"Vassandra%20Stormclaw\"&gt;Vassandra Stormclaw&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that the curse was considered a &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;heresy&lt;/a&gt; among their brethren.\nAs an alternative.\nRealizing that the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; will never stop hunting them until they become servants to the undead whether in life or death, the &lt;a href=\"Hillsbrad%20Refugee\"&gt;Hillsbrad Refugees&lt;/a&gt; decided to take the offer of blood by &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt;. Thus they became worgen, to have the power to have their vengeance, and also so that the &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; would not be able to raise them as Forsaken after their death.\nPrejudice.\nFolklore.\nWorgen were considered monsters even before their release. While originally called Druids of the Scythe, these lupine men were labeled as worgen upon their release, after monsters from rural human folklore. Before their release, worgen existed only in the timid whispers of the old, and the fanciful embellishments of the young. Arugal, too, had learned of mythical creatures called worgen. Old, rural folklore may hearken to these creatures, and it was common among farmer's children to hear tales of beastly wolf-men stalking the fields and marshes outside the village.\nBefore the Cataclysm.\nBefore the Cataclysm, little was known about worgen curse. In Duskwood, the Carevin family considered worgen to be monsters, and sent adventurers to keep their numbers down. The author of the &lt;a href=\"Singed%20Page%20%28Torment%20of%20the%20Worgen%29\"&gt;Torment of the Worgen&lt;/a&gt; knew he would be hunted and should run and hide. &lt;a href=\"Lieutenant%20Dumont\"&gt;Lieutenant Dumont&lt;/a&gt; reached out to the local humans of &lt;a href=\"Silverbrook\"&gt;Silverbrook&lt;/a&gt; for aid, but once he discovered they were worgen, called them blasted, &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt;-forsaken, and filth-ridden savages, and had them killed. Within Gilneas, &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Baron%20Ashbury\"&gt;Ashbury&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Marley\"&gt;Marley&lt;/a&gt;, and others despised worgen, and would go out into the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; every full moon, armed to the teeth, to hunt them for sport. Genn was bitten on one such hunt and, knowing the others would shoot him dead if they knew, kept it a secret. &lt;a href=\"Revil%20Kost\"&gt;Revil Kost&lt;/a&gt; claimed all creatures deserve to live, but held a vendetta against worgen, which he loathed with a passion and did not consider to be people, going so far as to call his captive an it.\nInvasion of Gilneas.\nDuring the fall of Gilneas, many Gilneans had strong feelings for or against worgen. As a human, &lt;a href=\"Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; called worgen motherless beasts, blasted mongrels, flea-ridden devils, and fleabags. Lord Godfrey witnessed &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra&lt;/a&gt; and the worgen &lt;a href=\"Halford%20Ramsey\"&gt;Halford Ramsey&lt;/a&gt; fight the worgen attacking Gilneas, and shot the latter regardless. When worgen were seen running wild, &lt;a href=\"Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Liam&lt;/a&gt; wished to catch and treat them, while Godfrey wished to hunt them. When Krennan began keeping worgen in cages to treat them, Godfrey openly opposed the idea, and later came to taunt the worgen captured. Upon finding Genn Greymane had been a worgen through the entire worgen and forsaken invasion, Godfrey kidnapped the king and sought to hand him over to the Forsaken. When his plans were foiled, Godfrey declared he would sooner die than have a worgen for a king, and jumped to his death.\nAfter the Cataclysm.\nAfter the Cataclysm, Gilneas rejoined the Alliance, but prejudice against worgen - Gilnean or otherwise - remains. When the Gilnean royals fled to Darnassus, their presence made many kaldorei uneasy. &lt;a href=\"Maiev%20Shadowsong\"&gt;Maiev Shadowsong&lt;/a&gt; and her student &lt;a href=\"Neva\"&gt;Neva&lt;/a&gt; visited the Gilnean worgen hunting camps to taunt and accuse them, and later killed worgen such as &lt;a href=\"Eadrik\"&gt;Eadrik&lt;/a&gt;. In Silverpine Forest, the Forsaken recovered and raised the body of Lord Godfrey, who believed Gilneas died the moment worgen were accepted, considered undeath a better fate than being a worgen, and eagerly used wolfsbane to kill Gilnean worgen. While Tobias Mistmantle searched Duskwood for his brother, he attempted to keep his true form hidden away from the people of Darkshire, who seem to react poorly to worgen. Calor and the Carevin family still consider the nearby worgen savage, evil, and an infestation. &lt;a href=\"Watch%20Commander%20Relthorn%20Netherwane\"&gt;Relthorn Netherwane&lt;/a&gt; expressed distaste for worgen among the Alliance.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Third%20invasion%20of%20the%20Burning%20Legion\"&gt;third invasion of the Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;, Revil Kost continues to hunt the worgen of Duskwood. During the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; produced pamphlets calling worgen mongrels, planning to put Genn Greymane on the throne of the Alliance to wipe out the Forsaken, then kill him and wipe out the worgen so there are only pure-blooded humans.\nIn the RPG.\nIn a small cabin in &lt;a href=\"Silverpine%20Forest\"&gt;Silverpine Forest&lt;/a&gt;'s southeast, lives &lt;a href=\"Halmish\"&gt;Halmish&lt;/a&gt;, an old man who states the forest is cursed. Not because of the &lt;a href=\"Plague%20of%20Undeath\"&gt;plague&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;, but by a curse that changes men into beasts. At night, when the &lt;a href=\"moon\"&gt;moon&lt;/a&gt; rises above the treetops and bathes the world in pale light, terrible howls erupt from &lt;a href=\"Shadowfang%20Keep\"&gt;Shadowfang Keep&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Pyrewood%20Village\"&gt;Pyrewood Village&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 as if the men and women within had transformed into wolves. Probably the curse old Halmish mentioned.\nA &lt;a href=\"Dalaran%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Dalaran&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt; named &lt;a href=\"Alphus%20Wordwill\"&gt;Alphus Wordwill&lt;/a&gt; is researching on what he calls the \"Worgen Curse\". Only one place in all of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; bears traces of this strange curse: the fortress of Shadowfang and the nearby Pyrewood Village. Alphus believes this curse is somehow tied to the moon. When the full moon rises, those afflicted by this curse undergo a transformation, turning into strange, man-wolf hybrid creatures. This transformation is mental as well as physical; the &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt;, like Alphus calls them, desire to hunt, slay, and eat. No matter their dispositions as &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s during the day, at night under the full moon these individuals are bloodthirsty monsters. He believes that a possible cure might solve the problem instead of just simply eliminating them. He hopes that the cure, instead of preventing their transformation, would preserve the afflicted individual's mindset after it. Such an effect would allow good-hearted worgen to take on fearsome physical abilities and use these against the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, and other evil powers. Given proper funding and support, he believes he can create such a cure.\nAlphus managed to get his funding and begun working on a cure for the Worgen Curse. He needed heroes to protect him and his servants as they moved through the forest gathering reagents and conducting tests. Later he sent these heroes to sneak into Pyrewood and drop the cure into the water supply, then they sneaked out and observed the changes over several days. This activity undoubtedly angered Shadowfang Keep's mysterious overseers. In addition to staying alive through all of this, Alphus sent the heroes to slay Shadowfang's evil lords to permanently stamp out the curse's evil."}

It takes place during the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Gilneas\"&gt;invasion of Gilneas&lt;/a&gt;.\nUpon the conclusion of &lt;a href=\"Endgame%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Endgame (quest)&lt;/a&gt;, players leave the instance and head to &lt;a href=\"Rut%27theran%20Village\"&gt;Rut'theran Village&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Kalimdor\"&gt;Northern Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, take a quick trip into &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt; and then start the &lt;a href=\"Darkshore%20storyline\"&gt;Darkshore storyline&lt;/a&gt;.\nGilneas City.\nIn Gilneas City players are thrust into the action as the city is being locked down. The &lt;a href=\"worgen\"&gt;worgen&lt;/a&gt; are invading the city and all citizens are being told to stay inside. When it becomes apparent that the Gilnean forces cannot stop the worgen, players help evacuate the citizens into the Military Quarter for safety in the quest &lt;a href=\"Evacuate%20the%20Merchant%20Square\"&gt;Evacuate the Merchant Square&lt;/a&gt;. In an effort to protect the city, &lt;a href=\"King%20Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;King Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; decides on a drastic course of action - he frees the rebel &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Darius%20Crowley\"&gt;Lord Darius Crowley&lt;/a&gt; from prison. Together, Greymane and Crowley try to defend the city but to no avail. Greymane begins an evacuation of the city as players join Crowley in Light's Dawn Cathedral to make a &lt;a href=\"Last%20Stand%20%28quest%29\"&gt;Last Stand (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuskhaven.\nSeveral months have passed since the evacuation of Gilneas City and a cutscene reveals that players were transformed into worgen by the curse. All of the Gilnean survivors regrouped in &lt;a href=\"Duskhaven\"&gt;Duskhaven&lt;/a&gt; where those who had been afflicted by the curse were treated by &lt;a href=\"Krennan%20Aranas\"&gt;Krennan Aranas&lt;/a&gt;. He developed a temporary treatment that allows those afflicted by the curse to control it, but only lasts as long as he has ingredients. Matters get complicated again in &lt;a href=\"Invasion\"&gt;Invasion&lt;/a&gt; as it is revealed that the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; have arrived in Gilneas with an invasion force. Together with &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Liam%20Greymane\"&gt;Prince Liam Greymane&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Lord%20Godfrey\"&gt;Lord Godfrey&lt;/a&gt;, players resist the invasion before a massive explosion sounds out.\nExodus from Duskhaven.\nIt turns out the massive explosion heard during the battle was the land of Gilneas collapsing. The Cataclysm weakened the earth and now it is collapsing into the sea. Mayor &lt;a href=\"Gwen%20Armstead\"&gt;Gwen Armstead&lt;/a&gt; immediately initiates an evacuation from Duskhaven before the entire town goes under and commissions players to help convince the more \"difficult\" citizens to leave. The evacuated citizens travel to Greymane Manor briefly, before moving onwards toward Stormglen.\nStormglen.\nOn the way to &lt;a href=\"Stormglen\"&gt;Stormglen&lt;/a&gt;, players work with Prince Liam Greymane to halt the Forsaken forces following them before arriving in the abandoned town, finding it overrun with spiders. In hopes of finding out what happened to Stormglen, &lt;a href=\"Lorna%20Crowley\"&gt;Lorna Crowley&lt;/a&gt;, daughter of Lord Darius Crowley, sends players into the &lt;a href=\"Blackwald\"&gt;Blackwald&lt;/a&gt; - a great marsh north of Stormglen. In the Blackwald players meet with &lt;a href=\"Belysra%20Starbreeze\"&gt;Belysra Starbreeze&lt;/a&gt;, a night elf from Darnassus and travel to &lt;a href=\"Tal%27doren\"&gt;Tal'doren&lt;/a&gt;, finding Lord Darius Crowley alive and transformed into a worgen himself. In Tal'doren, Belysra and the other Night Elves reveal the origin of the worgen curse - it was a Night Elven creation thousands of years earlier. Using a mystical artifact known as the &lt;a href=\"Scythe%20of%20Elune\"&gt;Scythe of Elune&lt;/a&gt; as well as the waters of the tree Tal'doren, the Night Elves enact a ritual that gives players permanent control of the worgen form, making it a blessing instead of a curse in &lt;a href=\"Neither%20Human%20Nor%20Beast\"&gt;Neither Human Nor Beast&lt;/a&gt;. As the ritual completes, King Genn Greymane arrives with Lorna Crowley and Lord Godfrey, who immediately demands Lord Darius Crowley surrender. With mounting tensions, King Greymane reveals a secret - he is also a worgen. Finding common ground, Lord Crowley and King Greymane agree to unite and take back Gilneas City.\nBattle for Gilneas City.\nAs the united Gilneans and worgen return to Gilneas City to seize it from the Forsaken that occupied it, Lord Godfrey betrays King Greymane in &lt;a href=\"Betrayal%20at%20Tempest%27s%20Reach\"&gt;Betrayal at Tempest's Reach&lt;/a&gt;, then jumps off a cliff after players rescue him. As the Gilneans prepare to assault the city, Lorna Crowley helps players liberate the small town of &lt;a href=\"Emberstone\"&gt;Emberstone&lt;/a&gt; from Forsaken control. Finally in the massive quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Battle%20for%20Gilneas%20City\"&gt;The Battle for Gilneas City&lt;/a&gt;, players join the fight to retake the city, moving from quarter to quarter and pushing back the Forsaken forces. Finally the armies come face to face with &lt;a href=\"Sylvanas%20Windrunner\"&gt;Sylvanas Windrunner&lt;/a&gt; herself and she shoots at King Greymane - only to have the shot blocked by Prince Liam Greymane. With Prince Liam Greymane dying, King Greymane promises vengeance before realizing that the Forsaken intend to use the Undead Plague to purge the city of life. Abandoning his third for vengeance, Greymane orders the Gilneans to abandon their city for the second time - traveling to the shore. Arriving at &lt;a href=\"Keel%20Harbor\"&gt;Keel Harbor&lt;/a&gt;, Night Elves from Darnassus have ships ready to take the Gilnean survivors to &lt;a href=\"Teldrassil\"&gt;Teldrassil&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the worgen are set up in a great tree known as the &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Oak\"&gt;Howling Oak&lt;/a&gt;. There, King Genn Greymane asks players to aid the Night Elves as thanks for saving them and sends them to &lt;a href=\"Darkshore\"&gt;Darkshore&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Breaking%20Waves%20of%20Change\"&gt;Breaking Waves of Change&lt;/a&gt;."}

They are also capable of bending the &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt;s to their will by the use of runes, similar to the ones that are etched into their own skin, and used these &lt;a href=\"Runed%20Giant\"&gt;Runed Giant&lt;/a&gt;s to wage war on the earthen and the giants of earth and stone.\nAfter being corrupted by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Gods\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, who took control of the titan facility of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, Keeper &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; churned out entire armies of iron dwarves through the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. Following Loken's death and Yogg-Saron's defeat, they have then re-entered the service of the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s as evidenced in &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; during the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt;. The Ulduar Keepers then allied with &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; to combat the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s.\nHistory.\nOrigin.\nThe iron dwarves are a people created by the mad &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;; he wanted an army to do his bidding and ask no questions.\nThousands of years ago, their capital, &lt;a href=\"Thor%20Modan\"&gt;Thor Modan&lt;/a&gt;, was destroyed by the &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt;s. The events surrounding the war are unknown, but the stone giants continue to bombard the city to this day to prevent its rebuilding; thus necessitating the iron dwarves to move to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Argol\"&gt;Dun Argol&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey took part in &lt;a href=\"First%20war%20between%20the%20earthen%20and%20the%20iron%20dwarves\"&gt;a great war against the earthen&lt;/a&gt; where &lt;a href=\"Val%27anyr%2C%20Hammer%20of%20Ancient%20Kings\"&gt;Val'anyr, Hammer of Ancient Kings&lt;/a&gt; was shattered.\nFor thousands of years the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; was unable to do more than keeping the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s quiet and complacent inside Ulduar. His grasp on them was tenuous, and convincing them to directly help the Old God had proven fruitless in the past. It was not until &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the Old God-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Ulduar and weakened Yogg-Saron's chains that the entity's influence on the Keepers increased, becoming strong as iron. Yogg-Saron commanded &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; to create a new army from the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. In Loken's hands, the forge churned out legions of iron dwarves and &lt;a href=\"Iron%20vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; who sought only bloodshed and war.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nAt the time of the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, the iron dwarves in &lt;a href=\"Howling%20Fjord\"&gt;Howling Fjord&lt;/a&gt; picked fights with both the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They attacked the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Ivald%27s%20Ruin\"&gt;Ivald's Ruin&lt;/a&gt; and took control of &lt;a href=\"Baelgun%27s%20Excavation%20Site\"&gt;Baelgun's Excavation Site&lt;/a&gt;, killing a lot of explorers who got stuck in the middle of the battle. During the infiltration of the Explorers' League, they received orders of &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;: They had to bury the fissures now in order to make silent and blind the &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Grizzly%20Hills\"&gt;Grizzly Hills&lt;/a&gt; rune-smiths subjugated the &lt;a href=\"Stone%20Behemoth\"&gt;Stone Behemoth&lt;/a&gt;s and set them on the path of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; to free their &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Father&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, the dwarves craftsmen constructed the war golem to stop the stone giants. However, the dwarves of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Argol\"&gt;Dun Argol&lt;/a&gt;, led by &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Thane%20Furyhammer\"&gt;Iron Thane Furyhammer&lt;/a&gt;, started a war with the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. They won the first fight against them thanks to their &lt;a href=\"iron%20golem\"&gt;iron golem&lt;/a&gt;s. However, they have been defeated when their creations turned against them. Moreover, &lt;a href=\"Thor%20Modan\"&gt;Thor Modan&lt;/a&gt; was besieged by the &lt;a href=\"stone%20giant\"&gt;stone giant&lt;/a&gt;s. Taking advantage of the siege, the Horde stole and killed many iron dwarves in the capital. Later, they fell under the attack of stone giants and &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; with the death of many iron dwarves and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Thane%20Argrum\"&gt;Iron Thane Argrum&lt;/a&gt;.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;, the iron dwarves took the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;, Loken created an even larger army from scratch, and expelled the earthen from Ulduar. A party of them was looking for &lt;a href=\"Norgannon%27s%20Core\"&gt;Norgannon's Core&lt;/a&gt;. They started by tracking &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; into the &lt;a href=\"frostborn\"&gt;frostborn&lt;/a&gt; territories, declaring war with them. Later, they assaulted &lt;a href=\"the%20Frigid%20Tomb\"&gt;the Frigid Tomb&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Foot%20Steppes\"&gt;Foot Steppes&lt;/a&gt; but were stopped by the frostborn. Finally, they killed the &lt;a href=\"keeper\"&gt;keeper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Creteus\"&gt;Creteus&lt;/a&gt;, but didn't obtain Norgannon's Core. Another party, led by &lt;a href=\"Valduran%20the%20Stormborn\"&gt;Valduran the Stormborn&lt;/a&gt;, was at war with the &lt;a href=\"Dolomite%20Giant\"&gt;Dolomite Giant&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Snowdrift%20Plains\"&gt;Snowdrift Plains&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, they used three forges to construct an &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Colossus\"&gt;Iron Colossus&lt;/a&gt;. A coalition of &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and earthen defeated them and killed Valduran. &lt;a href=\"Overseer%20Narvir\"&gt;Overseer Narvir&lt;/a&gt; stole &lt;a href=\"The%20Heart%20of%20the%20Storm\"&gt;The Heart of the Storm&lt;/a&gt; and gave life to the Iron Colossus. However, their creation has been defeated thank to &lt;a href=\"jormungar\"&gt;jormungar&lt;/a&gt;s' acid.\nThe iron dwarves were part of &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;'s \"primary defensive emplacements\". Moreover, they occupied the Antechambers of Ulduar in order to defend the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Council\"&gt;Iron Council&lt;/a&gt;. So, they defended Ulduar during the siege and helped &lt;a href=\"Razorscale\"&gt;Razorscale&lt;/a&gt; to fight the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Many of them have been defeated during the invasion of Ulduar and their delegate inside the Iron Council, &lt;a href=\"Stormcaller%20Brundir\"&gt;Stormcaller Brundir&lt;/a&gt;, has been defeated.\nDespite the defeat of both &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, there were still many iron troops throughout Northrend. Consequently, both &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; were looking for a way to \"fix\" them.\nLegion.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the iron dwarves have been integrated into Ulduar's defensive systems, serving the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s alongside the &lt;a href=\"iron%20vrykul\"&gt;iron vrykul&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s. When &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; attempted to unify the titan-forged, they were defending Ulduar against the demons. After the end of the siege, &lt;a href=\"Dvalen%20Ironrune\"&gt;Dvalen Ironrune&lt;/a&gt; joined the &lt;a href=\"Valarjar\"&gt;Valarjar&lt;/a&gt; alongside the &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Battlelord&lt;/a&gt;.\nExploring Azeroth: Northrend.\nDuring their travels through Northrend, the brothers &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; made note of the status of the iron dwarves. Thor Modan is still a ruin, the war with the stone giants and their earthen servants having continued on; even though the iron dwarves themselves have since joined with the titanic keepers and work with other factions of earthen. The defenses of Ulduar are noted to be still operational, watching over the defeated &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;. The facility is still under repair from the previous Legion attack.\nThe iron dwarves maintain some presence at the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Stone\"&gt;Halls of Stone&lt;/a&gt;, with one being questioned by the Bronzebeard brothers as to the journey of their ancestor, &lt;a href=\"Mina%20Stormsmith\"&gt;Mina Stormsmith&lt;/a&gt;. The nameless iron dwarf claimed to have been present when Mina Stormsmith arrived 500 years ago; recanting the tale to them of how &lt;a href=\"Sjonnir%20The%20Ironshaper\"&gt;Sjonnir The Ironshaper&lt;/a&gt; attempted to have her destroyed. She came here to ask them to have her deceased &lt;a href=\"Mithrios%20Stormsmith\"&gt;brother&lt;/a&gt; \"remade\", but they refused and tried to kill her, as she was of flesh and therefore weak in their eyes. She fought wave after wave of iron dwarves until her axe shattered, but a spirit arrived in a wave of blinding light to save her from death. She then took up her broken weapon and fought her way out of Ulduar.\nThe iron dwarves remain steadfast as well within the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, where a female iron dwarf has been appointed as the new overseer of the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Crucible\"&gt;Iron Crucible&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt;'s demise. She was noted by &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; to be far more informative and talkative than the hostile fire giant had been.\nAppearance.\nTheir iron skins are etched with runes\u2014and they use those runes to practice some powerful magic, including making rune golems."}

Judging by the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Horde\"&gt;Iron Horde&lt;/a&gt;'s use of them, they can apparently be re-purposed to serve as engines as well.\nThe foundation of all Iron Horde technology is a primitive, coal-fired centrifugal engine that can be used to turn wheels, belts, and chains, allowing for the construction of crude vehicles and siege weapons including tanks, cannons, and chariots. The &lt;a href=\"Kor%27kron%20Iron%20Star\"&gt;Kor'kron Iron Star&lt;/a&gt;, an early, unmounted version of this engine, was first unleashed by orcish siege engineers during the &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream%20%28tactics%29\"&gt;final battle&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar%20%28instance%29\"&gt;Siege of Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, and it is this technology that Garrosh smuggles into the past. The Kor'kron Iron Star was incorporated into the final encounter with Garrosh during the Siege of Orgrimmar specifically to foreshadow the Iron Horde.\nSomehow, the &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s figured out how to focus the power of a &lt;a href=\"Core%20of%20Flame\"&gt;Core of Flame&lt;/a&gt; containing the primal energies of Draenor, and the technology is used in the iron star engines that the Iron Horde is using extensively throughout . The &lt;a href=\"Core%20of%20Iron\"&gt;Core of Iron&lt;/a&gt; is the heart of the goblin \"Iron Star\" technology.\nDuring the meeting on the , launched an iron star against &lt;a href=\"Mannoroth\"&gt;Mannoroth&lt;/a&gt;.\nOne of the uses of the iron star that Iron Horde intended to unleash within &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; was to act as a weapon of mass destruction, capable of erupting a volcano.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href=\"Azerite%20Iron%20Star\"&gt;Azerite Iron Star&lt;/a&gt; was used by the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; to breach the walls of &lt;a href=\"Boralus\"&gt;Boralus&lt;/a&gt;.\nIron star-powered cannons can apparently also be used to transport troops, as evidenced by the fact that the &lt;a href=\"Ironmarch\"&gt;Ironmarch&lt;/a&gt; forces use them to shoot cages filled with orcs onto the &lt;a href=\"Shattershore\"&gt;Shattershore&lt;/a&gt;.

Their task was to safeguard the Keeper's holding alongside the chiseled &lt;a href=\"tol%27vir\"&gt;tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;. The vrykul revered their creators and worshiped them as gods. They were aware to at least some extent of the events which took place in that period, including &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;'s battle with the mighty &lt;a href=\"Galakrond\"&gt;Galakrond&lt;/a&gt;, and incorporated at least some of their exploits during that period into their legends and mythology.\nAfter the creation of the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt;, an army of vrykul was created by &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; in order to protect &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;.

Helya went on to create more Val'kyr from female vrykul to help her with her duty. Then Odyn and Helya created the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, and all vrykul received a call: those who proved their bravery by dying in a glorious battle, would live again in his hall in a storm-forged body. The &lt;a href=\"valarjar\"&gt;valarjar&lt;/a&gt; was created.\nThe vrykul considered &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt; as their ancestral land, probably living there before moving to &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. As time went by, vrykul began separating into several small clans, most of them recognizing a central king as their ruler. Though they were warlike creatures, most of the clans avoided direct confrontation. The &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; was an exception, believing that in order to reach the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt; they needed to develop a culture of violence and aggression.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Hyldnir\"&gt;Hyldnir&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"frost%20vrykul\"&gt;frost vrykul&lt;/a&gt; became at some point the loyal servants and helpers of keeper &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt;. Along with the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt; faction known as the &lt;a href=\"Sons%20of%20Hodir\"&gt;Sons of Hodir&lt;/a&gt;, they helped Thorim guard and protect &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;. However, this ended when Thorim's wife, a Hyldnir vrykul called &lt;a href=\"Sif\"&gt;Sif&lt;/a&gt;, was slain by &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, Thorim's brother. A war between the Hyldnir and the Sons of Hodir started after Thorim brutally attacked the ice giants that were framed for the death of Sif. Thorim exiled himself to &lt;a href=\"Temple%20of%20Storms\"&gt;Temple of Storms&lt;/a&gt; in grief, but the war between the Hyldnir and the Sons of Hodir continued for many millennia to come.\nThe sealing of the Halls of Valor.\nIn order to neutralize keeper &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt;, Loken helped Helya be free of Odyn's control. Helya resented Odyn deeply for forcing her to become a Val'kyr against her will. Helya then used her powers to seal off the Halls of Valor and the inhabitants within. Only a few Valarjar were outside of the Halls of Valor when Helya attacked. Though Odyn and his Valarjar could not leave the Halls, Odyn continued bringing the souls of worthy vrykul to increase the ranks of his Valarjar. Helya, meanwhile, went on to create a mist-shrouded home for herself and some Val'kyr that followed her, known as &lt;a href=\"Helheim\"&gt;Helheim&lt;/a&gt;. This realm would become the final destination for many vrykul spirits after death, as Helya started using her Val'kyr to wrest away the spirits of dead vrykul from the Val'kyr that had remained loyal to Odyn. Though trapped, Odyn and his Val'kyr were still powerful, so most of the spirits Helya ended up taking to Helheim were the ones of those deemed unworthy by Odyn's judgment.\nOver several millennia, Helya claimed as many souls of slain vrykul as she could, and her ranks of &lt;a href=\"Kvaldir\"&gt;Kvaldir&lt;/a&gt;--corrupted, undead vrykul--continued to swell. Helya tasked the kvaldir with dragging the souls of the unworthy and dishonorable vrykul to Helheim. After a while, Helya began to go after the souls of not just the heroic vrykul dead but also the living. Any vrykul who seemed poised to learn the truth about the conflict between Helya and Odyn became a target, and she had her Kvaldir slay them with ruthless efficiency. She started to raise her own champions, the &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; of Helheim, and she had them search Azeroth for her enemies. Helya sent them to kill vrykul in order to rob their unjudged souls, and either trap them in Helheim or convert them into kvaldir, thus robbing Odyn of his champions. Any spirits that ended up in Helya's care suffered greatly. Helheim was torment for vrykul heroes, who found themselves transformed into Kvaldir even if they had been worthy of entering the Halls of Valor as Valarjar. Many of these vrykul became more dangerous in death than they had been in life. Empowered by Helya and afraid of disappointing her, they zealously obeyed her commands.\nRecovering Stormheim.\nAfter the sealing of the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Halls of Valor&lt;/a&gt;, some vrykul came to believe that their path to a glorious afterlife with Odyn would be cleared if they once again held their ancestral home of &lt;a href=\"Stormheim\"&gt;Stormheim&lt;/a&gt;. Stormheim, on what would later be known as the &lt;a href=\"Broken%20Isles\"&gt;Broken Isles&lt;/a&gt;, was however occupied by &lt;a href=\"Highborne\"&gt;Highborne&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt;. The vrykul hero and king &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Magnar Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; led a massive attack on Stormheim, surprising the Highborne with their ferocity. For weeks the elves and vrykul skirmished, with Magnar leading the charge. The vrykul's assault scored immediate victories and gave them enough momentum to push the Highborne out of their city. The elves' last chance to reclaim Stormheim happened at the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Suramar%20Pass\"&gt;Battle of Suramar Pass&lt;/a&gt;, but in the end the vrykul stood victorious. The Highborne were forced to flee and never made a claim upon Stormheim again. The vrykul had to fight some traitors loyal to &lt;a href=\"Helya\"&gt;Helya&lt;/a&gt; and her &lt;a href=\"Helarjar\"&gt;Helarjar&lt;/a&gt; forces, which tried to wrestle Stormheim from the vrykul. Though Magnar and his sons were killed, the vrykul were able to prevent the Helarjar from claiming Stormheim.\nThe largest clan to settle in Stormheim was the &lt;a href=\"Tideskorn\"&gt;Tideskorn&lt;/a&gt;, while other groups included the &lt;a href=\"Bonespeakers\"&gt;Bonespeakers&lt;/a&gt;, mystics that tended to the graves of Vrykul heroes. The Stormheim vrykul, being cut off from their Northrend kin, elected a new king to lead them. Magnar and the many different kings that followed were buried either in the &lt;a href=\"Tomb%20of%20the%20Old%20Kings\"&gt;Tomb of the Old Kings&lt;/a&gt; or in the &lt;a href=\"Field%20of%20Fallen%20Kings\"&gt;Field of Fallen Kings&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Val%27kyr\"&gt;Val'kyr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Eyir\"&gt;Eyir&lt;/a&gt; created a new group of female vrykul in Stormheim, the &lt;a href=\"Valkyra\"&gt;Valkyra&lt;/a&gt;, who aspire to become Val'kyr and serve under Odyn in the Halls of Valor.\nThe Winterskorn War.\nAfter the titan-forged were exiled from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt; by the betrayer &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"fire%20giant\"&gt;fire giant&lt;/a&gt;s &lt;a href=\"Ignis\"&gt;Ignis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt; took control of the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20clan\"&gt;Winterskorn clan&lt;/a&gt; and fortified their metal hides with enchanted armor in a desire to conquer the &lt;a href=\"Storm%20Peaks\"&gt;Storm Peaks&lt;/a&gt;. However, the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt; began to spread among the vrykul, changing their metal skin into the flesh. In order to bridge this weakness, &lt;a href=\"Ignis\"&gt;Ignis&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt; constructed an army of molten giants to help the vrykul in the war. The massive army attacked the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;s, starting the &lt;a href=\"Winterskorn%20War\"&gt;Winterskorn War&lt;/a&gt;. It was only thanks to the help of &lt;a href=\"Tyr\"&gt;Tyr&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Archaedas\"&gt;Archaedas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Ironaya\"&gt;Ironaya&lt;/a&gt; that the earthen drove them back. Tyr, alongside his companion Archaedas, forged a shield named &lt;a href=\"Truthguard\"&gt;Truthguard&lt;/a&gt; and gave it to a vrykul champion named &lt;a href=\"Yrgrim%20the%20Truthseeker\"&gt;Yrgrim the Truthseeker&lt;/a&gt; to help expose Loken's treachery. This allowed them to convert many vrykul to their cause.\nIgnis and Volkhan didn't abandon the war, however; they enslaved the &lt;a href=\"proto-dragon\"&gt;proto-dragon&lt;/a&gt;s to help the vrykul in the war, and renewed their attack. After losing more and more ground to the Winterskorn army, Tyr decided they needed more help. He was able to convince the &lt;a href=\"Dragon%20Aspects\"&gt;Dragon Aspects&lt;/a&gt; to help them put an end to the war. Thanks to the combined powers of &lt;a href=\"Ysera\"&gt;Ysera&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Nozdormu\"&gt;Nozdormu&lt;/a&gt;, the Winterskorn vrykul were trapped in a mist and fell into a deep sleep for several millennia. They were locked away in tomb cities across what would later become &lt;a href=\"Northrend\"&gt;Northrend&lt;/a&gt;. However, the curse of flesh continued to warp the sleeping vrykul and when they woke, thousands of years later, they were nothing more than beings of flesh and blood.\nAfter the war, Tyr and his companions stole the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from Loken, and rounded up titan-forged that would follow them away from &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;, in order to analyze the data and plan a way to stop Loken. Among these people were some vrykul that decided to follow Tyr. After the group had traveled a long way south and were in the area currently known as &lt;a href=\"Tirisfal%20Glades\"&gt;Tirisfal Glades&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi monsters sent by Loken caught up with them. Tyr fought them and sacrificed his life to stop them. His companions and the rest of the group continued their journey further south, but the vrykul were so moved with Tyr's sacrifice that they decided to stay behind and guard his &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;tomb&lt;/a&gt; forever. They named the area Tirisfal, which in their language meant \"Tyr's Fall\". Some of these vrykul formed a secretive group, &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Guard\"&gt;Tyr's Guard&lt;/a&gt;, to protect the tomb forever.\nWrath of the Lich King.\nFor thousands of years, the imprisoned &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt; was unable to do more than keeping the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s quiet and complacent inside Ulduar. His grasp on them was tenuous, and convincing them to directly help the Old God had proven fruitless in the past. It was not until &lt;a href=\"Cho%27gall\"&gt;Cho'gall&lt;/a&gt; of the Old God-worshiping &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer%20clan\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer clan&lt;/a&gt; infiltrated Ulduar and weakened Yogg-Saron's chains that the entity's influence on the Keepers increased, becoming strong as iron. Yogg-Saron commanded &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; to create a new army from the &lt;a href=\"Forge%20of%20Wills\"&gt;Forge of Wills&lt;/a&gt;. In Loken's hands, the forge churned out legions of &lt;a href=\"Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and iron vrykul who sought only bloodshed and war.\nThese corrupted iron dwarves, &lt;a href=\"iron%20giant\"&gt;iron giant&lt;/a&gt;s and iron vrykul formed Loken's &lt;a href=\"iron%20army\"&gt;army of iron&lt;/a&gt;. The creator of these new iron vrykul is the fire giant named &lt;a href=\"Volkhan\"&gt;Volkhan&lt;/a&gt;, who can be seen forging new additions to the iron vrykul army in the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Crucible\"&gt;Iron Crucible&lt;/a&gt; inside the &lt;a href=\"Halls%20of%20Lightning\"&gt;Halls of Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. At the time, &lt;a href=\"Sjonnir%20The%20Ironshaper\"&gt;Sjonnir The Ironshaper&lt;/a&gt; was Loken's right-hand iron vrykul in Ulduar; he was in charge of the Forge of Wills, and by all accounts eager to use it to make more iron creations for his master, until he was killed by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s. Iron vrykul were also stored below the Forge of Wills.\nDespite the defeat of both &lt;a href=\"Loken\"&gt;Loken&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Yogg-Saron\"&gt;Yogg-Saron&lt;/a&gt;, there were still many iron troops throughout Northrend. Consequently, both &lt;a href=\"Thorim\"&gt;Thorim&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Mimiron\"&gt;Mimiron&lt;/a&gt; were looking for a way to \"fix\" them.\nLegion.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"third%20invasion\"&gt;third invasion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the iron vrykul have been integrated into &lt;a href=\"Ulduar\"&gt;Ulduar&lt;/a&gt;'s defensive systems, serving the &lt;a href=\"Keeper\"&gt;Keeper&lt;/a&gt;s alongside the &lt;a href=\"Iron%20Dwarf\"&gt;iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"frost%20giant\"&gt;frost giant&lt;/a&gt;s and the &lt;a href=\"mechagnome\"&gt;mechagnome&lt;/a&gt;s. When &lt;a href=\"Odyn\"&gt;Odyn&lt;/a&gt; attempted to unify the titan-forged, they were defending Ulduar against the demons."}

Ironaya and her allies would later steal the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; from Ulduar and flee south.\nLoken sent two &lt;a href=\"C%27Thrax\"&gt;C'Thrax&lt;/a&gt;xi after the group, and Tyr held them off, giving his life in the process. The vrykul stayed behind to honor him. After burying Tyr, Ironaya and the others traveled south to &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; and hid the Discs of Norgannon there. The earthen, fearing the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;, asked to be put into hibernation until the day would come that a cure could be found. The mechagnomes, even knowing they were also cursed, volunteered to stay awake and keep watch over the earthen. Ironaya and Archaedas also entered hibernation within Uldaman's vaults.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThousands of years later, Ironaya awakened when intruders delved into Uldaman and fought them off. She was defeated.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Mathias%20Shaw\"&gt;Mathias Shaw&lt;/a&gt; reported that he knows of a rumor about Uldaman's &lt;a href=\"Chamber%20of%20Khaz%27mul\"&gt;Chamber of Khaz'mul&lt;/a&gt; which is opened by the &lt;a href=\"Staff%20of%20Prehistoria\"&gt;Staff of Prehistoria&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Map%20Chamber\"&gt;Map Chamber&lt;/a&gt;. According to a story, adventurers that would get the staff and enter the chamber would fight off Ironaya.

The &lt;a href=\"Pantheon\"&gt;Pantheon&lt;/a&gt; entrusted the watcher Ironaya with overseeing the construction and maintenance of Uldaman, but as time passed, the once awe-inspiring vault fell to ruin. Within the map chamber, Ironaya has spent millennia in a form of stasis, analyzing the original master plan drawn up by &lt;a href=\"Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; and attempting to find a way to restore the complex to its original functionality.\"\nSpeculation.\nShe probably was the one who placed the seals that prevented &lt;a href=\"Zakajz%20the%20Corruptor\"&gt;Zakajz the Corruptor&lt;/a&gt; from coming back to life before &lt;a href=\"Thoradin\"&gt;Thoradin&lt;/a&gt;'s arrival at &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Fall\"&gt;Tyr's Fall&lt;/a&gt; (see &lt;a href=\"The%20Sword%20of%20Kings\"&gt;The Sword of Kings&lt;/a&gt;)."}

{"id": "75453", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=75453", "title": "Irondeep Mine", "text": "Irondeep Mine is a &lt;a href=\"mine\"&gt;mine&lt;/a&gt; found in the northern area of &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20Valley\"&gt;Alterac Valley&lt;/a&gt;, north of &lt;a href=\"Stonehearth%20Graveyard\"&gt;Stonehearth Graveyard&lt;/a&gt;. In theory, due to its proximity to &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Baldar\"&gt;Dun Baldar&lt;/a&gt;, it should be captured by the Alliance more often than the Horde. However, in many battles the mine is ignored at the start; and only captured once the Horde have taken it or when the Alliance is pushed onto the defensive.\nAt the beginning of the battle, the mine is owned by &lt;a href=\"Irondeep\"&gt;Irondeep&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"trogg\"&gt;trogg&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Morloch\"&gt;Morloch&lt;/a&gt;. Irondeep Mine, like its counterpart &lt;a href=\"Coldtooth%20Mine\"&gt;Coldtooth Mine&lt;/a&gt;, produces supplies for ground assaults (to be transported by a player) and 1 reinforcement to the fraction owning the mine.\nMobs.\nTo gain control of the mine, the boss of the faction in the mine must be killed by a hostile player (who must do the killing blow). The mobs in the mine differ depending on the ownership of the mine:\nWhen you have killed the leader, a message will be announced in the chat across the battlegrounds and your faction's NPC will begin spawning and fighting any remaining mobs of the previous faction. If the battle lasts more than 30 minutes, the neutral NPC boss and his followers (&lt;a href=\"Morloch\"&gt;Morloch&lt;/a&gt;) will respawn to attempt to recapture the mine again.\n\"Note: Although your NPC will spawn and begin fighting any remaining mobs, they are weak and can therefore sometimes be killed by the previous faction mob. Also, to much annoyance, the area around the spawning points of &lt;a href=\"Irondeep%20Supplies\"&gt;Irondeep Supplies&lt;/a&gt; may not spawn any friendly NPCs so players may still have to kill enemy mobs dotted around the mine.\"\nGround Assault Supplies.\nOnce the mine is under a faction's control, it will produce supplies for players of that faction to carry back to their base to gather a ground assault. The amount needed depends on the faction:\nSupplies are handed in in batches of 10, a player can not carry more than 10 supplies at a time. These supplies are then handed back to the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Stormpike Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Quartermaster\"&gt;Frostwolf Quartermaster&lt;/a&gt; back at base. Having a &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Insignia%20Rank%206\"&gt;Stormpike Insignia Rank 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"Frostwolf%20Insignia%20Rank%206\"&gt;Frostwolf Insignia Rank 6&lt;/a&gt; is very helpful for returning the supplies back to base."}

While he kept its twin, &lt;a href=\"Ironfel\"&gt;Ironfel&lt;/a&gt;, for himself, he bestowed Ironfoe to &lt;a href=\"Reginald%20Windsor\"&gt;Marshal Windsor&lt;/a&gt;'s great, great grandfather, which was then passed down each generation to him. Its twin Ironfel was given to &lt;a href=\"Fineous%20Darkvire\"&gt;Fineous Darkvire&lt;/a&gt;, who succeeded Forgewright after his death as the new Dark Iron Chief Architect.\nIronfoe was taken from Marshal Windsor when he was captured by Dark Iron dwarves and held in &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Depths\"&gt;Blackrock Depths&lt;/a&gt;. It was used by &lt;a href=\"Emperor%20Dagran%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Emperor Dagran Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; himself, until the Emperor's death. \nBattle for Azeroth.\nIronfoe was wielded by &lt;a href=\"Thaelin%20Darkanvil\"&gt;Thaelin Darkanvil&lt;/a&gt; and used to shape &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"Black%20Anvil\"&gt;Black Anvil&lt;/a&gt;. It was taken by the &lt;a href=\"Venture%20Company\"&gt;Venture Company&lt;/a&gt; during an attack on &lt;a href=\"Shadowforge%20City\"&gt;Shadowforge City&lt;/a&gt;, and delivered to &lt;a href=\"Mogul%20Razdunk\"&gt;Mogul Razdunk&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Kezan\"&gt;Kezan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; dispatched an Alliance hero to reclaim Ironfoe from Razdunk in the &lt;a href=\"MOTHERLODE%21%21\"&gt;MOTHERLODE!!&lt;/a&gt;, and it was returned to Thaelin who once again used it to smelt Azerite, and acts as its keeper.\nIn the RPG.\nThe hammer is named after the legendary dwarven smith &lt;a href=\"Kaltor%20Ironfoe\"&gt;Kaltor Ironfoe&lt;/a&gt;, who forged battleaxes which also bear his name. Three are known to exist, two of which are in dwarven hands. The third is believed to be lost somewhere in &lt;a href=\"Felwood\"&gt;Felwood&lt;/a&gt;, and may be in the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;'s control. An ironfoe is crafted from a single, massive block of &lt;a href=\"dark%20iron\"&gt;dark iron&lt;/a&gt;, sculpted into a perfectly symmetrical shape. Dwarven runes are carved in relief on its surface, suggesting (correctly) that this is a weapon of great power. An ironfoe is a dark iron battleaxe of instinct that feels perfectly comfortable in its wielder's hand, despite its obvious heft and weight."}

It is the ancestral home of the Bronzebeard dwarves, and one of the oldest cities of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; rules the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; from the throne room within the city. The &lt;a href=\"Great%20Forge\"&gt;Great Forge&lt;/a&gt; area gave the city its name.\nCarved into the stone heart of Khaz Modan, the mighty city of Ironforge is a testament to the dwarves' strength and resilience. The city is perhaps the most intricate of the Alliance cities, boasting many small passageways, shops built into the rock walls, and cavernous rooms. The feel of the city is a bustling, rowdy, and somewhat industrial one, where there are always a thousand things happening at any time of the day or night. However, it is predominantly safe-feeling and cozy; fires roar in the hearths of the inns and shops, and much dwarven laughing and frivolity is to be heard. Also, unlike &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Darnassus\"&gt;Darnassus&lt;/a&gt;, the city is actually a massive cavern carved into the earth by the dwarves; the ceiling and floor are both hard stone.\nMainly because of the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt;, linking Ironforge and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, and the district of Tinker Town, Ironforge is one of the most racially diverse cities in the Alliance world. Dwarves predominate, of course, but you will find plenty of gnomes even outside of Tinker Town, and probably as many humans. You will find almost no &lt;a href=\"Night%20elf\"&gt;night elves&lt;/a&gt; however, as they probably prefer more natural and open-spaced environments. With the Council of Three Hammers uniting all three dwarven clans, Ironforge has recently welcomed &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt; into Ironforge as well.\nThe collective frivolity of the place, the bustling and gruff manner of the dwarves, and the proximity to many quest and raid areas have historically made Ironforge, along with &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, a popular place to idle.\nHistory.\nA marvel to the dwarves' skill at shaping rock and stone, Ironforge was constructed in the very heart of the mountains that were nestled in the wintry peaks of &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt;. The dwarven capital is an expansive underground city that houses many dwarven explorers, miners, and warriors. Massive doors of rock protect the city in times of war, and lava from the mountain itself is redirected and distributed for heat, energy and smithing purposes.\nWaterfalls of magma and bountiful supplies of metallic ores allowed the denizens of Ironforge to become masters of smithing and weaponry.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nIronforge would become the ancient home of the dwarves, whose people lived in peace for many long centuries within the mountain. However, their society grew too large and could no longer be maintained within the confines of their mountain cities. While the mighty High King, &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, ruled over all dwarves with justice and wisdom, three powerful factions had arisen amongst the dwarven society. The &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by Thane &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, held close ties to the High King and stood as the traditional defenders of Ironforge Mountain. The &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by Thane &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, inhabited the foothills and crags around the base of the mountain and sought to gain more control within the city. The third faction, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;, ruled by the &lt;a href=\"Sorcerer-Thane%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Sorcerer-Thane Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, hid within the deepest shadows under the mountain and plotted against both their Bronzebeard and the Wildhammer cousins.\nWhile the three clans were able to live in a tenuous peace, the death of High King Anvilmar (from old age) plunged the three clans into war with the prize being Ironforge itself. After many years of fighting the Bronzebeards, who had the largest standing army, emerged victorious and banished the Dark Irons and Wildhammers from under the mountain. Even as the Wildhammers founded their own kingdom of &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, the Dark Iron plotted in secret from the newly created home within the Redridge Mountains.\nSeeking to claim all of Khaz Modan for their own the Dark Irons under Thaurissan and his sorceress wife, &lt;a href=\"Modgud\"&gt;Modgud&lt;/a&gt;, launched a two-pronged assault against both Ironforge and Grim Batol. The Dark Irons had nearly taken control of both kingdoms when Madoran and Khardros were able to snatch victory and push the Dark Irons back. While Thaurissan survived and fled with his forces, his wife Modgud was killed by Khardros.\nWith common cause between them, Ironforge and Grim Batol marched south with the intention of destroying the Dark Irons once and for all. In turn Thaurissan seeking a powerful minion that would ensure his victory accidentally called forth &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros%20the%20Firelord\"&gt;Ragnaros the Firelord&lt;/a&gt;, whose rebirth ultimately saw Thaurissan killed and the Dark Irons enslaves to the summoned elemental. The combined Bronzebeard and Wildhammer armies halted their advance and turned back towards kingdoms being unwilling to face the Ragnaros's wrath. Upon learning that Modgud's death had left an evil stain upon Grim Batol King Bronzebeard offered to let the Wildhammers live within the borders of Ironforge, but the Wildhammers refused and would find &lt;a href=\"Aerie%20Peak\"&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; within &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt;.\nDesiring to retain relations and trade with their cousins, the dwarves of Ironforge constructed two massive arches, the &lt;a href=\"Thandol%20Span\"&gt;Thandol Span&lt;/a&gt;, to bridge the gap between Khaz Modan and Lordaeron. Bolstered by mutual trade, the two kingdoms prospered. After the deaths of Madoran and Khardros, their sons jointly commissioned two great statues in honor of their fathers. The two statues would stand guard over the pass into the southlands, which had become volcanic in the wake of Ragnaros' scorching presence. They served as both a warning to all who would attack the dwarven kingdoms, and as a reminder of what price the Dark Irons paid for their crimes.\nThe two kingdoms retained close ties for some years, but the Wildhammers were much changed by the horrors they witnessed at Grim Batol. They took to living above ground on the slopes of Aerie Peak, instead of carving a vast kingdom within the mountain. The ideological differences between the two remaining dwarven clans eventually led to their parting of ways.\nThe Second War and aftermath.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; Ironforge had received missives from &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; warning them of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' arrrival. Khaz Modan would soon after come under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which would cause the destruction of many dwarven strongholds. While the rest of the Horde moved north &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; remained within the region, which saw the orcs and dwarves clash for many months. Even with the loss of all of their other strongholds, &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge remained standing&lt;/a&gt;, despite Kilrogg's best efforts. Each time a dwarven citadel fell, the survivors fled to Ironforge, and by the end of the conflict the whole of the dwarf nation lurked within the city, awaiting a chance for revenge. The Bleeding Hollow would eventually be defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and with Ironforge freed, the inhabitants joined the Alliance. Following the Alliance victory at the Dark Portal, &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; would appoint his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Muradin\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; as ambassador to Lordaeron.\nIn the years following the Horde's defeat, the leaders of the various Alliance nations began to bicker and argue over territorial holdings and decreasing political influence. King Terenas of Lordaeron, the patron of the Alliance, began to suspect that the fragile pact they had forged during their darkest hour would not stand for long. Terenas had convinced the Alliance leaders to lend money and laborers to help rebuild the city of Stormwind that was destroyed during the orcish occupation of Azeroth. Those taxes, coupled with the high expense of maintaining and operating the numerous orc internment camps, led many leaders - &lt;a href=\"Genn%20Greymane\"&gt;Genn Greymane&lt;/a&gt; of Gilneas in particular - to believe that their kingdoms would be better off seceding from the Alliance.\nTo make matters worse, the brusque &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Silvermoon\"&gt;Silvermoon&lt;/a&gt; rescinded their allegiance to the Alliance, stating that the humans' poor leadership led to the burning of their forests during the Second War. Though Terenas tactfully reminded the elves that nothing of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; would have remained if not for the hundreds of valiant humans who'd given their lives to defend it, the elves stubbornly decided to go their own way. In the wake of the elves' departure, &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; pulled stake and seceded as well.\nThough the Alliance was falling apart, King Terenas still had allies that he could count on. Both Admiral Proudmoore of Kul Tiras and the young King Varian Wrynn of Azeroth remained committed to the Alliance. Also, the wizards of the Kirin Tor, led by the Archmage Antonidas, pledged Dalaran's steadfast support to Terenas' rule. Most pleasingly, perhaps, was the pledge of the mighty Dwarven King Magni Bronzebeard, who vowed that the Dwarves of Ironforge would forever owe a debt of honor to the Alliance for liberating Khaz Modan from the Horde's control.\nThe Third War.\nThe dwarves of Ironforge battled the &lt;a href=\"Undead%20Scourge\"&gt;Undead Scourge&lt;/a&gt; and sent units to aid the rest of the Lordaeron against the undead threat. Even after the fall of Lordaeron Ironforge remained steadfast in its commitments and aided their allies throughout the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;. During the war Magni learned that Muradin had died and that &lt;a href=\"Arthas\"&gt;Arthas&lt;/a&gt; himself was responsible. Magni was overcome with grief at the news of Muradin's demise, but he and the youngest brother, &lt;a href=\"Brann%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Brann&lt;/a&gt;, remained steadfast in their desire to continue serving the dwarven people.\nSome time after &lt;a href=\"High%20Inquisitor%20Fairbanks\"&gt;High Inquisitor Fairbanks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alexandros%20Mograine\"&gt;Alexandros Mograine&lt;/a&gt; visited King Magni. To avenge Muradin, Magni forged the &lt;a href=\"Ashbringer\"&gt;Ashbringer&lt;/a&gt; to oppose &lt;a href=\"Frostmourne\"&gt;Frostmourne&lt;/a&gt;, Arthas, and the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt;. While Magni never took much stock in the belief that Master dwarven &lt;a href=\"blacksmith\"&gt;blacksmith&lt;/a&gt;s could impart emotions into the weapons they create, standing before &lt;a href=\"The%20Great%20Anvil\"&gt;The Great Anvil&lt;/a&gt;, he found himself thinking of how he would not see Muradin again. He thus harnessed all of his rage, fury, the desire for vengeance, and willed them into being with each strike of his hammer. When he was finished, he gave Mograine the finest blade that had ever been crafted by his hand. This would confirm that he is, at the very least, a skilled weaponsmith of the highest degree.\nFor at least part of the Third War, Magni fought alongside &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and declared him to be a friend of Ironforge.\nWhen the gnome refugees of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; settled in Ironforge, some dwarves like &lt;a href=\"Skuerto\"&gt;Skuerto&lt;/a&gt; were booted out of the city to make way for them.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nIronforge is the capital of the dwarves and is led by King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. The city is perhaps the oldest city to ever been build, having survived the coming of the Horde and the scourge invasion. The city proudly sits on a mountain, never to been taken by its enemy. Filled with discoveries and wonders any adventurer would want to visit. &lt;a href=\"%3AOld%20Ironjaw\"&gt;:Old Ironjaw&lt;/a&gt; gives a great reputation to the city.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"invasion%20of%20Outland\"&gt;invasion of Outland&lt;/a&gt;, the gates of Ironforge were invaded by a group of &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;s led by &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Kruul\"&gt;Highlord Kruul&lt;/a&gt;.\nPearl of Pandaria.\n&lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Strongbo\"&gt;Strongbo&lt;/a&gt; journeyed to Ironforge, where he sensed that the earth elementals in the area were in pain. Even after being informed of the dwarven origins Strongbo maintained that the earth was in distress and that he could feel the pressure building, though Li Li pointed out that it didn't mean the dwarves were responsible. \nThe two pandaren ended up attending &lt;a href=\"Brewfest\"&gt;Brewfest&lt;/a&gt; and after fighting back the Dark Iron dwarves met with King Magni, who revealed that &lt;a href=\"Chen\"&gt;Chen&lt;/a&gt; that helped him during the Third War. The King further stated that any friend of Chen's was a friend of Khaz Modan and upon Li Li's request, Magni provided the pandaren with a zeppelin and two ram mounts.\nStormrage.\nAs whole Azeroth fell into the mists of Emerald Nightmare, so did Ironforge, as observed by &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt;.\nElemental Unrest.\nIronforge was attacked by raging elementals, but the attack was successfully repelled by dwarven leaders and Alliance heroes.\nThe Shattering: Prelude to Cataclysm.\nFollowing the civil unrest amongst the Dwarves, the Bronzebeard clan emerged victorious. For the following years after the war King Magni Bronzebeard could be found in the High Seat, as the Dwarven leader of Ironforge. However, in recent times King Magni Bronzebeard had fallen ill to a Titanic curse. This left Ironforge in a state of unrest, but soon the participants of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; returned to Ironforge, to establish the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, with representatives from each of the clans, consisting of &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they have set aside their differences in order to rule the Dwarven city of Ironforge.\nFire and Iron.\nAfter returning from Outland to Azeroth around the time of the Shattering, &lt;a href=\"Kurdran\"&gt;Kurdran&lt;/a&gt; returned to Aerie Peak and learned about the situation in Ironforge. He told Falstad, who was chosen by King Wrynn, that he will represent the Wildhammer clan in the Council of Three Hammers, an act not fair to Falstad as he has been leading the dwarves for centuries. Kurdran then traveled to Ironforge to represent the Wildhammer clan in the Council of Three Hammers. Tensions were running high between the Wildhammer clan and the other two clans in Ironforge as they were resentful of the Wildhammer's nonconformist tendencies as well as fearful of the false rumors circulating that said the Wildhammers were using barbaric brutal tactics on their enemies as well as their allies who didn't comply with their demands. Eventually, the tensions led to a fight between a Wildhammer and a Bronzebeard that ended in somebody's death. \nThe Bronzebeard clan and the Dark Iron clan had proposed to reforge the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20the%20High%20King\"&gt;Hammer of the High King&lt;/a&gt; as an act of unity between the three clans and to ease the rising tensions in Ironforge but in order to do so, they required the scepter that belonged in Kurdran's possession. Though Kurdran was reluctant to part with the scepter for sentimental reasons and saw the reforging of the hammer as a waste of time, he nonetheless handed over the scepter so that the Wildhammer would be better received in Ironforge. Still, Kurdran had trouble adjusting to Ironforge as he missed the open skies of the Hinterlands and was not fond of the politicking required of his position. His troubles were compounded when tensions again rose as a fight broke out between Kurdran and his Wildhammer dwarves and some Dark Iron dwarves, which consequently led to a fire that killed his gryphon &lt;a href=\"Sky%27ree\"&gt;Sky'ree&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe hammer would later be reforged as an act of unity between the three dwarven clans, under a decree of the Council of Three Hammers. It was decided that a dark iron smith should reforge the hammer. A few days before the reforging, the council discovered that the pieces of the hammer might've been fakes. Yet the majority of the council agreed to continue with the reforging without the public knowing about it being a fake. Kurdran however, disagreed with the lie. Later that night, Kurdran would come to where the pieces were stored, and removed the Wildhammer scepter that was to be used as the hammer's handle. During a conversation with Moira Thaurissan, it was implied that she planned on the Wildhammers alienating the other two clans so that tensions between the Dark Irons and the Bronzebeards would lessen. Moira informed Kurdran that his brute strength was useless, and only winning hearts and minds mattered in Ironforge. The night before the reforging, Muradin Bronzebeard advised Kurdran to compromise his principles a little as his beliefs were not only holding himself back but his clan and the entire city as well.\nOn the day of the reforging, it was discovered that the handle was missing, and Kurdran admitted he had stolen it. But instead of letting it be reforged, he smashed the handle with his stormhammer, and it shattered to pieces. Kurdran declared that the union of the dwarven clans shouldn't start with reforging a hammer that could be fractured again. Instead, Kurdran proposed that the dwarven clans move forward from the past and unite with a fresh start. Gladly, Muradin joined him in fracturing the other fragments while Moira did so reluctantly, her plan quietly foiled at such a public event.\nRealizing that Falstad was the better dwarf to represent the Wildhammer clan in the Council of Three Hammers, Kurdran decided to step down from his position as Wildhammer representative and traveled to Stormwind to aid King Varian's army.\nCataclysm.\nWith the trouble taken to form the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves' worries are far from over. When a surprise attack from the Dark Irons who were supposed to be with the Alliance was engaged, &lt;a href=\"Commander%20Stonebreaker\"&gt;Commander Stonebreaker&lt;/a&gt; handles the situation and sends one of his scouts to Ironforge with a note claiming that Moira's Dark Irons had attacked the airfield. Moira accused Stonebreaker and the messenger of lying, believing that they were trying to take her son's claim to the throne but &lt;a href=\"Muradin\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; vouched for the commander, claiming that he was loyal and honest to Ironforge. After reviewing the situation and coming with a solution, Moira revealed her discovery that &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Slaghammer\"&gt;Ambassador Slaghammer&lt;/a&gt; had been secretly working for the Twilight's Hammer to undermine her and her &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;\"halfbreed\"&lt;/a&gt;.\nDuring this time &lt;a href=\"Li%20Li%20Stormstout\"&gt;Li Li Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; visited the city in order to speak with &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; and got into a brief argument with Moira to Falstad's amusement.\nBlood in the Snow.\nOne day, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt;'s had discovered that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; threatened Ironforge by rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; against them. The king believed that if he aided them against the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; they would give him more troops for his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. But the King didn't realize that the dwarven clans did not trust one another. When Varian sought the help from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; declined to offer aid in Ironforge\u2019s defense for they feared that if they left to fight the Frostmane trolls, the Dark Irons would take advantage of their absence to defeat the remaining clan and take over Ironforge. Frustrated, Varian argued that if no one would help, then Ironforge will fall under siege. Only &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; offered aid, stating that the Dark Irons will prove their loyalty to the Council, Ironforge, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of Ironforge. And so Moira and the High King set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.\nThe High King, his champions, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; worked together to save Ironforge. On their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment. Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.\nLegion.\nFour years after King Magni's petrification, Moira was asked by Muradin and some of the priests to talk to Magni, as she often did when times were trying, in the hopes that it would wake him up. She, however, felt that it was a fool's errand, still believing that Magni would still not have approved of her ruling, but did so to keep up appearances. However, to the vast surprise of Moira and Advisor Belgrum, Magni awoke with a mighty crash as a living statue made of diamond. With a voice like a mountainslide, he told Moira and Belgrum that he now spoke for the land and was a part of Azeroth itself. Muradin and Falstad also came down to see him.\nWhile the Council of Three Hammers waited for Magni and discussed what the king's return would mean for the political stability of Ironforge upstairs at the High Seat, Magni was taking the time to walk once again through his city, including stopping at the The Great Anvil, seeing the gryphons at the gryphon roost, and kneeling in the pool of the Mystic Ward. By all laws under the mountain, as long as the rightful ruler was alive, the city belonged to him, but Moira and Falstad knew that the Dark Irons and the Wildhammers would never kneel to a Bronzebeard king. However, Magni, having just returned to the throne room, replied that he had not come to reclaim his crown. No longer a king but a servant of Azeroth, he delivered a dire warning about the Burning Legion's return to the three, and that they had to prepare their people\u2014all their people\u2014for what was coming. He then proclaimed that he had to leave immediately to warn the rest of the Alliance.\nWards.\nIronforge is structurally a giant circle of sections, it also contains several \"depth\" levels (at least eight, though they are not accessible in-game). The accessible portions of Ironforge appear to be located on the 5th level, the \"fifth depth\" of the city.\nNotable characters.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; rules Ironforge from the High Seat at the heart of the city, with the support of their two highest-ranking advisers, &lt;a href=\"Royal%20Historian%20Archesonus\"&gt;Royal Historian Archesonus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Senator%20Barin%20Redstone\"&gt;Senator Barin Redstone&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"High%20Tinker%20Mekkatorque\"&gt;High Tinker Mekkatorque&lt;/a&gt;, the leader of the gnomish exiles from &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;, plays a role in the &lt;a href=\"gnome\"&gt;gnome&lt;/a&gt; starting experience. , the leader of the &lt;a href=\"Explorers%27%20League\"&gt;Explorers' League&lt;/a&gt;, leads the dwarves' effort to uncover the mysteries of their past from the Hall of Explorers.\nQuests.\nSee .\nFilm universe.\nIronforge is depicted close to its \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" incarnation.

{"id": "132564", "revid": "46586549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=132564", "title": "Ironforge (kingdom)", "text": "The Kingdom of Ironforge (also known as the Kingdom of Khaz Modan, or simply Ironforge) is the major government of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt; on the continent of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. Being a &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;senatorial&lt;/a&gt; monarchy, it is now reigned by the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, composed of one member from each major dwarven clan, until the heir &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt; is old enough. The kingdom also has its &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Royal%20Treasury\"&gt;own treasury&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe dwarven kingdom was founded after the awakened dwarves ventured out from the ancient city of &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nWar of the Three Hammers.\nIn former times, the Kingdom, led by the &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar%20family\"&gt;Anvilmar family&lt;/a&gt;, ruled over the three big dwarven clans &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt;. After the death of &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, the tensions between the clans erupted in a civil war, called the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. The Bronzebeards emerged victorious due to owning the largest, best-equipped army, and banished the other clans from Ironforge, which founded their own kingdoms.\nThe later attempt to seize Ironforge by the Dark Irons was repelled by the Bronzebeards and Wildhammer together, but even as &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, the home of the Wildhammers, was now uninhabitable, they declined the offer to return to Ironforge.\nMeeting the humans.\nThey encountered the humans, perhaps their most important allies, around 1800 years before the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; and at the same time the &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elves&lt;/a&gt; as the elves and humans were already allies. &lt;a href=\"Gilneas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Gilneas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Alterac%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Alterac&lt;/a&gt;, strong supporters of &lt;a href=\"Strom\"&gt;Strom&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=\"Arathor\"&gt;Arathor Empire&lt;/a&gt;, had developed mighty armies that explored the mountainous southern lands of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. It was during this period that humans first met the ancient race of dwarves and traveled to their cavernous subterranean city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. The humans and dwarves shared many secrets of metal-smithing and engineering and discovered a common love for battle and storytelling.\nSecond and Third Wars.\nPrior to the start of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt; Ironforge had received missives from &lt;a href=\"Terenas%20Menethil\"&gt;King Terenas&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; warning them of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s' arrival. &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; would soon after come under attack by the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, which would cause the destruction of many dwarven strongholds. While the rest of the Horde moved north &lt;a href=\"Kilrogg%20Deadeye\"&gt;Kilrogg Deadeye&lt;/a&gt; and his &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; remained within the region, which saw the orcs and dwarves clash for many months. Even with the loss of all of their other strongholds, &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge remained standing&lt;/a&gt;, despite Kilrogg's best efforts. Each time a dwarven citadel fell, the survivors fled to Ironforge, and by the end of the conflict the whole of the dwarf nation lurked within the city, awaiting a chance for revenge. The Bleeding Hollow would eventually be defeated by the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance of Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; and with Ironforge freed, the inhabitants joined the Alliance. Following the Alliance victory at the Dark Portal, &lt;a href=\"Magni\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; would appoint his younger brother &lt;a href=\"Muradin\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; as ambassador to Lordaeron.\nIn the aftermath of the war, the Alliance began fracturing and some of its members seceded from the Alliance. King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, who vowed that the dwarves of Ironforge would forever owe a debt of honor to the Alliance for liberating Khaz Modan from the Horde's control, remained a staunch supporter of the Alliance.\nAt some point before the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;, a band of renegade dwarves fled to the human lands to try to escape justice after their failed attempt to overthrow the dwarven government. &lt;a href=\"Davin\"&gt;Davin&lt;/a&gt;'s platoon intercepted them, capturing or killing all the dwarves.\nWith the collapse of the Alliance of Lordaeron, the kingdom remained an ally of the modern Alliance and participated in their battles, calling this state that &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Reserve\"&gt;Ironforge Reserve&lt;/a&gt; was called to the Alliance Front.\nCataclysm.\nWhen freak natural disasters began rocking much of Azeroth just prior to the Cataclysm, the dwarven lands were not spared from the calamitous upheavals. A series of violent quakes tore through areas surrounding Ironforge, reducing settlements to rubble and taking the lives of many innocent dwarves in the process. To glean answers as to the troubling state of the world, King Magni selflessly underwent a mystic ritual to commune with the earth. The archaic ceremony, however, had an unexpected effect: Magni was transformed into diamond and became fused to the depths of Ironforge itself.\nIn the power vacuum that followed, his estranged daughter, Moira, who had married into the much despised Dark Iron clan, briefly claimed Ironforge\u2019s throne and effectively locked down the city. If not for the intervention of King Varian Wrynn of Stormwind and his son, Prince Anduin, her brash actions might have sparked another civil war. With Varian\u2019s guidance, control of Ironforge has since been divided equally among the Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron clans through the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;. Yet as bitterness and prejudice fester among the clans, the council\u2019s ability to govern as one remains uncertain.\nThe representatives of each dwarven clan in the council is:\nBlood in the Snow.\nOne day, &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;King Varian&lt;/a&gt;'s had discovered that &lt;a href=\"Zandalar%20tribe\"&gt;Zandalari trolls&lt;/a&gt; threatened the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;dwarven capital&lt;/a&gt; by rallying the &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane trolls&lt;/a&gt; against them. The king believed that if he aided them against the &lt;a href=\"ice%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; they would give him more troops for his campaign against the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;. But the King didn't realize that the dwarven clans did not trust one another. When Varian sought the help from the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, both &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; declined to offer aid in Ironforge's defense for they feared that if they left to fight the Frostmane trolls, the Dark Irons would take advantage of their absence to defeat the remaining clan and take over Ironforge. Frustrated, Varian argued that if no one would help, then Ironforge will fall under siege. Only &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; offered aid, stating that the Dark Irons will prove their loyalty to the Council, &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; in the defense of Ironforge. And so Moira and the High King set out in the snow to save the city, leaving the others to think about their actions.\nThe High King, his champions, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; worked together to save Ironforge. On their return, the other dwarven leaders were ashamed of their behavior and vowed never again to allow fear or distrust to cloud their judgment. Free to trust one another, all three dwarven leaders pledged their full strength to the Alliance cause.\nOrganization.\nPeople and culture.\nDwarven society is heavily influenced by their &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt; ancestry and connection with the &lt;a href=\"titan\"&gt;titan&lt;/a&gt;s. Families unite in &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s each headed by a &lt;a href=\"thane\"&gt;thane&lt;/a&gt;, or high thane in case of larger clans.\nIn the kingdom, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s are considered as &lt;a href=\"Heretic\"&gt;pariahs&lt;/a&gt; that must operate in the shadows of polite society. They practice their &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20%28magic%29\"&gt;dark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Fel\"&gt;arts&lt;/a&gt; within hidden enclaves, so that they can escape the prejudice of the public, notably in the &lt;a href=\"Bonegrip%27s%20Runes%20and%20Dooms\"&gt;Bonegrip's Runes and Dooms&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Forlorn%20Cavern\"&gt;Forlorn Cavern&lt;/a&gt;, who serve as a \"rat's hole\" for the warlock community of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; as &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; decided to keep a careful watch on them. The &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Guard\"&gt;Ironforge Guard&lt;/a&gt; consider the warlocks to be evil spawn hiding in the dark corners of the city. Their demonic familiars are also seen as loathsome creatures, as some guards have expressed their disgust and willingness to slit their skulls. Like in &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, the law does not seem to expressly prohibit their presence in the city (if they are not enemies of the Alliance).\nPolitical structure.\nHistorically, the &lt;a href=\"High%20King\"&gt;High King of dwarves&lt;/a&gt; is the ultimate leader of the united dwarven &lt;a href=\"clan\"&gt;clan&lt;/a&gt;s, but since the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; and the separation of core families in the kingdom, this title remains unused. With the recent reunion of said clans, prince &lt;a href=\"Dagran%20Thaurissan%20II\"&gt;Dagran Thaurissan II&lt;/a&gt; will presumably be coronated the next High King of dwarves upon reaching adulthood.\nSince the War of Three Hammers, the kingdom of Ironforge has instead been ruled by a &lt;a href=\"King\"&gt;King of Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;, serving as the permanent head of government in the parts of &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt; that remained under &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard\"&gt;Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; control after the War of the Three Hammers. The position as King of Khaz Modan is currently entitled to first-borns of direct descent from &lt;a href=\"Madoran%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Madoran Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;. First-born daughters of this line will instead carry on the entitlement unto their sons, rather than having their uncles take control. The personal advisor of the King will temporarily take command of the kingdom until a suitable successor is decided. After the crystallization of &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Advisor%20Belgrum\"&gt;Advisor Belgrum&lt;/a&gt; ruled until the &lt;a href=\"Council%20of%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;Council of Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt; was founded.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Lord\"&gt;Lord of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; is the local leader of the kingdom's capital city - normally the King of Khaz Modan also holds this title. The Lord of Ironforge automatically holds a seat in the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Senate of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;.\nWith the formation of the Council of Three Hammers, one representative from each of the three major clans - &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Falstad%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Falstad&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammer clan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Moira Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; representing the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; - will rule in unison until prince Dagran is fit to become Lord of Ironforge, King of Khaz Modan and presumably also the High King of dwarves.\nThe government, currently headed by the Three Hammers, historically by the King of Khaz Modan or the High King of dwarves, also consists of senators from the &lt;a href=\"Senate%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;Senate of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these seats are reserved for respected dwarven clans and families, like the &lt;a href=\"Anvilmar%20family\"&gt;Anvilmar family&lt;/a&gt; and by the Lord of Ironforge. The Senate's exact role in government is unclear, but their field of issues includes investigating and eliminating possible threats to Ironforge, keeping the production of the &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; mines optimal, and setting funds aside for defense issues.\nThe kingdom of Ironforge holds a prominent position within the heart of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; as one of its most powerful member states. The chosen leader(s) of Ironforge thus hold a seat at the table of the High King of the Alliance, and Ironforge military often engages in Alliance operations. The deep political relations with other member states, especially the nearby &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Nation of Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Kingdom%20of%20Stormwind\"&gt;Kingdom of Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, have had a huge influence on Ironforge. Examples being the decision to grant asylum to the Gnomeregan Exiles integrating them within the &lt;a href=\"Tinker%20Town\"&gt;Tinker Town&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge, and the construction of the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; connecting Ironforge with &lt;a href=\"Stormwind%20City\"&gt;Stormwind City&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in the formation of the &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20District\"&gt;Dwarven District&lt;/a&gt; in Stormwind.\nVillages and settlements not affiliated with any distinct Alliance nation, but who have sworn fealty to the Alliance maintained by the monarchies of Ironforge and &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt;, pay taxes to those kingdoms in order to sustain the Alliance's upkeep.\nFilm universe.\nThe kingdom of Ironforge is a &lt;a href=\"dwarven\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"kingdom\"&gt;kingdom&lt;/a&gt; located in Dun Morogh of Khaz Modan. It's ruled by King and its capital is the underground city of .\nThe kingdom has good relations with the , doing businesses. According to Stormwind advisors, it is a tiny nation.\nThe kingdom participated in the council that would eventually lead to the creation of the ."}

{"id": "28590", "revid": "41171629", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=28590", "title": "Ironforge Airfield", "text": "The Ironforge Airfield, formerly known as the Airstrip or the &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; airfield, among other (unofficial) things, is an airfield located in a high mountain valley northeast of the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarven&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"capital%20city\"&gt;capital city&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. It has two landing strips, and several gnome pilots are there standing next to their &lt;a href=\"Bomber\"&gt;planes&lt;/a&gt; or tinkering with them. Around the airfield, there are a series of dwarven buildings and structures. &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer\"&gt;Mountaineer&lt;/a&gt;s from Ironforge patrol the area, and some members of the &lt;a href=\"Stormpike%20Guard\"&gt;Stormpike Guard&lt;/a&gt; can be found here too. North of the airfield there is a &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; roost, but it only connects to &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Bolar%20Quarry\"&gt;Gol'Bolar Quarry&lt;/a&gt; via a &lt;a href=\"flying%20machine\"&gt;flying machine&lt;/a&gt;. Further north, near the &lt;a href=\"Wetlands\"&gt;Wetlands&lt;/a&gt;, there is a crashed gnome plane along with some bones.\nBackground.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nBefore &lt;a href=\"patch%204.0.3a\"&gt;patch 4.0.3a&lt;/a&gt; updated the world, this area was inaccessible except by careful mountain climbing and\u2014while the \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft%20Atlas\"&gt;World of Warcraft Atlas&lt;/a&gt;\" labeled it \"Airstrip\"\u2014there was no in-game subzone name, leading to speculations about its purpose.\nAhn'Qiraj War Effort.\nThe Airfield is mentioned in all the repeatable Alliance quests (&lt;a href=\"http%3A//wow.allakhazam.com/search.html%3Fq%3Dalliance%2Bneeds%2Bmore\"&gt;\"The Alliance Needs More ...\"&lt;/a&gt;) from the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War%20Effort\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War Effort&lt;/a&gt; event. The quest objectives all state \"Bring 20 \"Materials\" to \"NPC\" at the airfield in Dun Morogh.\"\nHowever, all those NPCs can, in fact, be found in Ironforge and not at the airfield, and there is no mention of the airfield in the non-repeatable quests.\nIt can be supposed that the &lt;a href=\"Ahn%27Qiraj%20War%20Effort\"&gt;Ahn'Qiraj War Effort&lt;/a&gt; quests were originally planned to be at the airfield (Flying the goods over would make sense) but have been moved to Ironforge for unknown reasons.\nI Got What Yule Need.\nThe &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Krizz\"&gt;Krizz&lt;/a&gt; revealed and foiled a plan of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; at the airfield. Krizz traveled there with &lt;a href=\"Fala%20Fizzlesprocket\"&gt;Fala Fizzlesprocket&lt;/a&gt; atop &lt;a href=\"Metzen%20the%20Reindeer\"&gt;Metzen the Reindeer&lt;/a&gt;, defeated the dwarves and rescued gnome prisoners who had been forced to create a gigantic robot resembling &lt;a href=\"Greatfather%20Winter\"&gt;Greatfather Winter&lt;/a&gt;.\nCataclysm.\nThanks to &lt;a href=\"Ambassador%20Slaghammer\"&gt;Ambassador Slaghammer&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;Dark Iron dwarves&lt;/a&gt; were able to attack the airfield through their &lt;a href=\"mole%20machine\"&gt;mole machine&lt;/a&gt;s, ambush the local guards and put the dwarven &lt;a href=\"bomber\"&gt;bomber&lt;/a&gt;s to the torch. Led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Grimaxe\"&gt;General Grimaxe&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves under the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%27s%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight's Hammer&lt;/a&gt; will stop at nothing to see the land burn in the name of the &lt;a href=\"Old%20God\"&gt;Old God&lt;/a&gt;s.\nLegion.\nDuring the &lt;a href=\"Legion%20Invasion\"&gt;Burning Legion's invasion&lt;/a&gt;, Ironforge Airfield falls under the Legion's control. Its residents and, presumably, the flying machines have been killed or destroyed. The last defenders are led by &lt;a href=\"Mountaineer%20Falmor\"&gt;Mountaineer Falmor&lt;/a&gt;.\nGeography.\nSouth of the airfield there is a small area with three tanks. Some &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan%20Evacuee\"&gt;Gnomeregan Evacuee&lt;/a&gt;s have found a way out of their irradiated city, a lone pet trainer offers her service to hunters, and some gnomes and dwarves are dancing in the snow. Here is a big tower with a sealed entrance to a tunnel which is similar to the tunnel in &lt;a href=\"North%20Gate%20Pass\"&gt;North Gate Pass&lt;/a&gt;. The tunnel continues back the same distance as the others located around Dun Morogh, at an upward incline. When it reaches its peak, it drops off into midair. If enough distance from this jump point can be gained then it is possible to land in the &lt;a href=\"Deeprun%20Tram\"&gt;Deeprun Tram&lt;/a&gt; of Ironforge. However, no other player-characters have been observed via this method, although NPCs are present. In addition, the portal between the &lt;a href=\"Tram\"&gt;Tram&lt;/a&gt; and Tinkertown does not function when reached via this method, and instead players pass straight through without pause.\nIn the same valley, there exists a frozen lake to the south of the airstrip. Since the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the entire lake is the site of an ongoing battle between &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20dwarf\"&gt;Ironforge dwarves&lt;/a&gt; and Dark Iron forces led by &lt;a href=\"General%20Grimaxe\"&gt;General Grimaxe&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the Cataclysm the southern end of the lake had a cave of &lt;a href=\"Frostmane%20tribe\"&gt;Frostmane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ice%20troll\"&gt;trolls&lt;/a&gt; that skirmished with Ironforge dwarves on the lake itself. The cave itself\u2014and apparently the trolls\u2014was destroyed.\nThere is also a black bear mother watching over her offspring northwest of the &lt;a href=\"gryphon\"&gt;gryphon&lt;/a&gt; roost just by a waterfall. \nBy walking around the mountain over Ironforge, a camp with two members of the Seasoned Coldmine Explorers (members of the Stormpike Guard), a cave occupied by Frostmane Trolls, and an empty dwarven camp can be reached.\nGetting there.\nThe most direct way is a flying mount. &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; characters without one, can use a special flight route between the Airfield and &lt;a href=\"Gol%27Bolar%20Quarry\"&gt;Gol'Bolar Quarry&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href=\"Mathel%27s%20Flying%20Machine\"&gt;Mathel's Flying Machine&lt;/a&gt;. Any Alliance character can ride the machine down from the airport, to ride up to the airport, the player must first accept the quest &lt;a href=\"Get%20to%20the%20Airfield\"&gt;Get to the Airfield&lt;/a&gt;. This quest becomes available after completing the quests &lt;a href=\"Entombed%20in%20Ice\"&gt;Entombed in Ice&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Dealing%20with%20the%20Surge\"&gt;Dealing with the Surge&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20Scheming\"&gt;Dark Iron Scheming&lt;/a&gt;.\n&lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; characters without flying mounts can still get to the Airfield by walking a difficult unmarked path that begins at the &lt;a href=\"North%20Gate%20Pass\"&gt;North Gate Pass&lt;/a&gt; end of &lt;a href=\"Loch%20Modan\"&gt;Loch Modan&lt;/a&gt;. This route\u2014which is climbable, albeit with some careful jumping\u2014has existed since the game's launch."}

Acquiring these will require two or three stacks of .\nBuff.\nCreating this item grants the character a +30 &lt;a href=\"Stamina\"&gt;Stamina&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Gift%20of%20Friendship\"&gt;Ironforge Gift of Friendship&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"buff\"&gt;buff&lt;/a&gt; for 60 minutes. The buff persists if the Gift Collection item is consumed as an ingredient. The Gift Collection buffs do not &lt;a href=\"stack\"&gt;stack&lt;/a&gt;, and any new buff from creating a city Gift Collection will overwrite an existing one. \nIngredient.\nAn Ironforge Gift Collection is one of three &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; city Gift Collections which are ingredients of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20Gift%20Collection\"&gt;Alliance Gift Collection&lt;/a&gt;.\nNotes.\nThis is a &lt;a href=\"conjured\"&gt;conjured&lt;/a&gt; item.

Unfortunately, that means you cannot pass these directly to an &lt;a href=\"alt\"&gt;alt&lt;/a&gt; on the same account.\nThis item is primarily useful during Love is in the Air and the seven day duration of the item is longer than the event, so is not a handicap. It does prevent you from saving these for the following year. \nThe item can be created from the ingredient items after the event is over. By combining each hierarchical layer of gifts and pledges near its expiration, it should be possible to extend the overall duration to around 21 days for the city gift collections; so anywhere within that timeframe, a city gift could be created. It is unknown whether or not the buff will proc based on the item creation or if a separate check requires the event to be in progress, but the response time for the buff to proc during the event suggests that no separate check is used. \nSee also.\nThere is a plethora of individual items that are combined in this seasonal event to form successively larger collections. For details, see the main &lt;a href=\"Love%20is%20in%20the%20Air\"&gt;Love is in the Air&lt;/a&gt; article."}

Through this role, they act variously as &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Guard%20%28NPC%29\"&gt;city guards&lt;/a&gt; within the capital of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;, elite bodyguards of the monarch, and a peacekeeping force within the wider &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; region. \nEach member of the guard is equipped with a set of plate armor, a specific attire with an iconic red color and the symbol of a hammer. Under Ironforge's government, &lt;a href=\"Angus%20Stonehammer\"&gt;Angus Stonehammer&lt;/a&gt; serves as captain of the guard. While the main responsibility of the Ironforge Guard appears to lie within the kingdom, members may serve in the armed forces fighting on distant battlefields as part of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt; military. Members have also been known to accompany important figures to distant locations in their role.\nHistory.\nThe Ironforge Guard have historically been involved in resisting any attack on the city by enemy forces, &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; or otherwise. During the &lt;a href=\"Elemental%20Unrest\"&gt;Elemental Unrest&lt;/a&gt;, when frenzied &lt;a href=\"elemental\"&gt;elemental&lt;/a&gt;s threatened major cities across &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;, the guard helped successfully defend Ironforge from the assault. \nShortly before the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the estranged Princess of Ironforge &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt; would return to the city and attempt to seize power, throwing Ironforge into chaos. At this time, the guards were vital in maintaining peace between Moira's &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Iron clan&lt;/a&gt; and the Ironforge dwarves themselves.

If you have autoloot turned on, you can hold down the shift key while right clicking the Pledge of Adoration to not autoloot it.

Always looking for ways to improve their &lt;a href=\"Tank%20%28vehicle%29\"&gt;tank&lt;/a&gt;s, they often hire &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s to gather supplies for them.\nThe brigade seems to have had up to 19 siege engines, equipped with black boxes, one of which was lost in the &lt;a href=\"Badlands\"&gt;Badlands&lt;/a&gt;.\nSpeculation.\nThe Brigade may be part of the larger &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Guard\"&gt;Ironforge Guard&lt;/a&gt;."}

They have a natural resistance to frost &lt;a href=\"magic\"&gt;magic&lt;/a&gt;. They had a digsite in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt; that was overrun. They are led by the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeard clan&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlternative names for these dwarves are Bronzebeard dwarves, sometimes &lt;a href=\"Hill%20dwarf\"&gt;hill dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, and have once been referred to as &lt;a href=\"Mountain%20dwarf\"&gt;mountain dwarves&lt;/a&gt;.\nThey are the standard playable dwarves, with their cousins the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt; being playable as an &lt;a href=\"allied%20race\"&gt;allied race&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nFollowing the &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; identity being made in the wake of the awakening of the &lt;a href=\"earthen\"&gt;earthen&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarves founded the mighty city of &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; as well as the &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;kingdom of Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. For many long centuries, dwarven kind lived united \u2014 with three factions rising among them known as the &lt;a href=\"Bronzebeard%20clan\"&gt;Bronzebeards&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20clan\"&gt;Wildhammers&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20clan\"&gt;Dark Irons&lt;/a&gt;. Under the wise rule of High King &lt;a href=\"Modimus%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Modimus Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;, these three factions remained cordial. When Modimus passed away from old age, tensions boiled over among the clans, and war erupted for control of the city. Thus began the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Three%20Hammers\"&gt;War of the Three Hammers&lt;/a&gt;, a savage conflict that raged for many years, during which time the Bronzebeard clan won sole ownership of Ironforge and expelled its rivals. While the second stage of this war saw the Ironforge dwarves working with the &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarves&lt;/a&gt;, the latter did not return to the city due to the pride of their leader, &lt;a href=\"Khardros%20Wildhammer\"&gt;Khardros Wildhammer&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Kings\"&gt;Valley of Kings&lt;/a&gt; was erected as a monument to Wildhammer and Ironforge friendship, and while rivalries would continue, the two did not raise arms against one another ever again.\nSome Ironforge dwarves aided the humans during the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href=\"Thargas%20Anvilmar\"&gt;Thargas Anvilmar&lt;/a&gt;. Khaz Modan was besieged by the rampaging &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt; that was heading north during the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;. The proud dwarves of Ironforge made their stand alongside their &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; cousins. Inch by inch, the Horde claimed Khaz Modan; though the dwarves and gnomes made it difficult as the Horde forced their way through the territory. Eventually, the twin-race host was forced to split as both races retreated to their respective capitals, with &lt;a href=\"Orgrim%20Doomhammer\"&gt;Orgrim Doomhammer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;ish Horde, committed his forces to what he saw the greater threat of the two, Ironforge. Unlike with the rest of Khaz Modan, the &lt;a href=\"siege%20of%20Ironforge\"&gt;siege of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; was unsuccessful, with nearly every resident of the city taking up an axe to defend their home. By the end of the siege, ten orcs were slain for every dwarf felled, and Orgrim called off the attack to surround both Gnomeregan and Ironforge, instead of conquering them, leaving the &lt;a href=\"Bleeding%20Hollow%20clan\"&gt;Bleeding Hollow clan&lt;/a&gt; to this task. Khaz Modan was the prize, and its resources were soon being mined by the Blackrock clan to serve the Horde's needs.\nAs the war moved &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;north&lt;/a&gt;, Ironforge's dwarves offered to join the &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Grand Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. Led by King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt;, the city's resilient inhabitants proved to be a valuable addition to the Alliance forces, helping to secure victory after victory against the orcs. Ever since that time, Ironforge's dwarves have remained an invaluable part of the Alliance. When Khaz Modan was liberated, the dwarves continued to aid the Alliance, even after their &lt;a href=\"Wildhammer%20dwarf\"&gt;Wildhammer dwarf&lt;/a&gt; cousins began to pull away following the &lt;a href=\"Third%20War\"&gt;Third War&lt;/a&gt;.\nApart from reveling in the prospect of battle, the dwarves have long been interested in uncovering the truth of their enchanted past. Due to the efforts of dwarven archeologists scattered throughout the world, much has been learned about the race's origins and the curse of flesh that afflicted the earthen by finding the &lt;a href=\"Discs%20of%20Norgannon\"&gt;Discs of Norgannon&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Uldaman\"&gt;Uldaman&lt;/a&gt;. Many mysteries still remain, however, and the dwarves have continued excavating Azeroth's ancient sites for answers.\nMost recently, a twist of fate has drawn the rival clans back to Ironforge after they'd spent centuries apart. When freak natural disasters began rocking much of Azeroth just prior to the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt;, the dwarven lands were not spared from the calamitous upheavals. A series of violent quakes tore through areas surrounding Ironforge, reducing settlements to rubble and taking the lives of many innocent dwarves in the process. To glean answers as to the troubling state of the world, King &lt;a href=\"Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Magni&lt;/a&gt; selflessly underwent a mystic ritual to commune with the earth. The archaic ceremony, however, had an unexpected effect: Magni was transformed into diamond and became fused to the depths of Ironforge itself.\nIn the power vacuum that followed, his estranged daughter, &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira&lt;/a&gt;, who had married into the much despised Dark Iron clan, briefly claimed Ironforge's throne and effectively locked down the city. If not for the intervention of King &lt;a href=\"Varian%20Wrynn\"&gt;Varian Wrynn&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; and his son, Prince &lt;a href=\"Anduin%20Wrynn\"&gt;Anduin&lt;/a&gt;, her brash actions might have sparked another civil war. With Varian's guidance, control of Ironforge has since been divided equally among the Bronzebeard, Wildhammer, and Dark Iron clans through the Council of Three Hammers. Yet as bitterness and prejudice fester among the clans, the council's ability to govern as one remains uncertain. It would take some time for the dwarves to finally stand united and fears over the Dark Irons in particular to fade, though the clans stood together under the Alliance's banner.\nMagni would eventually awaken just before the advent of the return of the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Burning Legion&lt;/a&gt;. While many feared this would disrupt the new balance of the Council, Magni did not assert control over Ironforge. Instead, he donned the moniker of Speaker of Azeroth, departing to ensure that the world would be protected from &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt;, and acting as the voice of the planet in the wake of the monumental threat before them.\nBy the time of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Muradin%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;Muradin Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; and the Ironforge dwarves led a united coalition of the Three Hammers to aid in &lt;a href=\"Stromgarde\"&gt;Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt; against the Horde in the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20Stromgarde\"&gt;Battle for Stromgarde&lt;/a&gt;.\nAppearance.\nMale dwarves.\nMost dwarven males are stocky, muscular, and all of them have facial hair.\nFemale dwarves.\nFemale Ironforge dwarves are short and stocky like their male counterparts.\nMost Ironforge female dwarves do not appear to have beards. However there really are some bearded female Ironforge dwarves as proven by &lt;a href=\"Graun%20Blump\"&gt;Graun Blump&lt;/a&gt;. Beards owned by female dwarves appear to be rare. However, female dwarves who sported strong beards are considered a sign of beauty among members of the race. Two bearded sisters fought in the battle to retake Grim Batol. It is unknown if other female dwarves grow beards, but then chose to shave.\nIn the RPG.\nThey are also referred to as Bronzebeard dwarves and it is the &lt;a href=\"racial%20class\"&gt;racial class&lt;/a&gt; of dwarves and player race in the Warcraft RPG. The term can also be used to refer to the playable race of dwarves in \"World of Warcraft\", the &lt;a href=\"Dwarf%20%28playable%29\"&gt;dwarves of Ironforge&lt;/a&gt; faction.\nThe \"Ironforge dwarf\" class indicates that an Ironforge dwarf not only has a greater understanding of the dwarven heritage but also dwarven fighting styles and the innate abilities that dwarves can harness with sufficient training.\n\"Note: Before the War of the Three Hammers the term Ironforge dwarf could technically refer to the three main clans of dwarves that once inhabited Ironforge. After the War of the Three Hammers Ironforge dwarf primarily refers to the Bronzebeard clan and any of the smaller clans within the clan. In the case of WoW, the term Ironforge dwarf is the term used for the player race. Ironforge dwarf is also a racial class in the RPG.\"\nBackground.\nThe dwarves of Ironforge are a proud, stern and determined people with streaks of kindness hidden under the gruff exteriors of their sturdy frames. Their love for battle, invention, and exploration impels them ever forward to discover and unearth the mysteries of their heritage, educating them further about those who first created the dwarven race. Only recently have the dwarves discovered the legacy of their ancient progenitors, the Titans. As the dwarves begin to delve deeper into the mysteries of their past, they also begin to uncover deeper enigmas. Still, they keep to the forges and workshops, ever innovating and creating new and more effective ways to destroy. Steam-powered &lt;a href=\"technology\"&gt;technology&lt;/a&gt; and firearms originate from dwarven inventiveness and creativity. The stout race is renowned for its skills at battle and also as cunning engineers and crafters. The uncovered fragments of their distant past have led the dwarves on an unprecedented exodus of exploration. Seeking out their origins, the dwarves have dispatched &lt;a href=\"prospector\"&gt;prospector&lt;/a&gt;s across all of &lt;a href=\"Lordaeron\"&gt;Lordaeron&lt;/a&gt; in order to seek out signs of the Titans, the supposed creators of the dwarves. The dwarves have embraced the idea that it is their purpose to search the world for more signs of proof of their heritage. Dwarven outposts exist in the most desolate of places. Here, the dwarves spend their time seeking out the secrets of ancient times, or simply use their outposts as staging grounds for expeditions to clear out their enemies so that they may continue their quest.\nRelations.\nIronforge dwarves are affiliated with the Alliance. While the dwarves of Ironforge appreciate the fighting skill of the Horde, it is with grim eyes that they look upon the orcs and their allies, the trolls and the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt;. Although the dwarves have held dealings of commerce and diplomacy with the high elves, they keep the people of &lt;a href=\"Quel%27Thalas%20%28kingdom%29\"&gt;Quel'Thalas&lt;/a&gt; at an arm's distance. While the night elves may share the same allegiances, the dwarves look upon them with suspicion and some trepidation. Humans, however, are the staunch and constant allies of the dwarven people and find welcome, favor and kindness when in dwarven lands.\nThe Ironforge dwarves also view their gnomish cousins with much love due to shared interests in invention, exploration, and the gathering of knowledge as evidenced by their invitation to the Gnomereganian refugees to live in &lt;a href=\"Ironforge\"&gt;Ironforge&lt;/a&gt;. They have been known to be on extremely friendly terms with the few &lt;a href=\"pandaren\"&gt;pandaren&lt;/a&gt; who have made it to Ironforge and other dwarven settlements.\nRegion.\nThe Ironforge dwarves dwell in and around &lt;a href=\"Ironforge%20Mountain\"&gt;Ironforge Mountain&lt;/a&gt;. The city of Ironforge is a vast subterranean city carved into the depths of Ironforge Mountain. This vast complex has served as the dwarven homeland for thousands of years. The city of Ironforge is not only home to the dwarves, but also their gnomish cousins driven from their capital of &lt;a href=\"Gnomeregan\"&gt;Gnomeregan&lt;/a&gt;. Ironforge sits north of the &lt;a href=\"Dun%20Morogh\"&gt;Dun Morogh&lt;/a&gt; Peaks, located high above Loch Modan in central &lt;a href=\"Khaz%20Modan\"&gt;Khaz Modan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"King%20Magni%20Bronzebeard\"&gt;King Magni Bronzebeard&lt;/a&gt; presides over the social and cultural matters of the dwarves and rules with a temperament befitting a dwarven warrior, artisan and explorer.\nFaith.\nDwarven priests deliver the message of the Light to their people. They share this faith with humanity and uphold its precepts and teachings. Some dwarves have recently taken to investigating the past and discovered that the Titans themselves were godlike beings. No one has yet begun worshipping the titans as gods, for it would seem that the Light prevails over the reverence for the dwarves' own progenitors.\nLanguage.\nDwarves speak &lt;a href=\"Dwarven%20%28language%29\"&gt;Dwarven&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Common%20%28language%29\"&gt;Common&lt;/a&gt;. Dwarves learn languages that tend to be of most use to them in either practical matters, or in matters of trade and diplomacy, including Gnome, Goblin, Orcish, and Thalassian."}

He longs to prove he is still strong and an asset to both the tauren people and the Horde.\nBiography.\nThe Garad'kra.\nIronhoof was a personal friend of the tauren's high chieftain, &lt;a href=\"Cairne%20Bloodhoof\"&gt;Cairne Bloodhoof&lt;/a&gt;. Even after Cairne was killed in a &lt;a href=\"mak%27gora\"&gt;mak'gora&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href=\"Warchief\"&gt;Warchief&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;, straining the relations between &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s and tauren, Ironhoof remained staunchly loyal to the Horde. When the &lt;a href=\"Garad%27kra\"&gt;Garad'kra&lt;/a&gt; militia was formed, Ironhoof demanded to be conscripted, seeing it as a great honor.\nIronhoof joined the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Malgar\"&gt;Malgar&lt;/a&gt; in defending a small orc farm in the &lt;a href=\"Northern%20Barrens\"&gt;Northern Barrens&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"centaur\"&gt;centaur&lt;/a&gt; raiders. Malgar and his &lt;a href=\"wolf\"&gt;wolf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Remnes\"&gt;Remnes&lt;/a&gt; were injured in the fighting, but Ironhoof saved them by defeating the remaining centaur. As Ironhoof questioned one of the survivors, the centaur's new leader &lt;a href=\"Aratas\"&gt;Aratas&lt;/a&gt; appeared and killed the survivor with a spear throw before disappearing. Despite the orc's protests, Ironhoof carried the injured Malgar and Remnes to Orgrimmar to recuperate in the &lt;a href=\"Wyvern%27s%20Tail\"&gt;Wyvern's Tail&lt;/a&gt; inn. While the orc slept, Ironhoof bought him a tauren bow to replace his destroyed rifle. When Malgar woke up, Ironhoof tried to convince him to join him in the Garad'kra. The orc\u2014who wanted nothing to do with the Horde and didn't want to take orders from others\u2014refused and left the city, though not before telling the tauren that he owed him a blood debt for saving his life.\nThe Garad'kra commander &lt;a href=\"Shagara\"&gt;Shagara&lt;/a&gt; summoned Ironhoof and his new teammates &lt;a href=\"Ashra%20Valandril\"&gt;Ashra&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Rada%27jin\"&gt;Rada'jin&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Valley%20of%20Honor\"&gt;Valley of Honor&lt;/a&gt; to inspect them. She appointed Ironhoof to be her &lt;a href=\"Stone%20guard%20%28rank%29\"&gt;stone guard&lt;/a&gt;, giving his commands the same weight as hers, in the hopes of using his vast battlefield experience to mold her team. Ironhoof tried to keep Shagara's team together, criticizing Shagara for almost killing Ashra in their mak'gora and trying to stop Ashra and &lt;a href=\"Felgrim\"&gt;Felgrim&lt;/a&gt; from bickering with each other during the Garad'kra assembly in the &lt;a href=\"Ring%20of%20Valor\"&gt;Ring of Valor&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe Barrens and Maraudon.\n&lt;a href=\"Battlemaster%20Br%C3%B6ng\"&gt;Battlemaster Br\u00f6ng&lt;/a&gt; gave the Garad'kra their first mission of dealing with the new centaur threat. In the Northern Barrens, Shagara's team found Malgar under attack from Aratas and his soldiers. Ironhoof held his own with his axe, but his teammates proved to be disorganized and only won the battle thanks to Malgar's help. Afterward, Malgar's unlikely friend &lt;a href=\"Dorthar\"&gt;Dorthar&lt;/a&gt;, a centaur abandoned by his kin, revealed that Aratas had created an army of centaur and orc slaves in &lt;a href=\"Desolace\"&gt;Desolace&lt;/a&gt; in order to invade &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Bluff\"&gt;Thunder Bluff&lt;/a&gt; and Orgrimmar. Shagara asked for Ironhoof's advice, and he decided that the Garad'kra needed to buy the Horde time by striking at Desolace on their own.\nShagara sent word back to Br\u00f6ng, after which the team set out on a &lt;a href=\"zeppelin\"&gt;zeppelin&lt;/a&gt; journey to Desolace alongside Malgar and Dorthar. Ironhoof did not mind working with Dorthar, despite the long rivalry between centaur and tauren. As the journey continued, the Garad'kra helped Dorthar learn how to fight, knitting the team closer together and training them to work as a unit. On arrival in Desolace, Ironhoof and Shagara formed a plan to stop the centaur army by killing Aratas, even if it meant their own deaths, while Malgar and Dorthar would free the orc slaves. In the ensuing battle outside &lt;a href=\"Maraudon\"&gt;Maraudon&lt;/a&gt;, the Garad'kra started to lose against Aratas' &lt;a href=\"perfect%20ones\"&gt;perfect ones&lt;/a&gt; until Malgar joined them and turned the tide. Rada'jin died from one of Aratas' spears meant for Malgar, and the khan retreated into Maraudon with the unconscious Shagara to sacrifice her to his &lt;a href=\"Aratas%27%20father\"&gt;elemental father&lt;/a&gt;.\nRada'jin's death caused the Garad'kra to immediately fall back into disagreements until Malgar declared that he was going after Shagara, which convinced the others to follow him. Inside Maraudon, Aratas summoned his \"father\", and the Garad'kra stopped to fight it while Malgar followed the centaur. The elemental proved to be impervious to all of Ironhoof, Ashra, and Felgrim's attacks, and the battle seemed lost until Malgar and Shagara returned with Aratas' spear, the elemental's only weakness. After the others used their abilities to create an opening, Ashra used the spear to destroy the elemental.\nThe Garad'kra returned to Orgrimmar, where Ironhoof helped Shagara search for recruits that could take Rada'jin's place, until Malgar offered himself for the role. Shagara accepted this, and the friends then gathered to witness Dorthar joining the Horde.\nDragonflight.\nIronhoof was amongst the tauren who followed &lt;a href=\"Bovan%20Windtotem\"&gt;Bovan Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahran%20Plains\"&gt;Ohn'ahran Plains&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Windtotem%20tribe\"&gt;Windtotem&lt;/a&gt; leader received a vision from &lt;a href=\"Ohn%27ahra\"&gt;Ohn'ahra&lt;/a&gt;. After the tauren were attacked by &lt;a href=\"Clan%20Nokhud\"&gt;Clan Nokhud&lt;/a&gt;, Ironhoof was amongst those that regrouped at &lt;a href=\"Toghusuq%20Village\"&gt;Toghusuq Village&lt;/a&gt; and could be found tending to the &lt;a href=\"Weary%20Pack%20Kodo\"&gt;Weary Pack Kodo&lt;/a&gt; in the northeastern part of the village. In contrast to his fellow tauren who hated the centaur, Ironhoof admitted that they were in dire straits because of the centaur, but he did not hate them. Instead, he explained that he would choose his enemies based on their actions over their ancestry. When asked about the &lt;a href=\"%3ABloody%20Axe\"&gt;:Bloody Axe&lt;/a&gt; found at where the tauren had been attacked, he revealed that it belonged to his friend &lt;a href=\"Nawa\"&gt;Nawa&lt;/a&gt;, who was later rescued from captivity.\nHe later attended the joint funeral for the fallen tauren and &lt;a href=\"Maruuk%20Centaur\"&gt;Maruuk Centaur&lt;/a&gt; within the village, where he reflected on the old hatred between the tauren and centaur of &lt;a href=\"Kalimdor\"&gt;Kalimdor&lt;/a&gt;, and how the old scars run deep. He then expressed his hopes that one day his people would be able to overcome their traumatic past and see beyond the surface, as he had.\nIronhoof later joined in the rebuilding of Toghusuq Village, where he admitted that his people were still wary of the centaur, but that they were acclimating. He even muses about the possibility of one of the Maruuk joining the &lt;a href=\"Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, while flashing a knowing smile at adventurers."}

For example, a party consisting of a &lt;a href=\"rogue\"&gt;rogue&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"mage\"&gt;mage&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; walk into a bar and &lt;a href=\"loot\"&gt;loot&lt;/a&gt; some &lt;a href=\"rare\"&gt;rare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"cloth\"&gt;cloth&lt;/a&gt; armor. All of them can potentially wear that armor, but only the mage really needs it, the rest will likely just sell it or give it to an alt (see &lt;a href=\"Greed\"&gt;Greed&lt;/a&gt;). Therefore, it is expected that the warrior and rogue will allow the mage to have it by not &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt;ing on the item.\nEtiquette.\nIt's not always obvious who needs an item, perhaps the mage already has better armor or perhaps the party loots some &lt;a href=\"crafting\"&gt;crafting&lt;/a&gt; items and it's not known who has what &lt;a href=\"professions\"&gt;professions&lt;/a&gt;. Prior to patch 1.9, people would typically say \"n\" or \"g\" to indicate if they want an item for need or for greed. Now this declaration of &lt;a href=\"need\"&gt;need&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"greed\"&gt;greed&lt;/a&gt; is built into &lt;a href=\"roll\"&gt;roll&lt;/a&gt;ing for an item. If everyone declares &lt;a href=\"greed\"&gt;greed&lt;/a&gt;, then everyone rolls for the item; if one or more people declare &lt;a href=\"need\"&gt;need&lt;/a&gt;, only they roll on the item, which is the usual tactic of &lt;a href=\"Loot%20ninja\"&gt;ninjas.&lt;/a&gt;\nLoot level.\nPrior to &lt;a href=\"patch%208.0.1\"&gt;patch 8.0.1&lt;/a&gt;, there was a Need before Greed party loot setting which is an attempt to enforce the above etiquette. Those party members who can't use an item (such as mages and mail armor pieces) or who can't use the item most effectively (such as warriors and cloth armor pieces) aren't given the chance to loot an item until the party members who can most effectively use the item have the chance to loot it.\nProblems with Need before Greed.\nBefore patch 3.3.0, the Need before Greed setting only took into account whether or not you could use the item now, not in the future. This means that if a &lt;a href=\"mob\"&gt;mob&lt;/a&gt; dropped a piece of armor requiring level 37, the level 36 &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; in the party would not be able to roll on it. Similarly, a level 39 &lt;a href=\"hunter\"&gt;hunter&lt;/a&gt; would not be able to roll on &lt;a href=\"mail\"&gt;mail&lt;/a&gt; items even though they would be able to use them next level.\nWith patch 3.3.0, the Need Before Greed system was redesigned to recognize gear appropriate for a class:\nFor items other than equipment, other restrictions apply; you can't roll Need on:\nAnyone can roll Need on gems.\nAll items will still be available via Greed rolls (except for duplicate &lt;a href=\"Unique\"&gt;Unique&lt;/a&gt; items) as well as the new Disenchant option should no member be able to use the item. Low-level items are unrestricted.\nOff Specs.\nAs Hybrid classes (such as Druids, Shamans, and Paladins) and other classes capable of performing multiple roles (such as Warriors and Death Knights), items may drop that may be used for any of these roles; NOTE: This may not apply to Priests because they may or may not use the same gear for both healing and DPS. Many players have different perspectives on rolling for off-spec loot. Many players agree that gear rolls should be main spec only, which in most players' opinion, is the role that they are currently playing with, even if it is the player's Secondary spec. In a raid setting, it would be more beneficial to the raid if the active tank is allowed to roll for a tanking item over a Paladin or Warrior currently acting as a DPS.\nIf you are running an instance or raid with the intention of getting off-spec gear, or there's a chance that off-spec gear will drop, it's best to declare this before the run starts and make sure everyone is okay with it. To be absolutely polite you should be willing to forgo main spec Need rolls."}

Neeru was tricked into thinking that the adventurers are working with Neeru and his &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Blade\"&gt;Burning Blade&lt;/a&gt; and thus with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt;. Neeru retold the adventurers his goals and revealed himself to be the leader of the Burning Blade and that he is working with the &lt;a href=\"Searing%20Blade\"&gt;Searing Blade&lt;/a&gt; within the &lt;a href=\"Ragefire%20Chasm\"&gt;Ragefire Chasm&lt;/a&gt;. He used to send unaware adventurers into Ragefire Chasm to test the strength of the Searing Blade cultists, to see if they're truly worthy of being on his side.\nThis info was sent to Thrall who immediately had the leaders of Searing Blade killed. This angered Neeru, but he did not take any action and proposed to wait.\nCataclysm.\nNeeru volunteered to aid &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt; in any way he could.\nMists of Pandaria.\nWith Garrosh angered by the fact that &lt;a href=\"Warlock\"&gt;demon worshipers&lt;/a&gt; are found in &lt;a href=\"Orgrimmar\"&gt;Orgrimmar&lt;/a&gt;, he has sent the Kor'kron along with &lt;a href=\"Ureda%20of%20the%20Black%20Flame\"&gt;Ureda&lt;/a&gt; to take care of them. Neeru and the other warlocks were trapped in their tents.\nLater, during the &lt;a href=\"Siege%20of%20Orgrimmar\"&gt;siege&lt;/a&gt;, he was hanged on the Chasm's ceiling along with other warlocks.

He leads the Burning Blade regiment that inhabits a cave complex just outside of Orgrimmar, and they work to watch the Horde\u2019s movement \u2014 and see if Thrall plans to move against them before they have a sufficient defense.\nNeeru is one of the youngest Burning Blade members, and still in his healthy prime \u2014 instead of corrupted and twisted by years of fel magic. Since he wasn\u2019t in the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt;, and only tasted the end of the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, doesn\u2019t trust him as far as he could spit a dead rat. He put Neeru in charge of the &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s in &lt;a href=\"Durotar\"&gt;Durotar&lt;/a&gt;, but there are a handful of warlocks who know they must watch Neeru in turn. Neeru is fed carefully modified information in case he does cave in to Thrall. If Klass has his ultimate wish, Thrall will swallow the misinformation, then kill Neeru as a traitor, fulfilling two goals.\nQuotes.\nListen closely to what you are told and do not quickly trust, or distrust.

Like his father and his younger twin sister &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, he had a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; guise, appearing as Victor Nefarius, Lord of Blackrock. Holding the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock clan&lt;/a&gt; and various clans of &lt;a href=\"ogre\"&gt;ogre&lt;/a&gt;s under his control, Nefarian ruled from &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;his lair&lt;/a&gt; at the top of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; until he was defeated by &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;champions of Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the return of his father and the &lt;a href=\"Cataclysm%20%28event%29\"&gt;Cataclysm&lt;/a&gt; that resulted, Nefarian was brought back to life as a rotted abomination, and &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;descended further&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, where he set up a laboratory full of new (and mostly failed) experiments - including reanimating his sister Onyxia. Ultimately, he was destroyed once again by Azeroth's champions.\nNefarian serves as one of the two secondary antagonists (alongside his sister Onyxia) in classic \"&lt;a href=\"World%20of%20Warcraft\"&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/a&gt;\" and returns as one of the supporting antagonists in \"\".\nBackground.\nAftermath of the Second War.\nShortly before his departure for &lt;a href=\"Draenor\"&gt;Draenor&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=\"Horde%20of%20Draenor\"&gt;Horde of Draenor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; commanded &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt; and Nefarian to secure the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20clan\"&gt;Blackrock&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s of &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;Blackrock Spire&lt;/a&gt; as their new force. His children agreed to do so.\nAfter Draenor's destruction, Deathwing returned as Daval Prestor to Lordaeron, sowing chaos. He secretly called on Nefarian to accompany him, also disguised as a human noble. Together, they spread distrust among &lt;a href=\"Alliance%20of%20Lordaeron\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;'s nations. After the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20of%20Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Battle of Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian chose to work from shadows and contacted the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; in Blackrock Mountain, manipulating the orcs into allowing the black dragonflight to use the location as their new base. The son of Deathwing established a hidden laboratory there, hoping to achieve his father's dream of rebuilding the black dragonflight. To that end, he conducted grotesque experiments with the blood of different dragonflights, much of which he harvested from living dragons.\nWith the aid of his sister Onyxia\u2014who served as one of his mightiest supporters and was seen traveling to and from Blackrock on occasion\u2014and the orchestrations of their human personas, Nefarian worked toward replenishing the black dragonflight. Nefarian was obsessed with following in his father's footsteps by achieving what his father could not. He has been experimenting with the blood of all of the various dragonflights to create a &lt;a href=\"chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;chromatic dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; of unstoppable warriors and unspeakable hybrids of both red and black dragons.\nNefarian and his draconic minions took control of the &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire\"&gt;upper Spire&lt;/a&gt; and made war on the &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Iron%20dwarf\"&gt;dwarves&lt;/a&gt;' holdings in the mountain's volcanic depths. Realizing that the dwarves were led by the mighty &lt;a href=\"fire%20elemental\"&gt;fire elemental&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Ragnaros\"&gt;Ragnaros&lt;/a&gt; - Nefarian vowed to crush his enemies and claim the whole of Blackrock Mountain for himself. To this end, he made efforts to bolster his forces like his father Deathwing in ages past.\nIntent on seizing the entire region for his own, he has struck up an alliance with &lt;a href=\"Dal%27rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Dal'rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt;, though he only used him and his &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Horde\"&gt;Dark Horde&lt;/a&gt; to battle against his enemies for control of the mountain. Nefarian's mad bid for dominance has even attracted the ire of the &lt;a href=\"red%20dragonflight\"&gt;red dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 in the form of the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 which has always been the Black flight's greatest foe. Though Nefarian's intentions are known, the methods he is using to achieve them remain a mystery. The &lt;a href=\"Blackwing\"&gt;Blackwing Cabal&lt;/a&gt; served directly under him in his lair.\nWorld of Warcraft.\nThanks to the effort of &lt;a href=\"Moira%20Thaurissan\"&gt;Moira Thaurissan&lt;/a&gt;, word was spread about Nefarian and the Dark Horde, and the Horde in Orgrimmar was in an uproar. As such, Horde heroes traveled to Blackrock Mountain to deal with their enemies.\nWithin the mountains of Blackrock, Nefarian worked tirelessly to keep his kin alive and create a &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20dragonflight\"&gt;new flight&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Rend%20Blackhand\"&gt;Rend Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; was the first to use a Chromatic being known as &lt;a href=\"Gyth\"&gt;Gyth&lt;/a&gt;. Upon the arrival of the adventurers in the &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Stadium\"&gt;arena&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=\"Upper%20Blackrock%20Spire%20%28Classic%29\"&gt;Upper Blackrock&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian implored his new experiments alongside Rend's orcs to kill them. When that plan fails, he orders Rend to deal with the heroes personally with Gyth at his side. After Rend and Gyth fell before the might of the Horde adventurers, Nefarian promised that the next time they meet would be the last.\nIn the &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, Nefarian enslaved the red dragon &lt;a href=\"Vaelastrasz%20the%20Corrupt\"&gt;Vaelastrasz&lt;/a&gt; and corrupted him, commanding him to kill the heroes of Azeroth. Vaelastrasz once held the &lt;a href=\"Red%20Scepter%20Shard\"&gt;red scepter shard&lt;/a&gt;, as part of the the &lt;a href=\"The%20Scepter%20of%20the%20Shifting%20Sands\"&gt;Scepter of the Shifting Sands&lt;/a&gt;, but Nefarian has stolen it and will destroy it if he is not defeated &lt;a href=\"From%20the%20Desk%20of%20Lord%20Victor%20Nefarius\"&gt;soon enough&lt;/a&gt;.\nHorde champions continued to fight against Nefarian's twisted creations before confronting Nefarian in his lair, ultimately defeating him. The Horde champions then took &lt;a href=\"Head%20of%20Nefarian\"&gt;his head&lt;/a&gt; as proof of their victory and returned to Orgrimmar. The head was put on a pike by &lt;a href=\"Varok%20Saurfang\"&gt;Varok Saurfang&lt;/a&gt; himself.\nA year later after his death, &lt;a href=\"Lady%20Sinestra\"&gt;Lady Sinestra&lt;/a&gt; met with &lt;a href=\"Overlord%20Mor%27ghor\"&gt;Overlord Mor'ghor&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=\"Shadowmoon%20Valley\"&gt;Shadowmoon Valley&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned that although Nefarian had been killed, his experiment continues.\nNight of the Dragon.\nDuring the events in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt; prior to the &lt;a href=\"war%20against%20the%20Lich%20King\"&gt;war against the Lich King&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Kalecgos\"&gt;Kalecgos&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Krasus\"&gt;Krasus&lt;/a&gt; confirm that Nefarian, the eldest and most powerful of Deathwing's children, had been slain by brave fighters. Kalec later suggests to &lt;a href=\"Dargonax\"&gt;Dargonax&lt;/a&gt; that Nefarian's mother, &lt;a href=\"Sintharia\"&gt;Sintharia&lt;/a&gt;, abandoned him to his enemies after he failed her.\nSintharia, also the creator of Dargonax and the &lt;a href=\"twilight%20dragonflight\"&gt;twilight dragonflight&lt;/a&gt;, was mentally unstable and referred to Dargonax as Nefarian on a few different occasions. Despite being their mother, Sinathria showed spite towards both Onyxia and Nefarian.\nCataclysm.\nAfter his death in Blackwing Lair, the &lt;a href=\"Twilight%20Hammer\"&gt;Twilight Hammer&lt;/a&gt; cultists recovered Nefarian's corpse and reanimated it with &lt;a href=\"Void\"&gt;Void&lt;/a&gt; magics. The dragon retained a sliver of his former personality, but he was now an obedient servant of the Twilight's Hammer. It was his knowledge of how to craft monsters that the cult wanted from him. Thus, Nefarian returned to his own experiments and forged a new generation of chromatic dragons.\nHe was then charged by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; to continue his insidious endeavors within &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;. Dwelling on the lessons learned from his defeat in Blackwing Lair, he has burrowed deeper into the heart of Blackrock Mountain and rebuilt his sanctuary. The &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Shadowflame\"&gt;Vault of the Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;, a deep pit of cascading magma, is the heart of Blackwing Descent, and the location of horrific new experiments in undeath and magical augmentation, including a triumph dear to even Nefarian's cold, wrathful heart. He had continued his experiments along with his minion &lt;a href=\"Maloriak\"&gt;Maloriak&lt;/a&gt;, a human named Malory who he had captured, which yielded results such as &lt;a href=\"Chimaeron\"&gt;Chimaeron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Atramedes\"&gt;Atramedes&lt;/a&gt;. When Nefarian arrived in Blackwing Descent, he repurposed the &lt;a href=\"Omnotron%20Defense%20System\"&gt;Omnotron Defense System&lt;/a&gt; to annihilate anyone intruding on his laboratories. Nefarian largely considered &lt;a href=\"Magmaw\"&gt;Magmaw&lt;/a&gt; a worrisome pest, but has grown fond of feeding the beast his failed experiments and servants.\nNefarian also succeeded in the reanimation of his sister, &lt;a href=\"Onyxia\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, but ultimately he was slain yet again by adventurers of the Alliance and Horde in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Descent\"&gt;Blackwing Descent&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nThe remains of Nefarian and Onyxia remained untouched in Blackwing Descent for several years. When &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; awoke at the conclusion of the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, his &lt;a href=\"Darkwhisper\"&gt;servants&lt;/a&gt; attempted to raise Nefarian and Onyxia into the Old Gods' service once again. &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Inquisitor%20Xanesh\"&gt;Dark Inquisitor Xanesh&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Vexiona\"&gt;Vexiona&lt;/a&gt; lured &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt; to Blackwing Descent and intended to use his essence to revive the draconic siblings, but their efforts were thwarted. At Wrathion's command, their remains were completely destroyed, and the last remaining scales used to craft a &lt;a href=\"Ashjra%27kamas%2C%20Shroud%20of%20Resolve\"&gt;cloak&lt;/a&gt; to protect against N'Zoth's corruption.\nIn the RPG.\nNefarian usually enters combat in human form at first, summoning his many minions and allies while he wears down his enemies with powerful spells. If seriously threatened, he takes on his true form, using his shadow flame breath to incinerate anyone who is not properly protected. He uses his corrupted power ability to incapacitate whatever characters he feels are the greatest threat. If badly wounded, Nefarian uses his powerful magic to retreat. If prevented from retreating, he uses his most powerful spells and abilities to turn his enemies against each other, and to drain their health and spells while restoring his own. Nefarian's breath, known as shadow flame, is among the deadliest of any dragon's attacks.

He can be found in the &lt;a href=\"Vault%20of%20the%20Shadowflame\"&gt;Vault of the Shadowflame&lt;/a&gt;, where he resurrects his sister &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20%28Blackwing%20Descent%20tactics%29\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;, who makes up the first phase of the fight. Throughout the fight, Nefarian has several other undead adds as well.\nBackground.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"&lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;'s son, Nefarian, gained infamy for his horrifying efforts to create chromatic dragons from the essences of &lt;a href=\"Azeroth\"&gt;Azeroth&lt;/a&gt;'s various [dragonflights. After his death in &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt;, he was reanimated and charged by Deathwing to continue his insidious endeavors.\"\nAbilities.\nPhase One: Rise Sister!\nNefarian reveals the undead form of his sister, Onyxia, and the two dragons attack the raid.\nPhase Two: Curse You, Mortals!\nWhen the players kill Onyxia, Nefarian takes to the air and fills the room with magma except for three platforms. Nefarian then summons a Chromatic Prototype upon each of the platforms.\nPhase Three: You Simply Will Not Die!\nAfter the players kill all the Chromatic Prototypes, the lava subsides, and Nefarian lands to finish the battle.\nStrategy.\nPhase One.\nThe encounter begins with an introductory event in which Nefarian (as Lord Victor Nefarius) resurrects &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20%28Blackwing%20Descent%20tactics%29\"&gt;Onyxia&lt;/a&gt;. He then turns into his dragon form and flies into the air, landing 30 seconds into the fight. Before Nefarian lands he will spawn 6/12 (10/25-man) Animated Bone Warriors which can be either kited, CC'd or tanked until they run out of energy and die on their own in this phase. Onyxia and Nefarian should be tanked on opposite sides of the room to remove their 100% haste buff Children of Deathwing. Onyxia should be damaged down to low health but not killed. This will give you some time to burn Nefarian's health down before the last phase. Onyxia will eventually hit full energy and instantly kill the raid, and every 10% of Nefarian's health adds 25% to her energy charge. You will generally have time to burn Nefarian down to sub-80% before killing Onyxia and ending the phase. Do not let either Dragon breathe on the Animated Bone Warriors as this will break CC, snares and roots and reset their energy to full.\nPhase Two.\nThe arena will fill with lava and three Chromatic Prototypes will spawn on each raised pillar of the room. They do not melee. They cast Blast Nova which must be interrupted.\nAssign players to each of the three platforms for phase two. Each platform needs one reliable interrupt for 10-man and two reliable interrupts for 25-man (you will need interrupt rotations on 25). A ranged interrupter is helpful in the beginning of the phase on each platform while everyone is jumping up. You should try to damage Nefarian below 70% in this phase, survival cooldowns should be used to mitigate the electrocute at 70%. The phase will end after the Chromatic Prototypes die or after three minutes.\nPhase Three.\nThe lava will subside and Nefarian will land, stay spread out until Nefarian has stopped casting Shadowflame Barrage. \nPhase Three is like phase one except Nefarian will now cast Shadowblaze Spark, it will always be targetted on the location of the Animated Bone Warriors. It will break CC, snares and roots on the Animated Bone Warriors and reset their energy to full just as the dragons' breath does. \nSince Shadowblaze Spark is always targeted on the Bone Warriors, CC and roots are ineffective. You should have a tank kite the Bone Warriors away from Nefarian and continually move to avoid the Animated Bone Warriors ever regaining energy. They will die after 50 seconds and reset their empowering strikes stacks, this will allow the Bone Warrior tank to survive. Both tanks will need to use a survival cooldown to survive Electrocute every 10% of Nefarian's health. \nThe longer Nefarian takes to die the faster he will cast Shadowblaze Spark, until it is impossible to avoid and the raid dies.\nAlternate Strategy.\nAn alternate strategy for high DPS, low HPS composition groups, is to push through phase 1 and phase 2 very quickly (essentially nef is full health), then burn in phase 3.\nIn Phase 1, tank should continue as normal rotating the boss when needed. DPS should kite the bone warriors on top of the onyxia tank. This phase should last no longer than 2 minutes. As soon as onyxia is dead the bone warriors will all drop in a neat pile. \nOn Phase 2, blow a heroism/bloodlust/time warp and down these 3 casters asap. This phase also should last no longer than 2 minutes.\nOn Phase 3, it is business as usual. The add tank will stand next to the nice pile of bonewarriors and pick them up to kite ahead of the Nef tank. The Nef tank will slowly circle around in the same direction and the dps follows suit perpendicular to Nef.\nAdvantages - Less AOE healing in phase 1 and phase 2, reduced RNG factor.\nDisadvantages - Phase 3 could take longer than usual causing a wipe as the spark mechanic will out run your add tank.\nVideos.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

{"id": "116184", "revid": "39299307", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=116184", "title": "Nefarian (tactics)", "text": "Nefarian is located atop &lt;a href=\"Blackwing%20Lair\"&gt;Blackwing Lair&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href=\"Chromaggus\"&gt;Chromaggus&lt;/a&gt;. He has two forms: his Human form, Lord Victor Nefarius, and his dragon form, Nefarian proper. Nefarian is an extremely difficult encounter as it requires a full 40-man raid to win along with strong coordination and leadership. On average, the full encounter consists of 3 stages and takes about 20\u201330 minutes to finish.\nAttacks and abilities.\nSeasons of Mastery.\nDuring the Season of Mastery, the drakonid adds spawn at a significantly faster rate. In addition, the class calls have additional effects that can last beyond the normal duration of the class call, making it possible to have multiple effects active at once.\nStrategy.\nPhase 1.\nTo activate the Encounter a person must walk up to Nefarian's throne and talk through what he says. Upon completion of this he says \"Let the Games begin.\" From here, Nefarian is invulnerable, and walks amid the raid randomly shadow bolting, &lt;a href=\"mind%20control\"&gt;mind control&lt;/a&gt;ling people and casting fear on random targets. The room begins to flood with &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s at the same time. \nPhase 1 of the fight consists of defeating the drakonids.\nThere are 6 types of drakonids that spawn. In every Nefarian encounter you will fight &lt;a href=\"Chromatic%20Drakonid\"&gt;Chromatic Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s; the largest and toughest drakonids. Fortunately they spawn in far fewer number than the other colors. In addition to the Chromatic Drakonid, 2 other random colors of &lt;a href=\"drakonid\"&gt;drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s will spawn as well. One color will spawn from the southern door, and one color will spawn from the northern door. Colors are fixed for each instance: if Nefarian is attempted multiple times before the instance resets, the same color combinations will appear.\nDifferent colors of drakonids have different special abilities and are resistant to different schools of magic. Note that, unlike some other Blackwing Lair mobs, these drakonids are not particularly vulnerable to any magic. Below is a list of their colors and associated abilities / resistances:\nThe Drakonids can be killed by either AoE attacks or direct damage and aside from Chromatics, they do not hit very hard and do not have a lot of health.\nDoorway method.\nRaid is split up into groups so that DPS is split up as evenly as possible. The easiest way to do this is start with a Physical assist train on one side (Hunter, Rogue, Warrior) with nuker/AoE classes (Mage, Warlock, Paladin, Shaman) on the other, with healers and tanks being split evenly. At least 2 to 3 tanks need to be designated per side to be able handle Chromatic Drakonids. Taunt moves should be enough to hold mobs, but any that leak should be the primary target, followed by a designated assist target.\nRanged DPS classes (Mage, Warlock, Hunter) and healers should be positioned max range from either door so that they can switch sides quickly. Hunters can be moved between sides to tweak the DPS balance. Hard, steady DPS is crucial so if one side is waiting for spawns, people need to switch over; the non-chromatic drakonids shouldn't live past taunt duration while chromatics have significantly more health and need to be \"sunder\" tanked.\nFor Black combos, Warlocks should be switched off with Hunters so that they can make full use of their moves. Blue doesn't impact +hit/-resistance Mages too badly but it might help to add Hunters to assist train mobs.\nRed and bronze drakonids should be handled primarily by casters and only melee with called out healers.\nGreen drakonids are the least harmful so this side should be composed mainly of dispellers and classes that wouldn't do versus the other color.\nPhase 2.\nAfter killing 42 Drakonids, no more will spawn (you still have to kill all the others that are up), and Nefarian will land on the balcony in the Dragon Form. This is the beginning of Phase 2 of the encounter. Before landing, he will have cast an AoE (ignores LoS), Shadow Flame, on the entire raid. This version of the spell does about 1000 shadow damage and is completely resistible. Previously, every member of the raid must have been wearing &lt;a href=\"Onyxia%20Scale%20Cloak\"&gt;Onyxia Scale Cloak&lt;/a&gt; to avoid the fatal DoT from Shadow Flame (frost mages could use their &lt;a href=\"Ice%20Block\"&gt;Ice Block&lt;/a&gt; ability and paladins could use their &lt;a href=\"Divine%20Shield\"&gt;Divine Shield&lt;/a&gt; ability to avoid the Flame without the cloak). By now, most of the drakonids should be dead. Move your raid to this area and start DPSing him down, from here on out it is simple damage dealing with a few twists. It should be noted that, if your raid attempts the AoE version of Phase 1 and stays near the throne, you can stand BEHIND the throne and NOT be hit by Shadow Flame. It is the only place in the room that has this property (and is therefore was the only way for someone without a Cloak or immunity shield to live).\nHe has all the abilities of normal dragons: &lt;a href=\"Conical\"&gt;Conical&lt;/a&gt; breath attack (shadow based), &lt;a href=\"Cleave\"&gt;Cleave&lt;/a&gt;, and Bellowing Roar. He also does Veil of Shadow on the target nearest to the center of his hitbox. Nefarian casts an AOE fear roughly every 30 seconds. The ground shakes immediately before this occurs, giving the MT time to stance dance and use berserker rage. Alternatively, have any priests cast fear ward on the MT. It's worthy to note that his fear has limited range of about 35 yards, so ranged DPS and healers can completely avoid it by proper positioning.\nApproximately every 25\u201335 seconds he will \"call out\" a specific class. During class-call outs, that class will have some negative effect on them. Below is a list of each class and the effect their call-out has on them:\nPhase 3.\nWhen his health reaches 20% he will resurrect all the &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s killed in Phase 1 as \"&lt;a href=\"Bone%20Constructs\"&gt;Bone Constructs&lt;/a&gt;\". They hit fairly hard but do not have a lot of health, so they are relatively easily AoE'd to death. It is advisable to move AoE groups into position where the &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s were originally killed prior to reaching 20% HP to ensure their swift elimination, and to avoid healers getting swarmed. It is also advisable to wait for an appropriate call, where you don't lose any healing. Since the Bone Constructs are classified as &lt;a href=\"Undead\"&gt;Undead&lt;/a&gt; they are vulnerable to Paladins' &lt;a href=\"Holy%20Wrath\"&gt;Holy Wrath&lt;/a&gt;, which should be used in conjunction with other AoE sources. An effective technique for Paladins is: 1.) BoP a Mage 2.) Divine Shield 3.) Holy Wrath 4.) Use Stratholme water (if you brought some along). This would be an ideal time for the non-MT Warriors to pop &lt;a href=\"Shield%20Wall\"&gt;Shield Wall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Challenging%20Shout\"&gt;Challenging Shout&lt;/a&gt; in a staggered order to ensure adds do not attack healers (assuming these abilities are not on cooldown from Phase 1). Corrupted Shaman Totems from the Shaman class call will affect the adds; it is advisable to have those totems killed before the adds spawn. \nNote that if your computer isn't top of the line you will have extremely low FPS when the drakonids are resurrected, so make sure you turn your graphics down and do anything else you can to increase performance before the fight.\nAfter this he continues to cast his class debuffs up till he dies.\nNefarian encounter can be reattempted any number of times, however, it takes 15 minutes for him to reset after a wipe (as of patch 1.9.3). Prior to this patch, once the battle had progressed to Phase 2, and the remaining Drakonids had all been killed, the gates would never re-open. Therefore, a Soulstone or other wipe prevention must have been in place, or the battle could not be re-attempted until the instance had reset completely. Nefarian would still respawn after 15 minutes.\nAn alternate strategy for Phase 3 is to have all the AoE move towards the &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s have the entire raid (with the exception of the MT) move to one spot, the Heal Aggro alone will draw the &lt;a href=\"Drakonid\"&gt;Drakonid&lt;/a&gt;s where Mage AoE becomes much easier and much more effective.\nHigh level and solo strategy.\nStart the encounter then move to the door close to the throne. AoE all of the adds until 42 of them are killed, then finish off the stragglers. Let Nefarian land and blow him up. At 20%, he will resurrect the drakonids previously killed, so either pause DPS on the boss and clear the adds, or finish him off and then re-kill the adds, as they will not despawn on his death.\nHunter macro for ranged weapon unequip.\nThis macro was updated patch 3.2, you may use this to unequip then equip your weapon. When you see his call simply use it to remove the weapon and after the call comes then use it again to equip the weapon once again and continue to attack. Note: you need the first backpack (the original bag) slot empty for this to work!\nLoot.\nAs of &lt;a href=\"patch%203.2.2\"&gt;patch 3.2.2&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href=\"Tier%202\"&gt;Tier 2&lt;/a&gt; helms that dropped from have been moved to Nefarian's loot table.\nNefarian drops three tier pieces, two non-set epic items, and \"one\" , alongside other rare and uncommon-quality loot.\nVideo.\n&lt;vplayer/&gt;"}

They maintained a strong presence within the &lt;a href=\"Lost%20City%20of%20Tol%27vir\"&gt;Lost City of Tol'vir&lt;/a&gt;, their original main dwelling, as well as several more regions of &lt;a href=\"Uldum\"&gt;Uldum&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href=\"Skywall\"&gt;Skywall&lt;/a&gt;, until they were defeated by the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s and executed for their crimes by the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen%20%28faction%29\"&gt;Ramkahen tribe&lt;/a&gt;.\nHistory.\nDuring the Uldum questlines, &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;adventurer&lt;/a&gt;s encounter members of Neferset on numerous occasions, first time when they arrive along with &lt;a href=\"Adarrah\"&gt;Adarrah&lt;/a&gt; and her caravan through the &lt;a href=\"Gate%20of%20Unending%20Cycles\"&gt;Gate of Unending Cycles&lt;/a&gt; and are captured by a band of &lt;a href=\"Pygmy\"&gt;pygmies&lt;/a&gt; and are sold for three coconuts to the corrupted tol'vir (although they're surely worth five). Thanks to Addarah and &lt;a href=\"Budd\"&gt;Budd&lt;/a&gt;'s plan, however, they manage to free themselves and the &lt;a href=\"Ramkahen\"&gt;Ramkahen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Prince%20Nadun\"&gt;Prince Nadun&lt;/a&gt;.\nBefore the escape, it is revealed that &lt;a href=\"Siamat\"&gt;Siamat&lt;/a&gt;, Lord of the South Wind, was empowered by &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt; himself to bestow the gift of stone skin upon the tol'vir, removing the &lt;a href=\"Curse%20of%20Flesh\"&gt;Curse of Flesh&lt;/a&gt;. After becoming exhausted from converting the population of Neferset into their stoney bodies, the Neferset reneged on their end of of the deal and turned on Siamat, trapping him within the tower at the center of their lost city.\nThe Neferset's main bastion is &lt;a href=\"Neferset%20City\"&gt;Neferset City&lt;/a&gt;, located in the southern region of Uldum by the sea. However, after &lt;a href=\"The%20Fall%20of%20Neferset%20City\"&gt;The Fall of Neferset City&lt;/a&gt; and death of &lt;a href=\"Dark%20Pharaoh%20Tekahn\"&gt;Dark Pharaoh Tekahn&lt;/a&gt;, the Neferset forces are scattered and retreat into their last bastion and new seat of power - The Lost City of the Tol'vir where players first encountered them.\nMonths after the Cataclysm, the last five remaining members of the Neferset, including &lt;a href=\"Bathet\"&gt;Bathet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Menrim\"&gt;Menrim&lt;/a&gt;'s brother, and &lt;a href=\"Nanteret\"&gt;Nanteret&lt;/a&gt; were captured and put on trial. After none of them professed any regret for any of their crimes (in fact, quite the opposite), they were sentenced to death, and due to being stone tol'vir were executed by being crushed.\nThe Neferset's Lost City was taken over by the Ramkahen. Though the Neferset had been completely wiped out, when the forces of &lt;a href=\"N%27Zoth\"&gt;N'Zoth&lt;/a&gt; invaded Uldum they reanimated the slain Neferset with &lt;a href=\"void\"&gt;void&lt;/a&gt; energies.\nAccording to &lt;a href=\"Zekhan\"&gt;Zekhan&lt;/a&gt; after the &lt;a href=\"Fourth%20War\"&gt;Fourth War&lt;/a&gt;, they remain forever sick and hostile to all others for the bargain they made with Deathwing.\nOathsworn.\nThe Lost City of the Tol'vir is shared with Oathsworn tol'vir which are probably a subgroup of the Neferset tribe."}

As a huge portion of paladin aggro comes from spell damage the worst thing you could fight would be something highly resistant to holy damage, which this mob can potentially be. It is recommended to use a magical resistance aura/devotion aura and seal of the crusader until the mob absorbs a non-holy magic type, at which point you may judge/conscecrate/exorcise as much as you can before it changes its magic type again. Absorbing holy damage becomes further troublesome as it is the hardest of all types to resist when the mob starts using holy damage against you."}

From the &lt;a href=\"Darkspear%20Rebellion\"&gt;Darkspear Rebellion&lt;/a&gt; forward, it was Vol'jin's favored weapon.\nHistory.\nDuring Vol'jin's time recovering from &lt;a href=\"Garrosh%20Hellscream\"&gt;Garrosh Hellscream&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href=\"Dagger%20in%20the%20Dark\"&gt;assassination attempt&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan%20Monastery\"&gt;Shado-Pan Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"Chen%20Stormstout\"&gt;Chen Stormstout&lt;/a&gt; shared a test brew that left the drinker with a feeling of freedom, mainly linked with a past memory of the emotion. Vol'jin recalled the emotion as the peace one knows when crushing one's enemies, their dreams dying with them and leaving one's future clear like the morning after the rain, the crisp snapping of their bones, and their dying sighs of a quick death.\nSome time later, Vol'jin was sent a vision by the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; warning him of the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Invaders\"&gt;Zandalari Invaders&lt;/a&gt; that were sailing from the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; to attack &lt;a href=\"Zouchin%20Village\"&gt;Zouchin Village&lt;/a&gt; and secure a landing zone. During the preparations to blunt the invasion and evacuate the villagers, Chen had the &lt;a href=\"Shado-Pan\"&gt;Shado-Pan&lt;/a&gt; replace the weapon Vol'jin had lost, telling &lt;a href=\"Brother%20Xiao\"&gt;Brother Xiao&lt;/a&gt; to make the glaive Vol'jin had remembered from the brew. Chen directed their &lt;a href=\"swordsmith\"&gt;swordsmith&lt;/a&gt;s to knock the grips off two of their curved swords, then Xiao riveted the tangs together and wrapped them in &lt;a href=\"shark\"&gt;shark&lt;/a&gt;'s skin over &lt;a href=\"bamboo\"&gt;bamboo&lt;/a&gt;. After it was completed, Chen proudly presented it to Vol'jin after the troll had been outfitted with armor. When snapped still, the blades curiously quivered and hummed. Though it wasn't his glaive, the balance matched favorably, and he commented that Xiao had done well.\nVol'jin continued to wield this glaive for the rest of his life. Following the &lt;a href=\"Battle%20for%20the%20Broken%20Shore\"&gt;Battle for the Broken Shore&lt;/a&gt; and Vol'jin's death, Nekana was hung with his mask and other weapons in a place of honor on the wall within &lt;a href=\"Grommash%20Hold\"&gt;Grommash Hold&lt;/a&gt;.\nBattle for Azeroth.\nNekana would eventually be moved to a display on the &lt;a href=\"Echo%20Isles\"&gt;Echo Isles&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;a href=\"Zalazane\"&gt;Zalazane&lt;/a&gt; escaped &lt;a href=\"Bwonsamdi\"&gt;Bwonsamdi&lt;/a&gt;'s grasp, &lt;a href=\"Master%20Gadrin\"&gt;Master Gadrin&lt;/a&gt; requested that the &lt;a href=\"adventurer\"&gt;Horde Speaker&lt;/a&gt; retrieve the glaive in order to use it's power to end Zalazane. They were successful, Zalazane not believing that Vol'jin' could have such power.\n&lt;a href=\"Princess%20Talanji\"&gt;Princess Talanji&lt;/a&gt; then suggested that Vol'jin's remains (including his &lt;a href=\"Urn%20of%20Vol%27jin\"&gt;urn&lt;/a&gt; and glaive), be taken to &lt;a href=\"Atal%27Dazar\"&gt;Atal'Dazar&lt;/a&gt; to rest alongside the other great &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt; leaders of the past. After discovering that his spirit no longer rested in the urn, Gadrin led a seance to contact the former warchief. Vol'jin's spirit responded, claiming that the &lt;a href=\"Shadowlands\"&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/a&gt; were in turmoil due to &lt;a href=\"G%27huun\"&gt;G'huun&lt;/a&gt; and instructed the adventurer to use Nekana to finish off the &lt;a href=\"old%20god\"&gt;old god&lt;/a&gt; once and for all. Afterwards, Vol'jin's spirit, the adventurer, and Talanji proudly displayed the bloodied glaived for all of &lt;a href=\"Zuldazar\"&gt;Zuldazar&lt;/a&gt; to see, using it as proof of both Talanji's ability to lead the Zandalari to victory and how much the Horde had aided the &lt;a href=\"Zandalari%20Empire\"&gt;Zandalari Empire&lt;/a&gt;. Nekana was then put on a plaque and displayed near the shrines of the &lt;a href=\"loa\"&gt;loa&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=\"Dazar%27alor%20%28pyramid%29\"&gt;Dazar'alor&lt;/a&gt;."}

After the &lt;a href=\"Dragonmaw%20clan\"&gt;Dragonmaw clan&lt;/a&gt; joined the nascent &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Horde&lt;/a&gt;, Nekros became a &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt; instead, but never joined with the &lt;a href=\"Shadow%20Council\"&gt;Shadow Council&lt;/a&gt; when faced between being loyal to &lt;a href=\"Gul%27dan\"&gt;Gul'dan&lt;/a&gt; or his clan. Nekros never cared for his dark, magical calling. He fled from the warlock ranks, returning to his &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt; ways. But his duty to his clan, and himself, demanded that he saddle his burden, especially after a &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt; deprived him of half a leg. Now having a peg leg, he was barely able to move around his base. His weapon was known as the &lt;a href=\"Scepter%20of%20Nekros%20Skullcrusher\"&gt;Scepter of Nekros Skullcrusher&lt;/a&gt;.\nNekros was commissioned by Zuluhed to hold the Demon Soul, which he would use to capture and contain the mighty dragonqueen. They did just that, and Nekros became her warden in &lt;a href=\"Grim%20Batol\"&gt;Grim Batol&lt;/a&gt;, using the Demon Soul to inflict unimaginable pain on her whenever she did not cooperate. When she tried to starve herself, he shattered an egg before her which forced her to return to cooperation with the orc.\nNekros continually abused her, both mentally and physically, especially after the &lt;a href=\"Second%20War\"&gt;Second War&lt;/a&gt;, when she became the only real weapon the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; had against the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Tyranastrasz\"&gt;Tyranastrasz&lt;/a&gt;, whom Nekros thought to have been her last living consort, was also being held captive with her, but was slowly dying after he contracted a fatal ailment while imprisoned by the Orcs.

The ogres eagerly and carelessly dissected the Throne with their arcane spellwork, until the dissonance between their magic and the &lt;a href=\"Grond\"&gt;lingering residual energies&lt;/a&gt; of the Throne caused an explosion that blew apart the orcish temple at the site and threw the elements out of balance all across Draenor. Huge storms lashed across the world, and Draenor's native spirits descended into turmoil. However, the Gorian sorcerer king, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt;, was not deterred in the slightest and simply sent more sorcerers to replace the ones that had been killed, for he now had proof of the elements' true power and was determined to claim it for himself.\nThe next year's orcish &lt;a href=\"Kosh%27harg\"&gt;Kosh'harg&lt;/a&gt; festival was marked by mourning for the incident at the Throne. The Shadowmoon elder shaman, Nelgarm, pleaded for action, lest all of the clans suffer disastrous famines as a result of the elements' imbalance. The clans agreed to join together, and Nelgarm called upon the elements to bless them with their protection. The united orc army first fell upon the Throne of the Elements. Surprised by the attack, the Gorian sorcerers retreated with little bloodshed, but Imperator Molok was quick to retaliate. The Gorian armies moved en masse, and total war engulfed Draenor, and now every orcish male, female and child had to be prepared to fight. The ogres imagined that this merciless tactic would strike terror into the hearts of the orcs, but the clans rose to the challenge and small, mobile groups of raiders slowly dismantled the Gorian Empire's network of fortresses and outposts, pushing the ogre armies back to their capital: &lt;a href=\"Goria\"&gt;Goria&lt;/a&gt;.\nSeveral months into the siege of the ogre city, an affliction called the &lt;a href=\"red%20pox\"&gt;red pox&lt;/a&gt; began to spread among the orcs, culling vast amounts of the orcish combatants. After consulting the elements, Nelgarm and his fellow shaman realized that the pox was an unseen attack from the ogres. The clan chieftains realized that the siege was now doomed to fail; too many orcs would die before Goria succumbed, and a frontal assault against the city was no longer possible. Nelgarm and the other shaman decided to take a very dangerous step to secure victory: they beseeched the elements to destroy Goria. Never before had shaman made such a violent request, but the orcs and the elemental spirits both understood that the ogres and their leader, &lt;a href=\"Imperator%20Molok\"&gt;Imperator Molok&lt;/a&gt;, would resume meddling with the &lt;a href=\"Throne%20of%20the%20Elements\"&gt;Throne of the Elements&lt;/a&gt; if the orcs failed. Thus, the elements agreed to unleash their fury upon Goria.\nThe shaman gathered outside the ogre city's mighty walls and witnessed the fury of the spirits. Over hours, lightning, fire and earthquakes ravaged the ogre capital until nothing but ash and rubble remained, before the earth itself wrenched open like a giant maw to swallow Molok and the remains of his great city whole. Untold thousands of ogres died that day; none were left alive by the elementals.\nThe orcs were victorious, but they had suffered massive losses and witnessed a destructive power they never wanted to see again. Nelgarm and the other shaman were particularly frightened by the elementals' wrath and said that the need for a unified orc army had passed. There was little argument, and the orc clans returned to their lands."}

It was here where Neltharion lived before he became &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Deathwing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Adventurer\"&gt;Class leaders&lt;/a&gt; ventured inside to recover the &lt;a href=\"Hammer%20of%20Khaz%27goroth\"&gt;Hammer of Khaz'goroth&lt;/a&gt; stolen by &lt;a href=\"Dargrul%20the%20Underking\"&gt;Dargrul the Underking&lt;/a&gt;. The entrance is at &lt;a href=\"Snowblind%20Mesa\"&gt;Snowblind Mesa&lt;/a&gt; - a short walk East up the hill from the cliffs behind &lt;a href=\"Thunder%20Totem\"&gt;Thunder Totem&lt;/a&gt;. The dragon-sized entrance is &lt;a href=\"Neltharion%27s%20Vault\"&gt;Neltharion's Vault&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe exit (up a path to the right of the last boss, Dargul, marked by torches) takes you to &lt;a href=\"Bartering%20Cave\"&gt;The Bartering Cave&lt;/a&gt; behind &lt;a href=\"Spiritwatch%20Point\"&gt;Spiritwatch Point&lt;/a&gt;. A fake portal that Dargrul destroys can be found at &lt;a href=\"Understone%20Breach\"&gt;Understone Breach&lt;/a&gt;.

An evil older than dragons was deemed to have resided here once, and an empowered black dragon was also here before the great dragon &lt;a href=\"Deathwing\"&gt;Neltharion&lt;/a&gt; eventually settled in it and gave it its name.\nAt some point, the &lt;a href=\"vrykul\"&gt;vrykul&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Magnar%20Icebreaker\"&gt;Magnar Icebreaker&lt;/a&gt; convinced a raiding party of fellow warriors to accompany him into the lair. They waited until they saw the Dragon Aspect leave his mountain, and then they went inside. They were attacked by the lair's defenders, and none but Magnar himself survived, the vrykul also managing to get away with &lt;a href=\"Scale%20of%20the%20Earth-Warder\"&gt;one of Neltharion's scales&lt;/a&gt;.\nAfter the start of the &lt;a href=\"War%20of%20the%20Ancients\"&gt;War of the Ancients&lt;/a&gt;, Neltharion tortured a captured &lt;a href=\"eredar%20warlock\"&gt;eredar warlock&lt;/a&gt; there. The great wyrm notably tested the effects of the &lt;a href=\"Demon%20Soul\"&gt;Dragon Soul&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href=\"demon\"&gt;demon&lt;/a&gt;, inflicting him great pain before killing him. &lt;a href=\"Malfurion%20Stormrage\"&gt;Malfurion Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; later drifted through the &lt;a href=\"Emerald%20Dream\"&gt;Emerald Dream&lt;/a&gt; in order to infiltrate the black wyrm's lair, wishing to discover how to steal the Dragon Soul. There, the druid discovered that the lair's caverns had been partially converted into a giant &lt;a href=\"Blacksmith%20%28building%29\"&gt;smithy&lt;/a&gt;, with many &lt;a href=\"goblin\"&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt;s working under the watchful eye of &lt;a href=\"Meklo\"&gt;Meklo&lt;/a&gt; in order to forge Neltharion's &lt;a href=\"adamantine\"&gt;adamantine&lt;/a&gt; plates. Several adamantine &lt;a href=\"Gold%20mine\"&gt;mines&lt;/a&gt; could actually be found around the mountain, and goblins mined it for their nefarious purposes. The lair had secret accesses for the goblins to bring the raw materials in, and was also defended by gray-skinned &lt;a href=\"troll\"&gt;troll&lt;/a&gt;s magically kept under Neltharion's sway.\n&lt;a href=\"Illidan%20Stormrage\"&gt;Illidan Stormrage&lt;/a&gt; later managed to use one of the black wyrm's discarded scales to find the lair.\nAt some point, Deathwing slew many of his kin there in his fury, leaving their bones to decay.\nAdventure Guide.\n\"The Earth Warder Neltharion, later known as Deathwing, once called this cavern home. Since his fall, the &lt;a href=\"drogbar\"&gt;drogbar&lt;/a&gt; that once worshipped the great &lt;a href=\"dragon\"&gt;dragon&lt;/a&gt; built their capital within this ancient lair.

Because of &lt;a href=\"%3AAzerite\"&gt;:Azerite&lt;/a&gt; eruption, the lingering power of the &lt;a href=\"black%20dragonflight\"&gt;black dragonflight&lt;/a&gt; awoke many &lt;a href=\"earth%20elemental\"&gt;earth elemental&lt;/a&gt;s who started fighting anything they could see, killing several &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20tribe\"&gt;Stonedark&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=\"Stonedark%20Protector\"&gt;watchers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=\"Ma%27haat%20the%20Indomitable\"&gt;Ma'haat the Indomitable&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href=\"stone%20lord\"&gt;stone lord&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=\"Deepholm\"&gt;Deepholm&lt;/a&gt;, was here to retrieve the dragonflight's essence.\nBeta.\n\"Neltharion, better known as Deathwing, once called these caves home.

The Troopers along with Demetria will attack all &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"hostile\"&gt;hostile&lt;/a&gt; enemies they encounter, including &lt;a href=\"player%20character\"&gt;player character&lt;/a&gt;s.\nAbilities.\nFor information on strategy, see Demetria's article.\nAdditional Info.\nIt is very possible that while encountering Demetria you will also encounter the &lt;a href=\"Crimson%20Courier\"&gt;Crimson Courier&lt;/a&gt;, who has her own entourage of elite warriors who frequently Intercept. There is no scripted event between the two, but the two will help each other. If the Courier and her entourage are added to the fight, it may cause a wipe.\nShe and her guards will attack Scourge they come across, especially when travelling through &lt;a href=\"Corin%27s%20Crossing\"&gt;Corin's Crossing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Plaguewood\"&gt;Plaguewood&lt;/a&gt;. It is possible, if she and her platoon are engaged in multiple mobs, too pull her away, and whittler her down while her guards deal with the Scourge. Note, that once the guards take out the undead, they'll be on you within seconds, so kill Demetria quick. Even if she is dead, the guards will still probably engage you, but will be much easier to deal with now that Demtria is no longer around to &lt;a href=\"rez\"&gt;rez&lt;/a&gt; them."}

Scarlet battle magi are some of the deadliest members of the Scarlet Crusade; their knowledge of arcane magic is tempered with zeal and training in martial arms. In combat, powerful battle magi might charge into a unit of &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt; creatures and lay it to waste with incendiary magic, and then obliterate any survivors with ordinary or enchanted steel. Battle magi are among the rarest of their order and are highly respected. The overwhelming majority of battle magi are trained in &lt;a href=\"Tyr%27s%20Hand\"&gt;Tyr's Hand&lt;/a&gt; and the newly founded &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;, and then sent to the locations where they are most needed. While the Scarlet Crusade opposes both the &lt;a href=\"Forsaken\"&gt;Forsaken&lt;/a&gt; and the Scourge, battle magi are typically assigned to deal with the latter, since the Scourge is considered more dangerous. Since normal spells and swords are typically ineffective against the stronger members of the Scourge, Scarlet battle magi focus their studies on fire magic. While most of their spells are designed to destroy large groups of weak monsters, battle magi also learn to empower their weapons, knowing that situations arise where ranged magic might fail. Overall, Scarlet battle magi are versatile, and that quality makes them feared by their enemies \u2014 and the rest of the world.\nLike all members of the Scarlet Crusade, Scarlet battle magi are &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;s. Most began their careers as &lt;a href=\"magi\"&gt;magi&lt;/a&gt;. As members of the Scarlet Crusade, and typically among the most zealous members of the organization, battle magi are unpopular among the educated members of the &lt;a href=\"Alliance\"&gt;Alliance&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href=\"battle%20mage\"&gt;battle mage&lt;/a&gt; who flaunts her title is likely to be considered insane and turned away by any adventuring party; many battle magi know this well enough conceal their identities. Some battle magi despise or disdain the rest of the world and travel only with other members of their organization. When a battle mage participates in an adventuring group, she often takes a leadership or front line role, in spite of the tendency of most spellcasters to do the opposite. Battle magi have a reputation for fearlessly charging into battle \u2014 a reputation that is not always remembered in a positive light. Battle magi deal with their targets quickly, using instantaneous spells to eliminate weak opponents immediately. Their spells and reflexes are impressive, which may ensure the battle mage\u2019s stay within an adventuring group, even if she is not entirely trusted.\nIn World of Warcraft.\ns can be found in &lt;a href=\"Stratholme\"&gt;Stratholme&lt;/a&gt;."}
{"id": "69502", "revid": "40389549", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=69502", "title": "Scarlet crusader", "text": "As they wander the blasted wastes, the undead creatures who call the &lt;a href=\"Plaguelands\"&gt;Plaguelands&lt;/a&gt; home have learned to scan the horizon continually for the crimson garb of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt;. Scarlet Crusaders come from many vocations \u2014 &lt;a href=\"warrior\"&gt;warrior&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"wizard\"&gt;wizard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=\"scout\"&gt;scout&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 but all have one obsession: the complete and utter destruction of the plagueborn creatures who have conquered and occupied their ancestral homelands. Whether a red robe, a red tabard or red lacquered armor, a Scarlet Crusader wears the bright color as a brazen declaration that the red blood of the living still flows in her veins and a beacon calling her undead foes to battles. Though often seen traveling in squads, even a lone Crusader will charge into battle with a zealous rage to destroy both the &lt;a href=\"undead\"&gt;undead&lt;/a&gt; and any she fears may be \"plagued\". The truly unlucky are those captured alive by a Scarlet Crusader and taken back to one of the Crusade's hidden encampments, where the Crusaders eagerly interrogate and torture prisoners for any information that will help the Crusade achieve its goals. Crusaders are predominately &lt;a href=\"human\"&gt;human&lt;/a&gt;, with only the occasional &lt;a href=\"dwarf\"&gt;dwarf&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=\"high%20elf\"&gt;high elf&lt;/a&gt; \u2014 they hate other races and blame them for everything bad as well.\nWaging guerrilla warfare in the Plaguelands, a Scarlet Crusader masters the subtle art of finding her undead quarry. A Scarlet Crusader gets a great deal of quick experience tracking and killing her chosen enemies, the Undead. A scarlet crusader can focus his senses through the lens of his zealotry and gain the uncanny ability to detect nearby undead. As he hones his abilities, a Scarlet Crusader can soon sense the presence of undead enemies with little work.\nMidnight rituals of the Scarlet Crusade imbue its devotees with the ability to \"infect\" the undead with the spark of life \u2014 and in doing so, make them vulnerable as normal mortals. Just as the Scarlet Crusade trains its members to manipulate their life force, it also trains them to protect it. As a Crusader becomes more powerful they can use their life force to incinerate any who stand in their way.\nAll inductees into the Scarlet Crusade receive a crimson ring that reminds them not only of their devotion to the cause, but also of their ability to create a crimson circle that will prevent undead creatures from crossing its boundaries. Clever members of the Crusade have learned to use this ability to imprison the undead, either for questioning or slaughter. Once a Scarlet Crusader has proven his or her devotion to the Crusade, they are introduced to the dark art of interrogation. A Scarlet Crusader who has mastered the art of interrogation can inflict such pain that a creature cannot help but reveal all the Crusader wishes to know."}

These former &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s and &lt;a href=\"healer\"&gt;healer&lt;/a&gt;s, once dedicated to aiding the wounded, have turned their training in the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Holy Light&lt;/a&gt; to a more devious end \u2014 torturing a captured subject without allowing the prisoner the luxury of death. For this reason, inquisitors are given high authority within their own organization \u2014 and are feared by their own people as much as their enemies. In spite of their title, inquisitors do not always torture simply to extract information \u2014 many enjoy inflicting pain, and that quality makes them dangerous in combat.\n&lt;a href=\"Grand%20Inquisitor%20Isillien\"&gt;Grand Inquisitor Isillien&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most influential figures in the Scarlet Crusade, and rumors say he handpicks the few others who are deemed worthy to bear the mantle of inquisitor. High-ranking inquisitors train pupils in the subtle art of manipulation as well as the destructive and fearsome arts for which the inquisitors are famous. It is the duty of the inquisitor to transform a broken &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knight of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; into a loyal zealot of the Scarlet Crusade, such as &lt;a href=\"Highlord%20Taelan%20Fordring\"&gt;Highlord Taelan Fordring&lt;/a&gt;. Inquisitors are also responsible for detecting treachery in their own ranks; inquistors are affiliated with the Scarlet Crusade (at least initially; defectors are possible). Hardly a day passes that the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusader\"&gt;Crusaders&lt;/a&gt; do not find an &lt;a href=\"infiltrator\"&gt;infiltrator&lt;/a&gt; loyal to the &lt;a href=\"Cult%20of%20the%20Damned\"&gt;Cult of the Damned&lt;/a&gt;. \nWith the skill to judge a potential traitor comes the power of the executioner; inquisitors have the right and the responsibility to deal with traitors. Betrayal is not limited to siding with the &lt;a href=\"Scourge\"&gt;Scourge&lt;/a&gt;, of course; disagreeing with &lt;a href=\"Saidan%20Dathrohan\"&gt;Grand Crusader Saidan Dathrohan&lt;/a&gt; might be grounds for elimination as well. The final responsibility of the inquisitor is morale \u2014 in many ways, inquisitors retain the role of normal priests, and they ensure the soldiers in their care remain in good spirits. In spite of the fear that even other members of the Scarlet Crusade feel toward inquisitors, they retain the role of &lt;a href=\"confessor\"&gt;confessor&lt;/a&gt;, moral support, and other responsibilities that one might expect from a priest of the &lt;a href=\"Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Light\"&gt;Church of the Holy Light&lt;/a&gt;.\nScarlet inquisitors are almost exclusively human priests, but a few &lt;a href=\"paladin\"&gt;paladin&lt;/a&gt;s have the dedication and magical skill to follow this path. As high-ranking members of the Scarlet Crusade, individuals outside the organization look down on them even more than other Crusaders, and with justification. Even inquisitors who are still sane have a level of zeal that the average person or adventuring party cannot tolerate. The Church of the Holy Light takes a stand against the inquisitors' torture and other methods, but the crusaders dismiss such accusations as na\u00efve. The &lt;a href=\"knight\"&gt;knight&lt;/a&gt;s and priests of &lt;a href=\"Stormwind\"&gt;Stormwind&lt;/a&gt; have not yet experienced the full force of the Scourge, and the Crusade believes that this lack of knowledge prevents them from being willing to use the necessary amount of force. The Scarlet Crusade's loyal knights and priests are convinced (by their inquisitors) that the church will eventually see their way of life as necessary. Inquisitors see themselves as the voices of reason in a world clouded with deception; they burn through the lies of the world with the searing flame of truth. Most inquisitors are self-confident, and a large number of them take leadership roles, such as &lt;a href=\"Sally%20Whitemane\"&gt;High Inquisitor Sally Whitemane&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Monastery\"&gt;Scarlet Monastery&lt;/a&gt;. On the rare occasions that an inquisitor leaves an outpost to go adventuring, he functions much the same as he does within the organization: as a leader and support for his group. Unlike many other members of the Scarlet Crusade, however, inquisitors are cautious in combat and remain as far from melee as possible, using their magic to disorient their enemies or bless their allies with the power of the Holy Light. While inquisitors are potent healers, this role is typically considered secondary to eliminating their targets or enhancing their allies\u2019 abilities."}

The Scarlet Crusade has a couple of ex-paladins dedicated to training new &lt;a href=\"paladins\"&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt; that join the organization. Paladins seem drawn to the organization, but few can balance their commitment to the Light with the dark deeds done by the Scarlet Crusade, so few keep their holy status. Most abandon the teachings of the &lt;a href=\"Light\"&gt;Light&lt;/a&gt; and find their abilities changing to suit their new mindsets. A broken &lt;a href=\"Knights%20of%20the%20Silver%20Hand\"&gt;Knight of the Silver Hand&lt;/a&gt; is transformed into a loyal zealot of the &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20Crusade\"&gt;Scarlet Crusade&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=\"Scarlet%20inquisitor\"&gt;Scarlet inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;s.

The common folk are terrified of the Crusade, and few oppose the scarlet knights out of fear for their lives. Scarlet knights work with the Scarlet Crusade &lt;a href=\"priest\"&gt;priest&lt;/a&gt;s, who rebuke undead, forcing the undead foes to cower long enough for the mounted knights to do their work. They also run down fleeing enemies.\nThe shields of the former knights of the Holy Light once glowed white.

They are the gatekeepers to the inner sanctum of Lower Blackrock Spire.\nHistory.\nThe defining characteristic of this organization of &lt;a href=\"orc\"&gt;orc&lt;/a&gt;s is their use of worgs in battle, evident by their swarming numbers within the halls of &lt;a href=\"Hordemar\"&gt;Hordemar&lt;/a&gt;. \nUnlike the normal &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s, however, the Scarshield Legion has been seen fighting alongside the worgs, as opposed to on the backs of them. The reasons for this are unknown, but it is likely due to the close quarters of the Legion's current residence, making most of the members' destinations within the City reachable by foot. Given the need, however, it is likely that the Scarshield's worgs double as &lt;a href=\"mounts\"&gt;mounts&lt;/a&gt;.\nWorg breeding.\nThe vast population of worgs within lower Blackrock Spire is easily achieved by the Legion's role to breeding the beasts, as well as train them. Despite the common rumors and belief that the Legion's vicious canines are the product of something otherworldly, their conceiver is not far off. The Legion currently cares for and provides home for the giant &lt;a href=\"Halycon\"&gt;Halycon&lt;/a&gt; and her equally large mate &lt;a href=\"Gizrul%20the%20Slavener\"&gt;Gizrul the Slavener&lt;/a&gt;, the parents of nearly all battle-ready Scarshield and &lt;a href=\"Bloodaxe%20Legion\"&gt;Bloodaxe&lt;/a&gt; worgs. Both are kept in lower Blackrock spire where they are tended to and heavily guarded, despite their capability to hold their own.\nSpeculation.\nIt is possible that when Rend and &lt;a href=\"Maim%20Blackhand\"&gt;Maim Blackhand&lt;/a&gt; fled to &lt;a href=\"Blackrock%20Mountain\"&gt;Blackrock Mountain&lt;/a&gt; they brought with them other surviving members of the &lt;a href=\"raider\"&gt;raider&lt;/a&gt;s of the &lt;a href=\"First%20War\"&gt;First War&lt;/a&gt; with whom they forged the Scarshield Legion.\nAlternatively, the Scarshield Legion may have existed as a raider group in the &lt;a href=\"Old%20Horde\"&gt;Old Horde&lt;/a&gt; during the First War.

When the time to retire from his century of guardianship came, he discovered that there were no suitable replacements to take his place. As such he reluctantly agreed to remain as Guardian. Over Scavell's long guardianship he and the council would keep a strong relationship as they continued to protect the world from the &lt;a href=\"Burning%20Legion\"&gt;Legion&lt;/a&gt;. In particular he would consider &lt;a href=\"Erbag\"&gt;Erbag&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"Relfthra\"&gt;Relfthra&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=\"Gnome\"&gt;gnomish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=\"High%20elf\"&gt;high elven&lt;/a&gt; representatives to the council, among his closest friends.\nWhen &lt;a href=\"Sargeras\"&gt;Sargeras&lt;/a&gt; found that one of his servants, &lt;a href=\"Sataiel\"&gt;Sataiel&lt;/a&gt;, was planning to betray him, he sent several visions to Scavell that depicted a dangerous demon lurking in &lt;a href=\"Deadwind%20Pass\"&gt;Deadwind Pass&lt;/a&gt; and awaiting the return of the Burning Legion. Scavell hunted Sataiel down and, after an epic battle, slew her with her own scythe, &lt;a href=\"Ulthalesh%2C%20the%20Deadwind%20Harvester\"&gt;Ulthalesh&lt;/a&gt;, and sent her soul screaming into the weapon. When Scavell examined the blade, he was filled with dread and wondered if the real threat remained unchecked. He decided to hide Ulthalesh where no one would find it.\nSome eight hundred years ago, Scavell decided that he'd had enough of the Guardianship, and sought out likely successors. Over the next few years, he gathered five powerful apprentices:\nOf the five, &lt;a href=\"Aegwynn\"&gt;Aegwynn&lt;/a&gt; showed the greatest overall aptitude, and was invested with the power of the \"Tirisfalen\" halfway through her apprenticeship. Scavell survived the transference ritual by only a year, dying peacefully in his sleep. His other four apprentices joined the Order, and eventually died battling demons.\nShortly after Aegwynn's four hundredth birthday, she named her pet &lt;a href=\"Scavell%20%28thunder%20lizard%29\"&gt;thunder lizard&lt;/a&gt; after her long-gone master."}

{"id": "327661", "revid": "49723770", "url": "https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki?curid=327661", "title": "Scenario", "text": "Scenarios, introduced in \"&lt;a href=\"Mists%20of%20Pandaria\"&gt;Mists of Pandaria&lt;/a&gt;\", are short, 3-player &lt;a href=\"instance\"&gt;instance&lt;/a&gt;s, with progressive objectives and a story arc. Scenarios are completely role-less, meaning tanks or healers aren't necessary to succeed - any class combination can work. Smaller scenarios play similar to group quests and help players earn faction reputation, while larger scenarios play out like epic PvE battlegrounds with major objectives and plenty of scripted events. They are instanced areas.\nScenarios are available at level 90. Most scenarios have a minimum average &lt;a href=\"item%20level\"&gt;item level&lt;/a&gt; of 425 in order to queue for them. The four scenarios added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.3.0\"&gt;Patch 5.3.0&lt;/a&gt; have an average minimum item level requirement of 496. &lt;a href=\"Heroic%20mode\"&gt;Heroic mode&lt;/a&gt; versions of scenarios do not have an item level requirement.\nFrom ' onwards, there are no new endgame scenarios, and thus, no scenario rewards. Instead, some quests use scenario mechanics, which are seamlessly integrated into the main world using &lt;a href=\"phasing\"&gt;phasing&lt;/a&gt;, rather than being their own instances. In ', the &lt;a href=\"Deaths%20of%20Chromie\"&gt;Deaths of Chromie&lt;/a&gt; was added.\nQueuing up.\nThrough the group finder.\nQueuing for scenarios works identically to queuing for a dungeon, and is accomplished via the Scenarios pane of the &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt; interface (default hotkey: ). Players can choose a specific scenario, or opt for a random scenario. Completing a random scenario will reward the player with roughly and a &lt;a href=\"Greater%20Cache%20of%20Treasures\"&gt;Greater Cache of Treasures&lt;/a&gt; that may contain either additional gold or a randomly enchanted piece of level 90 equipment tailored to their class (though not necessarily their spec).\nThe scenarios group finder is not available for players level 91+.\nThrough NPCs.\nStarting from level 91 you can't use the &lt;a href=\"Group%20Finder\"&gt;Group Finder&lt;/a&gt; interface for scenarios anymore. At the &lt;a href=\"Seat%20of%20Knowledge\"&gt;Seat of Knowledge&lt;/a&gt; you can still talk to &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Fu\"&gt;Lorewalker Fu&lt;/a&gt; to queue for Normal scenarios, &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Shin\"&gt;Lorewalker Shin&lt;/a&gt; for Heroic scenarios and &lt;a href=\"Lorewalker%20Han\"&gt;Lorewalker Han&lt;/a&gt; for old LFR raids.\nScenarios.\nSingle-player scenarios.\nStarting from a very rare drop, &lt;a href=\"warlock\"&gt;warlock&lt;/a&gt;s can undertake a very difficult solo-scenario to turn their fire green in &lt;a href=\"Pursuing%20the%20Black%20Harvest\"&gt;Pursuing the Black Harvest&lt;/a&gt;.\nThere are a handful of scenarios on the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder\"&gt;Isle of Thunder&lt;/a&gt; that are designed for a single player. None of these single-player scenarios may be queued for the normal way by using the scenario-finder interface. Instead, the quest giver will provide a gossip option to queue for and start the scenario. All but one of these scenarios can only be completed once per player during the &lt;a href=\"Isle%20of%20Thunder%20storyline\"&gt;Isle of Thunder storyline&lt;/a&gt;. As such, the documentation and walk-throughs for these scenarios are provided in the quests where the scenarios take place:\nThe one repeatable single-player scenario is &lt;a href=\"Troves%20of%20the%20Thunder%20King\"&gt;Troves of the Thunder King&lt;/a&gt;, the loot-grabbing scenario that requires a &lt;a href=\"Key%20to%20the%20Palace%20of%20Lei%20Shen\"&gt;Key to the Palace of Lei Shen&lt;/a&gt; to begin.\nAdditionally, as part of &lt;a href=\"Wrathion\"&gt;Wrathion&lt;/a&gt;'s legendary quest, he starts the solo scenario &lt;a href=\"The%20Thunder%20Forge%20%28quest%29\"&gt;The Thunder Forge (quest)&lt;/a&gt;.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Proving%20Grounds\"&gt;Proving Grounds&lt;/a&gt;, added in &lt;a href=\"Patch%205.4.0\"&gt;Patch 5.4.0&lt;/a&gt;, uses the scenario mechanic. There is also one repeatable scenario as part of the &lt;a href=\"Timeless%20Isle\"&gt;Timeless Isle&lt;/a&gt; cooking chain. The quest &lt;a href=\"The%20Secret%20Ingredient%20Is...\"&gt;The Secret Ingredient Is...&lt;/a&gt; is the walk-through and completion of this opens the dailies &lt;a href=\"Noodle%20Time\"&gt;Noodle Time&lt;/a&gt; and .\nPet battle scenarios.\nThe &lt;a href=\"Celestial%20Tournament\"&gt;Celestial Tournament&lt;/a&gt; takes place in a single-player &lt;a href=\"pet%20battle\"&gt;pet battle&lt;/a&gt; scenario, where players face a series of pet tamers and battle pets. This scenario is repeatable.\nNot-yet-released scenarios.\nThese scenarios were planned, and appear in the game files, but have not been released. "}
